Noteholders should also consider the tax consequences of the Exchange Offer\n(including disposition of the Old\nNotes and investment in the New Notes). See \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences\u201d in this\nprospectus.\n\nTendering your Old Notes in exchange for\nthe New Notes offered under this prospectus involves significant risks. You should reach your own investment\ndecision about the New Notes\nonly after consultation with your own financial, legal and tax advisers (as you deem appropriate) about\nrisks associated with participating\nin the Exchange Offer and with an investment in the New Notes and the suitability of participating in the\nExchange Offer and investing\nin the New Notes in light of the particular characteristics and terms of the New Notes, which are complex in\nstructure and operation,\nand of your particular financial circumstances.\n\nRisks Relating to the Exchange Offer\n\nWe have not obtained a third-party determination\nthat the Exchange Offer is fair to Noteholders.\n\nNone of us, JPMorgan Chase & Co., the Trustee,\nthe Dealer Manager or the Exchange Agent makes any recommendation as to whether you should exchange your Old\nNotes in the Exchange Offer.\nWe have not retained, and do not intend to retain, any unaffiliated representative to act on behalf of\nNoteholders for purposes of negotiating\nthe terms of the Exchange Offer, preparing a report concerning the fairness of the Exchange Offer to you or\nto us or determining that\nthe total consideration offered in the Exchange Offer represents a fair valuation of either the Old Notes or\nthe New Notes. If you tender\nyour Old Notes, you may ultimately receive less value than if you choose to keep them. The value of the New\nNotes to be issued in the\nExchange Offer may not equal or exceed the value of the Old Notes tendered. You must make your own\nindependent decision regarding your\nparticipation in the Exchange Offer.\n\nThe trading market for the Old Notes that remain\noutstanding following the completion of the Exchange Offer may be significantly limited.\n\nTo the extent tenders of Old Notes in the Exchange\nOffer are accepted for exchange by us and the Exchange Offer is completed, the trading market for the Old\nNotes that remain outstanding\nfollowing the completion of the Exchange Offer may be significantly limited.\n\nIf a significant portion of the remaining Old Notes\nare exchanged pursuant to the Exchange Offer, it would have a negative impact on the liquidity of the\noutstanding Old Notes. Any remaining\nOld Notes may command a lower price than a comparable issue of securities with greater market liquidity. A\nreduced market value and liquidity\nmay also make the trading price of such remaining Old Notes more volatile. Accordingly, the market price for\nsuch Old Notes that remain\noutstanding after the completion of the Exchange Offer may be adversely affected as a result of the Exchange\nOffer and there can be no\nassurance that an active trading market will exist for the Old Notes following the Exchange Offer. None of\nus, JPMorgan Chase & Co.,\nthe Trustee, the Dealer Manager or the Exchange Agent has any duty to make a market in any such remaining\nOld Notes. It will not be possible\nto ascertain the aggregate principal amount of the Old Notes to be accepted for exchange prior to the\nExpiration Deadline.\n\nThe Exchange Offer may be extended, withdrawn,\nterminated or amended at any time, subject to applicable law.\n\nUntil we announce whether we have decided to accept\nvalid tenders of Old Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offer, no assurance can be given that the Exchange Offer\nwill be completed. This may\ndepend upon the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions of the Exchange Offer. In addition, subject to\napplicable law and as provided\nin this prospectus, we may, in our sole and absolute discretion, extend, withdraw, terminate or amend the\nExchange Offer or amend or waive\nany of the terms and conditions of the\n                                                     20                                                     \nExchange Offer at any time before such announcement\nand may, in our sole and absolute discretion, waive any of the conditions of the Exchange Offer either\nbefore or after such announcement.\nIn addition, we reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to extend, withdraw, terminate or\namend the Exchange Offer at\nany time and for any reason. For details, see \u201cThe Exchange Offer \u2014 Extension, Withdrawal, Termination and\nAmendment.\u201d\n\nThe consummation of the Exchange Offer may not\noccur or may be delayed. Failure to complete the Exchange Offer could negatively affect the price of the Old\nNotes.\n\nWe are not obligated to complete the Exchange Offer.\nEven if the Exchange Offer is completed, it may not be completed on the schedule described in this\nprospectus or any subsequent notices\nof extension. Accordingly, Noteholders participating in the Exchange Offer may have to wait longer than\nexpected to receive their New\nNotes, during which time those Noteholders will not be able to effect transfers of their Old Notes tendered\nin the Exchange Offer or participate\nin any other repurchase, repayment or redemption with respect to such Old Notes. In addition, if the\nExchange Offer is not completed or\nis delayed, the market price of the Old Notes may decline to the extent that the current market price of the\nOld Notes reflects a market\nassumption that the Exchange Offer will be completed.\n\nWe may not accept all Old Notes tendered in the\nExchange Offer.\n\nWe are not under any obligation to accept for exchange\nany Old Notes tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer and will not be liable to any person for the failure\nto accept any tender of Old\nNotes for exchange pursuant to the Exchange Offer. Tenders of Old Notes may be rejected in our sole and\nabsolute discretion for any reason\nand we are not under any obligation to Noteholders to furnish any reason or justification for refusing to\naccept for exchange a tender\nof Old Notes. For example, tenders of Old Notes may be rejected if the Exchange Offer is withdrawn or\nterminated, if the Exchange Offer\ndoes not comply with the relevant requirements of a particular jurisdiction or for any other reason.\n\nYou may not receive New Notes in the Exchange\nOffer if the procedures for the Exchange Offer are not followed.\n\nNoteholders are responsible for complying with\nall Exchange Offer procedures. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Exchange Offer, the issuance of\nNew Notes in exchange for Old\nNotes will only occur upon completion of the procedures described in this prospectus under \u201cThe Exchange\nOffer \u2014 Procedures for Tendering Old Notes.\u201d Therefore, Noteholders who wish to exchange Old Notes for New\nNotes should allow sufficient time for\ntimely completion of the tender procedure. None of us, JPMorgan Chase & Co., the Trustee, the Dealer Manager\nor the Exchange Agent\nis obligated to extend the Exchange Offer, notify Noteholders of irregularities with respect to any such\nNoteholder\u2019s Exchange Instruction\nor notify Noteholders of any failure to follow the proper procedures.\n\nAny Noteholder whose Old Notes are held on its\nbehalf by a broker, dealer, bank, custodian, trust company, nominee or other Intermediary should promptly\ncontact such entity if it wishes\nto tender or withdraw tenders of its Old Notes in the Exchange Offer. Such Intermediaries may have deadlines\nfor participating in the\nExchange Offer prior to the Expiration Deadline. Noteholders should carefully review the specific procedures\nfor tendering Old Notes in\nthe section entitled \u201cThe Exchange Offer \u2014 Procedures for Tendering Old Notes.\u201d\n\nWe are not providing for guaranteed delivery procedures\nand therefore you must allow sufficient time for the necessary tender procedures to be completed at or prior\nto the Expiration Deadline.\nTenders not completed at or prior to the Expiration Deadline will be disregarded and of no effect.\n\nThe value of the Old Notes may exceed the value\nof the New Notes following the Exchange Offer.\n\nThe market value of the New Notes may be affected\nby a number of factors as described under \u201c\u2014 Risks Relating to the Secondary Market Prices of the New Notes\n\u2014 Many economic and market factors will impact the value of the New Notes\u201dand \u201c\u2014 Risks Relating to the Index\n\u2014 Energy MLP market risks may affect the trading value of the New Notes and the amount you will receive at\nmaturity\u201d below. No\nassurance can be given that the performance of the New Notes will be similar to, or better than, the\n                                                     21                                                     \nperformance\nof the Old Notes. Following the Exchange Offer, the value of the Old Notes not tendered in the Exchange\nOffer may exceed the value of\nthe New Notes issued in the Exchange Offer.\n\nWe may purchase, repay or redeem any Old Notes\nnot tendered in the Exchange Offer on terms that could be more favorable to Noteholders than the terms of\nthe Exchange Offer.\n\nWhether or not the Exchange Offer is completed,\nwe or any of our affiliates may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, acquire (from time to time) Old\nNotes other than pursuant\nto the Exchange Offer, including through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender\noffers, exchange offers or otherwise.\nSuch purchases may be on such terms as we or the relevant affiliate may determine, which may be more or less\nfavorable than the terms\npursuant to the Exchange Offer and could be for consideration or otherwise on terms more or less favorable\nthan those contemplated by\nthe Exchange Offer. Noteholders that validly tender (and do not validly withdraw) Old Notes in the Exchange\nOffer will not, in respect\nof such tendered Old Notes accepted for exchange, be able to participate in any other repurchase, repayment\nor redemption, which may be\nmade on terms that are more favorable than those of the Exchange Offer.\n\nIf you tender your Old Notes in the Exchange\nOffer, you will be unable to sell or otherwise transfer any tendered Old Notes or participate in any\nrepurchase, repayment or redemption\nunless they are returned to you following withdrawal or non-acceptance.\n\nWhen considering whether to tender Old Notes in\nthe Exchange Offer, you should take into account that, after the time of such tender, you will not be able\nto sell or otherwise transfer\nany tendered Old Notes or participate in any repurchase, repayment or redemption with respect to such Old\nNotes. If you withdraw or we\ndo not accept all or a portion of your tender, these restrictions will continue to apply until your Old\nNotes are returned to you.\n\nThere are significant differences between the\nOld Notes and the New Notes.\n\nWhile the Old Notes and the New Notes each offer\na return linked to the performance of the Alerian MLP Index as measured by its VWAP level, and to cash\ndistributions on\nits components, subject to the deduction of an investor fee and, if applicable, a repurchase fee, there are\nsignificant differences between\nthe Old Notes and the New Notes, including differences in the issuer, financial terms (including the\nspecific formula for determining\namounts payable on the notes) and relevant dates. Additionally, the New Notes are subject to an issuer right\nof redemption, which allows\nus to redeem, in our sole discretion, some or all outstanding New Notes. Investors should carefully consider\nthese differences in addition\nto those described under \u201cComparison of the Material Terms of the Old Notes and the New Notes\u201d in deciding\nwhether\nto tender Old Notes in exchange for the New Notes.\n\nLegality of purchase.\n\nNone of us, JPMorgan Chase & Co., the Trustee,\nthe Dealer Manager or the Exchange Agent has or assumes responsibility for the lawfulness of the acquisition\nof the New Notes by a prospective\ninvestor of the New Notes, whether under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or the\njurisdiction in which it operates (if\ndifferent), or for compliance by that prospective investor with any law, regulation or regulatory policy\napplicable to it.\n\nThis prospectus does not constitute an invitation\nto participate in the Exchange Offer in or from any jurisdiction in or from which, or to or from any person\nto or from whom, it is unlawful\nto make such offer under applicable securities laws or otherwise. Persons into whose possession this\nprospectus comes are required by\nus and the Dealer Manager to inform themselves about, and to observe, any such restrictions. No action that\nwould permit a public offer\nhas been or will be taken in any jurisdiction by us or the Dealer Manager.\n\nNoteholders must comply with all laws that apply\nto them in any place in which they possess this prospectus. Noteholders must also obtain any consents or\napprovals that they need in order\nto tender their Old Notes. None of us, JPMorgan Chase & Co., the Trustee, the Dealer Manager or the Exchange\nAgent is responsible\nfor Noteholders\u2019 compliance with these legal requirements. Non-compliance with these could result in, among\nother things, the unwinding\nof trades and/or penalties.\n                                                     22                                                     \nA Noteholder\u2019s failure to consult its own\nadvisers may result in it suffering adverse accounting, financial, legal or tax consequences.\n\nNoteholders should consult their own accounting,\nfinancial, legal and tax advisers as they may deem appropriate regarding the suitability to themselves of\nthe accounting, financial, legal\nand tax consequences of participating or declining to participate in the Exchange Offer and an investment in\nthe New Notes. Noteholders\nare liable for their own taxes and have no recourse to us, JPMorgan Chase & Co., the Trustee, the Dealer\nManager or the Exchange Agent\nwith respect to taxes arising in connection with the Exchange Offer (including disposition of the Old Notes\nand investment in the New\nNotes).\n\nRisks Relating to the New Notes\n\nYour investment in the New Notes will involve\ncertain risks. The New Notes do not guarantee any return of principal at, or prior to, maturity, early\nrepurchase or redemption. Investing\nin the New Notes is not equivalent to investing (or taking a long position) directly in the Index or any\nIndex Component. In addition,\nyour investment in the New Notes entails other risks not associated with an investment in conventional debt\nsecurities. You should consider\ncarefully the following discussion of risks before you decide that an investment in the New Notes is\nappropriate for you.\n\nRisks Relating to the New Notes Generally\n\nYour investment in the New Notes may result in\na loss.\n\nYou may lose some or all of your initial investment\nat maturity or upon early repurchase or redemption. The aggregate payments on your notes will be less than\nyour initial investment if\nany Coupon Payments (which reflect the negative effect of the Accrued Investor Fee) are insufficient to\noffset any decrease in the VWAP\nLevel and the negative effect of any Investor Fee Shortfall (and, in the case of early repurchase, the\nRepurchase Fee Amount).\n\nYou are not guaranteed any Coupon Payments.\n\nNo Coupon Payment will be payable with respect to a Coupon Valuation Date if the Reference Distribution\nAmount is less than the Accrued Investor Fee, even if that Reference Distribution Amount is positive. The\nReference Distribution Amount reflects cash distributions on the Index Components over a relevant quarterly\nperiod. The Accrued Investor Fee accrues at a rate of 0.85% per annum each day. If the Reference\nDistribution Amount on the previous Coupon Valuation Date is less than the Accrued Investor Fee on that\nCoupon Valuation Date, any Investor Fee Shortfall will also be included in the Accrued Investor Fee.\n\nIn addition, the Coupon Amount as of any Coupon Valuation Date will reflect only the excess of the Reference\nDistribution Amount over the Accrued Investor Fee with respect to that Coupon Valuation Date. Any reduction\nin or elimination of the cash distributions of one or more Index Component will similarly reduce the\nReference Distribution Amount and the amount of the relevant Coupon Payment, if any.\n\nThe Accrued Investor Fee and the Repurchase Fee\nAmount will reduce amounts payable on the New Notes.\n\nEach Coupon Amount reflects the deduction of an\nAccrued Investor Fee, which will reduce each Coupon Amount, if any. The actual amount of the deduction will\nbe determined on the relevant\nCoupon Valuation Date and will depend on the VWAP Level as of the immediately preceding Index Business Day\nthat is not a Disrupted Day\nfor any Index Component and any Investor Fee Shortfall carried over from the immediately preceding Coupon\nValuation Date.\n\nIn addition, if the Reference Distribution Amount\nused to calculate the Stub Coupon Amount on any Index Business Day (other than an actual Coupon Valuation\nDate) is less than the Accrued\nInvestor Fee used to calculate that Stub Coupon Amount, an amount equal to the difference between the\nAccrued Investor Fee and the Reference\nDistribution Amount, which is the Investor Fee Shortfall, will be deducted in calculating the Closing\nIntrinsic Note Value and each Intraday\nIntrinsic Note Value on that Index\n                                                     23                                                     \nBusiness\nDay. Accordingly, the payment at maturity or upon early repurchase or redemption will be reduced by the\namount of any Investor Fee Shortfall\nreflected in the relevant Closing Intrinsic Note Value.\n\nFurthermore, a Repurchase Fee Amount of 0.125%\nof the Closing Intrinsic Note Value as of the final day of the relevant Measurement Period (but excluding\nany Unpaid Coupon Amount included\nin that Closing Intrinsic Note Value) is deducted in determining the amount payable upon early repurchase.\nAs a result, the Repurchase\nFee Amount will reduce the amount payable upon early repurchase.\n\nThe New Notes are subject to the credit risks\nof JPMorgan Financial and JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThe New Notes are subject to the credit risk of\nJPMorgan Financial, as issuer of the New Notes, and the credit risk of JPMorgan Chase & Co., as guarantor of\nthe New Notes. JPMorgan\nFinancial\u2019s and JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s credit ratings and credit spreads may adversely affect the market\nvalue of the\nNew Notes. Investors in the New Notes are dependent on the ability of JPMorgan Financial and JPMorgan Chase\n& Co. to pay all amounts\ndue on the New Notes. Any actual or potential change in JPMorgan Financial\u2019s or JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s\ncreditworthiness\nor the credit spreads, as determined by the market for taking that credit risk, is likely to affect\nadversely the value of the New Notes.\nAny payment on the New Notes is subject to the creditworthiness of JPMorgan Financial and JPMorgan Chase &\nCo. If JPMorgan Financial\nand JPMorgan Chase & Co. were to default on their payment obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed\nto you under the New Notes\nand you could lose your entire investment.\n\nAs a finance subsidiary, JPMorgan Financial has\nno independent operations and has limited assets.\n\nAs a finance subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase &\nCo., JPMorgan Financial has no independent operations beyond the issuance and administration of its\nsecurities. Aside from the initial\ncapital contribution from JPMorgan Chase & Co., substantially all of the assets of JPMorgan Financial are\nexpected to relate to obligations\nof one or more of its affiliates to make payments under loans made by JPMorgan Financial or under other\nintercompany agreements with JPMorgan\nFinancial. As a result, JPMorgan Financial\u2019s ability to make payments in respect of the New Notes is\nlimited. JPMorgan Financial\nis dependent upon payments from one or more of its affiliates under intercompany loans and other\nintercompany agreements to meet its obligations\nunder the notes it issues. If these affiliates do not make payments to JPMorgan Financial and JPMorgan\nFinancial fails to make payments\non the New Notes, holders of the New Notes may have to seek payment under the related guarantee by JPMorgan\nChase & Co. and that guarantee\nwill rank pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThe New Notes will not have the benefit of any\ncross-default or cross-acceleration with other indebtedness of JPMorgan Financial or JPMorgan Chase & Co.; a\ncovenant default or bankruptcy,\ninsolvency or reorganization event with respect to JPMorgan Chase & Co. does not constitute an event of\ndefault.\n\nThe New Notes will not have the benefit of any\ncross-default or cross-acceleration with other indebtedness of JPMorgan Financial or JPMorgan Chase & Co. In\naddition, a covenant\ndefault by JPMorgan Chase & Co., or an event of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of JPMorgan Chase &\nCo., does not constitute\nan event of default with respect to the New Notes.\n\nThe early redemption feature may force a potential\nearly exit.\n\nIf we elect to redeem your notes early, the term\nof the New Notes will be reduced to as short as approximately six months and you may lose some or all of\nyour initial investment upon\nearly redemption. You will not receive any further payments, including any Coupon Payments, after the\napplicable Redemption Settlement\nDate. There is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the New\nNotes at a comparable return\nfor a similar level of risk.\n                                                     24                                                     \nThe payment on the New Notes is linked to the\nVWAP levels, not to the closing levels, of the Index.\n\nThe payment at maturity or upon early repurchase\nor redemption is linked to the performance of the VWAP level of the Index over a five-day measurement\nperiod, which we refer to as the\nFinal VWAP Level, as compared to the average VWAP level over a measurement period at the initial pricing of\nthe New Notes, which we refer\nto as the Initial VWAP Level. Although the VWAP level is intended to track the performance of the Index, the\ncalculation of the VWAP level\nis different from the calculation of the official closing level of the Index, and the VWAP level will not\nnecessarily correlate with the\nperformance of the official closing level of the Index. The official closing level of the Index may vary\nsignificantly from the VWAP level.\nTherefore, the payment at maturity or upon early repurchase or redemption may be different from, and may be\nsignificantly less than, the\npayment you would receive if that payment were determined by reference to the official closing level of the\nIndex.\n\nA trading market may not develop, and the New\nNotes may not continue to be listed over their term.\n\nAlthough we intend to list the New Notes on NYSE\nArca, no assurance can be given as to the approval of the New Notes for listing or, if listed, the continued\nlisting for the term of the\nNew Notes, or the liquidity or trading market for the New Notes. There can be no assurance that a secondary\nmarket for the New Notes will\ndevelop. We are not required to maintain a listing on NYSE Arca or any other exchange.\n\nThe trading price of the New Notes in any secondary\nmarket may differ significantly from the Closing Intrinsic Note Value and Intraday Intrinsic Note Value.\n\nThe Closing Intrinsic Note Value is published on\neach Index Business Day and is meant to approximate the intrinsic value of the New Notes at the close on\nthat day, and the Intraday Intrinsic\nNote Value is published every 15 seconds on each Index Business Day and is meant to approximate the\nintrinsic value of the New Notes at\nthat time. See \u201cDescription of the New Notes \u2014 Understanding the Value of the New Notes.\u201d In contrast, the\ntrading\nprice of the New Notes at any time is the price at which you may be able to sell your notes in the secondary\nmarket at that time, if one\nexists.\n\nThe trading price of the New Notes at any time\nmay vary significantly from the Closing Intrinsic Note Value and the Intraday Intrinsic Note Value at that\ntime due to, among other things,\nimbalances of supply and demand (including as a result of any decision of ours to issue, stop issuing or\nresume issuing additional New\nNotes), lack of liquidity, transaction costs, credit considerations and bid-offer spreads. A premium or\ndiscount over the Intraday Intrinsic\nNote Value can also arise in the trading price as a result of mismatches of trading hours between the New\nNotes and the components included\nin the Index underlying the New Notes, actions (or failure to take action) by the index sponsor and NYSE\nArca and technical or human errors\nby service providers, market participants and others. If you pay a premium for the New Notes above the\nClosing Intrinsic Note Value and\nthe Intraday Intrinsic Note Value, you could incur significant losses if you sell your New Notes at a time\nwhen the premium is no longer\npresent in the market.\n\nIn addition, the payment on the New Notes at maturity\nor upon early repurchase or redemption will be determined based on the Closing Intrinsic Note Value\ncalculated using the average VWAP\nLevel over a five-day Measurement Period, which may vary significantly from the trading price of the New\nNotes and will not reflect any\npremium. Furthermore, if you sell your New Notes in the market at a time when the New Notes are trading at a\ndiscount below the Closing\nIntrinsic Note Value and the Intraday Intrinsic Note Value, you will receive less than the Closing Intrinsic\nNote Value and the Intraday\nIntrinsic Note Value\n\nThe liquidity of the market for the New Notes\nmay vary materially over time, including as a result of any decision of ours to issue, stop issuing or\nresume issuing additional New Notes.\n\nIn our sole discretion, and without providing you\nnotice or obtaining your consent, we may decide to issue and sell additional New Notes from time to time.\nHowever, we are under no obligation\nto issue or sell additional New Notes at any time, and if we do sell additional New Notes, we may limit or\nrestrict those sales, and we\nmay stop and subsequently resume selling additional New Notes at any time. If we limit, restrict or stop\nsales of such additional notes,\nor if we subsequently resume sales of such additional\n                                                     25                                                     \nnotes, the liquidity and trading price of the New\nNotes in the secondary market could be materially and adversely affected. Unless we indicate otherwise, if\nwe suspend selling additional\nNew Notes, we reserve the right to resume selling additional New Notes at any time, which might result in\nthe reduction or elimination\nof any premium in the trading price. See \u201c\u2014 The trading price of the New Notes in any secondary market may\ndiffer significantly from the Closing Intrinsic Note Value and Intraday Intrinsic Note Value.\u201d\n\nIn addition, affiliates of ours may engage in limited\npurchase and resale transactions in the New Notes, although they are not required to do so. The number of\nNew Notes outstanding or held\nby persons other than our affiliates could be further reduced at any time due to early repurchase of the New\nNotes or due to our or our\naffiliates\u2019 purchases of New Notes in the secondary market. A suspension of additional issuances of the New\nNotes could result in\na significant reduction in the number of outstanding notes if investors subsequently exercise their right to\nhave the New Notes repurchased\nby us.\n\nAccordingly, the number of outstanding New Notes,\nand their liquidity, could vary substantially over the term of the New Notes. There may not be sufficient\nliquidity to enable you to sell\nyour New Notes readily, and you may suffer substantial losses and/or sell your New Notes at prices\nsubstantially less than their intrinsic\nvalue, including being unable to sell them at all or only for a price of zero in the secondary market. In\naddition, any election by holders\nto request that we repurchase the New Notes will be subject to the restrictive conditions and procedures\ndescribed under \u201cDescription of the New Notes,\u201d including the condition that you may request repurchase of\nat least 50,000 notes at any one time and\nthat you may only exercise your right to require us to repurchase the New Notes once per week. If the total\nnumber of outstanding New\nNotes is close to or below 50,000, you may not be able to purchase enough New Notes to meet the minimum size\nrequirement in order to exercise\nyour early repurchase right. The unavailability of the repurchase right can result in the New Notes trading\nin the secondary market at\na discount below their intrinsic value.\n\nThere are restrictions on the minimum number\nof New Notes you may request that we repurchase and the dates on which you may exercise your right to have\nus repurchase your New Notes.\n\nIf you elect to exercise your right to have us\nrepurchase your New Notes, you must request that we repurchase at least 50,000 notes on the applicable\nRepurchase Date. If you own fewer\nthan 50,000 notes, you will not be able to have us repurchase your New Notes. Your request that we\nrepurchase your New Notes is valid\nonly if we receive your Repurchase Notice by no later than 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business\nDay immediately preceding the\napplicable Repurchase Valuation Date (generally Thursday). Once delivered, a Repurchase Notice may not be\nrevoked. If we do not receive\nyour Repurchase Notice by the deadline, your Repurchase Notice will not be effective and we will not\nrepurchase your New Notes on the\ncorresponding Repurchase Date. In addition, because of the timing requirements of the Repurchase Notice and\nthe five-Index Business Day\nMeasurement Period, settlement of the repurchase will be prolonged when compared to a sale and settlement in\nthe secondary market.\n\nYou will not know the payment upon early repurchase\nor the repurchase date at the time you elect to request that we repurchase your New Notes.\n\nYou will not know the amount payable upon early\nrepurchase or the Repurchase Date at the time you elect to request that we repurchase your New Notes. Your\nnotice must be received by\nus no later than 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable\nRepurchase Valuation Date. The\nIssuer\u2019s acknowledgement may specify a Repurchase Date that follows the final day in the Measurement Period\nby up to five Business\nDays. In addition, the amount payable upon early repurchase will not be determined until the final day of\nthe Measurement Period with\nrespect to the Repurchase Valuation Date, which is the fifth Index Business Day from the Repurchase\nValuation Date, subject to postponement\nin the event of a market disruption event and as described under \u201cGeneral Terms of Notes \u2014 Postponement of\nan Averaging Date\u201d under \u201cDescription of the New Notes.\u201d As a result, you will be exposed to market risk in\nthe event\nthe market fluctuates after we receive your request.\n                                                     26                                                     \nFor purposes of determining any payment on the\nNew Notes at maturity or upon early repurchase or redemption, the VWAP level will be referenced only on the\nIndex Business Days during\nthe relevant measurement period.\n\nAs a result, the value of the New Notes and any\npayment on the New Notes may be adversely affected. If the VWAP level increases or remains relatively\nconstant during the initial term\nof the New Notes and then decreases below the Initial VWAP Level, the relevant Final VWAP Level may be\nsignificantly less than if it were\ncalculated on a date or dates earlier than the Index Business Days during the relevant measurement period.\nUnder these circumstances,\nyou may receive a lower return on the New Notes than you would have received if you had invested directly in\nthe Index or the Index Components.\n\nYou will have no ownership rights in any of the\nIndex Components.\n\nInvesting in the New Notes is not equivalent to\ninvesting (or taking a short position) directly in any Index Component. As a holder of the New Notes, you\nwill not have voting rights\nor rights to receive cash distributions or other rights that direct holders of the Index Components would\nhave.\n\nMarket disruptions may adversely affect your\nreturn.\n\nThe Note Calculation Agent may, in its sole discretion,\ndetermine that the markets have been affected in a manner that prevents the VWAP Calculation Agent from\ndetermining the VWAP level on\nany day during a measurement period and prevents the Note Calculation Agent from calculating the amount of\nany payment on the New Notes\nat maturity or upon early repurchase or redemption. These events may include disruptions or suspensions of\ntrading in the markets as a\nwhole. If the Note Calculation Agent, in its sole discretion, determines that any of these events prevents\nus or any of our affiliates\nfrom properly hedging our obligations under the New Notes, it is possible that the determination of the VWAP\nlevel and the payment at\nmaturity or upon early repurchase or redemption will be postponed and that your return will be adversely\naffected. In addition, if any\nday during a measurement period is postponed to the last possible day and the VWAP level is not available on\nthat day because of the occurrence\nof a Disrupted Day (as defined below), the VWAP Calculation Agent will nevertheless make determinations with\nrespect to any affected Index\nComponent and the Index on that last possible day for purposes of calculating the VWAP level. See \u201cGeneral\nTerms of the New Notes \u2014 Postponement of an Averaging Date\u201d and \u201cGeneral Terms of the New Notes \u2014\nPostponement of a Payment Date\u201d\nfor more information.\n\nThe tax consequences of an investment in the\nNew Notes are unclear.\n\nThe tax consequences of an investment in the New\nNotes are unclear. There is no direct legal authority as to the proper U.S. federal income tax treatment of\nthe New Notes, and we do not\nintend to request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) regarding the New Notes.\n\nThe IRS might not accept, and a court might not\nuphold, the treatment of the New Notes as \u201copen transactions\u201d that are not debt instruments, as described in\n\u201cMaterial\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences\u201d in this prospectus. If the IRS were successful in asserting an\nalternative treatment for the\nNew Notes, the timing and character of any income or loss on the New Notes could be materially and adversely\naffected. See\n\u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences \u2014 Exchanging U.S. Holders \u2014 Tax Consequences of the Ownership\nand Disposition\nof the New Notes \u2014 Alternative Tax Treatments of the New Notes\u201d in this prospectus.\n\nEven if the New Notes are treated as open transactions\nthat are not debt instruments, the New Notes could be treated as \u201cconstructive ownership transactions\u201d\nwithin the meaning\nof Section 1260 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). If applicable, the\nconstructive ownership rules\nwould recharacterize any gain recognized in respect of the New Notes that would otherwise be long-term\ncapital gain and that is in excess\nof the \u201cnet underlying long-term capital gain\u201d (as defined in Code Section 1260) as ordinary income and\nimpose a notional\ninterest charge as if that income had accrued for tax purposes at a constant yield over your holding period\nfor the New Notes. See \u201cMaterial\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences \u2014 Exchanging U.S. Holders \u2014 Tax Consequences of the Ownership and\nDisposition of the\nNew Notes \u2014 Potential Application of the Constructive Ownership Rules to the New Notes\u201d in this prospectus.\n                                                     27                                                     \nAlthough the U.S. federal income tax treatment\nof Coupon Amounts is uncertain, we expect (in the absence of an administrative determination or judicial\nruling to the contrary) to treat\nCoupon Amounts as ordinary income at the time accrued or received in accordance with your method of\naccounting for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes.\n\nIn 2007 Treasury and the IRS released a notice\nrequesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of \u201cprepaid forward contracts\u201d and similar\ninstruments, which\nmay include the New Notes. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these\ninstruments to accrue income over\nthe term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the\ncharacter of income or loss with\nrespect to these instruments; the relevance of factors such as the exchange-traded status of the instruments\nand the nature of the underlying\nproperty to which the instruments are linked; and whether these instruments are or should be subject to the\n\u201cconstructive ownership\u201d\nregime described above. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective\ndates, any Treasury regulations\nor other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the\ntax consequences of an investment\nin the New Notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax adviser regarding the U.S.\nfederal income tax consequences\nof an investment in the New Notes, including the potential application of the constructive ownership rules,\npossible alternative treatments\nand the issues presented by the notice described above.\n\nNon-U.S. Holders should evaluate an investment\nin the New Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the applicability of any income tax\ntreaties.\n\nAs noted above, the IRS might not accept, and a\ncourt might not uphold, the treatment of the New Notes as \u201copen transactions\u201d that are not debt instruments.\nIf the IRS were\nsuccessful in asserting an alternative treatment for the New Notes, a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in\n\u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income\nTax Consequences \u2014 Exchanging Non-U.S. Holders\u201d in this prospectus) could, among other potentially adverse\nconsequences, be\nrequired to recognize income, gain or loss and file tax returns in the jurisdictions in which the underlying\nMLPs that are treated as\npartnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes operate (including federal, state and local jurisdictions)\nas if the Non-U.S. Holder\nowned direct interests in those MLPs , treated as recognizing income or loss (taxable in the United States\nand applicable state and local\njurisdictions) each time the Index is rebalanced, and subject to 15% withholding on the amount realized when\nselling or exchanging a New\nNote (including upon early repurchase or redemption at maturity) and when otherwise treated as selling one\nor more partnership interests\n(e.g., when the Index is rebalanced). See \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences \u2014 Exchanging\nNon-U.S. Holders\n\u2014 Tax Consequences of the Ownership and Disposition of the New Notes \u2014 Beneficial Ownership\u201d in this\nprospectus.\n\nAssuming that the treatment of the New Notes as\n\u201copen transactions\u201d that are not debt instruments is respected, subject to the following sentence and the\ndiscussion in the\nnext paragraph, we generally expect that Coupon Amounts paid to Non-U.S. Holders will be withheld upon at a\nrate of 30%, subject to the\npossible reduction or elimination of that rate under the \u201cother income\u201d or similar provision of an\napplicable income tax treaty.\nCoupon Amounts that are treated as \"effectively connected\" with your conduct of a trade or business in the\nUnited States should\nnot be subject to this withholding tax. However, in order to avoid withholding on \u201ceffectively connected\u201d\nCoupon Amounts,\nyou will likely be required to provide a properly completed IRS Form W-8ECI. Any \u201ceffectively connected\nincome\u201d from your\nNew Notes, including also any gain from the sale or settlement of your New Notes that is or is treated as\neffectively connected with your\nconduct of a United States trade or business, will be subject to U.S. federal income tax, and will require\nyou to file U.S. federal income\ntax returns, in each case in the same manner as if you were a U.S. Holder (as defined in \u201cMaterial U.S.\nFederal Income Tax Consequences\n\u2014 Exchanging U.S. Holders\u201d in this prospectus). In particular, if you own or are treated as owning more than\n5% of the New\nNotes, you could be treated as owning a \u201cUnited States real property interest\u201d within the meaning of Code\nSection 897, in\nwhich case any gain from the sale or settlement of your New Notes would be deemed to be \u201ceffectively\nconnected income,\u201d with\nthe consequences described above.\n\nIf you are a non-U.S. holder that is a foreign\ncorporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you should also consider the potential application of the\nU.S. branch profits tax to\nyour effectively connected\n                                                     28                                                     \nincome, including\nincome or gain recognized if the IRS were successful in asserting that the New Notes constitute beneficial\nownership of the underlying\nMLPs.\n\nCode Section 871(m) and Treasury regulations promulgated\nthereunder (\u201cSection 871(m)\u201d) generally imposes a 30% withholding tax (or a lower rate under the dividend\nprovision of an\napplicable income tax treaty) on certain \u201cdividend equivalents\u201d paid or deemed paid with respect to\nderivatives linked to\nU.S. stocks or indices that include U.S. stocks or certain partnerships that own U.S. stocks under certain\ncircumstances, even in cases\nwhere the derivatives do not provide for payments explicitly linked to dividends. A Non-U.S. Holder\ngenerally should\nexpect withholding agents to withhold from each Coupon Payment 30% (or a lower rate under the dividend\nprovision of an applicable income\ntax treaty) of (i) the Estimated Amount (as defined in \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences \u2014\nExchanging Non-U.S.\nHolders \u2014 Tax Consequences of the Ownership and Disposition of the New Notes \u2014 Section 871(m)\u201d in this\nprospectus) and\n(ii) the portion of the Coupon Payment attributable to dividend equivalents with respect to Hess Midstream\nLP and Star Group LP, and also\nto withhold 30% (subject to possible reduction or elimination of that rate under the \u201cother income\u201d or\nsimilar provision of\nan applicable income tax treaty) of the remaining portion of the Coupon Payment, in each case assuming the\nincome is not effectively connected\nwith your conduct of a trade or business in the United States, as described above (in which case, in order\nto avoid withholding, you will\nlikely be required to provide a properly completed IRS Form W-8ECI). A Non-U.S. Holder that sells or\notherwise disposes\nof the New Notes between Coupon Payment Dates generally should expect withholding agents to withhold 30% (or\na lower rate under the dividend\nprovision of an applicable income tax treaty) of the estimated dividend equivalent amounts attributable to\nthe portion of the Coupon Amount\nthat has accrued since the immediately preceding Coupon Payment Date. See \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax\nConsequences \u2014\nExchanging Non-U.S. Holders \u2014 Tax Consequences of the Ownership and Disposition of the New Notes \u2014 Section\n871(m)\u201d in\nthis prospectus.\n\nIn the event of any withholding on the New Notes, we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with\nrespect to amounts so withheld. Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding the potential\napplication of withholding tax to the New Notes.\n\nEmployees of JPMorgan Chase & Co. or one\nof its affiliates holding the New Notes must comply with policies that limit their ability to purchase or\nsell the New Notes.\n\nIf you are an employee of JPMorgan Chase &\nCo. or one of its affiliates, you may acquire the New Notes only for investment purposes, and you must\ncomply with all of JPMorgan Chase\n& Co.\u2019s internal policies and procedures. Because these policies and procedures limit the dates and times\nthat you may transact\nin the New Notes, you may not be able to purchase the New Notes from us, and your ability to trade or sell\nthe New Notes in the secondary\nmarket may be limited.\n\nRisks Relating to Conflicts of Interest\n\nOur offering of the New Notes does not constitute\nan expression of our or JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s views about, or a recommendation of, the Index or any Index\nComponent.\n\nYou should not take our offering of the New Notes\nas an expression of our or JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s views about how the Index or any Index Component will\nperform in the future\nor as a recommendation to invest (directly or indirectly, by taking a long or short position) in the Index\nor any Index Component, including\nthrough an investment in the New Notes. As a global financial institution, we, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and our\naffiliates may, and often\ndo, have positions (long, short or both) in the Index or one or more Index Component that conflict with an\ninvestment in the New Notes.\nYou should undertake an independent determination of whether an investment in the New Notes is appropriate\nfor you in light of your specific\ninvestment objectives, risk tolerance and financial resources.\n\nWe, JPMorgan Chase & Co. or our affiliates\nmay have economic interests that are adverse to those of the holders of the New Notes as a result of our\nhedging and other trading activities.\n\nIn anticipation of the sale of the New Notes, we,\nthrough our affiliates or others, may take long or short positions in the Index, a similar index or one or\nmore Index Components or in\nlisted or over-the-counter options, futures, or other instruments linked to the Index, a similar index or\none or more Index\n                                                     29                                                     \nComponents. We may also adjust our hedge by, among\nother things, purchasing or selling any of the foregoing at any time and from time to time and close out or\nunwind our hedge by selling\nany of the foregoing during or before any measurement period. In addition, JPMS and other affiliates of ours\nor JPMorgan Chase & Co.\nalso trade the foregoing on a regular basis (taking long or short positions or both), for their accounts,\nfor other accounts under their\nmanagement and to facilitate transactions, including block transactions, on behalf of customers. While we\nand JPMorgan Chase & Co.\ncannot predict an outcome, any of these hedging or other trading activities could potentially affect the\nVWAP level and may adversely\naffect the value of the New Notes or any payment on the New Notes. If we and our affiliates are unable to\neffectively hedge our obligations\nunder the New Notes, we may limit, restrict or stop sales of additional New Notes, which could materially\nand adversely affect the liquidity\nand trading price of the New Notes in the secondary market.\n\nThis hedging and trading activity may present a\nconflict of interest between your interests as a holder of the New Notes and the interests of our affiliates\nin hedging and other trading\nactivities. These hedging and trading activities could also affect the price at which JPMS is willing to\npurchase your New Notes in the\nsecondary market. In addition, our hedging counterparties expect to make a profit. Because hedging our\nobligations entails risk and may\nbe influenced by market forces beyond our control, this hedging may result in a profit that is more or less\nthan expected, or it may result\nin a loss. It is possible that these hedging or trading activities could result in substantial returns for\nus or our affiliates while\nthe value of the New Notes declines.\n\nWe, JPMorgan Chase & Co. or our affiliates\nmay have economic interests that are adverse to those of the holders of the New Notes as a result of our\nbusiness activities.\n\nWe, JPMorgan Chase & Co. or our affiliates\nmay currently or from time to time engage in business with the issuer of an Index Component (the \u201cunderlying\ncompanies\u201d),\nincluding extending loans to, making equity investments in or providing advisory services to the underlying\ncompanies, including merger\nand acquisition advisory services. We and JPMorgan Chase & Co. do not make any representation or warranty to\nany purchaser of New\nNotes with respect to any matters whatsoever relating to our and JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s businesses with the\nunderlying companies.\n\nIn addition, in the course of our or JPMorgan Chase\n& Co.\u2019s businesses, we or our affiliates may acquire nonpublic information about the Index or one or more\nIndex Components or\nunderlying companies, and we will not disclose any such information to you.\n\nFurthermore, we, JPMorgan Chase & Co. or one\nof our affiliates may serve as issuer, agent or underwriter for issuances of other securities or financial\ninstruments with returns linked\nor related to changes in the VWAP level or closing level of the Index or the Index Components. To the extent\nthat we, JPMorgan Chase &\nCo. or one of our affiliates serves as issuer, agent or underwriter for these securities or financial\ninstruments, we, JPMorgan Chase\n& Co. or our affiliate\u2019s interests with respect to these securities or financial instruments may be adverse\nto those of the\nholders of the New Notes. By introducing competing products into the marketplace in this manner, we,\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. or one or\nmore of our affiliates could adversely affect the value of the New Notes.\n\nThe sponsor of the Index relies on numerous public\nanalyst reports, including reports produced by affiliates of ours and JPMorgan Chase & Co., and other\npublicly available information\nin its determination of projected future distribution growth, which is referenced in determining the\ncomposition of the Index.\n\nWe, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and our affiliates\nwill have no obligation to consider your interests as a holder of the New Notes in taking any actions that\nmight affect the VWAP level\nor the value of the New Notes.\n\nWe, JPMorgan Chase & Co. or our affiliates\nmay have economic interests that are adverse to those of the holders of the New Notes due to JPMS\u2019s role as\nNote Calculation Agent.\n\nJPMS, one of our and JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s\naffiliates, will act as the Note Calculation Agent. The Note Calculation Agent will make all necessary\ncalculations and determinations\nin connection with the New Notes, other than determinations to be made by the VWAP Calculation Agent,\nincluding calculations and determinations\nrelating to any payments on the New Notes, Market Disruption Events, splits and\n                                                     30                                                     \nreverse splits of the New Notes and the replacement\nof the Index with a successor index. In performing these duties, JPMS may have interests adverse to the\ninterests of the holders of the\nNew Notes, which may affect your return on the New Notes, particularly where JPMS, as the Note Calculation\nAgent, is entitled to exercise\ndiscretion. See \u201cGeneral Terms of the New Notes.\u201d\n\nWe may have interests that are adverse to those\nof the holders of the New Notes due to the issuer redemption feature of the New Notes.\n\nOn any Business Day on or after July 26, 2024,\nwe may, in our sole discretion, redeem the New Notes, in whole or in part. We will have no obligation to\nconsider your interests as a\nholder of the New Notes in determining whether to redeem the New Notes.\n\nJPMS and its affiliates may have published research,\nexpressed opinions or provided recommendations that are inconsistent with investing in or holding the New\nNotes or that may adversely\naffect the value of the New Notes, and may do so in the future.\n\nJPMS and its affiliates may publish research reports,\nexpress opinions or provide recommendations from time to time that relate to the Index or one or more Index\nComponents. These research\nreports, opinions or recommendations may be inconsistent with purchasing or holding the New Notes and could\nadversely affect the value\nof the New Notes. Any research, opinions or recommendations expressed by JPMS or its affiliates may not be\nconsistent with each other\nand may be modified from time to time without notice. Investors should make their own independent\ninvestigation of the merits of investing\nin the New Notes, the Index and the Index Components.\n\nRisks Relating to the Secondary Market Prices of the New Notes\n\nMany economic and market factors will impact\nthe secondary market price of the New Notes.\n\nThe secondary market price of the New Notes during\ntheir term will be impacted by a number of economic and market factors, which may either offset or magnify\neach other, aside from the\nVWAP level and the level of the Index, including:\n                                                                      \n  \u00b7  any actual or potential change in our or JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s  \n     creditworthiness or credit spreads;                              \n                                                                      \n                                                                                  \n  \u00b7  the actual and expected volatility in the Index and the prices of the Index  \n     Components;                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                             \n  \u00b7  the time to maturity of the New Notes;  \n                                             \n                                                                                      \n  \u00b7  the market price and actual and expected distributions on the Index Components;  \n                                                                                      \n                                                        \n  \u00b7  interest and yield rates in the market generally;  \n                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n     supply and demand for the New Notes, including inventory positions with any                            \n  \u00b7  market maker (supply and demand for the New Notes will be affected by any decision of ours to issue,   \n     stop issuing or resume issuing additional                                                              \n     New Notes);                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                    \n  \u00b7  the amount of the Accrued Investor Fee as of a particular determination date;  \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                \n  \u00b7  the Index Components and changes to those Index Components over time; and  \n                                                                                \n                                                                                   \n  \u00b7  a variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory and judicial events.  \n                                                                                   \n                                                     31                                                     \nRisks Relating to the Index\n\nVettaFi, the sponsor of the Index, may adjust\nthe Index in a way that affects its level, and VettaFi has no obligation to consider your interests.\n\nVettaFi is responsible for maintaining the Index.\nAdditional securities may satisfy the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the Index, and the securities\ncurrently included in the Index\nmay fail to satisfy the eligibility criteria. In addition, VettaFi can add, delete or substitute the\nsecurities underlying the Index or\nmake changes to the weighting methodology or other methodological changes that could affect the VWAP level\nof the Index. You should realize\nthat the changing of securities included in the Index may affect the Index, as a newly added security may\nperform significantly better\nor worse than the security or securities it replaces. Additionally, VettaFi may alter, discontinue or\nsuspend calculation or dissemination\nof the Index. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of the New Notes. VettaFi has no\nobligation to consider your interests\nin calculating or revising the Index.\n\nThere is no assurance that the strategy employed\nby the Index will be successful.\n\nThe Index measures the composite performance of energy-oriented\nMLPs that earn the majority of their cash flows from qualified activities involving energy commodities,\nusing a capped, float-adjusted,\ncapitalization-weighted methodology. There is, however, no assurance that the Index will outperform any\nother index or strategy that tracks\nMLPs selected using other criteria. Because the Index uses a capped, floated-adjusted, capitalization-\nweighted methodology, the performance\nof the VWAP level and Coupon Payments on the New Notes may be lower than if a different weighting\nmethodology were employed.\n\nEnergy MLP market risks may affect the trading\nvalue of the New Notes and the amount you will receive at maturity.\n\nWe expect that the VWAP level and the amount of any\ndistributions on the Index Components will fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition\nof the Index Components and\ncertain other factors. The financial condition of the Index Components may become impaired or the general\ncondition of the energy-oriented\nMLP market may deteriorate, either of which may cause a decrease in the VWAP level and the amount of any\ndistributions on the Index Components\nand thus in the value of the New Notes. Securities are susceptible to general market fluctuations and to\nvolatile increases and decreases\nin value, as market confidence in and perceptions regarding the Index Components change. Investor\nperceptions of the Index Components\nare based on various and unpredictable factors, including expectations regarding government, economic,\nmonetary, tax and fiscal policies,\ninflation and interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, and global or regional political, economic\nand banking crises. The VWAP\nlevel and the amount of any distributions on the Index Components are expected to fluctuate over the term of\nthe New Notes.\n\nThe Index Components are concentrated in the\nenergy industry.\n\nAll or substantially all of the Index Components\nthat have been issued by companies whose primary lines of business are directly associated with the energy\nindustry including the oil\nand gas sector. Many of the MLPs included in the Index are smaller, non-diversified businesses that are\nexposed to the risks associated\nwith such businesses, including the lack of capital funding to sustain or grow businesses and potential\ncompetition from larger, better\nfinanced and more diversified businesses. In addition, the MLPs in the energy industry are significantly\naffected by a number of factors\nincluding:\n                                                                                  \n  \u00b7  worldwide and domestic supplies of, and demand for, crude oil, natural gas,  \n     natural gas liquids, hydrocarbon products and refined products;              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                    \n  \u00b7  changes in tax or other laws affecting master limited partnerships generally;  \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                  \n  \u00b7  regulatory changes affecting pipeline fees and other regulatory fees in the  \n     energy sector;                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                   \n  \u00b7  changes in the relative prices of competing energy products;  \n                                                                   \n                                                     32                                                     \n                                                                                           \n  \u00b7  the impact of environmental laws and regulations and technological changes            \n     affecting the cost of producing and processing, and the demand for, energy products;  \n                                                                                           \n                                                                                                          \n  \u00b7  decreased supply of hydrocarbon products available to be processed due to                            \n     fewer discoveries of new hydrocarbon reserves, short- or long-term supply disruptions or otherwise;  \n                                                                                                          \n                                                                                     \n  \u00b7  risks of regulatory actions and/or litigation, including as a result of leaks,  \n     explosions or other accidents relating to energy products;                      \n                                                                                     \n                                                                                                \n  \u00b7  uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak             \n     of armed hostilities or further acts of terrorism in the United States, or elsewhere; and  \n                                                                                                \n                                                                                       \n  \u00b7  general economic and geopolitical conditions in the United States and worldwide.  \n                                                                                       \nIn addition, investments in securities of MLPs involve\nrisks that differ from investments in common stock including risks related to limited control and limited\nrights to vote on matters affecting\nan MLPs, risks related to potential conflicts of interest between an MLP and its general partner, and cash\nflow risks.\n\nPrices of securities of an MLP can be affected by\nfundamentals unique to the partnership, including earnings power and coverage ratio. Changes in the tax law\naffecting MLPs could adversely\naffect the price performance of securities of MLPs. These factors could affect the relevant industries and\nthe MLPs operating in these\nindustries and could cause some or all of the Index Components to decline in value, or to reduce their\ndistributions, during the term\nof the New Notes.\n\nAn investment in the New Notes is subject to\nrisks associated with mid-size and small capitalization stocks.\n\nMid-size and small capitalization companies may be\nless able to withstand adverse economic, market, trade and competitive conditions relative to larger\ncompanies. Mid-size and small capitalization\ncompanies are less likely to pay dividends on their stocks, and the presence of a dividend payment could be\na factor that limits downward\nstock price pressure under adverse market conditions.\n\nThe Index Calculation Agent may, in its sole\ndiscretion, discontinue the public disclosure of the intraday level of the Index.\n\nThe Index Calculation Agent is not under any obligation\nto continue to calculate the intraday level of the Index or required to calculate similar levels for any\nsuccessor index. If the Index\nCalculation Agent discontinues such public disclosure, we may not be able to provide the intraday levels\nrelated to the Index required\nto maintain any listing of the New Notes on NYSE Arca. If the New Notes become delisted, the liquidity of\nthe market for the New Notes\nmay be materially and adversely affected and you may sustain significant losses if you sell your New Notes\nin the secondary market.\n                                                     33                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                              Use of Proceeds                                               \nWe will not receive any cash proceeds from the\nExchange Offer.\n                                                     34                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                             The Exchange Offer                                             \nPurpose of the Exchange Offer\n\nWe are conducting the Exchange Offer to give existing\nholders of the Old Notes, which will mature on May 24, 2024, an opportunity to exchange their Old Notes for\nnotes providing similar exposure\nto the Alerian MLP Index, which will mature on January 28, 2044.\n\nTerms of the Exchange Offer\n\nGeneral\n\nWe are offering to exchange any and all outstanding\nOld Notes for New Notes based on the Exchange Ratio, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth\nin this prospectus.\n\nOld Notes accepted by us pursuant to the Exchange\nOffer will be immediately cancelled. Old Notes that have not been validly tendered and/or accepted for\nexchange pursuant to the Exchange\nOffer will remain outstanding after the Settlement Date and will mature on May 24, 2024 in accordance with\ntheir terms. The payment a\nNoteholder will be entitled to receive at maturity, subject to any earlier repurchase, will be based on the\naverage VWAP Level (as defined\nherein) of the Index over a five-day measurement period near the maturity date of the Old Notes.\n\nUnder the terms of the Old Notes, we are required\nto accept the Old Notes for repurchase, subject to compliance with the requirements and procedures set out\nin the terms of the Old Notes,\nincluding the requirement that a Noteholder request repurchase of a minimum of 50,000 Old Notes.

Accordingly, Noteholders may choose to avail\nthemselves of this\nrepurchase right instead of tendering their Old Notes in the Exchange Offer. The payment a Noteholder will\nbe entitled to receive upon\nearly repurchase will be based on the average VWAP Level of the Index over a five-day measurement period\nthat begins after a repurchase\nrequest is received.

A tendering Noteholder will receive a cash amount on the Settlement Date in lieu of\nany fractional New Notes,\ncalculated using the Daily Closing Intrinsic Note Value (as defined herein) of the New Notes on the\nExpiration Date as published on Bloomberg\nunder the ticker symbol \u201cAMJBVWAP.\u201d We will calculate cash amounts in lieu of\n                                                     35                                                     \nany fractional\nNew Notes payable in respect of the Old Notes, and our calculations will be final and binding absent\nmanifest error.\n\nMinimum Denomination\n\nBook-entry interests in the New Notes will be issued\nin minimum denominations equal to the Principal Amount and in integral multiples thereof.\n\nExchange Offer Period\n\nThe Exchange Offer commences on ,\n2024 and will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on ,\n2024, unless extended or early terminated by us, in which case notification to that effect will be given by\nus or on our behalf in accordance\nwith the methods set out in \u201c\u2014 Announcements\u201d below.\n\nConditions of the Exchange Offer\n\nWe will not be required to accept for exchange,\nor to issue New Notes or pay any cash amount in lieu of any fractional New Notes, pursuant to the Exchange\nOffer unless the conditions\nof the Exchange Offer are satisfied or waived.

In addition, we may\nreject tenders of Old Notes that we consider in our sole and absolute discretion not to have been validly\ntendered in the Exchange Offer\nand we are under no obligation to any relevant Noteholder to furnish any reason or justification for\nrefusing to accept such tenders.\nFor example, tenders of Old Notes may be rejected and not accepted and may be treated as not having been\nvalidly tendered in the Exchange Offer if any such tender does not comply with the requirements of a\nparticular jurisdiction.\n\nHowever, we will at any time have the sole and\nabsolute discretion to accept for exchange any Old Notes tendered in the Exchange Offer, the tender of which\nwould otherwise be invalid\nor, in our sole opinion, may otherwise be invalid. Noteholders are also advised that we may, in our sole and\nabsolute discretion, accept\ntenders of Old Notes for exchange pursuant to the Exchange Offer on more than one date if the Exchange Offer\nis extended or re-opened.\nSubject only as aforesaid, the acceptance of Old Notes validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the\nExchange Offer by us will\nbe irrevocable and once accepted the Exchange Offer will constitute binding obligations of the submitting\nNoteholders and ours to settle\nthe Exchange Offer.\n\nAlthough we have no present plans to do so, we\nexpressly reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to extend, withdraw, terminate or amend\nthe Exchange Offer even if all\nthe conditions to the Exchange Offer are satisfied. In addition, we expressly reserve the right, at any time\nor at various times, to waive\nany conditions to the Exchange Offer, in whole or in part, except as to the requirement that the\nRegistration Statement be declared effective,\nwhich condition we cannot waive. We will give oral or written notice (with any oral notice to be promptly\nconfirmed in writing) of any\nextension, amendment, non-acceptance, termination or waiver to the Exchange Agent as promptly as\npracticable, followed by a timely public\nannouncement.\n\nThese conditions are for our sole benefit, and\nwe may assert them regardless of the circumstances that may give rise to them, or waive them in whole or in\npart, at any or at various\ntimes in our sole discretion. If we fail at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights, this failure\nwill not constitute a waiver\nof such right. Each such right will be deemed an ongoing right that we may assert at any time or at various\ntimes. Any determination made\nby us concerning an event, development or circumstance described or referred to above will be conclusive and\nbinding.\n\nIn addition, as described below under \u201c\u2014\nExtension, Withdrawal, Termination and Amendment,\u201d subject to applicable law, we may in our absolute\ndiscretion terminate\nthe Exchange Offer for any reason even if all the conditions to the Exchange Offer are satisfied.\n\nExtension, Withdrawal, Termination and Amendment\n\nWe reserve the right to extend the Expiration Deadline\nfor the Exchange Offer, and delay acceptance for exchange of the Old Notes tendered in the Exchange Offer,\nby giving oral or written notice\nto the\n                                                     37                                                     \nExchange Agent and by a public announcement no later\nthan 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the next business day after the previously scheduled Expiration Date.\nDuring any such extension,\nall Old Notes you have previously tendered in the Exchange Offer will remain subject to the Exchange Offer\nand subject to your right to\nwithdraw in accordance with the Exchange Offer.\n\nWe reserve the right, regardless of whether or\nnot the conditions to the Exchange Offer have been satisfied but subject to applicable law, to withdraw or\nterminate the Exchange Offer\nprior to the Expiration Deadline or to amend it in any respect. If we withdraw, terminate or amend the\nExchange Offer, we will notify\nthe Exchange Agent by oral or written notice and will issue a timely public announcement regarding the\nwithdrawal, termination or amendment.\nUpon withdrawal or termination of the Exchange Offer for any reason, any Old Notes previously tendered in\nthe Exchange Offer will be promptly\nreturned to the tendering Noteholders.\n\nIf we make a material change in the terms of the\nExchange Offer or the information concerning the Exchange Offer, or waive a material condition of the\nExchange Offer, we will promptly\ndisseminate disclosure regarding the change or waiver, and extend the Exchange Offer, if required by law, so\nthat the Exchange Offer remains\nopen for a minimum of five (5) business days from the date we disseminate that disclosure.\n\nWe may amend the consideration offered in the Exchange\nOffer no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on\n, 2024 without extending the Expiration Deadline. If we make any such amendment after 5:00 p.m., New York\nCity time, on\n, 2024, we will extend the Exchange Offer, if required by law, so that the Exchange Offer remains open a\nminimum of ten (10) business\ndays from the date we disseminate that disclosure. If we make any such amendment, we will promptly\ndisseminate disclosure regarding the\nchange through a supplement to this prospectus.\n\nUntil we announce whether we have decided to accept\nvalid tenders of Old Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offer, no assurance can be given that the Exchange Offer\nwill be completed. This may\ndepend upon the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions of the Exchange Offer. In addition, subject to\napplicable law and as provided\nin this prospectus, we may, in our sole and absolute discretion, extend, withdraw, terminate or amend the\nExchange Offer or amend or waive\nany of the terms and conditions of the Exchange Offer at any time before such announcement and may, in our\nsole and absolute discretion,\nwaive any of the conditions of the Exchange Offer either before or after such announcement. In addition, we\nreserve the right to extend,\nwithdraw, terminate or amend the Exchange Offer at any time and for any reason.\n\nWe also reserve the right at any time or from time\nto time during, or following completion or cancellation of, the Exchange Offer to purchase or exchange or\noffer to purchase or exchange\nOld Notes or to issue an invitation to submit offers to sell Old Notes (including, without limitation, those\noffered pursuant to the Exchange\nOffer but not accepted for exchange), in each case on terms that may be more or less favorable than those\ncontemplated by the Exchange\nOffer. The making of any such new offer and the issuance of any new offer to purchase will depend on various\nfactors, including the aggregate\nprincipal amount of Old Notes exchanged pursuant to the Exchange Offer.\n\nProcedures for Tendering Old Notes\n\nNoteholders that need assistance with respect to the procedures for participating in the Exchange Offer\nshould contact the Dealer Manager, the contact details for whom are on the back cover of this prospectus.\n\nGeneral\n\nWe will accept tenders of Old Notes in the Exchange\nOffer only by way of the submission of valid Exchange Instructions in accordance with the procedures set out\nin this section.\n\nWe are not providing for guaranteed delivery procedures and therefore you must allow sufficient time for the\nnecessary tender procedures to be completed at or prior to the Expiration Deadline. Tenders not completed at\nor prior to the Expiration Deadline will be disregarded and of no effect.\n                                                     38                                                     \nBy submitting a tender with respect to Old Notes,\nNoteholders are deemed to make certain acknowledgments, representations, warranties and undertakings to us,\nthe Dealer Manager and the\nExchange Agent as set forth under \u201c\u2014 Noteholder Representations\u201d below.\n\nOnly a DTC Participant can properly instruct DTC\nwith regard to submitting Exchange Instructions. In so instructing, the DTC Participant, and the tendering\nNoteholder on whose behalf\nit is acting, will be deemed to have read and agreed to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Exchange\nOffer contained in this prospectus.\nEach DTC Participant will be deemed to consent to having DTC provide details concerning such DTC\nParticipant\u2019s identity to the Exchange\nAgent (and for the Exchange Agent to provide such details to us and the Dealer Manager, and their respective\nlegal advisers).\n\nThe tendering of Old Notes in the Exchange Offer\nwill be deemed to have occurred upon receipt by the Exchange Agent via DTC of a valid Exchange Instruction\nsubmitted in accordance with\nthe requirements of DTC. It is the responsibility of Noteholders to validly tender their Old Notes. We have\nthe right to waive any defects.\nHowever, we are not required to waive defects and are not required to notify a Noteholder of defects in\ntheir tender. We also reserve\nthe absolute right to waive any defect, irregularity or delay in respect of particular Old Notes, whether or\nnot we elect to waive similar\ndefects, irregularities or any delay in respect of other Old Notes.\n\nExchange Instructions must be submitted in respect\nof a principal amount of Old Notes of no less than their minimum denomination of $19.03661 and integral\nmultiples of $19.03661 thereafter.\n\nIf any custodial entity submits an offer aggregating\nmultiple instructions from Noteholders, such custodial entity will be responsible for ensuring that any New\nNotes and any cash amounts\nin lieu of any fractional New Notes are allocated to such Noteholders\u2019 accounts pursuant to the Exchange\nOffer.\n\nAn Exchange Instruction may be revoked only by\na Noteholder, or the relevant DTC Participant on its behalf, in the limited circumstances and in the manner\ndescribed in \u201c\u2014 Revocation Rights.\u201d\n\nHow to Tender If You Are a Beneficial Owner but Not a DTC Participant\n\nIf a Noteholder holds its Old Notes through a custodian\nor other Intermediary, such Noteholder may not submit an Exchange Instruction directly. It should therefore\ncontact its custodian or other\nIntermediary to instruct its custodian or Intermediary to submit an Exchange Instruction on its behalf. In\nthe event that the relevant\ncustodian or Intermediary is unable to submit an Exchange Instruction on its behalf by one of the methods\ndescribed herein, the Noteholder\nshould contact the Exchange Agent for assistance in submitting its Exchange Instruction. There can be no\nassurance that the Exchange Agent\nwill be able to assist any such Noteholders in successfully submitting an Exchange Instruction.\n\nNoteholders are advised to check with any bank,\nsecurities broker or other Intermediary through which they hold Old Notes when such Intermediary would\nrequire to receive instructions\nfrom a Noteholder in order for that Noteholder to be able to participate in, or revoke their instruction to\nparticipate in, the Exchange\nOffer before the deadlines specified in this prospectus. The deadlines set by any such Intermediary and DTC\nfor the submission of Exchange Instructions may be earlier than the relevant deadlines specified in this\nprospectus.\n\nOnly DTC Participants may submit Exchange Instructions. Each Noteholder that is not a DTC Participant must\narrange for the DTC Participant through which it holds the relevant Old Notes to submit an Exchange\nInstruction on its behalf to DTC by the deadlines specified by DTC.\n\nBecause the Exchange Offer will expire at 5:00\np.m., New York City time, on\n, 2024 (unless extended or early terminated by us), Noteholders who hold their Old Notes through a custodian\nor other Intermediary and\nwho intend to tender their Old Notes on the Expiration Date should allow sufficient time for completion of\nthe ATOP procedures before\n5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Expiration Date.\n                                                     39                                                     \nHow to Tender if You Are a DTC Participant\n\nTo participate in the Exchange Offer, a DTC Participant\nmust comply with the ATOP procedures of DTC described below.\n\nProcedures for Tender of Old Notes Held through DTC\u2019s\nATOP\n\nAny Noteholder who holds Old Notes through DTC\nmust arrange for a DTC Participant in DTC to electronically transmit the Noteholder\u2019s Exchange Instruction\nthrough DTC\u2019s ATOP\nsystem, for which the Exchange Offer will be eligible. Accordingly, a DTC Participant whose name appears on\nthe security position listing\nas the holder of the Old Notes must electronically transmit its acceptance of the Exchange Offer by causing\nDTC to irrevocably transfer\nOld Notes in the participant\u2019s account to the Exchange Agent\u2019s account at DTC in accordance with DTC\u2019s ATOP\nprocedures.\nDTC will then send an agent\u2019s message (as defined below) to the Exchange Agent.\n\nAn \u201cagent\u2019s message\u201d is a message,\ntransmitted by DTC, received by the Exchange Agent and forming part of the book-entry confirmation, which\nstates that DTC has received\nan express acknowledgment from the tendering participant that such participant has received this prospectus\nand agrees to be bound by\nthe terms of the Exchange Offer, and that the Issuer may enforce the terms of the Exchange Offer against\nsuch participant.\n\nAlthough transfer of the Old Notes to the Exchange\nAgent\u2019s account at DTC may be effected through book-entry at DTC, an agent\u2019s message must be transmitted by\nDTC and received\nby the Exchange Agent at or prior to the Expiration Deadline in order to validly tender Old Notes pursuant\nto the Exchange Offer. Old\nNotes tendered through DTC\u2019s ATOP system will be held to the order of the Exchange Agent until the earlier\nof the time of settlement\non the Settlement Date, or the termination of the Exchange Offer (if applicable). Such Old Notes will be\nreleased after the Exchange Offer\nhas expired.\n\nNoteholders who intend to tender their Old Notes\non the Expiration Date should allow sufficient time for completion of the ATOP procedures before 5:00 p.m.,\nNew York City time, on the\nExpiration Date.\n\nAll tenders submitted through DTC\u2019s ATOP system must be submitted in accordance with the deadlines and\nprocedures established by DTC and an agent\u2019s message with respect to any tender must be received by the\nExchange Agent at or prior to the Expiration Deadline.\n\nThere are no letters of transmittal for the Exchange\nOffer. Noteholders who hold Old Notes through DTC must tender their Old Notes through DTC\u2019s ATOP procedures.\n\nTenders and instructions other than in accordance\nwith the procedures set out in this section will not be accepted.\n\nWe will only accept tenders of Old Notes in the\nExchange Offer by way of the submission of valid Exchange Instructions in accordance with the procedures set\nout in this section. It is\nalso each Noteholder\u2019s responsibility to inform itself of, and arrange for timely tender of its Old Notes in\naccordance with, DTC\u2019s\nprocedures and deadlines.\n\nIrregularities\n\nAll questions as to the validity, form and eligibility\n(including time of receipt) of any Exchange Instruction or as to the revocation of any Exchange Instruction\nwill be determined by us,\nin our sole and absolute discretion, and such determination will be final and binding.\n\nWe reserve the absolute right to reject any and\nall Exchange Instructions, or revocation instructions not in proper form or in respect of which the\nacceptance by us may be unlawful.\nWe also reserve the absolute right to waive any defects, irregularities or delay in the submission of any\nand all Exchange Instructions\nor revocation instructions. We also reserve the absolute right to waive any such defect, irregularity or\ndelay in respect of particular\nOld Notes, whether or not we elect to waive similar defects, irregularities or any delay in respect of other\nOld Notes.\n                                                     40                                                     \nAny defect, irregularity or delay must be cured\nwithin such time as we determine, unless waived by us. Exchange Instructions will be deemed not to have been\nmade until such defects,\nirregularities or delays have been cured or waived. None of us, the Dealer Manager or the Exchange Agent\nshall be under any duty to give\nnotice to a Noteholder of any defects, irregularities or delays in the receipt or non-receipt of any\nExchange Instruction or revocation\ninstructions nor shall any of them incur any liability for failure to give such notice.\n\nDetermination of Validity\n\nAll questions as to the form of all documents and\nthe validity (including time of receipt) and acceptance of tenders and withdrawals of Old Notes will be\ndetermined by us, in our sole\ndiscretion, which determination shall be final and binding. Alternative, conditional or contingent tenders\nwill not be considered valid.\nWe reserve the absolute right to reject any or all tenders of Old Notes that we determine are not in proper\nform or not properly tendered\nor the acceptance of which would, in our opinion, be unlawful. We also reserve the right to waive any\ndefects, irregularities or conditions\nof tender as to particular Old Notes. A waiver of any defect or irregularity with respect to the tender of\none Old Note shall not constitute\na waiver of the same or any other defect or irregularity with respect to the tender of any other Old Notes\nexcept to the extent we may\notherwise so provide. Our interpretations of the terms and conditions of the Exchange Offer, including the\nterms and instructions in any\nExchange Instruction, will be final and binding. Tenders of Old Notes shall not be deemed to have been made\nuntil any defects or irregularities\nhave been waived by us or cured. None of us, the Trustee, the Dealer Manager, the Exchange Agent or any\nother person will be under any\nduty to give notice of any defects or irregularities in tenders of Old Notes, or will incur any liability to\nyou for failure to give any\nsuch notice.\n\nAcceptance of Old Notes for Exchange; Delivery of New Notes\n\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions of\nthe Exchange Offer, we will accept for exchange, and promptly deliver the New Notes and any cash amounts in\nlieu of any fractional New\nNotes in exchange for, validly tendered Old Notes that were not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Exchange\nOffer.\n\nFor purposes of the Exchange Offer, we will be\ndeemed to have accepted Old Notes for exchange if, as and when we give oral (promptly confirmed in writing)\nor written notice thereof\nto the Exchange Agent.\n\nWe will deliver New Notes and any cash amounts\nin lieu of any fractional New Notes in exchange for Old Notes accepted for exchange in the Exchange Offer\nafter the Expiration Deadline,\nby delivering the New Notes and paying any cash amounts in lieu of any fractional New Notes on the\nSettlement Date to the DTC accounts\nin which the relevant Old Notes are held. The delivery of such New Notes and payment of such cash amounts in\nlieu of any fractional New\nNotes to DTC will discharge our obligation to all such tendering Noteholders in respect of the delivery of\nthe New Notes and payment of\nany cash amounts in lieu of any fractional New Notes.\n\nRevocation Rights\n\nOld Notes tendered before the Expiration Deadline\nmay be validly revoked at any time at or before the Expiration Deadline. If the Exchange Offer is extended,\nOld Notes subject to the Exchange\nOffer may be validly revoked at any time before the new Expiration Deadline of the extended Exchange Offer.\nIf the Exchange Offer is terminated,\nthe Old Notes tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer will be promptly returned to the tendering\nNoteholders.\n\nFor a revocation of a tender of Old Notes to be\neffective, a valid electronic revocation instruction must be provided to DTC at or before the Expiration\nDeadline. Any such instruction\nmust specify the Old Notes to which the original Exchange Instruction related, the securities account to\nwhich such Old Notes are credited\nand any other information required under DTC\u2019s ATOP procedures. Noteholders who hold their Old Notes through\na custodian or other\nIntermediary and who intend to revoke their tender on the Expiration Date should allow sufficient time for\ncompletion of the ATOP procedures\nbefore 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Expiration Date.\n\nRevocation of a tender of Old Notes can only be\naccomplished in accordance with the foregoing procedures. Any permitted revocation may not be rescinded.

(\u201cFINRA\u201d) because JPMorgan Chase & Co. owns, directly or indirectly, all of the\noutstanding\nequity securities of JPMS and because JPMS and JPMorgan Financial are under common control by JPMorgan Chase\n& Co. Consequently, this\noffering is being conducted in compliance with the provisions of FINRA Rule 5121 (or any successor rule\nthereto) regarding a FINRA member\nfirm\u2019s participation in a public\n                                                     45                                                     \noffering of securities of an affiliate.

We will pay the Exchange Agent reasonable and customary fees\nfor its services and will reimburse\nit for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nBrokerage Commissions\n\nNoteholders that tender their Old Notes to the\nExchange Agent do not have to pay a brokerage fee or commission to us, the Dealer Manager or the Exchange\nAgent in connection with the\ntender of such securities. However, if a tendering Noteholder handles the transaction through an\nIntermediary, that Noteholder may be\nrequired to pay such Intermediary brokerage fees or commissions.\n\nFees and Expenses\n\nThe expenses of soliciting tenders with respect\nto the Old Notes will be borne by us. Any charges, costs and expenses incurred by Noteholders or any\nIntermediary in connection with the\nExchange Offer shall be borne by such Noteholder. No brokerage costs are being levied by the Dealer Manager\nor the Exchange Agent. Noteholders\nshould check whether their brokers or custodians will charge any fees.\n\nAnnouncements\n\nUnless stated otherwise, announcements in connection\nwith the Exchange Offer will be made by publication through the delivery of notices to DTC for communication\nto DTC Participants and the\nissue of a press release to one or more recognized financial news services selected by us.

If you tender\nyour Old Notes, you may ultimately receive less value than if you choose to keep them. The value of the New\nNotes to be issued in the\nExchange Offer may not equal or exceed the value of the Old Notes tendered. You must make your own\nindependent decision regarding your\nparticipation in the Exchange Offer. See \u201cRisk Factors \u2014 Risks Relating to the Exchange Offer\u2014 We have not\nobtained a third-party determination that the Exchange Offer is fair to Noteholders.\u201d\n                                                     46                                                     \nCertain Matters Relating to Non-U.S. Jurisdictions\n\nThis prospectus is not an offer to sell or exchange\nand it is not a solicitation of an offer to buy or exchange securities in any jurisdiction in which such\noffer, sale, purchase or exchange\nis not permitted. Countries outside the United States generally have their own legal requirements that\ngovern securities offerings made\nto persons resident in those countries and often impose stringent requirements about the form and content of\noffers made to the general\npublic. We have not taken any action under those non-U.S. regulations to facilitate a public offer to\nexchange outside the United States.\nTherefore, the ability of any non-U.S. Noteholder to tender Old Notes in the Exchange Offer will depend on\nwhether there is an exemption\navailable under the laws of such person\u2019s home country that would permit the person to participate in the\nExchange Offer without\nthe need for us to take any action to facilitate a public offering in that country or otherwise. For\nexample, some countries exempt transactions\nfrom the rules governing public offerings if they involve persons who meet certain eligibility requirements\nrelating to their status as\nsophisticated or professional investors. Non-U.S. Noteholders should consult their advisers in considering\nwhether they may participate\nin the Exchange Offer in accordance with the laws of their home countries and, if they do participate,\nwhether there are any restrictions\nor limitations on transactions in the New Notes that may apply in their home countries. None of us, JPMorgan\nChase & Co., the Trustee,\nthe Dealer Manager or the Exchange Agent can provide any assurance as to whether such limitations may exist.\n\nProhibition of sales to UK retail investors\n\nThe New Notes are not intended to be offered, sold\nor otherwise made available to, and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to, any retail\ninvestor in the United Kingdom\n(the \u201cUK\u201d). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail\nclient, as defined\nin point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of\nthe European Union (Withdrawal)\nAct 2018 (as amended, the \u201cEUWA\u201d); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial\nServices and Markets\nAct 2000 (as amended, the \u201cFSMA\u201d) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive\n(EU) 2016/97, where\nthat customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of\nRegulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it\nforms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (as amended, the \u201cUK Prospectus Regulation\u201d); or (iii)\nnot a qualified\ninvestor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue\nof the EUWA. Consequently,\nno key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by\nvirtue of the EUWA (as amended,\nthe \u201cUK PRIIPs Regulation\u201d) for offering or selling the New Notes or otherwise making them available to\nretail investors in\nthe UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the New Notes or otherwise making them available\nto any retail investor in\nthe UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, if we subsequently prepare\nand publish a key information document under the UK PRIIPs Regulation in respect of the New Notes, then the\nprohibition on the offering,\nsale or otherwise making available the New Notes to a retail investor as described above shall no longer\napply.\n\nProhibition of sales to EEA retail investors\n\nThe New Notes are not intended to be offered, sold\nor otherwise made available to, and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to, any retail\ninvestor in the European Economic\nArea (the \u201cEEA\u201d). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail\nclient as defined\nin point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, \u201cMiFID II\u201d); (ii) a customer within the\nmeaning of Directive\n(EU) 2016/97, as amended, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point\n(10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID\nII; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended the \u201cEU Prospectus\nRegulation\u201d).\nConsequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the \u201cEU\nPRIIPs Regulation\u201d)\nfor offering or selling the New Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has\nbeen prepared and therefore\noffering or selling such New Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may\nbe unlawful under the EU PRIIPs\nRegulation.\n                                                     47                                                     \nNotwithstanding the above, if we subsequently prepare\nand publish a key information document under the EU PRIIPs Regulation in respect of the New Notes, then the\nprohibition on the offering,\nsale or otherwise making available the New Notes to a retail investor as described above shall no longer\napply.\n                                                     48                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                             Description of the                                             \n                                                 New Notes                                                  \nThe New Notes do not guarantee any return of principal at or prior to maturity and do not pay fixed interest\nduring their term. Instead, the return on the New Notes is linked to the performance of the Alerian MLP\nIndex \u00ae(the \u201cIndex\u201d), as measured by its VWAP level, and to cash distributions on its components, subject to\nthe deduction of an investor fee and, if applicable, a repurchase fee.\n\nThe Index measures the composite performance of energy-oriented Master Limited Partnerships (\"MLPs\") that\nearn the majority of their cash flows from qualified activities involving energy commodities using a capped,\nfloat-adjusted, capitalization-weighted methodology. MLPs are limited partnerships primarily engaged in the\nexploration, marketing, mining, processing, production, refining, storage or transportation of any mineral\nor natural resource.\n\nThe New Notes may not be suitable for all investors and should be used only by investors with the\nsophistication and knowledge necessary to understand the risks inherent in the Index and investments in MLPs\ngenerally. Because the investor fee reduces the amount of any coupon payments, and because any investor fee\nshortfall and, in the case of early repurchase, the repurchase fee reduce the amount of your return at\nmaturity or upon early repurchase or redemption, the aggregate payments on your notes will be less than your\ninitial investment if any coupon payments are insufficient to offset any decrease in the VWAP level of the\nIndex and the negative effect of the investor fee and, in the case of early repurchase, the repurchase fee.\n\nYou may lose some or all of your initial investment at maturity or upon early repurchase or redemption. You\nare not guaranteed any coupon payments. Any payment on the New Notes at or prior to maturity, including any\nrepayment of principal, is subject to the credit risk of JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC, as issuer of\nthe New Notes, and JPMorgan Chase & Co., as guarantor of the New Notes.\n\nAbout the New Notes\n\nThe New Notes will be issued under an indenture\ndated as of February 19, 2016 among JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC, as issuer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.,\nas guarantor, and Deutsche\nBank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (as may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the\n\u201cIndenture\u201d), which is an\nexhibit to the Registration Statement of which this prospectus is a part.\n\nThe New Notes are part of a series of debt securities\nentitled \u201cGlobal Medium-Term Notes, Series A\u201d (the \u201cdebt securities\u201d) that we may issue under the Indenture\nfrom\ntime to time.\n\nWe have summarized below the material provisions\nof the Indenture and the debt securities and guarantees issued under the Indenture. These descriptions are\nonly summaries, and each investor\nshould refer to the Indenture, which describes completely the terms and definitions summarized below and\ncontains additional information\nregarding the debt securities issued under it. Where appropriate, we use parentheses to refer you to the\nparticular sections of the Indenture.\nAny reference to particular sections or defined terms of the Indenture in any statement under this heading\nqualifies the entire statement\nand incorporates by reference the applicable section or definition into that statement.\n\nThe New Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated\nobligations of JPMorgan Financial, the payment of which is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by JPMorgan\nChase & Co. (the \u201cGuarantor\u201d).\nThe New Notes will rank pari passuwith all of JPMorgan Financial\u2019s other unsecured and unsubordinated\nobligations. JPMorgan\nChase & Co.\u2019s guarantee of the New Notes will rank pari passuwith all of JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s other\nunsecured\nand unsubordinated obligations. Any payment on the New Notes is subject to the credit risk of JPMorgan\nFinancial, as issuer of the New Notes, and JPMorgan Chase & Co., as guarantor of the New Notes.\n\nThe Guarantor is a holding company that holds the\nstock of JPMorgan Chase & Co. Bank, National Association (the \u201cBank\u201d), and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Holdings LLC\n(the\n\u201cIHC\u201d), its \u201cintermediate holding company.\u201d The Guarantor conducts substantially all of its operations\nthrough\nsubsidiaries, including the Bank and the IHC. As a result, claims of the holders of the debt securities\nagainst the Guarantor under the\nguarantee will generally have a junior position to claims of creditors of the Guarantor\u2019s subsidiaries.\n                                                     49                                                     \nClaims of the Guarantor\u2019s subsidiaries\u2019 creditors other\nthan the Guarantor include substantial amounts of deposit liabilities, long-term debt and other liabilities.\nIn addition, the Guarantor\nis obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds that the Guarantor receives from\nthe issuance of securities (including\nthe New Notes), and the ability of the Bank and the IHC to make payments to the Guarantor is limited. As a\nresult of these arrangements,\nthe Guarantor\u2019s ability to make various payments is dependent on its receiving dividends from the Bank and\ndividends and extensions\nof credit from the IHC. These limitations could affect the Guarantor\u2019s ability to pay interest on its debt\nsecurities, redeem or\nrepurchase outstanding securities and fulfill its other payment obligations, including payment obligations\nunder the guarantees of our\ndebt securities.\n\nThe Indenture does not limit the aggregate principal\namount of debt securities that may be issued under it and provides that debt securities may be issued up to\nthe principal amount authorized\nby us from time to time. We have previously established the Series A medium-term notes under the Indenture.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we\nhad approximately $32 billion aggregate principal amount of Series A medium-term notes outstanding under the\nIndenture. Our board of managers\nhas authorized the issuance of New Notes under the registration statement to which this prospectus relates\nin such amounts as may be required\nto permit all outstanding Old Notes not held by JPMorgan Financial or its affiliates to be exchanged for New\nNotes. Our board of managers\nhas also authorized the issuance of securities, including Series A medium-term notes, under certain shelf\nregistration statements with\nan aggregate initial public offering price not to exceed $130 billion, to be issued on or after February 17,\n2023.\n\nThe Indenture allows us to reopen a previous issue\nof a series of debt securities and issue additional debt securities of that issue. We may, in our sole\ndiscretion and without providing\nholders notice or obtaining their consent, issue and sell additional securities having the same terms and\nconditions as the New Notes.\nWe have no obligation to take your interests into account when deciding whether to issue additional debt\nsecurities. In addition, we are\nunder no obligation to reopen the New Notes or to issue any additional New Notes.\n\nWe will irrevocably deposit with DTC no later than\nthe opening of business on the applicable date or dates funds sufficient to make payments of the amount, if\nany, payable with respect\nto the New Notes on any date or dates. We will give DTC irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the\napplicable amount to the holders\nof the New Notes entitled thereto.\n\nSubject to applicable law (including, without limitation,\nU.S. federal laws), we or our affiliates may, at any time and from time to time, purchase outstanding New\nNotes by tender, in the open\nmarket or by private agreement.\n\nThe New Notes are not bank deposits, are not insured\nby the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency and are not obligations of, or\nguaranteed by, a bank.\n\nKey Terms of the New Notes\n\nGeneral\n\nIssuer:JPMorgan Chase Financial\nCompany LLC, an indirect, wholly owned finance subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nGuarantor: JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nPrincipal Amount: $\nper New Note (equal to the Initial VWAP Level divided by ten, rounded to the nearest cent)\n\nIndex: The return on the New Notes\nis linked to the performance of the Alerian MLP Index (Bloomberg ticker: AMZ), which we refer to as the\nIndex, as measured\nby its VWAP level, and to cash distributions on its components. See \u201c\u2014 Terms Relating to Closing Intrinsic\nNote Value \u2014 VWAP Level\u201dbelow.\n\nThe Index measures the composite performance of\nenergy-oriented Master Limited Partnerships, or MLPs, that earn the majority of their cash flows from\nqualified activities involving energy\ncommodities (the\n                                                     50                                                     \n\u201cIndex\nComponents\u201d) using a capped, float-adjusted, capitalization-weighted methodology. The Index is calculated\nand maintained by VettaFi\nLLC (\u201cVettaFi\u201d).\n\nCoupon Payments:For each New Note\nyou hold on a Coupon Record Date, you will receive on the immediately following Coupon Payment Date an\namount in cash equal to the Coupon\nAmount, if any, as of the immediately preceding Coupon Valuation Date.\n\nCoupon Amount:The Coupon Amount\nas of any Coupon Valuation Date will equal:\n                                                                                    \n  \u00b7  the Reference Distribution Amount with respect to that Coupon Valuation Date,  \n     minus                                                                          \n                                                                                    \n                                                                           \n  \u00b7  the Accrued Investor Fee with respect to that Coupon Valuation Date,  \n                                                                           \nprovided that the Coupon Amount will not be less than $0.\n\nIf the Reference Distribution Amount on a Coupon\nValuation Date is less than the Accrued Investor Fee on that Coupon Valuation Date, an amount equal to the\nexcess of the Accrued Investor\nFee over the Reference Distribution Amount (the \u201cInvestor Fee Shortfall\u201d) will be included in the Accrued\nInvestor Fee with\nrespect to the next Coupon Valuation Date.\n\nThe Accrued Investor Fee will reduce each Coupon Amount. In addition, no Coupon Payment will be payable with\nrespect to a Coupon Valuation Date if the Reference Distribution Amount is less than the Accrued Investor\nFee, even if that Reference Distribution Amount is positive. You are not guaranteed any Coupon Payments.\n\nThe Coupon Amount is subject to adjustment in the\nevent of a split or reverse split of the New Notes as described under \u201c\u2014 Split or Reverse Split of the New\nNotes\u201d\nbelow.\n\nPayment at Maturity:For each New\nNote, unless earlier repurchased or redeemed, you will receive at maturity a cash payment equal to the\nClosing Intrinsic Note Value determined\nover the Measurement Period with respect to the Final Valuation Date. If that amount is less than or equal\nto zero, the payment at maturity\nwill be $0.\n\nIssuer Redemption:On any Business\nDay on or after July 26, 2024, we may, in our sole discretion, redeem the New Notes, in whole or in part. If\nwe exercise our right to\nredeem your New Notes prior to maturity, for each New Note that is redeemed, you will receive on the\nRedemption Settlement Date a cash\npayment equal to the Closing Intrinsic Note Value determined over the Measurement Period with respect to the\nRedemption Valuation Date.\nIf that amount is less than or equal to zero, the payment upon early redemption will be $0.\n\nWeekly Repurchase: On a weekly basis,\nyou may request that we repurchase a minimum of 50,000 New Notes (subject to adjustment in the event of a\nsplit or reverse split of the\nNew Notes) if you comply with the required procedures, subject to a repurchase fee of 0.125%. For each New\nNote that is repurchased, you\nwill receive on the relevant Repurchase Date a cash payment equal to the Closing Intrinsic Note Value\ndetermined over the Measurement\nPeriod with respect to the Repurchase Valuation Date minus the Repurchase Fee Amount with respect to the\nRepurchase Valuation Date.\n\nIf the amount calculated above is less than or\nequal to zero, the payment upon early repurchase will be $0.\n\nTerms Relating to Closing Intrinsic Note Value\n\nClosing Intrinsic Note Value: As\nof any date of determination, an amount per New Note equal to:\n

respect to the Coupon Amount\nas of the immediately preceding Coupon Valuation Date has not yet occurred, the Closing Intrinsic Note Value\nwill also include that Coupon\nAmount (an \u201cUnpaid Coupon Amount\u201d).\n\nFor purposes of determining the Closing Intrinsic\nNote Value over any Measurement Period, the Index Ratio is determined based on the arithmetic average of the\nVWAP Levels over that Measurement\nPeriod, and the date of determination for purposes of determining the Coupon Amount, any Investor Fee\nShortfall and any Unpaid Coupon\nAmount is the final day of that Measurement Period.\n\nThe Closing Intrinsic Note Value is not the closing price or any other trading price of the New Notes in the\nsecondary market and is not intended as a price or quotation, or as an offer or solicitation for the\npurchase or sale of your New Notes or as a recommendation to transact in the New Notes at the stated price.\nThe trading price of the New Notes at any time may vary significantly from the Closing Intrinsic Note Value\ndue to, among other things, imbalances of supply and demand (including as a result of any decision of ours\nto issue, stop issuing or resume issuing additional New Notes), lack of liquidity, transaction costs, credit\nconsiderations and bid-offer spreads.\n\nIf the Reference Distribution Amount used to calculate the Stub Coupon Amount on any Index Business Day is\nless than the Accrued Investor Fee used to calculate that Stub Coupon Amount, the resulting Investor Fee\nShortfall will be deducted in calculating the Closing Intrinsic Note Value on that Index Business Day.\nAccordingly, the payment at maturity or upon early repurchase or redemption will be reduced by the amount of\nany Investor Fee Shortfall reflected in the relevant Closing Intrinsic Note Value.\n\nIndex Ratio: As of any date of determination,\nthe Index Ratio is equal to:\n                                             Initial VWAP Level

Notwithstanding the foregoing, all dollar amounts related to determination of any\npayment on the New Notes per\nnote will be rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth, with five one hundred-thousandths rounded upward (e.g.,\n0.76545 would be rounded up\nto 0.7655), and all dollar amounts payable, if any, on the aggregate principal amount of notes per holder\nwill be rounded to the nearest\ncent, with one-half cent rounded upward.\n\nTrustee: Deutsche Bank Trust Company\nAmericas\n\nDay Count Fraction: With respect\nto each Coupon Valuation Date, the day count fraction is calculated as follows:\n\nwhere:\n                                                                                     \n  \u00b7  \u201cY1\u201d is the year, expressed as a number, in which the first day                 \n     of the Coupon Accrual Period with respect to that Coupon Valuation Date falls;  \n                                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n     \u201cY2\u201d is the year, expressed as a number, in which the day immediately                                  \n  \u00b7  following the last day included in the Coupon Accrual Period with respect to that Coupon Valuation     \n     Date falls;                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                               \n  \u00b7  \u201cM1\u201d is the calendar month, expressed as a number, in which the                           \n     first day of the Coupon Accrual Period with respect to that Coupon Valuation Date falls;  \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n     \u201cM2\u201d is the calendar month, expressed as a number, in which the                                        \n  \u00b7  day immediately following the last day included in the Coupon Accrual Period with respect to that      \n     Coupon Valuation Date falls;                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n     \u201cD1\u201d is the first calendar day, expressed as a number, of the                                          \n  \u00b7  Coupon Accrual Period with respect to that Coupon Valuation Date, unless that number would be 31, in   \n     which case D1 will be 30; and                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n     \u201cD2\u201d is the calendar day, expressed as a number, immediately following                                 \n  \u00b7  the last day included in the Coupon Accrual Period with respect to that Coupon Valuation Date, unless  \n     that number would be 31 and D1 is                                                                      \n     greater than 29, in which case D2 will be 30.                                                          \n                                                                                                            \nSplit or Reverse Split of the New Notes\n\nWe may initiate a split or reverse split of the\nNew Notes at any time. We will determine the ratio of such split or reverse split, as applicable, using\nrelevant market indicia in our\nsole discretion. If we decide to initiate a split or reverse split, as applicable, we will issue a notice to\nholders of the New Notes\nand a press release announcing the split or reverse split and the ratio and specifying the effective date of\nthe split or reverse split,\nwhich will be at least three Business Days after the date on which the split or reverse split, as\napplicable, is announced, which we refer\nto as the \u201cannouncement date.\u201d The record date for a share split or reverse split will be the Business Day\nimmediately preceding\nthe effective date.\n\nIf the New Notes undergo a split or reverse split,\nwe will adjust the terms of the New Notes as may be necessary or desirable to effectuate that split or\nreverse split, as applicable, including,\nwithout limitation, the Principal Amount, any Coupon Amount, the Closing Intrinsic Note Value, the Accrued\nInvestor Fee, the Periodic\nInvestor Fee, the Reference Distribution Amount, the number of shares held by a Reference Holder and the\nminimum number of New Notes you\nmay request that we repurchase. For example, if the New Notes undergo a 4-for-1 split, each New Note holder\nwho holds one note via DTC\nprior to the split will, after the split, hold four New Notes, and the Principal Amount, any Coupon Amount,\nthe Closing Intrinsic Note\nValue, the Accrued Investor Fee, the Periodic Investor Fee, the Reference Distribution Amount and the number\nof shares held by a Reference\nHolder will be adjusted as may be necessary or desirable to equal 1/4 of their respective values that would\nhave prevailed in the absence\nof the 4-for-1 split. In addition, the minimum number of New Notes you may request that we repurchase will\nbe\n                                                     57                                                     \nincreased\nto equal 4 times its prior value. These adjustments may be applied retroactively for purposes of adjusting\nany Coupon Amount that has\nbeen determined but not yet paid.\n\nIn the case of a reverse split, noteholders who\nhold a number of New Notes that is not evenly divisible by the relevant ratio will receive the same\ntreatment as all other noteholders\nfor the maximum number of New Notes they hold that is evenly divisible by the relevant ratio, and we will\nhave the right to compensate\nnoteholders for their remaining or \u201cpartial\u201d New Notes in a manner determined by the Note Calculation Agent\nin its sole discretion.\nOur current intention is to provide holders with a cash payment for their partial New Notes in an amount\nequal to the appropriate percentage\nof the Closing Intrinsic Note Value (which may be calculated using an Index Ratio that reflects the average\nVWAP Level over a measurement\nperiod of five Index Business Days) on a specified Index Business Day no later than 20 Index Business Days\nfollowing the announcement\ndate, with payment to be made on a specified Business Day no later than five Business Days following the\ndate on which the amount of the\npayment is determined.\n\nPostponement of a Payment Date\n\nIn this section, we refer to each Coupon Payment\nDate and the Maturity Date as \u201cPayment Dates.\u201d If any scheduled Payment Date is not a Business Day, then\nthat Payment Date\nwill be the next succeeding Business Day following the scheduled Payment Date. If, due to a market\ndisruption event or otherwise, any\nAveraging Date referenced in the determination of a payment on the New Notes that will or may be payable on\nany Payment Date is postponed\nso that it falls less than three Business Days prior to that scheduled Payment Date, that Payment Date will\nbe the third Business Day\nfollowing the latest such Averaging Date, as postponed. If any Payment Date is adjusted as the result of a\nnon-Business Day, a market\ndisruption event or otherwise, any amount payable on that Payment Date will be made on that Payment Date as\npostponed, with the same force\nand effect as if that Payment Date had not been postponed, but no interest will accrue or be payable as a\nresult of the delayed payment.\n\nPostponement of an Averaging Date\n\nThe Final VWAP Level used to determine the Closing\nIntrinsic Note Value in connection with any payment at maturity or upon early repurchase or redemption will\nreflect the arithmetic average\nof the VWAP Levels on the five Index Business Days in the relevant Measurement Period, and the VWAP Level on\neach Index Business Day is\ncalculated by reference to the VWAP and the Index Units of each Index Component, as well as the Index\nDivisor. In this section, we refer\nto each of the five Index Business Days in a Measurement Period as an \u201cAveraging Date.\u201d As set forth below,\nif any Index Component\nis disrupted on any Averaging Date, determinations with respect to that Index Component for purposes of\ncalculating the VWAP Level applicable\nto that Averaging Date will be postponed. In addition, determinations with respect to that disrupted Index\nComponent for purposes of calculating\nthe VWAP Level applicable to each following Averaging Date will also be postponed so as to avoid using the\nsame VWAP of an Index Component\non a given Index Business Day to calculate the VWAP Levels for more than one Averaging Date.\n\nIf any Averaging Date is an Unavailable Day for\nany Index Component, the VWAP Level on that Averaging Date will be deemed to be the Adjusted VWAP Level with\nrespect to that Averaging\nDate, and that Averaging Date will be postponed to the earliest date on which that Adjusted VWAP Level can\nbe calculated as set forth\nbelow. For the avoidance of doubt, no Averaging Date will be postponed to a date that is after the\napplicable Final Disrupted Averaging\nDate.\n\nThe \u201cAdjusted VWAP Level\u201d with respect\nto an Averaging Date that is an Unavailable Day for any Index Component will be determined by the VWAP\nCalculation Agent and will be calculated\nin accordance with the formula for calculating the VWAP Level, using:\n                                                                                                            \n     with respect to each Index Component for which the originally scheduled Averaging                      \n  \u00b7  Date is not an Unavailable Day, the VWAP and the Index Units of that Index Component, and the Index    \n     Divisor, in each case as of the originally                                                             \n     scheduled Averaging Date;

(Section 5.01)                           \n                                                                                    \nUnless provided otherwise, if an Event of Default\noccurs and is continuing because of a default in the payment of principal, interest or other amounts payable\non the debt securities, a\nfailure in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or agreement applicable to us, the guarantee ceasing\nto be in full force and effect,\nor any other event of default provided in the applicable supplemental indentures to the Indenture or form of\nsecurity, either the trustee\nor the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of such series then\noutstanding, treated as one\nclass, by written notice to us and the Guarantor, may declare the principal of all outstanding debt\nsecurities of such series and any\ninterest accrued thereon, to be due and payable immediately. Unless otherwise specified, if a default due to\nspecified events of our bankruptcy,\ninsolvency, receivership, winding up or liquidation, occurs and is continuing, the principal of all\noutstanding debt securities and any\ninterest accrued thereon will automatically, and without any declaration or other action on the part of the\ntrustee or any holder, become\nimmediately due and payable. Subject to certain conditions such declarations may be annulled and past\ndefaults may be waived by the holders\nof a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of the series affected.\n(Sections 5.01 and 5.10)\n\nEvents of bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution, receivership,\nwinding up or liquidation relating to the Guarantor will not constitute an Event of Default with respect to\nany series of debt securities.\nIn addition, failure by the Guarantor to perform any of its covenants or warranties (other than a payment\ndefault) will not constitute\nan Event of Default with respect to any series of debt securities. Therefore, events of bankruptcy,\nresolution, receivership, insolvency,\nwinding up or liquidation relating to the Guarantor (in the absence of any such event occurring with respect\nto us) will not permit any\nof the debt securities to be declared due and payable and the trustee is not authorized to exercise any\nremedy against us or the Guarantor\nupon the occurrence or continuation of these events with respect to the Guarantor. Instead, even if an event\nof bankruptcy, insolvency,\nresolution, receivership, winding up or liquidation relating to the Guarantor has occurred, the trustee and\nthe holders of debt securities\nof a series will not be able to declare the relevant debt securities to be immediately due and payable\nunless there is an Event of Default\nwith respect to that series as described above, such as our bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, winding up\nor liquidation or a payment\ndefault by us or the Guarantor on the relevant debt securities. The value you receive on any series of debt\nsecurities may be significantly less than what you would have otherwise received had our debt securities\nbeen declared due and payable immediately or the trustee been authorized to exercise any remedy against us\nor the Guarantor upon the occurrence or continuation of these events with respect to the Guarantor.\n\nAn Event of Default with respect to one series\nof debt securities does not necessarily constitute an Event of Default with respect to any other series of\ndebt securities. The Indenture\nrequires the trustee to provide notice of default with respect to the debt securities within 90 days, unless\nthe default is cured, but\nprovides that the trustee may withhold notice to the holders of the debt securities of any default if the\nboard of directors, the executive\ncommittee, or a trust committee of directors or trustees and/or responsible officers of the trustee\ndetermines in good faith that it is\nin the interest of the holders of the debt securities of the applicable series to do so. The trustee may not\nwithhold notice of a default\nin the payment of principal of, interest on or any other amounts due under, such debt securities. (Section\n5.11)\n                                                     61                                                     \nThe Indenture provides that the holders of a majority\nin aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities of each series affected, with all such series\nvoting as a single class, may\ndirect the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee, or\nexercising any trust or power\nconferred on the trustee. The trustee may decline to act if the direction is contrary to law and in certain\nother circumstances set forth\nin the Indenture. (Section 5.09) The trustee is not obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers under\nthe Indenture at the request\nor direction of the holders of debt securities unless the holders offer the trustee security or indemnity\nsatisfactory to it against the\ncosts, expenses and liabilities incurred therein or thereby. (Section 6.02(d))\n\nNo holder of any debt security of any affected\nseries has the right to institute any action for remedy unless such holder has previously given to the\ntrustee written notice of default,\nthe trustee has failed to take action for 60 days after the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate\nprincipal amount of the debt securities\nof each affected series make written request upon the trustee to institute such action and have offered\nreasonable indemnity in connection\nwith the same and the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of each\naffected series (voting as a\nsingle class) have not given direction to the trustee that is inconsistent with the written request referred\nto above. (Section 5.06)\n\nHowever, the right of any holder of a debt security\nor coupon to receive payment of the principal of and interest on that debt security or coupon on or after\nits due date, or to institute\nsuit for the enforcement of any such payment, may not be impaired or affected without the consent of that\nholder. (Section 5.07)\n\nThe Indenture requires us and the Guarantor to\nfile annually with the trustee a written statement as to whether or not we or the Guarantor, as the case may\nbe, have knowledge of a default.\n(Section 3.05)\n\nWe, the Guarantor and certain of their affiliates\nhave a wide range of banking relationships with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas and The Bank of New\nYork Mellon. If an actual or\npotential event of default occurs with respect to any debt securities, the trustee may be considered to have\na conflicting interest for\npurposes of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. In that case, the trustee may be required to resign\nunder the Indenture, and\nwe would be required to appoint a successor trustee. For this purpose, a \u201cpotential\u201d event of default means\nan event that\nwould be an event of default if the requirements for giving us default notice or for the default having to\nexist for a specific period\nof time were disregarded.\n\nCovenant Breach\n\nUnder the Indenture, a \u201cCovenant Breach\u201d\nwould occur with respect to a series of debt securities if we fail to perform or breach any of the covenants\ncontained in the Indenture\n(other than a failure to pay principal or interest on the debt securities) and that failure or breach\ncontinues for 90 days after the\ntrustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities give\nwritten notice of that failure\nor breach. Neither the trustee nor the holders of the debt securities will be entitled to accelerate the\nmaturity of the debt securities\nas a result of any Covenant Breach. If a Covenant Breach or Event of Default with respect to the debt\nsecurities occurs and is continuing,\nthe trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the holders of\nthe debt securities by such\nappropriate judicial proceedings as the trustee deems most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights,\nwhether for the specific\nenforcement of any covenant or agreement in the Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in\nthe Indenture, or to enforce\nany other proper remedy.\n\nDischarge, Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance\n\nThe provisions in the Indenture relating to discharge,\ndefeasance and covenant defeasance are not applicable to the New Notes.\n\nPayment upon an Event of Default\n\nIn case an event of default with respect to the\nNew Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the amount declared due and payable per New Note upon any\nacceleration of the New Notes\nwill be determined by the Note Calculation Agent and will be an amount in cash equal to the amount payable\nat maturity per New Note calculated\nas if the date of acceleration were (a) the final day of the Measurement\n                                                     62                                                     \nPeriod with respect to the Final Valuation Date and (b) the Final Disrupted\nAveraging Date for the final day of the Measurement Period with respect to the Final Valuation Date (if the\ndate of acceleration is a\nDisrupted Day). Under these circumstances, the Measurement Period with respect to the Final Valuation Date\nwill consist of the date of\nacceleration and the four immediately preceding Index Business Days.\n\nThe amount determined as described above will constitute\nthe final payment on the New Notes, and no additional amounts will accrue with respect to the New Notes\nfollowing the date of acceleration.\n\nIf the maturity of the New Notes is accelerated\nbecause of an event of default as described above, we will, or will cause the Note Calculation Agent to,\nprovide written notice to the\ntrustee at its New York office, on which notice the trustee may conclusively rely, and to DTC, as holder of\nthe New Notes, of the cash\namount due with respect to the New Notes as promptly as possible and in no event later than two Business\nDays after the date of acceleration.\n\nModification of the Indenture\n\nThe Indenture contains provisions permitting us,\nthe Guarantor and the trustee to modify the Indenture or the rights of the holders of debt securities,\nincluding the New Notes, with the\nconsent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of each outstanding series\nof debt securities affected\nby the modification. Each holder of an affected debt security must consent to a modification that would:\n                                                                                 \n  \u00b7  extend the final maturity date of the principal of, or of any interest on,  \n     or other amounts payable under any debt security;                           \n                                                                                 \n                                                                                \n  \u00b7  reduce the principal amount of, rate of interest on, or any other amounts  \n     due under any debt security;                                               \n                                                                                \n                                                                                       \n  \u00b7  change the currency or currency unit of payment of any debt security or certain   \n     provisions of the Indenture applicable to debt securities in foreign currencies;  \n                                                                                       \n                                                                                     \n  \u00b7  change the method in which amounts of payments of principal, interest or other  \n     amounts are determined on any debt security;                                    \n                                                                                     \n                                                                      \n  \u00b7  reduce any amount payable upon redemption of any debt security;  \n                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n     impair the right of a holder to institute suit for the payment of a debt security                      \n  \u00b7  or, if the debt securities provide, any right of repurchase at the option of the holder of a debt      \n     security;                                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                 \n  \u00b7  reduce the percentage of debt securities of any series, the consent of the  \n     holders of which is required for any modification; or                       \n                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \n     make any change in the guarantee that would adversely affect the holders of                            \n  \u00b7  the debt securities of such series or release the Guarantor from the guarantee other than pursuant to  \n     the terms of the Indenture.

JPMorgan Financial will issue New Notes only in fully registered form as book-entry notes. The New\nNotes will be represented by\none or more permanent global notes deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC and registered in the name of DTC or\nits nominee. These certificates\nname DTC or its nominee as the owner of the New Notes. DTC maintains a computerized system that will reflect\nthe interests held by its\nparticipants in the global notes. An investor\u2019s beneficial interest will be reflected in the records of\nDTC\u2019s direct or indirect\nparticipants through an account maintained by the investor with its broker/dealer, bank, trust company or\nother representative. See \u201cClearance and Settlement\u201d for a further discussion of these matters.\n\nThe New Notes will initially be represented by\na type of global note referred to as a master note. A master note represents multiple securities that may be\nissued at different times\nand that may have different terms. Unless otherwise specified, in connection with each issuance of the New\nNotes, the trustee and/or paying\nagent will, in accordance with instructions from us, make appropriate entries or notations in its records\nrelating to the master note\nrepresenting the New Notes to indicate that the master note evidences the New Notes of that issuance.\n\nReferences to \u201cholders\u201d mean those\nwho own New Notes registered in their own names, on the books that JPMorgan Financial or the paying agent\nmaintain for this purpose, and\nnot those who own beneficial interests in notes registered in street name or in notes issued in book-entry\nform through DTC.\n\nDenominations\n\nBook-entry interests in the New Notes will be issued\nin minimum denominations equal to the Principal Amount and in integral multiples thereof.\n\nRegistrar, Transfer Agent and Paying Agent\n\nPayment of amounts due at maturity on the New Notes\nwill be payable and the transfer of the New Notes will be registrable at the principal corporate trust\noffice of The Bank of New York\nMellon in the City of New York.\n\nThe Bank of New York Mellon or one of its affiliates\nwill act as registrar and transfer agent for the New Notes. The Bank of New York Mellon will also act as\npaying agent for the New Notes\nand may designate additional paying agents.\n\nRegistration of transfers of the New Notes will\nbe effected without charge by or on behalf of The Bank of New York Mellon but upon payment (with the giving\nof such indemnity as The Bank\nof New York Mellon may require) in respect of any tax or other governmental charges that may be imposed in\nrelation to it.\n\nGoverning Law\n\nThe New Notes will be governed by and interpreted\nin accordance with the laws of the State of New York.\n\nReopening Issuances\n\nIn our sole discretion, and without providing you\nnotice or obtaining your consent, we may decide to issue and sell additional New Notes from time to time.\nThese further issuances, if\nany, will be consolidated to form a single class with the originally issued notes, will have the same CUSIP\nnumber and will trade interchangeably\nwith the New Notes immediately upon settlement.\n\nHowever, we are under no obligation to issue or\nsell additional New Notes at any time, and if we do sell additional New Notes, we may limit or restrict\nthose sales, and we may stop and\nsubsequently resume selling additional New Notes at any time. If we limit, restrict or stop sales of such\nadditional New Notes, or if\nwe subsequently resume sales of such additional New Notes, the liquidity and trading price of the New Notes\nin the secondary market could\nbe materially and adversely affected. Unless we indicate\n                                                     64                                                     \notherwise, if we suspend selling additional New Notes, we reserve the\nright to resume selling additional New Notes at any time, which might result in the reduction or elimination\nof any premium in the trading\nprice. If you pay a premium for the New Notes above the Closing Intrinsic Note Value and the Intraday\nIntrinsic Note Value, you could\nincur significant losses if you sell your New Notes at a time when the premium is no longer present in the\nmarket.\n\nA suspension of additional issuances of the New\nNotes could result in a significant reduction in the number of outstanding notes if noteholders subsequently\nexercise their right to have\nthe New Notes repurchased by us. Accordingly, the number of outstanding notes, and their liquidity, could\nvary substantially over the\nterm of the New Notes.\n\nThe New Notes do not limit our ability to incur\nother indebtedness or to issue other securities. Also, we are not subject to financial or similar\nrestrictions by the terms of the New\nNotes.\n\nWe have no obligation to take your interests into account when deciding whether to issue additional New\nNotes. In addition, we are under no obligation to reopen any series of notes or to issue any additional New\nNotes.\n\nConsolidations, Mergers, Sales and Transfers of Assets\n\nNeither we nor the Guarantor may merge or consolidate\nwith any other entity or sell, convey or transfer all or substantially all of their respective assets to any\nother entity, unless:\n                          \n  \u00b7  with respect to us:  \n                          \n                                                                                                            \n     either we are the continuing company in the case                                                       \n     of a merger or consolidation or the successor entity in the case of a merger or consolidation          \n     (including an affiliate of the Guarantor)                                                              \n     or the entity to whom those assets are sold, conveyed or transferred in the case of a sale,            \n  \u00b7  conveyance or transfer is a United States                                                              \n     corporation or limited liability company that expressly assumes the due and punctual payment of the    \n     principal of, any interest on, or                                                                      \n     any other amounts due under the debt securities and the due and punctual performance and observance    \n     of all the covenants and conditions                                                                    \n     of the Indenture binding upon us, and                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n     no Event of Default and no event which, with                                                           \n  \u00b7  notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default has occurred or would be             \n     continuing, immediately after the merger or                                                            \n     consolidation, or the sale, conveyance or transfer, and                                                \n                                                                                                            \n                                     \n  \u00b7  with respect to the Guarantor:  \n                                     \n                                                                                                            \n     either the Guarantor is the continuing corporation                                                     \n     in the case of a merger or consolidation or the successor corporation in the case of a merger or       \n     consolidation or the entity to whom those                                                              \n     assets are sold, conveyed or transferred in the case of a sale, conveyance or transfer is a United     \n  \u00b7  States corporation that expressly assumes                                                              \n     the full and unconditional guarantee of the full and punctual payment of the principal of, any         \n     interest on, or any other amounts due under                                                            \n     the debt securities and the due and punctual performance and observance of all the covenants and       \n     conditions of the Indenture binding upon                                                               \n     the Guarantor, and                                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n     no Event of Default and no event which, with                                                           \n  \u00b7  notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default has occurred or would be             \n     continuing, immediately after the merger or                                                            \n     consolidation, or the sale, conveyance or transfer.

(Section 14.01)\n\nThe Guarantor\u2019s obligations under the guarantee\nare unconditional and absolute. However, (1) the Guarantor will not be liable for any amount of payment that\nwe are excused from making\nor any amount in excess of the amount actually due and owing by us, and (2) any defense or counterclaims\navailable to us (except those\nresulting solely from, or on account of, our insolvency or our status as debtor or subject of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency proceeding) will\nalso be available to the Guarantor to the same extent as these defense or counterclaims are available to us,\nwhether or not asserted by\nus. (Section 14.02)\n\nAbout the Alerian MLP Index \u00ae\n\nAll information contained in this prospectus regarding\nthe Alerian MLP Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), including, without limitation, its make-up, performance, method of\ncalculation\nand changes in its components, has been derived from publicly available sources, without independent\nverification. This information reflects\nthe policies of, and is subject to change by, VettaFi LLC (\u201cVettaFi\u201d or the \u201cIndex Sponsor\u201d). The Index is\ncalculated,\nmaintained and published by VettaFi. VettaFi does not have any obligation to continue to publish, and may\ndiscontinue the publication\nof, the Index.\n\nThe Index is a price-return index calculated on\na real-time basis. Prices are delivered to the New York Stock Exchange every 15 seconds and subsequently\npublished to data vendors under\nthe ticker symbol \u201cAMZ.\u201d\n\nThe Index is a gauge of energy infrastructure MLPs.\nThe Index is calculated using a capped, float-adjusted, capitalization-weighted methodology whose\nconstituents earn the majority of their\ncash flow from qualified activities involving energy commodities. The Index began publishing on June 1,\n2006. In addition, over 10 years\nof hypothetical historical index data has been calculated based upon the application of the Index\nmethodology described herein. Relevant\ndata points, such as dividend yield, are also published daily. MLPs are added or removed by the Index\nSponsor based on the methodology\ndescribed below.\n\nConstituent Criteria\n\nA non-constituent will be added to the Index only\nduring the quarterly rebalancing process if it meets all criteria. Constituents will only be removed from\nthe Index for failing to meet\ncriteria during the quarterly rebalancing process. A non-constituent that has entered into a merger\nagreement to be acquired is not eligible\nto be added to the Index. If a constituent is taken over by a non-constituent, it will be removed from the\nIndex and its weight will be\nredistributed to all the remaining constituents on a proportional basis.\n\nThe inclusion criteria are set forth below. The\nMLP must:\n                                                                             \n  \u00b7  be a publicly traded partnership or limited liability company (\u201cLLC\u201d);  \n                                                                             \n                                                     66                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n     earn the majority of its cash flow from qualifying activities involving energy                         \n     commodities.

A non-constituent will only be added to the Index during the\nquarterly rebalancing process\nif it meets all criteria. Constituents will only be removed from the Index for failing to meet criteria\nduring the quarterly rebalancing\nprocess. A non-constituent that has entered into a merger agreement to be acquired is not eligible to be\nadded to the Index.\n\nThese criteria are reviewed regularly to ensure\nconsistency with industry trends.\n\nUnits Outstanding\n\nUnits included in the calculation of units outstanding\ninclude, but are not limited to, common units, subordinated units, special class units and paid-in-kind\nunits. Units excluded from the\ncalculation of units outstanding are general partner units, management incentive units and tradeable, non-\ncommon units.\n\nThe number of units outstanding generally reflects\nthat which is represented by the latest annual or quarterly report, unless otherwise indicated by a press\nrelease or Securities and Exchange\nCommission (\u201cSEC\u201d) document filed pursuant to a transaction. The following is a non-exhaustive list of\nqualifying transactions\nand the point at which they are reflected in a security\u2019s units outstanding. The word \u201creflected\u201d here means\nfor Index\nshare calculation and constituent selection purposes only. Changes to units outstanding and investable\nweight factors, as it relates to\ncalculating the Index, only occur after market close on rebalancing dates, stock dividends and splits\nexcepted.\n                                                                                                  \n  Qualifying Transaction                Reflected in Units Outstanding                            \n  Follow-on public equity offerings     Time of pricing                                           \n  Over-allotment option exercises       Earlier of time of press release or current report        \n  Private investments in public equity  Time of closing                                           \n  (\u201cPIPEs\u201d)                                                                                       \n  Unit repurchases                      Earlier of time of press release or current report        \n  At-the-market equity offerings        As reported in periodic reports, prospectuses or proxies  \n                                                                                                  \nWith respect to PIPEs, unless a lock-up period\nhas been specified, common units issued in a PIPE transaction are considered to be freely tradable upon the\nearlier of (a) the effectiveness\ndate of the accompanying SEC registration statement or (b) 180 days after the transaction close, pursuant to\nSEC Rule 144.\n\nInvestable Weight Factors\n\nA security\u2019s investable weight factor (\u201cIWF\u201d)\nis calculated as follows:\n                                             Units outstanding                                              \nThe IWF for each constituent is applied to the\ntotal outstanding units of such constituent to determine the free-float units to be included in the\ncalculation of the Index. For purposes\nof this calculation, insider-owned common units are those which are included in \u201cSecurity Ownership of\nCertain Beneficial Owners\nand Management\u201d of a company\u2019s latest annual report or proxy. This number is frequently expressed as,\n                                                     67                                                     \nor is similar to, \u201cAll directors and named executive officers\nas a group,\u201d plus common units owned by general partners and/or persons or entities with board\nrepresentation. Though insiders file\nForms 4 and Schedules 13 to indicate changes to their ownership position between annual reports and proxies,\nthey are not factored into\nthe calculation. Other documents (such as press releases, 8-Ks, and prospectus supplements) indicating\nchanges to ownership by a general\npartner are factored into the calculation immediately.\n\nIndex Calculation\n\nThe Index is calculated by VettaFi according to\nthe following equations:\n                                                                    \n  \u00b7  Initial Divisor = Base Date Index Market Capitalization / 100  \n                                                                    \n                                                          \n  \u00b7  Index Value = Index Market Capitalization / Divisor  \n                                                          \n                                                                                          \n  \u00b7  Post-Rebalance Divisor = Post-Rebalance Index Market Capitalization / Pre-Rebalance  \n     Index Value                                                                          \n                                                                                          \nIndex Weighting\n\nIndex shares are assigned based on prices after\nmarket close on the Thursday prior to the second Friday of each March, June, September and December. The\nIndex shares of each constituent\nare market-cap weighted based on their float-adjusted cap. Constituent weights are calculated and capped\naccording to the cap-adjusted\nweighting system described below and implemented after market close on the quarterly rebalancing date.\n\nThe post-rebalancing constituents are weighted\nand ranked by float-adjusted market capitalization (AMC). If the weight of the largest constituent exceeds\n10%, it is assigned a weight\nof 10% and its excess weight is proportionately distributed to the remaining constituents. After this\ndistribution, if the weight of the\nnext largest constituent exceeds 10%, it is assigned a weight of 10% and its excess weight is\nproportionately distributed to the remaining\nconstituents. This process is repeated until none of the remaining constituents has a weight that exceeds\n10%.\n\nIndex Rebalancings\n\nQuarterly rebalancings occur on the third Friday\nof each March, June, September and December, and are effective at the open of the next trading day. In the\nevent that the major US exchanges\nare closed on the third Friday of March, June, September or December, the rebalancing will take place after\nmarket close on the immediately\npreceding trading day. Data relating to constituent eligibility, additions and deletions are analyzed as of\n4:00 p.m. EST on the last\ntrading day of February, May, August and November.\n\nSince Index shares are assigned based on prices\nafter market close on the Thursday prior to the second Friday of each March, June, September, and December,\nthe weight of each constituent\non the quarterly rebalancing date may differ from its target weight due to market movements.\n\nOngoing Maintenance and Handling of Corporate Actions\n\nIn addition to the scheduled quarterly rebalancings,\nthe Index is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes in Index composition and related weight adjustments are\nnecessary whenever there are\nextraordinary events. Corporate actions will be implemented as practically as possible on a case-by-case\nbasis. Whenever possible, the\nchanges in the Index\u2019s components will be announced at least two business days prior to their implementation\nday.\n\nMerger.If two Index constituents merge,\nthe surviving stock will assume the combined weight of the original constituents. If an Index constituent is\ntaken over by a non-constituent\nstock, it will be removed from the Index and its weight will be redistributed to all the remaining\nconstituents on a proportional basis.\nGenerally, the implementation will take place one trading day after the constituent\u2019s merger vote date. If\n                                                     68                                                     \nthe stock\nis delisted before market open on the first trading day after the vote, the delisted security will trade at\nits last traded price.\n\nDelistings.If an Index component is delisted,\nit will be removed from the Index and its weight will be redistributed to all the remaining constituents on\na proportional basis.\n\nTreatment of Distributions\n\nThe Index does not account for cash distributions.\n\nBase Date\n\nThe base date for the Index is December 29, 1995,\nwith a base value of 100. Data prior to the live launch was back-tested by applying then-current Index\nmethodology to each historical\nrebalancing date to select and weight constituents. A back-filled or back-casted methodology can result in\nthe exclusion of acquired,\nmerged, or delisted companies and distort historical performance.\n\nIndex Committee\n\nThe Index is managed by an Index Committee that\nreviews all methodology modifications to ensure that they are made objectively and without bias. The\ncommittee is composed of full-time\nprofessional members of VettaFi\u2019s staff and board of directors. The committee convenes on a quarterly basis\nand is responsible for\noverseeing the development and applications of the methodology. If the Index methodology does not provide a\nclear process for the management\nof a situation, the committee will determine the process to be followed.\n\nInformation regarding methodology modifications\nand constituent changes is considered to be material and can have an impact on the market. Consequently, all\ncommittee discussions are\nconfidential.\n\nHoliday Schedule\n\nThe Index is calculated when US equity markets\nare open.\n\nAnnouncements\n\nIndex methodology changes, if any, will be announced\nafter market close. Announcements can be found on vettafi.com.\n\nData Integrity\n\nVettaFi uses various quality assurance tools to\nmonitor and maintain the accuracy of its data. While every reasonable effort is made to ensure data\nintegrity, there is no guarantee against\nerror. Adjustments to incorrect data will be handled on a case-by-case basis depending on the significance\nof the error and the feasibility\nof a correction. Incorrect intraday ticks of the Index resulting from data errors will not be corrected.\n\nLicense Agreement\n\nWe have entered into a license agreement with the\nIndex Sponsor providing for the license to us, in exchange for a fee, of the right to use the Index, which\nis owned by the Index Sponsor,\nin connection with certain securities, including the New Notes.\n\nThe license agreement between the Index Sponsor\nand us provides that the following language must be set forth in this prospectus:\n\n\u201cAlerian MLP Select Index, Alerian MLP Select\nTotal Return Index, Alerian MLP Index and Alerian MLP Total Return Index are trademarks of VettaFi, LLC and\ntheir use is granted under\na license from VettaFi, LLC.\u201d\n                                                     69                                                     \nAll disclosures contained herein regarding the\nIndex, including its make-up, method of calculation and changes in its components, are derived from publicly\navailable information prepared\nby the Index Sponsor. None of us, our affiliates or the trustee has independently verified any of this\ninformation.\n\nHow Are Payments on the New Notes Determined and What Fees Are Incurred by Investors in the New Notes?\n\nThe New Notes may pay a variable quarterly coupon\nbased on cash distributions on the Index Components over the relevant quarterly period, which we refer to as\nthe Reference Distribution\nAmount, minus an Accrued Investor Fee. The Accrued Investor Fee accrues at a rate of 0.85% per annum each\nday. If the Reference\nDistribution Amount determined in connection with any Coupon Payment is less than the Accrued Investor Fee\nat that time, such shortfall,\nwhich we refer to as an Investor Fee Shortfall, will be carried forward. The Accrued Investor Fee is\nincurred by all investors in the\nNew Notes and is deducted in connection with each Coupon Payment.\n\nAt maturity or upon early repurchase or redemption,\nthe New Notes provide for a cash payment based on the Closing Intrinsic Note Value calculated using the\naverage VWAP Level over a five-day\nMeasurement Period minus, in the case of an early repurchase, a Repurchase Fee Amount of 0.125% of that\nClosing Intrinsic Note\nValue (but excluding any Unpaid Coupon Amount). The Repurchase Fee Amount is borne by investors in the New\nNotes who submit notes for\nrepurchase prior to maturity. In addition, the Stub Coupon Amount and any Unpaid Coupon Amount will be added\nand any Investor Fee Shortfall\nwill be deducted in calculating the Closing Intrinsic Note Value and each Intraday Intrinsic Note Value on\nthat Index Business Day. Accordingly,\nthe payment at maturity or upon early repurchase or redemption will be reduced by the amount of any Investor\nFee Shortfall reflected in\nthe relevant Closing Intrinsic Note Value.\n\nCoupon Payments and the Accrued Investor Fee\n\nFor each New Note you hold on a Coupon Record Date,\nyou will receive on the immediately following Coupon Payment Date an amount in cash equal to the Coupon\nAmount, if any, as of the immediately\npreceding Coupon Valuation Date. Coupon Payments on the New Notes will be payable quarterly in arrears on\nthe fifteenth Index Business\nDay following each Coupon Valuation Date.\n\nThe Coupon Amount as of any Coupon Valuation Date\nwill equal:\n                                                                                      \n  \u00b7  the                                                                              \n     Reference Distribution Amount with respect to that Coupon Valuation Date, minus  \n                                                                                      \n                                                                       \n  \u00b7  the                                                               \n     Accrued Investor Fee with respect to that Coupon Valuation Date,  \n                                                                       \nprovided that the Coupon Amount will not\nbe less than $0.\n\nThe Accrued Investor Fee accrues on a daily basis\nat a rate of 0.85% per annum, applied to the Principal Amount, as adjusted to reflect the performance of the\nIndex from the Initial VWAP\nLevel to the VWAP Level on the Index Business Day immediately preceding the relevant Coupon Valuation Date.\nOn any Index Business Day,\nthe VWAP Level reflects the weighted VWAPs of the Index Components, where the VWAP of each Index Component\nis the volume-weighted average\nprice of one share of that Index Component as determined by the VWAP Calculation Agent based on the Primary\nExchange for that Index Component.\nAll else being equal, if the VWAP Level increases, the amount of the Accrued Investor Fee will increase, and\nif the VWAP Level decreases,\nthe amount of the Accrued Investor Fee will decrease.\n\nIn addition, if the Reference Distribution Amount\non a Coupon Valuation Date is less than the Accrued Investor Fee on that Coupon Valuation Date, an amount\nequal to the excess of the Accrued\nInvestor Fee over the Reference Distribution Amount, which we refer to as the Investor Fee Shortfall, will\nbe included in the Accrued\nInvestor Fee with respect to the next Coupon Valuation Date.\n\nThe Accrued Investor Fee will reduce each Coupon Amount. In addition, no Coupon Payment will be payable with\nrespect to a Coupon Valuation Date if the Reference Distribution Amount is less than the Accrued Investor\nFee, even if that Reference Distribution Amount is positive. You are not guaranteed any Coupon Payments.\n                                                     70                                                     \nFor information about the precise mechanics used\nto determine the Reference Distribution Amount and the Accrued Investor Fee, see \u201c\u2014 Key Terms of the New\nNotes \u2014 Terms Relating to Coupon Payments\u201dabove.\n\nPayment at Maturity or upon Early Redemption or Repurchase\n\nPayment at maturity.For each note, unless\nearlier repurchased or redeemed, you will receive at maturity a cash payment equal to the Closing Intrinsic\nNote Value determined over\nthe Measurement Period with respect to the Final Valuation Date. If that amount is less than or equal to\nzero, the payment at maturity\nwill be $0.\n\nPayment upon early redemption.On any Business\nDay on or after July 26, 2024, we may, in our sole discretion, redeem the New Notes, in whole or in part. If\nwe exercise our right to\nredeem your notes prior to maturity, for each note that is redeemed, you will receive on the Redemption\nSettlement Date a cash payment\nequal to the Closing Intrinsic Note Value determined over the Measurement Period with respect to the\nRedemption Valuation Date. If that\namount is less than or equal to zero, the payment upon early redemption will be $0.\n\nPayment upon early repurchase.On a weekly\nbasis, you may request that we repurchase a minimum of 50,000 notes if you comply with the required\nprocedures, subject to a repurchase\nfee of 0.125%. For each note that is repurchased, you will receive on the relevant Repurchase Date a cash\npayment equal to the Closing\nIntrinsic Note Value determined over the Measurement Period with respect to the Repurchase Valuation Date\nminus the Repurchase\nFee Amount with respect to the Repurchase Valuation Date. If that amount is less than or equal to zero, the\npayment upon early repurchase\nwill be $0.\n\nThe Repurchase Fee Amount with respect to any Repurchase\nValuation Date is equal to 0.125% of the Closing Intrinsic Note Value with respect to that date (but\nexcluding any Unpaid Coupon Amount\nincluded in that Closing Intrinsic Note Value). Accordingly, the Repurchase Fee Amount will vary based on\nthe performance of the VWAP\nLevel, the Stub Coupon Amount and any Investor Fee Shortfall with respect to the Stub Coupon Amount.\n\nClosing Intrinsic Note Value.As of any\ndate of determination, the Closing Intrinsic Note Value is an amount per note equal to:\n                                                                            \n  \u00b7  the                                                                    \n     Principal Amount, multiplied by the Index Ratio as of that date, plus  \n                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n     the                                                                                                    \n  \u00b7  Coupon Amount as of that date, calculated as if that date were a Coupon Valuation Date, which we       \n     refer to as the Stub Coupon Amount,                                                                    \n     minus                                                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                \n  \u00b7  any                                                                        \n     Investor Fee Shortfall determined in calculating that Stub Coupon Amount.  \n                                                                                \nIn addition, if the Coupon Ex-Date with respect\nto the Coupon Amount as of the immediately preceding Coupon Valuation Date has not yet occurred, the Closing\nIntrinsic Note Value will\nalso include that Coupon Amount, which we refer to as an Unpaid Coupon Amount.\n\nFor purposes of determining the Closing Intrinsic\nNote Value in connection with any payment at maturity or upon early repurchase or redemption, the Index\nRatio as of the final day of the\nrelevant Measurement Period reflects the performance of the Index from the Initial VWAP Level to the\narithmetic average of the VWAP Levels\non the five Index Business Days in that Measurement Period, which we refer to as the Final VWAP Level.\n\nYou may lose some or all of your initial investment at maturity or upon early repurchase or redemption. The\naggregate payments on your notes will be less than your initial investment if any Coupon Payments (which\nreflect the negative effect of the Accrued Investor Fee) are insufficient to offset any decrease in the VWAP\nLevel and the negative effect of any Investor Fee Shortfall (and, in the case of early repurchase, the\nRepurchase Fee Amount).\n                                                     71                                                     \nTiming of Payment upon Early Repurchase\n\nBecause the payment upon early repurchase is based\non the average VWAP Level over a five-day Measurement Period that begins after the deadline for submitting a\nRepurchase Notice, you will\nnot know the payment upon early repurchase amount you will receive at the time you elect to request that we\nrepurchase your notes.

An explanation of each of those values is set forth below:\n\nClosing Intrinsic Note Value / Daily Closing Intrinsic Note Value\n\nThe Closing Intrinsic Note Value is calculated\nand published on each Index Business Day and is meant to approximate the intrinsic value of the New Notes at\nthe close on that day, but\nthe published value is not the same as the Closing Intrinsic Note Value used to calculate any payment at\nmaturity or upon early repurchase\nor redemption. We refer to the published value as the Daily Closing Intrinsic Note Value.\n\nThe Closing Intrinsic Note Value on any date of\ndetermination reflects the Principal Amount of the New Notes, as adjusted by the Index Ratio on that date,\nplus the Stub Coupon Amount\non that date, minus any Investor Fee Shortfall with respect to that Stub Coupon Amount. In addition, if the\nCoupon Ex-Date with respect\nto the Coupon Amount as of the immediately preceding Coupon Valuation Date has not yet occurred, the Closing\nIntrinsic Note Value will\nalso include any Unpaid Coupon Amount.\n\nThe Index Ratio for the Daily Closing Intrinsic\nNote Value reflects the VWAP Level on that Index Business Day as compared to the Initial VWAP Level.\nHowever, the payment at maturity\nor upon early repurchase or redemption will be determined based on the Closing Intrinsic Note Value\ncalculated using an Index Ratio that\nreflects the average VWAP Level over a five-day Measurement Period as compared to the Initial VWAP Level\n(subject to a repurchase fee\nof 0.125% in the case of an early repurchase).\n\nThe Closing Intrinsic Note Value is not the closing\nprice or any other trading price of the New Notes in the secondary market and is not intended as a price or\nquotation, or as an offer\nor solicitation for the purchase or sale of your New Notes or as a recommendation to transact in the New\nNotes at the stated\n                                                     72                                                     \nprice. The trading price of the New Notes at any time may vary significantly\nfrom the Closing Intrinsic Note Value due to, among other things, imbalances of supply and demand (including\nas a result of any decision\nof ours to issue, stop issuing or resume issuing additional New Notes), lack of liquidity, transaction\ncosts, credit considerations and\nbid-offer spreads.\n\nIntraday Intrinsic Note Value\n\nThe Intraday Intrinsic Note Value is calculated\nand published by NYSE Arca every 15 seconds during NYSE Arca\u2019s Core Trading Session, which is currently from\n9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.,\nNew York City time, on each Index Business Day and is meant to approximate the intrinsic value of the New\nNotes at that time. Accordingly,\nthe Intraday Intrinsic Note Value at any time reflects the Principal Amount of the New Notes, as adjusted by\nthe cumulative performance\nof the Index (calculated using the level of the Index at that time rather than the VWAP Level) from the\nInitial VWAP Level, plus\nthe Stub Coupon Amount on that Index Business Day, minus any Investor Fee Shortfall with respect to that\nStub Coupon Amount. In\naddition, if the Coupon Ex-Date with respect to the Coupon Amount as of the immediately preceding Coupon\nValuation Date has not yet occurred,\nthe Intraday Intrinsic Note Value will also include any Unpaid Coupon Amount. Because the calculation of the\nIntraday Intrinsic Note Value\nis updated every 15 seconds on Bloomberg, the level of the Index (which is updated every 15 seconds on\nBloomberg) is used instead of the\nVWAP Level (which is calculated only once each day following the close).\n\nThe Intraday Intrinsic Note Value is not the closing price or any other trading price of the New Notes in\nthe secondary market and is not intended as a price or quotation, or as an offer or solicitation for the\npurchase or sale of your New Notes or as a recommendation to transact in the New Notes at the stated price.\nNo payments on the New Notes will be based on the Intraday Intrinsic Note Value. The trading price of the\nNew Notes at any time may vary significantly from the Intraday Intrinsic Note Value at that time due to,\namong other things, imbalances of supply and demand (including as a result of any decision of ours to issue,\nstop issuing or resume issuing additional New Notes), lack of liquidity, transaction costs, credit\nconsiderations and bid-offer spreads. A premium or discount over the Intraday Intrinsic Note Value can also\narise in the trading price as a result of mismatches of trading hours between the New Notes and the\ncomponents included in the Index underlying the New Notes, actions (or failure to take action) by the index\nsponsor and NYSE Arca and technical or human errors by service providers, market participants and others.\n\nTrading Price\n\nThe market value of the New Notes at any given\ntime, which we refer to as the Trading Price, is the price at which you may be able to sell your New Notes\nin the secondary market, if\none exists. The Trading Price of the New Notes at any time may vary significantly from the Intraday\nIntrinsic Note Value or the Closing\nIntrinsic Note Value due to, among other things, imbalances of supply and demand (including as a result of\nany decision of ours to issue,\nstop issuing or resume issuing additional New Notes), lack of liquidity, transaction costs, credit\nconsiderations, bid-offer spreads,\nmismatches of trading hours between the New Notes and the components included in the Index underlying the\nNew Notes, actions (or failure\nto take action) by the index sponsor and NYSE Arca and technical or human errors by service providers,\nmarket participants and others.\nThese and other factors may cause the New Notes to trade at a premium or discount, which may be significant,\nin relation to the Intraday\nIntrinsic Note Value or the Closing Intrinsic Note Value. Investors can compare the trading price, if any,\nof the New Notes against the\nIntraday Intrinsic Note Value to determine whether the New Notes are trading in the secondary market at a\npremium or a discount to the\nintrinsic value of the New Notes at any given time.\n\nIf you pay a premium for the New Notes above the Closing Intrinsic Note Value and the Intraday Intrinsic\nNote Value, you could incur significant losses if you sell your New Notes at a time when the premium is no\nlonger present in the market. In addition, the payment on the New Notes at maturity or upon early repurchase\nor redemption will be determined based on the Closing Intrinsic Note Value calculated using the average VWAP\nLevel over a five-day Measurement Period, which may vary significantly from the trading price of the New\nNotes and will not reflect any premium. Furthermore, if you sell your New Notes in the market at a time when\nthe New Notes are trading at a discount below the Closing Intrinsic Note Value and the Intraday Intrinsic\nNote Value, you will receive less than the Closing Intrinsic Note Value and the Intraday Intrinsic Note\nValue.\n                                                     73                                                     \nBloomberg Ticker Symbols\n\nThe Bloomberg ticker symbols under which information\nrelating to the Index can be located are set forth below.

However, the payment\nat maturity or upon early repurchase or redemption will be determined based on the Closing Intrinsic Note\nValue calculated using the average\nVWAP Level over a five-day Measurement Period.\n\n** The Interim Coupon or Shortfall Amount on any\nday represents the adjustment made in the calculation of the Closing Intrinsic Note Value as of that day to\nreflect the Stub Coupon Amount,\nany Investor Fee Shortfall with respect to the Stub Coupon Amount and any Unpaid Coupon Amount. Accordingly,\nas of any date of determination,\nthe Interim Coupon or Shortfall Amount is equal to the Coupon Amount as of that date, calculated as if that\ndate were a Coupon Valuation\nDate, minusany Investor Fee Shortfall with respect to that Stub Coupon Amount. In addition, if the Coupon\nEx-Date with respect\nto the Coupon Amount as of the immediately preceding Coupon Valuation Date has not yet occurred, the Interim\nCoupon or Shortfall Amount\nwill also include any Unpaid Coupon Amount. The Interim Coupon or Shortfall Amount will be negative if the\ncash distributions on the Index Components over the relevant period are insufficient to offset the Accrued\nInvestor Fee. While the Interim Coupon or Shortfall Amount is calculated and published in connection with\neach Index Business Day, the Coupon Amount will be calculated and paid quarterly.\n\nHypothetical Examples: Coupon Payments\n\nThe following examples illustrate hypothetical\nCoupon Amounts on the New Notes over a hypothetical period of eight quarters based on hypothetical Reference\nDistribution Amounts. The\n\u201creturn on Principal Amount\u201d as used in this section is the number, expressed as a percentage, that results\nfrom comparing\na Coupon Amount to the Principal Amount.\n\nIn addition, the hypothetical Coupon Amounts and\nreturns set forth below assume that the New Notes are not repurchased or redeemed early, as well as the\nfollowing:\n                                 \n  \u00b7  a Principal Amount of $25;  \n                                 \n                                                                                                            \n     an Initial VWAP Level of 100.00 and a constant VWAP Level of 100.00 over the                           \n  \u00b7  hypothetical period (see \u201c\u2014 Hypothetical Accrued Investor Fee Calculations\u201d for an illustration of     \n     the effect                                                                                             \n     of fluctuating VWAP Levels on the Accrued Investor Fee);                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                         \n  \u00b7  an investor fee percentage of 0.85% per annum; and  \n                                                         \n                                                                               \n  \u00b7  each hypothetical quarterly period is a quarter of a year with 360 days.  \n                                                                               \n                                                     74                                                     \nThe hypothetical Initial VWAP Level of 100.00 and\nthe VWAP Level on the Index Business Day immediately preceding each Coupon Valuation Date of 100.00 have\nbeen chosen for illustrative\npurposes only and may not represent a likely actual Initial VWAP Level or a likely actual VWAP Level.

However, the actual VWAP Level and, therefore, the\nIndex Ratio and the Accrued Investor\nFee, will fluctuate over the term of the New Notes.\n\nThe following table illustrates the hypothetical\nAccrued Investor Fee on the New Notes for a hypothetical quarterly period, assuming a range of VWAP Levels\nas of the Index Business Day\nimmediately preceding the relevant Coupon Valuation Date.\n\nIn addition, the hypothetical Coupon Amounts and\nreturns set forth below assume that the New Notes are not repurchased or redeemed early, as well as the\nfollowing:\n                                 \n  \u00b7  a Principal Amount of $25;  \n                                 \n                                       \n  \u00b7  an Initial VWAP Level of 100.00;  \n                                       \n                                                     \n  \u00b7  an investor fee percentage of 0.85% per annum;  \n                                                     \n                                                                                   \n  \u00b7  each hypothetical quarterly period is a quarter of a year with 360 days; and  \n                                                                                   \n                                                                                       \n  \u00b7  an Investor Fee Shortfall of $0 as of the immediately preceding Coupon Valuation  \n     Date.                                                                             \n                                                                                       \nThe hypothetical Initial VWAP Level of 100.00 has\nbeen chosen for illustrative purposes only and may not represent a likely actual Initial VWAP Level. The\nactual Initial VWAP Level is\nthe arithmetic average of the VWAP Levels determined over a period of five Index Business Days ending on the\nInception Date, which is\n.. We cannot predict the actual VWAP Level on any Index Business Day.\n\nThe Investor Fee Shortfall of $0 as of the immediately\npreceding Coupon Valuation Date has been chosen for illustrative purposes only. The actual Investor Fee\nShortfall as of the immediately\npreceding Coupon Valuation Date will equal the excess, if any, of the Accrued Investor Fee over the\nReference Distribution Amount as of\nthe immediately preceding Coupon Valuation Date.\n\nEach hypothetical Reference Distribution Amount,\nAccrued Investor Fee, Coupon Amount, Investor Fee Shortfall and return set forth below is for illustrative\npurposes only and may not be\nthe Reference Distribution Amount, Accrued Investor Fee, Coupon Amount, Investor Fee Shortfall or return\napplicable to a purchaser of\nthe New Notes.

We cannot predict the actual VWAP Level on any Index Business Day.\n\nBecause the Reference Distribution Amount with\nrespect to each Coupon Valuation Date is assumed to be $0, the Stub Coupon Amount and Unpaid Coupon Amount\nwould also be $0 on each Index\nBusiness Day over the term of the New Notes. Under these circumstances, no Coupon Payments would be made\nover the term of the New Notes.\n\nIn addition, because the Reference Distribution\nAmount with respect to each Coupon Valuation Date is assumed to be $0, the investor fee would not be offset\nby cash dividends on the Index\nComponents. Under these circumstances, due to the effect of the Investor Fee Shortfall, the Accrued Investor\nFee with respect to any Coupon\nValuation Date will reflect the entire investor fee that has accrued over the term of the New Notes up to\nthat Coupon Valuation Date.\nAny actual Investor Fee Shortfall may be greater than the amounts shown below.\n                                                     77                                                     \nIf the New Notes are repurchased or redeemed, the\npayment upon early repurchase or redemption will be the applicable Closing Intrinsic Note Value minus, in\nthe case of an early\nrepurchase, the applicable Repurchase Fee Amount.\n\nEach hypothetical total return, payment and Closing\nIntrinsic Note Value set forth below is for illustrative purposes only and may not be the actual total\nreturn, payment or Closing Intrinsic\nNote Value applicable to a purchaser of the New Notes. In addition, if you purchase the New Notes at a price\nthat is higher or lower than\nthe Principal Amount used for these examples, the return on your New Notes represented by the payment at\nmaturity or upon early repurchase\nor redemption will be different from the returns set forth in the examples below. The numbers appearing in\nthe following tables have been\nrounded for ease of analysis.\n\nExample 1 \u2014 The VWAP Level increases by 3% each year over the term of the New Notes.\n

The closing level\nof the Index on January 12, 2024 was 258.9071. We obtained the closing levels above and below from\nBloomberg, without independent verification.\n\nThe payment at maturity or upon early repurchase or redemption is linked to the VWAP Levels, not to the\nclosing levels of the Index.Although the VWAP Level is intended to track the\nperformance of the Index, the calculation of the VWAP Level is different from the calculation of the\nofficial closing level of the Index,\nand the VWAP Level will not necessarily correlate with the performance of the official closing level of the\nIndex. The official closing\nlevel of the Index may vary significantly from the VWAP Level. Therefore, the payment at maturity or upon\nearly repurchase or redemption\nmay be different from, and may be significantly less than, the payment you would receive if that payment\nwere determined by reference\nto the official closing level of the Index.\n\nThe historical closing levels of the Index should\nnot be taken as an indication of past or future performance of the VWAP Level on any Index Business Day, and\nno assurance can be given\nas to the\n                                                     80                                                     \nVWAP Level on any Index Business Day.

Beneficial owners will not receive\ncertificates representing their ownership\ninterests in securities, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the securities is\ndiscontinued.\n\nTo facilitate subsequent transfers, all securities\ndeposited by DTC direct participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC\u2019s partnership nominee, Cede\n& Co., or any\nother name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of securities with DTC\nand their registration in the\nname of Cede & Co. or any other DTC nominee do not affect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no\nknowledge of the actual\nbeneficial owners of the securities; DTC\u2019s records reflect only the identity of the DTC direct participants\nto whose accounts those\nsecurities are credited, which may or may not be the beneficial owners. The DTC direct and DTC indirect\nparticipants will remain responsible\nfor keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.\n\nConveyance of notices and other communications\nby DTC to DTC direct participants, by DTC direct participants to DTC indirect participants, and by DTC\ndirect participants and DTC indirect\nparticipants to beneficial owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or\nregulatory requirements as\nmay be in effect from time to time. Beneficial owners of securities may wish to take steps to augment the\ntransmission to them of notices\nof significant events with respect to the securities, such as redemptions, tenders, defaults, and proposed\namendments to the security\ndocuments. For example, beneficial owners of securities may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding the\nsecurities for their benefit\nhas agreed to obtain and transmit notices to beneficial owners. In the alternative, beneficial owners may\nwish to provide their names\nand addresses to the registrar and request that copies of notices be provided directly to them.\n\nWith respect to the securities that contain an\noption to redeem, redemption notices shall be sent to DTC. If less than all of the securities within an\nissue are being redeemed, DTC\u2019s\npractice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each DTC direct participant in the issue to be\nredeemed.\n\nNeither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other\nDTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to securities unless authorized by a DTC direct participant\nin accordance with DTC\u2019s\nMMI Procedures. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an omnibus proxy to an issuer as soon as possible\nafter the record date. The omnibus\nproxy assigns Cede & Co.\u2019s consenting or voting rights to those direct participants to whose accounts\nsecurities are credited\non the record date (identified in a listing attached to the omnibus proxy).\n\nRedemption proceeds, distributions, and dividend\npayments on the securities will be made to Cede & Co., or any other nominee as may be requested by an\nauthorized representative\nof DTC. DTC\u2019s practice is to credit DTC direct participants\u2019 accounts upon DTC\u2019s receipt of funds and\ncorresponding\ndetail information from issuer or agent, on payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown\non DTC\u2019s records. Payments\nby DTC participants to beneficial owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices,\nas is the case with securities\nheld for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in \u201cstreet name,\u201d and will be the\nresponsibility of that DTC\nparticipant and not of DTC, agent, or us, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in\neffect from time to time. Payment\nof redemption proceeds, distributions, and dividend payments to Cede & Co. (or any other nominee as may be\nrequested by an authorized\nrepresentative of DTC) is the responsibility of issuer or agent, disbursement of those payments to DTC\ndirect participants will be the\nresponsibility of DTC, and disbursement of those payments to the beneficial owners will be the\nresponsibility of DTC direct and DTC indirect\nparticipants.\n\nA beneficial owner shall give notice to elect to\nhave its securities purchased or tendered, through its participant, to an agent, and shall effect delivery\nof those securities by causing\nthe DTC direct participant to transfer the DTC participant\u2019s interest in the securities, on DTC\u2019s records,\nto an agent. The\nrequirement for physical delivery of securities in connection with an optional tender or a mandatory\npurchase will be deemed satisfied\nwhen the ownership rights in the securities are transferred by DTC direct participants on DTC\u2019s records and\nfollowed by a book-entry\ncredit of tendered securities to the agent\u2019s DTC account.\n                                                     83                                                     \nDTC may discontinue providing its services as depositary\nwith respect to the securities at any time by giving reasonable notice to issuer or agent. Under those\ncircumstances, in the event that\na successor depositary is not obtained, securities certificates are required to be printed and delivered.\n\nWe may decide to discontinue use of the system\nof book-entry-only transfers through DTC (or a successor securities depositary). In that event, securities\ncertificates will be printed\nand delivered to DTC.\n\nClearance and Settlement Procedures\n\nDTC participants that hold securities through DTC\non behalf of investors will follow the settlement practices applicable to United States corporate debt\nobligations in DTC\u2019s Same-Day\nFunds Settlement System.\n\nSecurities will be credited to the securities custody\naccounts of these DTC participants against payment in same-day funds, for payments in U.S. dollars, on the\nsettlement date. For payments\nin a currency other than U.S. dollars, securities will be credited free of payment on the settlement date.\n\nSecondary Market Trading\n\nTrading Between DTC Participants\n\nSecondary market trading between DTC participants\nwill occur in the ordinary way in accordance with DTC\u2019s rules. Secondary market trading will be settled\nusing procedures applicable\nto United States corporate debt obligations in DTC\u2019s Same-Day Funds Settlement System for securities.\n\nIf payment is made in U.S. dollars, settlement\nwill be in same-day funds. If payment is made in a currency other than U.S. dollars, settlement will be free\nof payment. If payment is\nmade other than in U.S. dollars, separate payment arrangements outside of the DTC system must be made\nbetween the DTC participants involved.\n                                                     84                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                             Comparison of the                                              \n                             Material Terms of the Old Notes and the New Notes                              \nThe following is a summary comparison of the material terms of the Old Notes and the New Notes that differ.\nThis summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified by reference to, the\n\u201cDescription of the New Notes\u201d section above, all of the definitions and provisions of the Indenture and any\nsupplement thereto, the Indenture for the Old Notes and any supplement thereto and the certificates for the\nOld Notes and the New Notes.

There is no direct legal authority as to the proper U.S. federal income tax treatment of\nthe New Notes, and we do not\nintend to request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) regarding the Exchange Offer or the\nNew Notes. As\ndescribed in the offering materials for the Old Notes, we have treated the Old Notes as \u201copen transactions\u201d\nthat are not debt\ninstruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, based on current market conditions, in the\nopinion of our special tax counsel,\nDavis Polk & Wardwell LLP, the New Notes should be treated as \u201copen transactions\u201d that are not debt\ninstruments for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes. The following discussion assumes these treatments are respected, except where\notherwise indicated.\n                                                    107                                                     \nExchanging U.S. Holders\n\nThis portion of the discussion applies to you,\nif you are a U.S. Holder. You are a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d if for U.S. federal income tax purposes you are a\nbeneficial owner of an\nOld Note that is exchanging that Note for a New Note and that is:\n                                                             \n  \u00b7  a citizen or individual resident of the United States;  \n                                                             \n                                                                                                   \n  \u00b7  a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized                 \n     in or under the laws of the United States, any state therein or the District of Columbia; or  \n                                                                                                   \n                                                                                        \n  \u00b7  an estate or trust the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation  \n     regardless of its source.                                                          \n                                                                                        \nTax Consequences of the Exchange\n\nIn general, your exchange of an Old Note for a\nNew Note pursuant to the Exchange Offer will be a taxable exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nAs stated in the offering materials for the Old\nNotes (the \u201cOriginal Offering Materials\u201d), upon a taxable exchange you should recognize gain or loss equal\nto the difference\nbetween the amount realized on the exchange and your tax basis in the Old Note, which should equal the\namount you paid to acquire it (assuming\ncoupon amounts on the Old Note are properly treated as ordinary income at the time accrued or received, in\naccordance with your method\nof accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes as also described therein). Subject to the discussion\nbelow concerning the potential\napplication of the \u201cconstructive ownership\u201d rules of Code Section 1260, this gain or loss should be long-\nterm capital gain\nor loss if you have held the Old Note for more than one year at that time. The deductibility of capital\nlosses is subject to limitations.\nAs described in the Original Offering Materials, it is uncertain whether the proceeds of the exchange\ninclude any amount (of cash or the\nvalue of other property, such as New Notes) attributable to accrued but unpaid coupon amounts on the Old\nNotes, or whether this amount\nwould be treated in the same manner as coupon amounts on the Old Notes, as described above.\n\nYour amount realized should otherwise equal the\nfair market value of the New Notes you receive plus any amount of cash you receive in lieu of any fractional\nNew Note.\n\nAs stated in the Original Offering Materials, the\nIRS may assert that the Old Notes constitute \u201cconstructive ownership transactions\u201d within the meaning of\nCode Section 1260,\nin which case your tax consequences from the exchange would be significantly and adversely affected. If an\nOld Note were treated as a\n\u201cconstructive ownership transaction,\u201d any gain recognized that would otherwise be long-term capital gain and\nthat is in excess\nof the \u201cnet underlying long-term capital gain\u201d (as defined in Code Section 1260) would be treated as\nordinary income, and\na notional interest charge would apply as if that income had accrued for tax purposes at a constant yield\nover the Old Note\u2019s term.\nIf an Old Note were treated as a \u201cconstructive ownership transaction,\u201d there would be a presumption that all\nlong-term capital\ngain is subject to recharacterization as ordinary income unless the contrary is demonstrated by clear and\nconvincing evidence. It is not\nclear how the \"net underlying long-term capital gain\" should be determined under Code Section 1260 in the\ncase of an instrument,\nlike the Old Notes, the underlying index with respect to which is rebalanced periodically. As described in\nthe Original Offering Materials,\nit is possible that long-term capital gain realized on an exchange of the Old Note pursuant to the Exchange\nOffer could be recharacterized\nas ordinary income, and subject to a notional interest charge, to the extent it exceeds the amount of long-\nterm capital gain you can establish\nwould have been realized if you had invested directly in the index components underlying the Old Note upon\nyour acquisition of the Old\nNote and rebalanced your portfolio as and when the index underlying the Old Notes rebalanced.\n\nAs described in the Original Offering Materials,\nthe application of the constructive ownership rules to the Old Notes is uncertain, and it is possible that\nunder certain circumstances\nthe effect of those rules might be relatively small. Due to the lack of governing authority and the fact-\nsensitive nature of the analysis\nunder Code Section 1260, no opinion has been rendered as to whether and how these rules would apply to your\nOld Notes.\n                                                    108                                                     \nIn addition, as described in the Original Offering\nMaterials, due to the lack of controlling authority, there remain significant uncertainties regarding the\ncharacter of gain or loss, on\na disposition of your Old Notes. For instance, you might be required to treat all or a portion of the gain\nor loss on the exchange of\nyour Old Notes as ordinary income or loss or as short-term capital gain or loss, without regard to how long\nyou have held them. Finally,\nas described in the Original Offering Materials, if your Old Notes were treated as debt instruments, among\nother things, any gain recognized\nat maturity or upon the exchange of your Old Notes generally would be treated as interest income, and if you\nrecognized a loss above certain\nthresholds, you might be required to file a disclosure statement with the IRS.\n\nTax Consequences of the Ownership and Disposition of the New Notes\n\nYou should not recognize taxable income or loss\nover the term of the New Notes prior to maturity other than pursuant to a sale, exchange or \u201cdeemed\nexchange\u201d as described\nbelow.\n\nTax Treatment of Coupon Amounts\n\nAlthough the U.S. federal income tax treatment\nof Coupon Amounts is uncertain, we expect (in the absence of an administrative determination or judicial\nruling to the contrary) to treat\nany Coupon Amounts with respect to the New Notes as ordinary income at the time accrued or received, in\naccordance with your method of\naccounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless otherwise indicated.\n\nSale, Exchange or Redemption of a New Note\n\nUpon a sale or exchange of a New Note (including\nearly repurchase or redemption at maturity), you should recognize gain or loss equal to the difference\nbetween the amount realized on\nthe sale or exchange and your tax basis in the New Note, which generally should equal the fair market value\nof the New Note at the time\nyou acquired it pursuant to the Exchange Offer. Subject to the discussions below under \u201c\u2014Potential\nApplication of the Constructive Ownership Rules to the New Notes\u201d and \u201c\u2014Alternative Tax Treatments of the\nNew Notes,\u201d this gain or\nloss should be long-term capital gain or loss if you have held the New Note for more than one year at that\ntime. The deductibility of\ncapital losses is subject to limitations. It is uncertain whether the proceeds of a sale or exchange prior\nto maturity include any amount\nattributable to accrued but unpaid Coupon Amounts, or whether this amount should be treated as described\nabove.\n\nPotential Deemed Exchange of New Notes on Index Rebalancing\n\nThe IRS could assert that under certain circumstances\na \u201cdeemed\u201d taxable exchange has occurred on one or more Index rebalancing dates. If the IRS were successful\nin asserting that\na taxable exchange has occurred, you could be required to recognize gain (but probably not loss), which\nwould equal the amount by which\nthe fair market value of your New Notes exceeds your tax basis in them on the relevant rebalancing date. Any\ngain recognized on a deemed\nexchange should be capital gain, subject to the discussions below under \u201c\u2014 Potential Application of the\nConstructive Ownership Rules to the New Notes\u201d and \u201c\u2014Alternative Tax Treatments of the New Notes.\u201d\n\nPotential Application of the Constructive Ownership Rules to the New Notes\n\nThe IRS may assert that the New Notes constitute\n\u201cconstructive ownership transactions\u201d within the meaning of Code Section 1260, in which case your tax\nconsequences of a sale\nor exchange of a New Note would be significantly and adversely affected. Code Section 1260 generally applies\nif an investor enters into\na \u201cconstructive ownership transaction\u201d with respect to a \u201cpass-thru\u201d entity, which term includes most of the\nunderlying\nMLPs. If a New Note is treated as a \u201cconstructive ownership transaction,\u201d any gain recognized in respect of\na New Note that\nwould otherwise be long-term capital gain and that is in excess of the \u201cnet underlying long-term capital\ngain\u201d (as defined\nin Code Section 1260) would be treated as ordinary income, and a notional interest charge would apply as if\nthat income had accrued for\ntax purposes at a constant yield over your holding period for the New Note. If a New Note were treated as a\n\u201cconstructive ownership\ntransaction,\u201d there would be a presumption that all long-term capital gain is subject to recharacterization\nas ordinary income unless\nthe contrary is demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence. It is not clear how the \u201cnet underlying long-\nterm capital gain\u201d\nshould be determined under Code Section 1260 in the case of an instrument, like the New Notes, the\nunderlying index with\n                                                    109                                                     \nrespect to which is rebalanced periodically. One reasonable possibility\nis that long-term capital gain realized on a sale or exchange of a New Note could be recharacterized as\nordinary income, and subject to\na notional interest charge, to the extent it exceeds the amount of long-term capital gain you can establish\nwould have been realized if\nyou had invested directly in the Index Components upon your acquisition of the New Notes and rebalanced your\nportfolio as and when the\nIndex rebalanced.\n\nIf the New Notes are treated as \u201cconstructive\nownership transactions,\u201d it is possible that the impact of the application of those rules might be\nrelatively small, assuming that\nthe Index Components comply with their stated distribution policies, that Coupon Amounts on the New Notes\nare treated as ordinary income\nconsistent with the position being taken herein, and that the turnover of the Index Components upon\nrebalancing of the Index is relatively\nsmall. In this event, based on our understanding of the Index Components\u2019 distribution policies, we think it\nwould be fairly unlikely\nthat you would recognize amounts of long-term capital gain significantly in excess of the \u201cnet underlying\nlong-term capital gain\u201d\nthat you would have recognized if you had invested directly in the Index Components on the Initial Issue\nDate and rebalanced your portfolio\nas and when the Index rebalanced. However, for a number of reasons, including among others because we have\nno control over the events\ndescribed above, and because the constructive ownership rules would, assuming they applied, require you to\nprove by clear and convincing\nevidence that your long-term capital gain does not in fact exceed the long-term capital gain that you would\nhave recognized if you had\ninvested directly in the Index Components, there can be no assurance that some or all of the long-term\ncapital gain that you recognize\non a sale or exchange of the New Notes will not be subject to recharacterization under Code Section 1260.\n\nDue to the lack of governing authority, our special\ntax counsel is unable to opine as to whether the constructive ownership rules apply to the New Notes.\nAccordingly, U.S. Holders should\nconsult their tax advisers regarding the potential application of the constructive ownership rules.\n\nAlternative Tax Treatments of the New Notes\n\nDue to the lack of controlling authority, there\nremain significant additional uncertainties regarding the tax consequences of your ownership and disposition\nof the New Notes. For instance,\nyou might be required to include amounts (other than Coupon Amounts) in income during the term of your New\nNotes (for example, under Code\nSection 1256) and/or to treat all or a portion of the gain or loss on the sale or exchange of a New Note as\nordinary income or loss or\nas short-term capital gain or loss, without regard to how long you held the New Note.\n\nIn addition, in 2007 Treasury and the IRS released\na notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of \u201cprepaid forward contracts\u201d and\nsimilar instruments,\nwhich may include the New Notes. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these\ninstruments to accrue income\nover the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the\ncharacter of income or loss\nwith respect to these instruments; the relevance of factors such as the exchange-traded status of the\ninstruments; the nature of the underlying\nproperty to which the instruments are linked; and whether these instruments are or should be subject to the\n\u201cconstructive ownership\u201d\nregime described above. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective\ndates, any Treasury regulations\nor other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the\ntax consequences of an investment\nin the New Notes, possibly with retroactive effect.\n\nThe IRS could seek to treat your New Notes as beneficial\nownership of the underlying MLPs for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In that event, you could be required\nto recognize income, gain\nor loss and file tax returns in the jurisdictions in which the underlying MLPs that are treated as\npartnerships for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes operate (including federal, state and local jurisdictions) as if you owned direct interests in\nthose MLPs despite the fact\nthat you will not receive Schedule K-1 or other information returns reporting your share of the MLPs\u2019\nincome, gain and loss and\nmay not have access to such information returns. Moreover, if you are treated as owning the underlying MLPs,\nyou could be treated as recognizing\nincome or loss each time the Index is rebalanced, which income could be short-term or long-term, depending\non how long you are treated\nas owning the MLPs that are treated as sold or disposed.\n                                                    110                                                     \nAlternatively, the IRS could seek to treat the\nNew Notes as debt instruments. In that event, your tax consequences will be governed by Treasury regulations\nrelating to the taxation\nof \u201ccontingent payment debt instruments.\u201d In this event, regardless of whether you are an accrual-method or\ncash-method taxpayer,\nyou will be required to accrue into income original issue discount on your New Notes at our \u201ccomparable\nyield\u201d for similar\nnoncontingent debt, determined at the time of the issuance of the New Notes, subject to certain adjustments,\nwith the result that your\ntaxable income in any year could differ significantly from (and could be significantly higher than) the\nCoupon Amounts (if any) you receive\nin that year. In addition, any gain recognized at maturity, upon early repurchase or redemption or upon a\nsale or exchange of your New\nNotes generally will be treated as interest income, and if you recognize a loss above certain thresholds,\nyou might be required to file\na disclosure statement with the IRS.\n\nExchanging Non-U.S. Holders\n\nThis portion of the discussion applies to you,\nif you are a Non-U.S. Holder. You are a \u201cNon-U.S. Holder\u201d if for U.S. federal income tax purposes you are a\nbeneficial owner\nof an Old Note that is exchanging that Note for a New Note and that is:\n                                      \n  \u00b7  a nonresident alien individual;  \n                                      \n                                \n  \u00b7  a foreign corporation; or  \n                                \n                                 \n  \u00b7  a foreign estate or trust.  \n                                 \nYou are not a \u201cNon-U.S. Holder\u201d for\npurposes of this discussion if you are an individual present in the United States for 183 days or more in\nthe taxable year of disposition.\nIn this case, you should consult your tax adviser regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of\nparticipating in the Exchange\nOffer and of your ownership and disposition of New Notes acquired in the Exchange Offer.\n\nTax Consequences of the Exchange\n\nIn general, your exchange of an Old Note for a\nNew Note pursuant to the Exchange Offer will be a taxable exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nAs described in the Original Offering Materials,\nany \u201ceffectively connected income\u201d from your Old Notes, which includes any gain recognized upon the exchange\nthat is \u201ceffectively\nconnected\u201d with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if an applicable treaty so\nrequires, attributable\nto a permanent establishment in the United States) will be subject to U.S. federal income tax and will\nrequire you to file U.S. federal\nincome tax returns, in each case in the same manner as if you were a U.S. Holder. In particular, if you own\nor are treated as owning more\nthan 5% of the Old Notes, you could be treated as owning a \u201cUnited States real property interest\u201d within the\nmeaning of Code\nSection 897, in which case any gain from the exchange of your Old Notes for the New Notes pursuant to the\nExchange Offer would be deemed\nto be \u201ceffectively connected income,\u201d with the consequences described above.\n\nAs described in the Original Offering Materials\nupon the exchange of Old Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offer, you should expect withholding agents to\nwithhold tax under Code Section\n871(m) equal to 30% (or a lower rate under the dividend provision of an applicable income tax treaty) of our\nestimate of the dividend\nequivalent amounts attributable to the portion of the coupon amount on the Old Notes that has accrued since\nthe immediately preceding\ncoupon payment date. Our estimate of the dividend equivalent amounts for a fully accrued quarterly coupon\npayment on an Old Note would\nbe 1.84866% of the principal amount of the Old Note. As described in the Original Offering Materials, you\nshould also expect withholding\nagents to withhold 30% (subject to possible reduction or elimination of that rate under the \u201cother income\u201d\nor similar provision\nof an applicable income tax treaty) of the remaining portion of any accrued coupon payments on the Old Notes\nafter accounting for estimated\ndividend equivalent amounts, unless those amounts are effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or\nbusiness in the United States\n(in which case, in order to avoid withholding, you will likely be required to provide a properly completed\nIRS Form W-8ECI).\n\nIf the amount of any cash payable to you upon the\nexchange is insufficient to satisfy the withholding tax described above, the difference might be withheld\nfrom or set off against Coupon\nAmounts payable on\n                                                    111                                                     \nyour New\nNotes, payments received upon sale, repurchase, redemption or maturity of those Notes or your other funds or\nassets. As stated in the\nOriginal Offering Materials, the issuer of the Old Notes will not pay any additional amounts with respect to\nany withholding tax.\n\nTax Consequences of the Ownership and Disposition of the New Notes\n\nBeneficial Ownership\n\nThe IRS could seek to treat you as the beneficial\nowner of the underlying MLPs for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In that event, you would be treated as\nengaged in a U.S. trade or business\nas a result of your ownership of the New Notes. You generally would be required to recognize income, gain or\nloss and file tax returns\nin the jurisdictions in which the MLPs that are treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes\noperate (including federal,\nstate and local jurisdictions) as if you owned direct interests in those MLPs despite the fact that you will\nnot receive Schedules K-1\nor other information returns reporting your share of the MLPs\u2019 income, gain and loss and may not have access\nto those information\nreturns. Moreover, if you are treated as owning the underlying MLPs, you generally would be treated as\nrecognizing income or loss each\ntime the Index is rebalanced. In addition, you generally would be subject to a 15% withholding tax on the\namount realized when you sell\nor exchange a New Note (including early repurchase or redemption at maturity) and when you are otherwise\ntreated as selling one or more\npartnership interests (e.g., when the Index is rebalanced), which withholding would generally be creditable\nagainst your U.S. federal\nincome tax, provided you properly file the required tax return(s). Even if the IRS does not treat you as a\nbeneficial owner of the underlying\nMLPs, it might seek to treat the New Notes as interests in the MLPs for the purpose of imposing this\nwithholding tax. If a Non-U.S. Holder\nthat is a foreign corporation were treated as a beneficial owner of the underlying MLPs, it could also\npotentially be subject to the U.S.\nbranch profits tax with respect to items of income and gain described in this paragraph.\n\nTax Treatment of Coupon Amounts and Gain Upon Disposition of the New Notes\n\nThe U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Coupon\nAmounts is uncertain. Assuming that the treatment of the New Notes as \u201copen transactions\u201d that are not debt\ninstruments is\nrespected, insofar as we have reporting responsibilities, we will treat Coupon Amounts as ordinary income\n(in the absence of an administrative\ndetermination or judicial ruling to the contrary), and by purchasing the New Notes you will agree to do the\nsame. Subject to the following\nsentence and the discussion below under \u201c\u2014Section 871(m),\u201d we generally expect that Coupon Amounts paid to\nNon-U.S.\nHolders will be withheld upon at a rate of 30%, subject to the possible reduction or elimination of that\nrate under the \u201cother income\u201d\nor similar provision of an applicable income tax treaty. Coupon Amounts that are treated as \"effectively\nconnected\" with your\nconduct of a trade or business in the United States should not be subject to this withholding tax. However,\nin order to avoid withholding\non \u201ceffectively connected\u201d Coupon Amounts, you will likely be required to provide a properly completed IRS\nForm W-8ECI.\n\nAny \u201ceffectively connected income\u201d\nfrom your New Notes, including also any gain from the sale or settlement of your New Notes that is or is\ntreated as effectively connected\nwith your conduct of a United States trade or business, will be subject to U.S. federal income tax, and will\nrequire you to file U.S.\nfederal income tax returns, in each case in the same manner as if you were a U.S. Holder. In particular, if\nyou own or are treated as\nowning more than 5% of the New Notes, you could be treated as owning a \u201cUnited States real property\ninterest\u201d within the meaning\nof Code Section 897, in which case any gain from the sale or settlement of your New Notes would be deemed to\nbe \u201ceffectively connected\nincome,\u201d with the consequences described above. In addition, if you are a foreign corporation, you could\nalso potentially be subject\nto the U.S. branch profits tax with respect to your effectively connected income.\n\nIf you are not a United States person, you should\nconsult your tax adviser regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the New\nNotes in light of your particular\ncircumstances.\n\nSection 871(m)\n\nCode Section 871(m) and Treasury regulations promulgated\nthereunder (\u201cSection 871(m)\u201d) generally imposes a 30% withholding tax (or a lower rate under the dividend\nprovision of an\napplicable income tax treaty) on certain \u201cdividend equivalents\u201d paid or deemed paid with respect to\nderivatives linked to\nU.S.\n                                                    112                                                     \nstocks or indices that include U.S. stocks under certain circumstances,\neven in cases where the derivatives do not provide for payments explicitly linked to dividends. In general,\nthis withholding regime applies\nto derivatives that substantially replicate the economic performance of one or more underlying U.S. stocks,\nas determined when the derivative\nis issued, based on one of two tests set forth in the regulations. Moreover, the applicable Treasury\nregulations generally require a \u201clook\nthrough\u201d of certain partnerships (\u201cCovered Partnerships\u201d) that own stock of U.S. corporations. It would be\nprudent to\nassume that many of the Index Components that are treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes are Covered Partnerships.\nAccordingly, the applicable Treasury regulations can deem non-U.S. investors to be receiving dividend\nequivalents in respect of Index\nComponents that are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes and in respect of\nunderlying U.S. stocks owned by Index\nComponents, that are Covered Partnerships even if no payments on the New Notes are directly traceable to any\ndividends on those underlying\nstocks. Withholding in the latter instance would be based on the amount of dividends paid on underlying U.S.\nstocks owned by those Covered\nPartnerships during your ownership period. The aggregate amounts actually paid on those underlying U.S.\nstocks during the applicable quarter\nmay not be known until the following year, if at all. Based on certain factual determinations made by us, we\ncurrently believe that an\nestimate of the dividend equivalent amounts that are attributable to underlying U.S. stocks owned by Index\nComponents that are Covered\nPartnerships is 0.1157% of the Principal Amount per Coupon Payment (the \u201cEstimated Amount\u201d). We may change\nthis estimate in\nsubsequent years. In addition, a portion of each Coupon Amount will be treated as a \u201cdividend equivalent\u201d\nwith respect to\neach of Hess Midstream LP and Star Group LP, which portion we will provide upon request. You generally\nshould expect withholding agents\nto withhold from each Coupon Payment 30% (or a lower rate under the dividend provision of an applicable\nincome tax treaty) of (i) the\nEstimated Amount and (ii) the portion of the Coupon Payment attributable to dividend equivalents with\nrespect to Hess Midstream LP and\nStar Group LP, and also to withhold 30% (subject to possible reduction or elimination of that rate under the\n\u201cother income\u201d\nor similar provision of an applicable income tax treaty) of the remaining portion of the Coupon Payment, in\neach case assuming the income\nis not effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States, as described\nabove (in which case, in order\nto avoid withholding, you will likely be required to provide a properly completed IRS Form W-8ECI). Our\nestimate of the dividend equivalent\namounts may be based on historical dividends or other non-prospective data and may change from time to time.\nIf you sell or otherwise\ndispose of the New Notes between Coupon Payment Dates, you generally should expect withholding agents to\nwithhold 30% (or a lower rate\nunder the dividend provision of an applicable income tax treaty) of the estimated dividend equivalent\namounts attributable to the portion\nof the Coupon Amount that has accrued since the immediately preceding Coupon Payment Date.\n\nUnder applicable Treasury regulations, withholding\nagents who have under-withheld on certain dividend amounts may adjust any withholding prior to March 15 of\nthe following year without\npenalties. We will not provide any further information concerning the actual dividend equivalent amounts in\nany year, which may differ\nfrom our estimated dividend equivalent amounts in that year. If you are a Non-U.S. Holder, you should\nconsult your tax adviser regarding\nthe potential application of Code Section 871(m) to the New Notes.\n\nWe will not pay any additional amounts with respect\nto any withholding tax.\n\nNon-Exchanging Investors\n\nIf you do not tender your Old Notes pursuant to\nthe Exchange Offer or do not have your tender of the Old Notes accepted for purchase pursuant to the\nExchange Offer, you will not recognize\nany gain or loss in respect of your retained Old Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of\nthe Exchange Offer. Your tax\nbasis, holding period, and other attributes of your retained Old Notes will remain unchanged.\n\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting\n\nYou may be subject to information reporting. You\nmay also be subject to backup withholding on payments in respect of your Notes unless you provide proof of\nan applicable exemption or\na correct taxpayer identification number and otherwise comply with applicable requirements of the backup\nwithholding rules. If you are\na Non-U.S. Holder, you will not be subject to backup withholding if you\n                                                    113                                                     \nprovide a properly completed IRS Form W-8 appropriate to your circumstances.\nAmounts withheld under the backup withholding rules are not additional taxes and may be refunded or credited\nagainst your U.S. federal\nincome tax liability, provided the required information is furnished to the IRS.\n\nFATCA\n\nLegislation commonly referred to as \u201cFATCA,\u201d\nand regulations promulgated thereunder, generally impose a 30% withholding tax on payments to certain\nnon-U.S. entities (including financial\nintermediaries) unless various U.S. information reporting and due diligence requirements have been\nsatisfied. An intergovernmental agreement\nbetween the United States and the non-U.S. entity\u2019s jurisdiction may modify these requirements. This regime\napplies to dividend\nequivalents, any amounts treated as interest or other \u201cfixed or determinable annual or periodical\u201d\n(collectively, \u201cFDAP\u201d)\nincome for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and payments of gross proceeds of the sale or other taxable\ndisposition of a Note (including\nearly redemption, exchange or settlement at maturity). However, under regulations proposed in 2018 (the\npreamble to which specifies that\ntaxpayers are permitted to rely on them pending finalization), no withholding will apply to payments of\ngross proceeds (other than any\namounts treated as FDAP income). You should consult your tax adviser regarding the potential application of\nFATCA to the New Notes.\n\nWe will not pay any additional amounts with respect\nto any withholding tax.\n\nTHE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU OF OWNING AND DISPOSING OF THE NEW NOTES ARE UNCLEAR. This discussion, insofar\nas it describes statements of law, constitutes the full opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP regarding the\nmaterial U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of the new notes.YOU SHOULD CONSULT\nYOUR TAX ADVISER REGARDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF PARTICIPATING IN THE EXCHANGE OFFER AND OF OWNING AND\nDISPOSING OF THE NEW NOTES, INCLUDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES UNDER STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. AND OTHER TAX LAWS\nAND THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN U.S. FEDERAL OR OTHER TAX LAWS.\n                                                    114                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                           Benefit Plan Investor                                            \n                                               Considerations                                               \nA fiduciary of a pension, profit-sharing or other\nemployee benefit plan subject to Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended\n(\u201cERISA\u201d), including\nentities such as collective investment funds, partnerships and separate accounts whose underlying assets\ninclude the assets of such plans\n(collectively, \u201cERISA Plans\u201d) should consider the fiduciary standards of ERISA in the context of the ERISA\nPlan\u2019s particular\ncircumstances before authorizing a participation in the Exchange Offer. Among other factors, the fiduciary\nshould consider whether an\nexchange of the Old Notes for the New Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offer would satisfy the prudence and\ndiversification requirements\nof ERISA and would be consistent with the documents and instruments governing the ERISA Plan.\n\nSection 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), prohibit ERISA Plans, as well as plans (including individual\nretirement accounts\nand Keogh plans) subject to Section 4975 of the Code (together with ERISA Plans, \u201cPlans\u201d), from engaging in\ncertain transactions\ninvolving the \u201cplan assets\u201d with persons who are \u201cparties in interest\u201d under ERISA or \u201cdisqualified persons\u201d\nunder Section 4975 of the Code (in either case, referred to herein as \u201cParties in Interest\u201d) with respect to\nsuch Plans. As\na result of our businesses, we and our current and future affiliates may be Parties in Interest with respect\nto many Plans. Where we (or\none of our affiliates) is a Party in Interest with respect to a Plan (either directly or by reason of such\nentity\u2019s ownership interests\nin its directly or indirectly owned subsidiaries), the tender of the Old Notes and the acquisition and\nholding of the New Notes by or\non behalf of the Plan could be a prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of\nthe Code, unless statutory or\nadministrative exemptive relief were available.\n\nIn this regard, certain prohibited transaction\nclass exemptions (\u201cPTCEs\u201d) issued by the U.S. Department of Labor may provide exemptive relief for direct or\nindirect prohibited\ntransactions resulting from the tender of the Old Notes and for the acquisition and holding of the New\nNotes. Those class exemptions are\nPTCE 96-23 (for certain transactions determined by in-house asset managers), PTCE 95-60 (for certain\ntransactions involving insurance\ncompany general accounts), PTCE 91-38 (for certain transactions involving bank collective investment funds),\nPTCE 90-1 (for certain transactions\ninvolving insurance company separate accounts) and PTCE 84-14 (for certain transactions determined by\nindependent qualified asset managers).\nIn addition, ERISA Section 408(b)(17) and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code may provide a limited exemption\nfor the purchase and sale of\nthe securities and related lending transactions, provided that neither the issuer of the securities nor any\nof its affiliates have\nor exercise any discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the\nassets of the Plan involved in\nthe transaction and provided further that the Plan pays no more, and receives no less, than adequate\nconsideration in connection with\nthe transaction (the so-called \u201cservice provider exemption\u201d). There can be no assurance that any of these\nstatutory or class\nexemptions will be available with respect to transactions involving the Old Notes or the New Notes.\n\nAccordingly, the Old Notes may not be tendered\nin the Exchange Offer and the New Notes may not be acquired or held by any Plan, any entity whose underlying\nassets include \u201cplan\nassets\u201d by reason of any Plan\u2019s investment in the entity (a \u201cPlan Asset Entity\u201d) or any person investing\n\u201cplan\nassets\u201d of any Plan, unless such Plan, Plan Asset Entity or person is eligible for the exemptive relief\navailable under PTCE 96-23,\n95-60, 91-38, 90-1 or 84-14 or the service-provider exemption or there is some other basis on which the\ntender of the Old Notes and the\nacquisition and holding of the New Notes will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited\ntransaction under ERISA or Section 4975\nof the Code. Each Noteholder participating in the Exchange Offer will be deemed to have represented by its\ntender of the Old Notes that\n(a) it is not a Plan or a Plan Asset Entity and it is not exchanging the Old Notes for the New Notes on\nbehalf of or with \u201cplan\nassets\u201d of any Plan or a Plan Asset Entity or (b) its tender of the Old Notes and its acquisition, holding\nand subsequent disposition\nof the New Notes will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of\nERISA or Section 4975 of the\nCode.\n\nIn this regard, certain governmental plans (as\ndefined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans\n(as described in Section 4(b)(4)\nof ERISA) (collectively, \u201cNon-ERISA Arrangements\u201d) are not subject to the fiduciary responsibility or\nprohibited transaction\nrules of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, but may be subject to similar rules under other\n                                                    115                                                     \napplicable laws or regulations (\u201cSimilar Laws\u201d). Accordingly,\neach Noteholder participating in the Exchange Offer that is a Non-ERISA Arrangement shall be required to\nrepresent and be deemed to have\nrepresented by its tender of the Old Notes that its tender of the Old Notes and its acquisition, holding and\nsubsequent disposition of\nthe New Notes will not constitute or result in a violation of any applicable Similar Laws.\n\nDue to the complexity of these rules, it is particularly\nimportant that fiduciaries or other persons considering exchanging the Old Notes for the New Notes on behalf\nof or with \u201cplan assets\u201d\nof any Plan, Plan Asset Entity or Non-ERISA Arrangement consult with their counsel regarding the relevant\nprovisions of ERISA, the Code\nor applicable Similar Laws and the availability of exemptive relief under PTCE 96-23, 95-60, 91-38, 90-1,\n84-14, the service provider\nexemption or some other basis on which the tender of the Old Notes and the acquisition and holding of the\nNew Notes will not constitute\nor result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation of\nany applicable Similar Laws.\n\nThe New Notes are contractual financial instruments.\nThe financial exposure provided by the New Notes is not a substitute or proxy for, and is not intended as a\nsubstitute or proxy for, individualized\ninvestment management or advice for the benefit of any acquirer or holder of the New Notes. The New Notes\nhave not been designed and will\nnot be administered in a manner intended to reflect the individualized needs and objectives of any acquirer\nor holder of the New Notes.\n\nEach acquirer or holder of any New Notes acknowledges\nand agrees that:\n\n(i) the\nacquirer or holder or its fiduciary has made and shall make all investment decisions for the acquirer or\nholder and the acquirer or holder\nhas not relied and shall not rely in any way upon us or our affiliates to act as a fiduciary or adviser of\nthe acquirer or holder with\nrespect to (A) the design and terms of the New Notes, (B) the acquirer or holder\u2019s investment in the New\nNotes, or (C) the exercise\nof or failure to exercise any rights the acquirer or holder or we or any of our affiliates has under or with\nrespect to the New Notes;\n\n(ii) we\nand our affiliates have acted and will act solely for our own accounts in connection with (A) all\ntransactions relating to the New Notes\nand (B) all hedging transactions in connection with our or our affiliates\u2019 obligations under the New Notes;\n\n(iii) any\nand all assets and positions relating to hedging transactions by us or our affiliates are assets and\npositions of those entities and are\nnot assets and positions held for the benefit of the acquirer or holder;\n\n(iv) our\ninterests are adverse to the interests of the acquirer or holder; and\n\n(v) neither\nwe nor any of our affiliates is a fiduciary or adviser of the acquirer or holder in connection with any such\nassets, positions or transactions,\nand any information that we or any of our affiliates may provide is not intended to be impartial investment\nadvice.\n\nEach Noteholder participating in the Exchange Offer\nhas exclusive responsibility for ensuring that its tender of the Old Notes and acquisition, holding and\nsubsequent disposition of the\nNew Notes does not violate the fiduciary or prohibited transaction rules of ERISA, the Code or any\napplicable Similar Laws. The offer\nto exchange the Old Notes for the New Notes with respect to any Plan, Plan Asset Entity or Non-ERISA\nArrangement is in no respect a representation\nor advice by us or any of our affiliates or representatives as to whether such an exchange is appropriate\nfor, or meets all relevant legal\nrequirements with respect to investments by, Plans, Plan Asset Entities or Non-ERISA Arrangements generally\nor any particular Plan, Plan\nAsset Entity or Non-ERISA Arrangement.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nPursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law\n(\u201cDGCL\u201d), a corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party\nto any threatened,\npending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative\n(other than a derivative action\nby or in the right of such corporation) who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such\ncorporation, or serving at the request\nof such corporation in such capacity for another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other\nenterprise, against expenses\n(including attorneys\u2019 fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably\nincurred in connection with\nsuch action, suit or proceeding, if such person acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably\nbelieved to be in or not opposed\nto the best interests of such corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no\nreasonable cause to believe\nhis or her conduct was unlawful.\n\nThe DGCL also permits indemnification by a corporation\nunder similar circumstances for expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) actually and reasonably incurred by\nsuch persons in connection\nwith the defense or settlement of a derivative action, except that no indemnification shall be made in\nrespect of any claim, issue or\nmatter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to such corporation unless and only to\nthe extent that the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application\nthat such person is fairly and\nreasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such court shall deem proper.\n\nThe DGCL provides that the indemnification described\nabove shall not be deemed exclusive of any other indemnification that may be granted by a corporation\npursuant to its by-laws, disinterested\ndirectors\u2019 vote, stockholders\u2019 vote, agreement or otherwise.\n\nThe DGCL also provides corporations with the power\nto purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or\nagent of the corporation, or\nis or was serving at the request of the corporation in a similar capacity for another corporation,\npartnership, joint venture, trust or\nother enterprise, against any liability asserted against him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of\nhis or her status as such,\nwhether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability as\ndescribed above.\n\nThe certificate of incorporation of JPMorgan Chase\n& Co. (\u201cJPMorgan Chase\u201d) provides that, to the fullest extent that the DGCL as from time to time in effect\npermits the\nlimitation or elimination of the liability of directors, no director of JPMorgan Chase shall be personally\nliable to JPMorgan Chase or\nits stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s certificate of incorporation\nempowers JPMorgan Chase to indemnify any director, officer, employee or agent of JPMorgan Chase or any other\nperson who is serving at\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s request in any such capacity with another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or\nother enterprise (including,\nwithout limitation, any employee benefit plan) to the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL as from time\nto time in effect, and any\nsuch indemnification may continue as to any person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or\nagent and may inure to the benefit\nof the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s certificate of incorporation\nalso empowers JPMorgan Chase by action of its board of directors, notwithstanding any interest of the\ndirectors in the action, to purchase\nand maintain insurance in such amounts as the Board of Directors deems appropriate to protect any director,\nofficer, employee or agent\nof JPMorgan Chase or any other person who is serving at JPMorgan Chase\u2019s request in any such capacity with\nanother corporation,\npartnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including, without limitation, any employee benefit\nplan) against any liability\nasserted against him or her or incurred by him or her in any such capacity or arising out of his or her\nstatus as such (including, without\n                                                    II-1                                                    \nlimitation, expenses, judgments, fines (including\nany excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to any employee benefit plan) and amounts paid in\nsettlement) to the fullest extent\npermitted under the DGCL as from time to time in effect, whether or not JPMorgan Chase would have the power\nor be required to indemnify\nany such person under the terms of any agreement or by-law or the DGCL.\n\nIn addition, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s by-laws require\nJPMorgan Chase to indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, as from time to time in\neffect, any person who was\nor is involved in any manner (including, without limitation, as a party or witness), or is threatened to be\nmade so involved, in any threatened,\npending or completed investigation, claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,\nadministrative, or investigative (including\nwithout limitation, any action, suit or proceeding by or in the right of JPMorgan Chase to procure a\njudgment in its favor, but excluding\nany action, suit, or proceeding, or part thereof, brought by such person against JPMorgan Chase or any of\nits affiliates unless consented\nto by JPMorgan Chase) (a \u201cProceeding\u201d) by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer,\nor employee of\nJPMorgan Chase, or is or was serving at the request of JPMorgan Chase as a director, officer or employee of\nanother corporation, partnership,\njoint venture, trust or other enterprise, against all expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees), judgments, fines\nand amounts paid in\nsettlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with such Proceeding (or part\nthereof). The by-laws specify that\nthe right to indemnification so provided is a contract right, set forth certain procedural and evidentiary\nstandards applicable to the\nenforcement of a claim under the by-laws and entitle the persons to be indemnified to receive payment in\nadvance of any expenses incurred\nin connection with such Proceeding, consistent with the provisions of applicable law, as from time to time\nin effect. Such provisions,\nhowever, are intended to be in furtherance and not in limitation of the general right to indemnification\nprovided in the by-laws, which\nright of indemnification and of advancement of expenses is not exclusive of any other rights to which a\nperson seeking indemnification\nmay otherwise be entitled, under any statute, by-law, agreement, vote or otherwise.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s by-laws also provide that\nJPMorgan Chase may enter into contracts with any director, officer or employee of JPMorgan Chase in\nfurtherance of the indemnification\nprovisions in the by-laws, as well as create a trust fund, grant a security interest or use other means\n(including, without limitation,\na letter of credit) to ensure payment of amounts indemnified.\n\nLastly, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s by-laws also provide\nthat any repeal or modification of the indemnification rights provided in the by-laws shall not adversely\naffect any right or protection\nthereunder of any person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or\nmodification.\n\nThe foregoing statements are subject to the detailed\nprovisions of Section 145 of the DGCL and the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of JPMorgan Chase.\n\nJPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC\n\nPursuant to Section 18-108 of the Delaware Limited\nLiability Company Act, a Delaware limited liability company is empowered to indemnify and hold harmless any\nmember or manager or other\npersons from and against all claims and demands whatsoever.\n\nThe limited liability company agreement of JPMorgan\nChase Financial Company LLC (\u201cJPMorgan Financial\u201d) provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by the\nlaws of the State\nof Delaware, no member, manager or officer shall be liable to JPMorgan Financial or any other member for any\nloss, damage or claim incurred\nby reason of any act or omission performed or omitted by such member, manager or officer in good faith on\nbehalf of JPMorgan Financial\nand in a manner reasonably believed to be within the scope of the authority conferred on such member,\nmanager or officer by the limited\nliability company agreement.\n\nJPMorgan Financial\u2019s limited liability company\nagreement provides that each person (and the heirs, executors or administrators of such person) who was or\nis a party or is threatened\nto be made a party to, or is involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding,\nwhether civil, criminal, administrative\nor investigative (hereinafter a \u201cproceeding\u201d), by reason of the fact that such person is or was a member,\nmanager or officer,\nor is or was serving at the request of JPMorgan Financial as a manager, director, officer, or trustee of\nanother company, corporation\nor of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee\nbenefit plan (hereinafter\nan \u201cindemnitee\u201d), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a\nmember, manager, director,\nofficer or trustee, or in any other capacity while serving as a member, manager,\n                                                    II-2                                                    \ndirector, officer, or trustee, shall be indemnified\nand held harmless by JPMorgan Financial to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Delaware\nfor members, managers and\nofficers of limited liability companies formed under the laws of the State of Delaware, as then in effect,\nagainst all expense, liability\nand loss (including attorneys\u2019 fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in\nsettlement) reasonably\nincurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith; provided, however, that JPMorgan Financial\nshall indemnify\nany such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if\nsuch proceeding (or part thereof)\nwas authorized by JPMorgan Financial\u2019s board of managers.\n\nIn addition, JPMorgan Financial\u2019s limited\nliability company agreement provides that an indemnitee shall have the right to be paid by JPMorgan\nFinancial the expenses (including\nattorney\u2019s fees) incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter\nan \u201cadvancement\nof expenses\u201d);
