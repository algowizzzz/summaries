If one of these events   \n      occurs and we are not the successor in the transaction, the successor will  \n      be required to assume our responsibilities relating to the debt securities  \n      and the indentures.                                                         \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      The indentures provide that holders of a majority of the total principal    \n      amount of outstanding debt securities of                                    \n      any series may vote to change certain of our obligations or certain of      \n      your rights concerning the debt securities of that series. However, to      \n      change the amount or timing of principal, interest or other payments under  \n      the debt securities of a series,                                            \n      every holder in the series affected by the change must consent.             \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      If an event of default (as described below) occurs with respect to any      \n      series of debt securities, the trustee or                                   \n      holders of 25% of the outstanding principal amount of that series may       \n      declare the principal amount of the series immediately payable. However,    \n      holders of a majority of the principal amount may rescind this action.      \n                                                                                  \nGeneral Indenture Provisions that Apply Only to Senior Debt Securities\n\nWe have agreed in the senior indenture that we and our subsidiaries will not sell,\nassign, transfer, grant a security interest in or otherwise\ndispose of the voting stock of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which we refer to as the\n\u0093Bank\u0094, and that the Bank will not issue its voting stock, unless the sale or\nissuance is for fair market value and we and our subsidiaries would own at\nleast 80% of the voting stock of the Bank following the sale or issuance. This\ncovenant would not prevent us from completing a merger, consolidation or sale of\nsubstantially all of our assets. In addition, this covenant would not prevent the\nmerger\nor consolidation of the Bank into another domestic bank if JPMorgan Chase and its\nsubsidiaries would own at least 80% of the voting stock of the successor entity\nafter the merger or consolidation.\n\n4\n\nIf we satisfy certain conditions in the senior indenture, we may discharge that\nindenture at any\ntime by depositing with the trustee sufficient funds or government obligations to\npay the senior debt securities when due.\n\nEvents of Default.

We will determine\nthe dividend, voting, conversion and other rights of the series being offered, and\nthe\nterms and conditions relating to the offering and sale of the series, at the time\nof the offer and sale. We may also issue preferred stock that will be represented\nby depositary shares.\n\nCommon Stock\n\nWe may use this prospectus\nand an applicable prospectus supplement to offer our common stock, par value $1\nper share. Subject to the rights of holders of our preferred stock, holders of our\ncommon stock are entitled to receive dividends when declared by our board of\ndirectors\n(which may also refer to a board committee). Each holder of common stock is\nentitled to one vote per share. The holders of common stock have no preemptive\nrights or cumulative voting rights.\n\nWarrants\n\nWe may use this prospectus and\nan applicable prospectus supplement to offer warrants for the purchase of debt\nsecurities, preferred stock or common stock, which we refer to as \u0093warrants.\u0094 We\nmay issue warrants independently or together with other securities.\n\nUnits\n\nWe may use this prospectus and an\napplicable prospectus supplement to offer any combination of debt securities,\npreferred stock, depositary shares, common stock and warrants issued by us, debt\nobligations or other\n\n5\n\nsecurities of an entity affiliated or not affiliated with us or other property\ntogether as units.

We conduct substantially all of our operations through subsidiaries,\nincluding the Bank and the IHC. As a result, claims of the holders of our\nsecurities will generally have a junior position to claims of creditors of our\nsubsidiaries. Claims of our subsidiaries\u0092 creditors other than JPMorgan Chase\ninclude substantial amounts of deposit liabilities, long-term debt and other\nliabilities. In addition, we are obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially\nall the\nnet proceeds that we receive from the issuance of securities (including any\nsecurities offered by use of this prospectus), and the ability of the Bank and the\nIHC to make payments to us is limited. As a result of these arrangements, our\nability to\nmake various payments is dependent on our receiving dividends from the Bank and\ndividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. These limitations could affect\nour ability to pay interest on our debt securities, pay dividends on our preferred\nstock\nand common stock, redeem or repurchase outstanding securities, and fulfill our\nother payment obligations.\n\nConflicts of Interest\n\nWe own directly or indirectly all the outstanding equity securities of J.P.

We do not undertake to\nupdate any forward-looking statements.

General corporate purposes may include investments in our subsidiaries,\npayments of\ndividends to us, extensions of credit to us or our subsidiaries or the financing\nof possible acquisitions or business expansion. Net proceeds may be temporarily\ninvested pending application for their stated purpose. Interest on our debt\nsecurities\n(including interest on the debt securities offered by use of this prospectus) and\ndividends on our equity securities (including dividends on the preferred stock or\ncommon stock offered by use of this prospectus), as well as redemptions or\nrepurchases of our outstanding securities, will be made using amounts we receive\nas dividends or extensions of credit from the IHC or as dividends from the Bank.\n\n10\n\nDESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES\n\nGeneral\n\nWe have described below some\ngeneral terms that may apply to the debt securities we may offer by use of this\nprospectus and an applicable prospectus supplement. We will describe the\nparticular terms of any debt securities we offer to you in the prospectus\nsupplement relating to\nthose debt securities.\n\nThe debt securities will be either senior debt securities or subordinated debt\nsecurities. The senior debt\nsecurities will be issued under the senior indenture, and the subordinated debt\nsecurities will be issued under the subordinated indenture. The debt securities\nand the indentures are governed by the laws of the State of New York.\n\nThe following summary is not complete. You should refer to the indentures, copies\nof which are exhibits to the registration statement.\n\nThe indentures do not limit the amount of debt securities that we may issue. Each\nof the indentures provides that we may issue debt securities\nup to the principal amount we authorize from time to time. The senior debt\nsecurities will be unsecured and will have the same rank as all of our other\nunsecured and unsubordinated debt. The subordinated debt securities will be\nunsecured and will be\nsubordinated and junior to all Senior Indebtedness as defined below under \u0093\u0097\nSubordinated Debt Securities \u0097 Subordination.\u0094\n\nWe are a holding company that holds the stock of the Bank and the IHC. We conduct\nsubstantially all of our operations through subsidiaries,\nincluding the Bank and the IHC. As a result, claims of the holders of our\nsecurities will generally have a junior position to claims of creditors of our\nsubsidiaries. Claims of our subsidiaries\u0092 creditors other than JPMorgan Chase\ninclude\nsubstantial amounts of deposit liabilities, long-term debt and other liabilities.\nIn addition, we are obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net\nproceeds that we receive from the issuance of securities (including any securities\noffered by use of this prospectus), and the ability of the Bank and the IHC to\nmake payments to us is limited. As a result of these arrangements, our ability to\nmake various payments is dependent on our receiving dividends from the Bank and\ndividends and extensions of credit from the IHC.

Original issue discount debt securities will bear no\ninterest or will bear interest at a below-market rate and will be sold at a\ndiscount below their stated principal amount. The prospectus supplement will\ncontain any special tax, accounting or other information relating to original\nissue discount\ndebt securities. If we offer other kinds of debt securities, including debt\nsecurities linked to an index or payable in currencies other than U.S. dollars,\nthe prospectus supplement relating to those debt securities will also contain any\nspecial\ntax, accounting or other information relating to those debt securities.\n\nWe will issue the debt securities only in registered form without\ncoupons. The indentures permit us to issue debt securities of a series in\ncertificated form or in permanent global form. You will not be required to pay a\nservice charge for any transfer or exchange of debt securities, but we may require\npayment of\nany taxes or other governmental charges.\n\nWe will pay principal of, and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the debt\nsecurities at\nthe corporate trust office in New York City of our paying agent, The Bank of New\nYork Mellon, or any successor paying agent that we may designate. You may also\nmake transfers or exchanges of debt securities at that location. We also have the\nright\nto pay interest on any debt securities by check mailed to the registered holders\nof the debt securities at their registered addresses. In connection with any\npayment on a debt security, we may require the holder to certify information to\nus. In the\nabsence of that certification, we may rely on any legal presumption to enable us\nto determine our responsibilities, if any, to deduct or withhold taxes,\nassessments or governmental charges from the payment.\n\nThe indentures do not limit our ability to enter into a highly leveraged\ntransaction or provide you with any special protection in the event\nof such a transaction. In addition, neither of the indentures provides special\nprotection in the event of a sudden or dramatic decline in our credit quality\nresulting from a takeover, recapitalization or similar restructuring of JPMorgan\nChase.\n\nWe may issue debt securities upon the exercise of warrants or upon exchange or\nconversion of exchangeable or convertible debt securities. The\nprospectus supplement will describe the specific terms of any of those warrants or\nexchangeable or convertible securities. It will also describe the specific terms\nof the debt securities or other securities issuable upon the exercise, exchange or\nconversion of those securities. See \u0093Description of Warrants\u0094 below.\n\nEach of the indentures contains a provision that, if made\napplicable to any series of senior or subordinated debt securities, respectively,\npermits us to elect:\n                                                                                  \n      defeasance, which would discharge us from all of our obligations (subject   \n      to limited exceptions) with respect to                                      \n      any debt securities of that series then outstanding, and/or                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      covenant defeasance, which would release us from our obligations under      \n      specified covenants, including, with                                        \n      respect to any series of senior securities, the covenant described under    \n      \u0093Senior Debt Securities\u0097Limitation on Disposition of Stock of the Bank\u0094.       \n                                                                                  \n12\n\nTo make either of the above elections, we must deposit in trust with the\nrespective trustee money\nand/or U.S. government obligations (as defined below) which, through the payment\nof principal and interest in accordance with their terms, will provide sufficient\nmoney, without reinvestment, to repay in full those senior or subordinated debt\nsecurities, as the case may be. As used in the indentures, \u0093U.S. government\nobligations\u0094 are: (1) direct obligations of the United States or of an agency or\ninstrumentality of the United States, in either case that are, or are guaranteed\nas, full faith and credit obligations of the United States and that are not\nredeemable by the issuer; and (2) certain depositary receipts with respect to an\nobligation referred to in clause (1).\n\nAs a condition to defeasance or covenant defeasance, we must deliver to the\ntrustee an opinion of counsel that the holders of the senior or\nsubordinated debt securities, as the case may be, will not recognize income, gain,\nor loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of the defeasance or covenant\ndefeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amount, in the\nsame\nmanner and at the same times as would have been the case if defeasance or covenant\ndefeasance had not occurred. That opinion, in the case of defeasance but not\ncovenant defeasance, must refer to and be based upon a ruling received by us from,\nor\npublished by, the Internal Revenue Service or be based upon a change in applicable\nfederal income tax law.\n\nIf we exercise our covenant\ndefeasance option with respect to a particular series of debt securities, then\neven if there were a default under the defeased covenant, payment of those debt\nsecurities could not be accelerated. We may exercise our defeasance option with\nrespect to\na particular series of debt securities even if we previously had exercised our\ncovenant defeasance option. If we exercise our defeasance option, payment of those\ndebt securities may not be accelerated because of any event of default. If we\nexercise\nour covenant defeasance option and an acceleration were to occur, the realizable\nvalue at the acceleration date of the money and U.S. government obligations in the\ndefeasance trust could be less than the principal and interest then due on those\ndebt\nsecurities. This is because the required deposit of money and/or U.S. government\nobligations in the defeasance trust is based upon scheduled cash flows rather than\nmarket value, which will vary depending upon interest rates and other factors.\n\nWe and the trustee under each indenture may modify that indenture with the consent\nof the holders of not less than a majority in principal\namount of outstanding debt securities of any series issued under that indenture\naffected by the modification. However, without the consent of each affected\nholder, no such modification may:\n                                                        \n      change the stated maturity of any debt security;  \n                                                        \n                                                                                  \n      reduce the principal amount of, or premium, if any, on, any debt security;

and\n\n(4) other specified conditions are met.\n\nIn addition, each indenture allows us, without the consent of the holders of the\ndebt securities of any series issued under that indenture, to\nconvey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to one or more of\nour subsidiaries.\n\nSenior Debt Securities\n\nThe senior debt securities will be direct, unsecured general obligations of\nJPMorgan Chase and will constitute Senior Indebtedness of JPMorgan\nChase. For a definition of \u0093Senior Indebtedness,\u0094 see \u0093\u0097 Subordinated Debt\nSecurities \u0097 Subordination\u0094 below.\n\nLimitation on Disposition of Stock of the Bank. Unless otherwise specified in the\nprospectus supplement relating to a particular series\nof debt securities, the senior indenture contains a covenant by us that, so long\nas any of the senior debt securities are outstanding, neither we nor any\nIntermediate Subsidiary (as defined below) will sell, assign, grant a security\ninterest in or\notherwise dispose of any shares of voting stock of the Bank, or any securities\nconvertible into, or options, warrants or rights to purchase shares of voting\nstock of the Bank, except to JPMorgan Chase or an Intermediate Subsidiary. In\naddition, the\ncovenant provides that neither we nor any Intermediate\n\n14\n\nSubsidiary will permit the Bank to issue any shares of its voting stock, or\nsecurities convertible into, or options, warrants or rights to purchase shares of\nits voting stock, nor will we permit\nany Intermediate Subsidiary that owns any shares of voting stock of the Bank, or\nsecurities convertible into, or options, warrants or rights to purchase shares of\nthe Bank\u0092s voting stock, to cease to be an Intermediate Subsidiary.\n\nThe above covenant is subject to our rights in connection with a consolidation or\nmerger of JPMorgan Chase with another entity or a\nconveyance, transfer or lease of all or substantially all of our assets to another\nentity. The covenant also will not apply if both:\n\n(1) the disposition in question is made for fair market value, as determined by\nthe board of directors of JPMorgan Chase or the\nIntermediate Subsidiary; and\n\n(2) after giving effect to the disposition, we and any one or more of our\nIntermediate\nSubsidiaries will collectively own at least 80% of the issued and outstanding\nvoting stock of the Bank or any successor to the Bank, free and clear of any\nsecurity interest.\n\nThe above covenant also does not restrict the Bank from being consolidated with or\nmerged into another domestic banking institution if, after\nthe merger or consolidation, (A) JPMorgan Chase, or its successor, and any one or\nmore Intermediate Subsidiaries own at least 80% of the voting stock of the\nresulting bank and (B) treating for purposes of the senior indenture the resulting\nbank as\nthe Bank, no covenant breach, event of default or event which, after notice or\nlapse of time or both, would become a covenant breach or event of default, shall\nhave happened and be continuing.\n\nThe senior indenture defines an \u0093Intermediate Subsidiary\u0094 as a subsidiary (1) that\nis organized under the laws of any domestic\njurisdiction and (2) of which all the shares of capital stock, and all securities\nconvertible into, and options, warrants and rights to purchase shares of capital\nstock, are owned directly by JPMorgan Chase, free and clear of any security\ninterest.\nAs used above, \u0093voting stock\u0094 means a class of stock having general voting power\nunder ordinary circumstances to elect at least a majority of the board of\ndirectors, managers or trustees irrespective of the happening of a contingency.\n\nDefaults andWaivers. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement, under the senior indenture, any one of\nthe following events will be an event of default with respect to the senior debt\nsecurities of any series:\n\n(1) default in\nthe payment of principal of (or premium, if any, on) any senior debt securities of\nthat series and continuance of that default for 30 days;\n\n(2) default in the payment of interest on any senior debt securities of that\nseries and continuance of that default for 30\ndays;\n\n(3) specified events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of JPMorgan\nChase; and\n\n(4) any other event of default specified with respect to senior debt securities of\nthat series.\n\nSenior debt securities issued by us prior to December 31, 2016 (the \u0093Pre-2017\nSenior Debt\u0094) contain events of default that are\ndifferent from those set forth above. In particular:\n                                                                                  \n      The events of default applicable to the Pre-2017 Senior Debt do not         \n      provide for a 30-day cure period with respect                               \n      to any failure by us to pay the principal of those senior debt securities;  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      Most series of Pre-2017 Senior Debt contain an additional event of default  \n      that is applicable if we fail to                                            \n      perform any of the covenants contained in the terms and conditions of, or   \n      the governing instrument for, those senior debt securities and that         \n      failure continues for 90 days; and                                          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      The events of default applicable to certain series of Pre-2017 Senior Debt  \n      provide that specified events of                                            \n      bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.       \n      would constitute an event of default with respect to those senior debt      \n      securities.                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n15\n\nAccordingly, if we fail to pay the principal of any series of Pre-2017 Senior Debt\nwhen due, the\nholders of such senior debt securities would be entitled to declare their\nsecurities due and payable immediately, whereas holders of the senior debt\nsecurities of any series would not be entitled to accelerate those senior debt\nsecurities until 30\ndays after our failure to pay the principal of those senior debt securities. In\naddition, holders of the senior debt securities will not have the benefit of the\nadditional events of default described above that are applicable to the Pre-2017\nSenior\nDebt.\n\nUnder the senior indenture, if any event of default with respect to the senior\ndebt securities of any series occurs and is\ncontinuing, either the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in principal\namount of the outstanding senior debt securities of that series may declare the\nprincipal amount (or, if the senior debt securities of that series are original\nissue\ndiscount senior debt securities, a specified portion of the principal amount) of\nall senior debt securities of that series to be due and payable immediately. No\nsuch declaration is required upon certain specified events of bankruptcy,\ninsolvency or\nreorganization. Subject to the conditions set forth in the senior indenture, the\nholders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding senior debt\nsecurities of that series may annul the declaration and waive past defaults,\nexcept uncured\npayment defaults and other specified defaults.\n\nWe will describe in the prospectus supplement any particular provisions relating\nto the\nacceleration of the maturity of a portion of the principal amount of original\nissue discount senior debt securities upon an event of default.\n\nSubordinated Debt Securities\n\nThe\nsubordinated debt securities will be direct, unsecured general obligations of\nJPMorgan Chase. The subordinated debt securities will be subordinate and junior in\nright of payment to all Senior Indebtedness.\n\nUnless otherwise provided in the prospectus supplement relating to a particular\nseries of subordinated debt securities, holders of the\nsubordinated debt securities may not accelerate the maturity of the subordinated\ndebt securities, except in the event of our bankruptcy, reorganization or\ninsolvency, and may not accelerate the subordinated debt securities if we fail to\npay\nprincipal or interest or fail to perform any other agreement in the subordinated\ndebt securities or the subordinated indenture. See \u0093\u0097 Defaults and Waivers\u0094 below.\n\nSubordination. The subordinated debt securities will be subordinate and junior in\nright of payment to all Senior Indebtedness whether\noutstanding on the date the subordinated indenture became effective or created,\nassumed or incurred after that date.\n\nThe subordinated\nindenture defines \u0093Senior Indebtedness\u0094 to mean the principal of, and premium, if\nany, and interest on all of our indebtedness for money borrowed, including all\nindebtedness for money borrowed by another person that we guarantee; similar\nobligations arising from off-balance sheet guarantees and direct credit\nsubstitutes; all obligations for claims in respect of derivative products such as\ninterest rate and foreign exchange contracts, commodity contracts and similar\narrangements; and\nany deferrals, renewals or extensions of any of the foregoing. However, Senior\nIndebtedness does not include indebtedness that is stated not to be senior to or\nto have the same rank as the subordinated debt securities or other securities\nhaving the\nsame rank as or that are subordinated to the subordinated debt securities. In\nparticular, Senior Indebtedness does not include (A) the subordinated debt\nsecurities issued under the subordinated indenture, (B) the subordinated\nindebtedness\nissued under the amended and restated indenture, dated as of December 15, 1992, as\namended, between us and U.S. Bank Trust National Association, as trustee, (C) the\nsubordinated indebtedness issued under the indenture, dated as of October 21,\n2010,\nbetween us and U.S. Bank Trust National Association, as trustee, and (D) other\ndebt of JPMorgan Chase that is expressly stated to have the same rank as or not to\nrank senior to the subordinated debt securities or other securities having the\nsame\nrank as or that are subordinated to the subordinated debt securities.\n\n16\n\nUnder the subordinated indenture, we may not make any payment on the subordinated\ndebt securities\nin the event:\n                                                                                  \n      we have failed to make full payment of all amounts of principal, and        \n      premium, if any, and interest, if any, due                                  \n      on all Senior Indebtedness; or                                              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      there shall exist any event of default on any Senior Indebtedness           \n      permitting the holders thereof to accelerate                                \n      the maturity thereof or any event which, with notice or lapse of time or    \n      both, would become such an event of default.                                \n                                                                                  \nIn addition, upon our dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization\n(whether in bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership proceedings or\notherwise) we must pay to the holders of Senior Indebtedness the full amounts of\nprincipal of, and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the Senior\nIndebtedness before any payment or distribution is made on the subordinated debt\nsecurities.\n\nNo series of our subordinated debt securities (other than our outstanding junior\nsubordinated indebtedness) is subordinated to any other\nseries of subordinated debt securities or to any other subordinated indebtedness\nof JPMorgan Chase referred to above. However, due to the subordination provisions\nof the various series of subordinated indebtedness issued by us and our\npredecessor\ninstitutions, in the event of our dissolution, winding-up, liquidation,\nreorganization or insolvency, holders of the subordinated debt securities that may\nbe offered by use of this prospectus and an applicable prospectus supplement may\nrecover less,\nratably, than holders of some of our other series of outstanding subordinated\nindebtedness and more, ratably, than holders of other series of our outstanding\nsubordinated indebtedness. In addition, holders of the subordinated debt\nsecurities\nmay be fully subordinated to interests held by the U.S. government in the event\nthat we enter into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation or similar proceeding.\n\nNo Limitation on Disposition of Voting Stock of the Bank. The subordinated\nindenture does not contain a covenant prohibiting us from\nselling or otherwise disposing of any shares of voting stock of the Bank, or\nsecurities convertible into, or options, warrants or rights to purchase shares of\nvoting stock of the Bank. The subordinated indenture also does not prohibit the\nBank from\nissuing any shares of its voting stock or securities convertible into, or options,\nwarrants or rights to purchase shares of its voting stock.\n\nDefaults and Waivers. Unless otherwise specified in the prospectus supplement\nrelating to a particular series of subordinated debt\nsecurities, the subordinated indenture defines an event of default with respect to\nany series of subordinated debt securities as follows:\n                                                                                  \n      specified events of bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency of JPMorgan    \n      Chase; and                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      any other event specified with respect to subordinated debt securities of   \n      that series.                                                                \n                                                                                  \nIf any event of default with respect to subordinated debt securities of any series\noccurs and is continuing, either the trustee or the holders\nof not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding subordinated debt\nsecurities of that series may declare the principal amount (or, if the\nsubordinated debt securities of that series are original issue discount\nsubordinated debt\nsecurities, a specified portion of the principal amount) of all subordinated debt\nsecurities of that series to be due and payable immediately. No such declaration\nis required upon certain specified events of bankruptcy, reorganization or\ninsolvency.\nSubject to the conditions set forth in the subordinated indenture, the holders of\na majority in principal amount of the outstanding subordinated debt securities of\nthat series may annul the declaration and waive past defaults, except uncured\npayment\ndefaults.\n\nWe will describe in the prospectus supplement any particular provisions relating\nto the acceleration of the maturity of a\nportion of the principal amount of original issue discount subordinated debt\nsecurities upon an event of default. In the event of the bankruptcy, liquidation,\nreorganization or insolvency of JPMorgan Chase, any right to enforce that payment\nin cash\nwould be subject to the broad equity powers of a federal bankruptcy court and to\nits determination of the nature and status of the payment claims of the holders of\nthe subordinated debt securities.\n\n17\n\nUnless otherwise provided in the prospectus supplement relating to a particular\nseries of\nsubordinated debt securities, there will be no right of acceleration of the\npayment of principal of the subordinated debt securities of that series upon a\ndefault in the payment of principal or interest or a default in the performance of\nany\ncovenant or agreement in the subordinated debt securities or the subordinated\nindenture. In the event of a default in the payment of principal or interest or a\ndefault in the performance of any covenant or agreement in the subordinated debt\nsecurities or the subordinated indenture, the trustee may, subject to specified\nlimitations and conditions, seek to enforce that payment or the performance of\nthat covenant or agreement.\n\nCovenant Breach\n\nUnder each indenture, a\n\u0093covenant breach\u0094 would occur with respect to the debt securities of any series\nissued under that indenture if we fail to perform or breach any of the covenants\ncontained in that indenture (in the case of the senior indenture, other than a\nfailure to pay principal of or interest on the senior debt securities) and that\nfailure or breach continues for 90 days after the trustee under that indenture or\nthe holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding debt\nsecurities\nof that series give written notice of that failure or breach. Under each\nindenture, neither the trustee nor the holders of the debt securities will be\nentitled to accelerate the maturity of the debt securities as a result of any\ncovenant breach.\n\nIf a covenant breach or event of default with respect to the debt securities of\nany series occurs and is continuing, the relevant trustee\nmay in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of\nthe holders of those debt securities by such appropriate judicial proceedings as\nthe trustee deems most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether\nfor\nthe specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in the relevant indenture,\nin aid of the exercise of any power granted in that indenture, or to enforce any\nother proper remedy.\n\nLimitation of Suits\n\nUnder each\nindenture, a holder of the debt securities of any series issued under that\nindenture will not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to that\nindenture or those debt securities unless:\n                                                                                  \n      the holder has given the trustee written notice of a continuing covenant    \n      breach or event of default with respect                                     \n      to those debt securities;                                                   \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of those debt          \n      securities at the time outstanding have made a                              \n      written request to the trustee to institute proceedings in respect of the   \n      covenant breach or event of default, and offered the trustee indemnity      \n      reasonably satisfactory to it; and                                          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      the trustee has not received from the holders of a majority in principal    \n      amount of those debt securities at the                                      \n      time outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and has        \n      failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such  \n      notice, request and offer of indemnity.                                     \n                                                                                  \nThe foregoing limitations will not apply to any suit instituted by holders of the\ndebt securities for the enforcement of any payment of\nprincipal or interest on or after the date when due.\n\nOther Provisions of the Indentures\n\nEach of the indentures requires the relevant trustee, within 90 days after the\noccurrence of a default known to it with respect to the debt\nsecurities of any series issued under that indenture, to give the holders of those\ndebt securities notice of the default if uncured or not waived. The trustee may\nwithhold the notice if it determines in good faith that the withholding of the\nnotice\nis in the interest of those holders. However, the trustee may not withhold the\nnotice in the case of a default in the payment of principal or interest. The\ntrustee may not give the above notice until at least 60 days after the occurrence\nof a\ndefault in the performance of a covenant in the indenture, other than, in the case\nof the senior indenture, a covenant to pay principal of or interest on the senior\ndebt securities. The term \u0093default\u0094 for the purpose of this provision\nmeans any event that is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, a\ncovenant breach or event of default with respect to the debt securities.\n\n18\n\nOther than the duty to act with the required standard of care during a default,\nthe trustee under\neach of the indentures is not obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers\nunder that indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders of the debt\nsecurities issued under that indenture, unless the holders have offered to the\ntrustee\nreasonable security or indemnity. Each of the indentures provides that the holders\nof a majority in principal amount of the debt securities issued under that\nindenture may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for\nany remedy\navailable to the trustee, or exercising any trust or other power conferred on the\ntrustee. However, the trustee may decline to act if the direction is contrary to\nlaw or the indenture, and the trustee may take any other action deemed proper by\nthe\ntrustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.\n\nEach of the indentures includes a covenant requiring us to file annually with the\nrelevant trustee a certificate stating that there exists no covenant breach, event\nof default or event that is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would\nbecome, a covenant breach or event of default under the relevant indenture, or if\nany such\ndefault exists, specifying such default.\n\nInformation Concerning The Trustees\n\nWe and our subsidiaries may maintain deposits or conduct other banking\ntransactions with the trustees under the senior indenture and the\nsubordinated indenture in the ordinary course of business. Deutsche Bank Trust\nCompany Americas is a trustee under certain of our existing indentures pursuant to\nwhich we have issued and outstanding series of senior debt securities. U.S. Bank\nTrust National Association is a trustee under certain of our existing indentures\npursuant to which we have issued and outstanding series of subordinated debt\nsecurities.\n\nInsolvency and Resolution Considerations\n\nThe debt securities offered by use of this prospectus constitute \u0093loss-absorbing\ncapacity\u0094 within the meaning of the rules issued by\nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the \u0093Federal Reserve\u0094).\nFederal Reserve rules require that JPMorgan Chase & Co. (the \u0093Parent Company\u0094)\nmaintain minimum levels of unsecured external long-term debt and\nother loss-absorbing capacity with specific terms for purposes of recapitalizing\nJPMorgan Chase\u0092s operating subsidiaries if the Parent Company were to enter into a\nresolution either:\n                                                                                  \n      in a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,    \n      or                                                                          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      in a receivership administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance             \n      Corporation (\u0093FDIC\u0094) under Title II of                                        \n      the Dodd-Frank Act (\u0093Title II\u0094).                                              \n                                                                                  \nIf the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution, holders of the debt\nsecurities offered by use of this prospectus and other debt and equity securities\nof the Parent Company will absorb the losses of the Parent Company and its\nsubsidiaries.\n\nThe preferred \u0093single point of entry\u0094 strategy under JPMorgan Chase\u0092s resolution\nplan contemplates that only the Parent Company\nwould enter bankruptcy proceedings. JPMorgan Chase\u0092s subsidiaries would be\nrecapitalized, as needed, so that they could continue normal operations or\nsubsequently be divested or wound down in an orderly manner. As a result, the\nParent\nCompany\u0092s losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed\nfirst on holders of the Parent Company\u0092s equity securities and thereafter on its\nunsecured creditors, including holders of the debt securities offered by use of\nthis prospectus and other debt securities. Claims of holders of those securities\nwould have a junior position to the claims of creditors of JPMorgan Chase\u0092s\nsubsidiaries and to the claims of priority (as determined by statute) and secured\ncreditors of the Parent Company.\n\nAccordingly, in a resolution of the Parent Company in bankruptcy, holders of the\ndebt securities offered\nby use of this prospectus and other debt securities of the Parent Company would\nrealize value only to the extent\n\n19\n\navailable to the Parent Company as a shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and\nits other subsidiaries, and only after any claims of priority and secured\ncreditors of the Parent Company have\nbeen fully repaid.\n\nThe FDIC has similarly indicated that a single-point-of-entry recapitalization\nmodel could be a desirable strategy to\nresolve a systemically important financial institution, such as the Parent\nCompany, under Title II. However, the FDIC has not formally adopted any specific\nresolution strategy.\n\nIf the Parent Company were to approach, or enter into, a resolution, none of the\nParent Company, the Federal Reserve or the FDIC is obligated\nto follow JPMorgan Chase\u0092s preferred resolution strategy, and losses to holders of\nthe debt securities offered by use of this prospectus and other debt and equity\nsecurities of the Parent Company, under whatever strategy is ultimately followed,\ncould be greater than they might have been under JPMorgan Chase\u0092s preferred\nstrategy.\n\n20\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED STOCK\n\nGeneral\n\nUnder our certificate of\nincorporation, our board of directors is authorized, without further stockholder\naction, to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $1 par value per\nshare, in one or more series, and to determine the voting powers and the\ndesignations,\npreferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and\nqualifications, limitations or restrictions of each series.

The following summary is not complete.\nYou should also refer to our certificate of incorporation and to the certificate\nof\ndesignations relating to the series of the preferred stock being offered for the\ncomplete terms of that series of preferred stock. A form of certificate of\ndesignations is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement. We will file\nthe\ncertificate of designations with respect to the particular series of preferred\nstock being offered with the SEC promptly after the offering of that series of\npreferred stock.\n\nThe preferred stock will, when issued against full payment of the purchase price\nrelating to a series of preferred stock, be fully paid and\nnonassessable. Unless otherwise specified in the prospectus supplement, in the\nevent we liquidate, dissolve or wind-up our business, each series of preferred\nstock being offered will have the same rank as to dividends and distributions as\nour\ncurrently outstanding preferred stock and each other series of preferred stock we\nmay offer in the future by use of this prospectus and an applicable prospectus\nsupplement. The preferred stock will have no preemptive rights.\n\nDividend Rights\n\nHolders of the preferred\nstock offered by use of this prospectus and an applicable prospectus supplement\nwill be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our board of directors or\nany duly authorized committee of our board, cash dividends at the rates and on the\ndates set forth in the prospectus supplement. Dividend rates may be fixed or\nvariable or both. Different series of preferred stock may be entitled to dividends\nat different dividend rates or based upon different methods of determination. We\nwill pay\neach dividend to the holders of record as they appear on our stock register (or,\nif applicable, the records of the depositary referred to under \u0093Description of\nDepositary Shares\u0094) on record dates determined by our board of directors or a\nduly authorized committee of our board. Dividends on any series of preferred stock\nmay be cumulative or noncumulative, as specified in the prospectus supplement. If\na dividend is not declared on any series of preferred stock for which dividends\nare\nnoncumulative, then the right of holders of that preferred stock to receive that\ndividend will be lost, and we will have no obligation to pay the dividend for that\ndividend period, whether or not dividends are declared for any future dividend\nperiod.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, each series of\npreferred stock that we offer by use of this\nprospectus and an applicable prospectus supplement will provide that we may not\ndeclare or pay or set aside for payment full dividends on any series of preferred\nstock ranking, as to dividends, equally with or junior to the series of preferred\nstock\nwe are offering unless we have previously declared and paid or set aside for\npayment, or we contemporaneously declare and pay or set aside for payment, full\ndividends (including cumulative dividends still owing, if any) on the series of\npreferred\nstock we are offering for, in the case of a series of noncumulative preferred\nstock, the most recently completed dividend period, or, in the case of a series of\ncumulative preferred stock, all past dividend periods. If we fail to pay dividends\nin\nfull as stated above, we may only declare dividends on equally ranking series of\npreferred stock pro rata so that the amount of dividends declared per share on the\nseries of preferred stock we are offering and the equally ranking series bear to\neach\nother the same ratio that accumulated and unpaid dividends per share on the series\nbeing offered and the other series bear to each other. We will not pay interest or\nany sum of money instead of interest in respect of any dividend that is not\ndeclared, or if declared is not paid, on any series of preferred stock we are\noffering.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, the preferred stock we offer by use of this prospectus and\nan applicable prospectus supplement will also provide that, unless we have paid or\ndeclared and set aside a sum sufficient for the payment thereof, in the case\nof a series of noncumulative preferred stock, full dividends on all outstanding\nshares of that preferred stock in respect of the most recently completed dividend\nperiod, or, in the case of a series of cumulative preferred stock, full dividends,\nincluding cumulative dividends, if any, owing on that preferred stock for all past\ndividend periods:\n                                                                                  \n      no dividend (other than a dividend in common stock or in any junior or      \n      equally ranking stock as to dividends and                                   \n      upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up) will be declared or paid or a  \n      sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for such payment or other  \n      distribution declared or made upon our                                      \n                                                                                  \n22\n                                                      \n  common stock or upon any junior or equally ranking  \n  stock as to dividends or upon liquidation,          \n  dissolution or winding-up, and                      \n                                                      \n                                                                                  \n      no common stock or other capital stock ranking junior or equally as to      \n      dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution                                  \n      or winding-up will be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any     \n      consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking     \n      fund for the redemption of any shares of any such capital stock) by us,     \n      except:                                                                     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  (1)  by conversion into or exchange for capital stock ranking junior to the     \n       preferred stock being offered;

Subject to\nthe conditions described above, and not otherwise, dividends (payable in cash,\ncapital\nstock, or otherwise), as may be determined by our board of directors or a duly\nauthorized committee of our board, may be declared and paid on our common stock\nand any other capital stock ranking junior to or on a parity with the preferred\nstock\nbeing offered from time to time out of any assets legally available for such\npayment, and the holders of the preferred stock being offered will not be entitled\nto participate in those dividends.\n\nAs used in this prospectus, \u0093junior to the preferred stock being offered\u0094 and like\nterms refer to our common stock and any other\nclass or series of our capital stock over which the preferred stock being offered\nhas preference or priority, either as to dividends or upon liquidation,\ndissolution or winding-up, or both, as the context may require; \u0093parity preferred\nstock\u0094 and \u0093on a parity with the preferred stock being offered\u0094 and like terms\nrefer to any class or series of our capital stock that ranks on a parity with the\nshares of the preferred stock being offered, either as to dividends or\nupon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or both, as the context may require;\nand \u0093senior to the preferred stock being offered\u0094 and like terms refer to any\nclass or series of our capital stock that ranks senior to the preferred stock\nbeing offered, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-\nup, or both, as the context may require.\n\nUnless\notherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, we will compute the\namount of dividends payable by annualizing the applicable dividend rate and\ndividing by the number of dividend periods in a year, except that the amount of\ndividends\npayable for any period greater or less than a full dividend period, other than the\ninitial dividend period, will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year\nconsisting of twelve 30-day months and, for any\nperiod less than a full month, the actual number of days elapsed in the period.\nDollar amounts resulting from that calculation will be rounded to the nearest\ncent, with one-half cent being rounded upward.\n\n23\n\nRights Upon Liquidation\n\nIn the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-\nup, holders of each series of preferred stock that we offer by\nuse of this prospectus and an applicable prospectus supplement will be entitled to\nreceive and to be paid out of our assets legally available for distribution to our\nstockholders the amount set forth in the prospectus supplement plus, in the case\nof\na series of noncumulative preferred stock, an amount equal to any declared and\nunpaid dividends, without accumulation of undeclared dividends, if any, from the\nday following the immediately preceding dividend payment date, to, but not\nincluding, the\ndate of the liquidating distribution, but without accumulation of any unpaid\ndividends for prior dividend periods, or, in the case of a series of cumulative\npreferred stock, an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends, whether\nor not\ndeclared, before we make any payment or distribution on our common stock or on any\nother capital stock ranking junior to the preferred stock offered by use of this\nprospectus and an applicable prospectus supplement, and any stock having the same\nrank as that series of preferred stock upon our liquidation, dissolution or\nwinding-up. After the payment to such holders of the full preferential amounts to\nwhich they are entitled, such holders will have no right or claim to any of our\nremaining\nassets.\n\nIf, upon our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, we\nfail to pay in full the amounts payable with\nrespect to preferred stock offered by use of this prospectus and an applicable\nprospectus supplement, and any stock having the same rank as that series of\npreferred stock, the holders of the preferred stock and of that other stock will\nshare ratably\nin any such distribution of our assets in proportion to the full respective\ndistributions to which they are entitled. For any series of preferred stock\noffered by use of this prospectus and an applicable prospectus supplement, neither\nthe sale of\nall or substantially all of our property or business, nor our merger or\nconsolidation into or with any other entity will be considered a liquidation,\ndissolution or winding-up.\n\nRedemption\n\nThe applicable prospectus\nsupplement will indicate whether the series of preferred stock offered by use of\nthis prospectus and the applicable prospectus supplement is subject to redemption,\nin whole or in part, whether at our option or mandatorily and whether or not\npursuant\nto a sinking fund. The redemption provisions that may apply to a series of\npreferred stock offered, including the redemption dates, the redemption prices for\nthat series and whether those redemption prices will be paid in cash, stock or a\ncombination of cash and stock, will be set forth in the prospectus supplement. If\nthe redemption price is to be paid only from the proceeds of the sale of our\ncapital stock, the terms of the series of preferred stock may also provide that,\nif our\ncapital stock is not sold or if the amount of cash received is insufficient to pay\nin full the redemption price then due, the series of preferred stock will\nautomatically be converted into shares of the applicable capital stock pursuant to\nconversion provisions specified in the prospectus supplement.\n\nIf we are redeeming fewer than all the outstanding shares of preferred\nstock of any series, whether by mandatory or optional redemption, our board of\ndirectors or any duly authorized committee of our board will determine the method\nfor selecting the shares to be redeemed, which (unless otherwise specified in the\napplicable prospectus supplement) may be by lot or pro rata or in such other\nmanner as the board of directors or any duly authorized committee of our board\ndetermines to be equitable. From and after the redemption date, dividends will\ncease to\naccumulate on the shares of preferred stock called for redemption up to the\nredemption date and all rights of the holders of those shares, except the right to\nreceive the redemption price, will cease.\n\nIn the event that we fail to pay full dividends, including accumulated but unpaid\ndividends, if any, on any series of preferred stock offered,\nwe may not redeem that series in part and we may not purchase or acquire any\nshares of that series of preferred stock, except by a purchase or exchange offer\nmade on the same terms to all holders of that series of preferred stock.\n\n24\n\nConversion Rights\n\nThe prospectus supplement will state the terms, if any, on which shares of the\nseries of preferred stock offered by use of this prospectus and\nan applicable prospectus supplement are convertible into shares of our common\nstock or other securities. As described under \u0093\u0097 Redemption\u0094 above, under certain\ncircumstances, preferred stock may be mandatorily convertible into our\ncommon stock or another series of our preferred stock.\n\nVoting Rights\n\nExcept as indicated below or in the applicable prospectus supplement, or except as\nexpressly required by applicable law, the holders of the\npreferred stock offered by use of this prospectus and an applicable prospectus\nsupplement will not be entitled to vote. Unless otherwise indicated in the\nprospectus supplement, each share of preferred stock of each series will be\nentitled to one\nvote on matters on which holders of that series of preferred stock are entitled to\nvote. However, as more fully described under \u0093Description of Depositary Shares,\u0094\nif we use this prospectus and an applicable prospectus supplement to offer\ndepositary shares representing a fractional interest in a share of a series of\npreferred stock, each depositary share, in effect, will be entitled to that\nfraction of a vote, rather than a full vote. If (unless otherwise indicated in the\nprospectus\nsupplement) each full share of any series of preferred stock offered is entitled\nto one vote, the voting power of that series will depend on the number of shares\nin that series, and not on the aggregate liquidation preference or initial\noffering\nprice of the shares of that series of preferred stock.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement, if, at any time or times,\nthe equivalent of an aggregate of six quarterly dividends, whether or not\nconsecutive, for any series of preferred stock being offered has not been paid,\nthe number of directors constituting our board of directors will be automatically\nincreased by\ntwo and the holders of each outstanding series of preferred stock with such voting\nrights, together with holders of such other shares of any other class or series of\nparity preferred stock outstanding at the time upon which like voting rights have\nbeen conferred and are exercisable, which we refer to as \u0093voting parity stock,\u0094\nvoting together as a class, will be entitled to elect those additional two\ndirectors, which we refer to as \u0093preferred directors,\u0094 at that annual\nmeeting and at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders until full dividends\nhave been paid for at least four quarterly consecutive dividend periods. At that\ntime such right will terminate, except as expressly provided in the applicable\ncertificate of designations or by law, subject to revesting. Upon any termination\nof the right of the holders of shares of preferred stock being offered and voting\nparity stock as a class to vote for directors as provided above, the preferred\ndirectors will cease to be qualified as directors, the term of office of all\npreferred directors then in office will terminate immediately and the authorized\nnumber of directors will be reduced by the number of preferred directors elected.\nAny\npreferred director may be removed and replaced at any time, with cause as provided\nby law or without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of\npreferred stock voting together as a class with the holders of shares of voting\nparity\nstock, to the extent the voting rights of such holders described above are then\nexercisable. Any vacancy created by removal with or without cause may be filled\nonly as described in the preceding sentence. If the office of any preferred\ndirector\nbecomes vacant for any reason other than removal, the remaining preferred director\nmay choose a successor who will hold office for the unexpired term in respect of\nwhich such vacancy occurred.\n\nSo long as any shares of the preferred stock being offered remain outstanding, we\nwill not, without the affirmative vote of the holders of at\nleast 66 2/3% in voting power of the preferred stock being offered and any voting\nparity stock, voting together as a class, authorize, create or issue any capital\nstock ranking senior to the preferred stock being offered as to dividends or upon\nliquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or reclassify any authorized capital stock\ninto any such shares of such capital stock or issue any obligation or security\nconvertible into or evidencing the right to purchase any such shares of capital\nstock.\nSo long as any shares of the preferred stock being offered remain outstanding, we\nwill not, without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in\nvoting power of the preferred stock being offered, amend, alter or repeal any\nprovision of\nthe applicable certificate of designations or our certificate of incorporation,\nincluding by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to adversely affect the\npowers, preferences or special rights of the preferred stock being offered.\n\n25\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, none of the following will be deemed to adversely\naffect the\npowers, preferences or special rights of the preferred stock being offered:\n                                                                                  \n      any increase in the amount of authorized common stock or authorized         \n      preferred stock, or any increase or decrease                                \n      in the number of shares of any series of preferred stock, or the            \n      authorization, creation and issuance of other classes or series of capital  \n      stock, in each case ranking on a parity with or junior to the preferred     \n      stock being offered as to dividends                                         \n      or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up;                             \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      a merger or consolidation of JPMorgan Chase with or into another entity in  \n      which the shares of the preferred                                           \n      stock being offered remain outstanding; and                                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      a merger or consolidation of JPMorgan Chase with or into another entity in  \n      which the shares of the preferred                                           \n      stock being offered are converted into or exchanged for preference          \n      securities of the surviving entity or any entity, directly or indirectly,   \n      controlling such surviving entity and such new preference securities have   \n      powers, preferences and special                                             \n      rights that are not materially less favorable than the preferred stock      \n      being offered;                                                              \n                                                                                  \nprovided that if the amendment would adversely\naffect such series but not any other series of outstanding preferred stock, then\nthe amendment will only need to be approved by holders of at least two-thirds of\nthe shares of the series of preferred stock adversely affected.\n\nUnder regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve Board, if the holders of any\nseries of our preferred stock become entitled to vote for the\nelection of directors because dividends on that series are in arrears, that series\nmay then be deemed a \u0093class of voting securities.\u0094 In such a case, a holder of 25%\nor more of the series, or a holder of 5% or more if that holder would\nalso be considered to exercise a \u0093controlling influence\u0094 over JPMorgan Chase, may\nthen be subject to regulation as a bank holding company in accordance with the\nBank Holding Company Act. In addition, (1) any other bank holding company may\nbe required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire\nor retain 5% or more of that series, and (2) any person other than a bank holding\ncompany may be required to provide notice to the Federal Reserve Board prior to\nacquiring or retaining 10% or more of that series.\n\nOutstanding Series of Preferred Stock\n\nRanking. Each of our Series I Preferred Stock, Series Q Preferred Stock, Series R\nPreferred Stock, Series S Preferred Stock, Series U\nPreferred Stock, Series V Preferred Stock, Series X Preferred Stock, Series CC\nPreferred Stock, Series DD Preferred Stock, Series EE Preferred Stock, Series FF\nPreferred Stock, Series GG Preferred Stock, Series HH Preferred Stock, Series II\nPreferred Stock, Series JJ Preferred Stock, Series KK Preferred Stock, Series LL\nPreferred Stock and Series MM Preferred Stock (each as defined below, and\ncollectively, the \u0093Outstanding Preferred Stock\u0094) ranks senior to our common stock\nas\nwell as any of our other stock that states it is expressly made junior to such\nseries of Outstanding Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and distribution\nof assets upon our liquidation, dissolution, or winding up.\n\nDividends. We may not declare or pay or set apart for payment full dividends on\nany series of preferred stock ranking, as to dividends,\nequally with or junior to the Outstanding Preferred Stock unless we have\npreviously declared and paid or set apart for payment full dividends on the\nOutstanding Preferred Stock for the most recently completed dividend period. When\ndividends are not\npaid in full on the Outstanding Preferred Stock and any series of preferred stock\nranking equally as to dividends, all dividends upon the Outstanding Preferred\nStock and such equally ranking series will be declared and paid pro rata.\n\nWith certain exceptions, unless we have paid or declared and set aside for payment\nfull dividends on the Outstanding Preferred Stock for the\nmost recently completed dividend period, we will not:\n                                                                                  \n      declare or make any dividend payment or distribution on any junior ranking  \n      stock, other than a dividend paid in                                        \n      junior ranking stock, or                                                    \n                                                                                  \n26\n                                                                                  \n      redeem, purchase, otherwise acquire or set apart money for a sinking fund   \n      for the redemption of any junior or                                         \n      equally ranking stock, except by conversion into or exchange for junior     \n      ranking stock.                                                              \n                                                                                  \nRights Upon Liquidation.\nIn the event we liquidate, dissolve or wind-up our business and affairs, either\nvoluntarily or involuntarily, holders of the Outstanding Preferred Stock of each\nseries will be entitled to receive liquidating distributions equal to the\nliquidation\npreference per share for such series, plus any declared and unpaid dividends,\nwithout accumulation of undeclared dividends, before we make any distribution of\nassets to the holders of our common stock or any other class or series of shares\nranking\njunior to the Outstanding Preferred Stock of such series.\n\nRedemption. We may redeem each series of Outstanding Preferred Stock on\nthe dates and at the redemption prices set forth below. In addition, we may redeem\neach series of Outstanding Preferred Stock (other than the Series I Preferred\nStock) in whole, but not in part, at a redemption price equal to the liquidation\npreference per share for each such series of Outstanding Preferred Stock, plus any\ndeclared and unpaid dividends, following the occurrence of a capital treatment\nevent.

Redemption of any Outstanding Preferred Stock may be subject to\nour receipt of any required approvals from the Federal Reserve Board or any other\nregulatory authority.\n\nVoting Rights. The Outstanding Preferred Stock has limited voting rights. Each\nshare of Outstanding\nPreferred Stock has one vote whenever it is entitled to voting rights.\n\nFixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series I\n\nOn April 23, 2008, we issued an aggregate of 600,000 shares of Fixed-to-Floating\nRate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock,\nSeries I, $1 par value, with a liquidation preference of $10,000 per share (the\n\u0093Series I Preferred Stock\u0094). Shares of the Series I Preferred Stock are\nrepresented by depositary shares, each representing a one-tenth interest in a\nshare of\npreferred stock of the series.\n\nDividends.

If we\ndo, we will arrange the issuance by a depositary of receipts for depositary\nshares, and each of those depositary shares will represent a fractional interest\nin a share of a particular series of preferred stock. We will specify that\nfractional\ninterest in the applicable prospectus supplement.\n\nThe shares of any series of preferred stock underlying the depositary shares\noffered by\nuse of this prospectus and an applicable prospectus supplement will be deposited\nunder a deposit agreement between us and a depositary selected by us. Subject to\nthe terms of the deposit agreement, each owner of a depositary share will be\nentitled,\nin proportion to the applicable fractional interest in the share of preferred\nstock underlying that depositary share, to all the powers, preferences and rights\nof the preferred stock underlying that depositary share, in proportion to the\napplicable\nfractional interest in a share of the preferred stock which those depositary\nshares represent. Those rights include dividend, voting, redemption, conversion\nand liquidation rights.\n\nThe depositary shares offered by use of this prospectus and an applicable\nprospectus supplement will be evidenced by depositary receipts\nissued under the deposit agreement. The depositary will issue depositary receipts\nto those persons who purchase the fractional interests in the preferred stock\nunderlying the depositary shares, in accordance with the terms of the offering.\nThe\nfollowing summary of the deposit agreement, the depositary shares and the\ndepositary receipts is not complete. You should refer to the forms of the deposit\nagreement and depositary receipts that are filed as exhibits to the registration\nstatement.\n\nDividends and Other Distributions. The depositary will distribute all cash\ndividends or other cash distributions received in\nrespect of the preferred stock to the record holders of related depositary\nreceipts in proportion to the number of depositary shares owned by those holders.\n\nIf we make a distribution other than in cash, the depositary will distribute\nproperty received by it to the record holders of depositary\nreceipts that are entitled to receive the distribution as nearly as practicable in\nproportion to the number of depositary shares held by each holder, unless the\ndepositary determines that it is not feasible to make the distribution. If this\noccurs,\nthe depositary may, with our approval, adopt a method of distribution that it\ndeems practicable, including the sale of the property and distribution of the net\nproceeds from the sale to the applicable holders of the depositary receipts.\n\nRedemption of Depositary Shares. Upon redemption, in whole or in part, of shares\nof any series of preferred stock that are held by the\ndepositary, the depositary will redeem, as of the same redemption date, the number\nof depositary shares representing the shares of preferred stock so redeemed. The\nredemption price per depositary share will be equal to the applicable fraction of\nthe\nredemption price per share payable with respect to that series of the preferred\nstock.\n\nDepositary shares called for redemption will no\nlonger be outstanding after the applicable redemption date, and all rights of the\nholders of those depositary shares will cease, except the right to receive any\nmoney, securities, or other property upon surrender to the depositary of the\ndepositary\nreceipts evidencing those depositary shares.\n\nVoting the Preferred Stock. Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which the\nholders of preferred stock are entitled to vote, the depositary will mail the\ninformation contained in the notice of meeting to the record holders of the\ndepositary shares representing that preferred stock. Each record holder of those\ndepositary\nshares on the record date, which will be the same date as the record date for the\npreferred stock, will be entitled to instruct the depositary as to the exercise of\nthe voting rights pertaining to the amount of the preferred stock underlying that\nholder\u0092s depositary shares. The depositary will try, to the extent practicable, to\nvote the number of shares of preferred stock underlying those depositary shares in\naccordance with those instructions, and we will agree to take all action that\nthe depositary deems necessary in order to enable the depositary to do so. The\ndepositary will not vote the shares of preferred stock to the extent it does not\nreceive specific instructions from the holders of depositary shares representing\nthe\npreferred stock.\n\n35\n\nAmendment and Termination of the Deposit Agreement. We and the depositary may\namend the\nform of depositary receipt evidencing the depositary shares and any provision of\nthe deposit agreement at any time regarding any depositary shares offered by use\nof this prospectus and an applicable prospectus supplement. However, any amendment\nthat\nmaterially and adversely alters the rights of the holders of depositary shares or\nwould be materially and adversely inconsistent with the rights granted to holders\nof the underlying preferred stock pursuant to our certificate of incorporation\nwill\nnot be effective unless the amendment has been approved by the holders of at least\na majority of the depositary shares then outstanding. The deposit agreement may be\nterminated by us or by the depositary only if:\n                                                                \n      all outstanding depositary shares have been redeemed; or  \n                                                                \n                                                                                  \n      there has been a final distribution of the underlying preferred stock in    \n      connection with our liquidation,                                            \n      dissolution or winding up and the preferred stock has been distributed to   \n      the holders of depositary receipts.                                         \n                                                                                  \nCharges of Depositary. We will pay all transfer and other taxes and governmental\ncharges arising solely from the existence of the\ndepositary arrangements regarding any depositary shares offered by use of this\nprospectus and an applicable prospectus supplement.

Holders of depositary receipts will pay\ntransfer and other taxes and governmental charges and other charges with respect\nto their depositary receipts as expressly provided in the deposit agreement.\n\nResignation and Removal of Depositary. The depositary for the depositary shares\noffered by use of this prospectus and an applicable\nprospectus supplement may resign at any time by delivering a notice to us of its\nelection to do so. We may remove the depositary at any time. Any such resignation\nor removal will take effect upon the appointment of a successor depositary and its\nacceptance of its appointment. We must appoint a successor depositary within 60\ndays after delivery of the notice of resignation or removal.\n\nMiscellaneous. The depositary will forward to holders of depositary receipts all\nreports and communications from us that we deliver to\nthe depositary and that we are required to furnish to the holders of the preferred\nstock.\n\nNeither we nor the depositary will be liable if\neither of us is prevented or delayed by law or any circumstance beyond our control\nin performing our respective obligations under the deposit agreement. Our\nobligations and those of the depositary will be limited to performing in good\nfaith our\nrespective duties under the deposit agreement. Neither we nor the depositary will\nbe obligated to prosecute or defend any legal proceeding relating to any\ndepositary shares or preferred stock unless satisfactory indemnity is furnished.\nWe and the\ndepositary may rely upon written advice of counsel or accountants, or upon\ninformation provided by persons presenting preferred stock for deposit, holders of\ndepositary receipts or other persons we believe to be competent, and on documents\nwe\nbelieve to be genuine.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK\n\nAs of the date of this prospectus, we are authorized to issue up to 9,000,000,000\nshares of common stock.

Each series of units will be issued under a\nseparate unit agreement to be entered into between us and a bank or trust company\n(which may be the Bank), as unit agent. The below summary of certain provisions of\nthe\nunits and unit agreements is not complete. You should refer to the unit agreement\nfor the complete terms of the unit agreement and the units. Forms of those\ndocuments will be filed as exhibits to or incorporated by reference in the\nregistration\nstatement.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, each unit will\nbe issued so that the holder of the unit is\nalso the holder of each security included in the unit. Thus, the holder of a unit\nwill have the rights and obligations of a holder of each included security. The\nunit agreement under which a unit is issued may provide that the securities\nincluded in\nthe unit may not be held or transferred separately, at any time or at any time\nbefore a specified date. We will describe the particular terms of any series of\nunits being offered in the prospectus supplement relating to that series of units.\nThose\nterms may include:\n                                                                                  \n      the designation and the terms of the units and any combination of debt      \n      securities, preferred stock, common stock                                   \n      and warrants issued by us, depositary shares representing preferred stock   \n      issued by us, debt obligations or other securities of an entity affiliated  \n      or not affiliated with us or other property constituting the units,         \n      including and whether and under                                             \n      what circumstances the debt securities, preferred stock, common stock and   \n      warrants issued by us, depositary shares representing preferred stock       \n      issued by us, debt obligations or other securities of an entity affiliated  \n      or not affiliated with us or                                                \n      other securities may be traded separately;                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                             \n      any additional terms of the governing unit agreement;  \n                                                             \n                                                                                  \n      any additional provisions for the issuance, payment, settlement, transfer   \n      or exchange of the units or of the debt                                     \n      securities, preferred stock, common stock and warrants issued by us,        \n      depositary shares representing preferred stock issued by us, debt           \n      obligations or other securities of an entity affiliated or not affiliated   \n      with us or other property constituting                                      \n      the units; and                                                              \n                                                                                  \n                                                            \n      any applicable U.S. federal income tax consequences.  \n                                                            \nThe terms and conditions described under \u0093Description of Debt Securities,\u0094\n\u0093Description of Preferred Stock,\u0094\n\u0093Description of Common Stock\u0094 and \u0093Description of Warrants\u0094 will apply to each\nunit and to any debt securities, preferred stock, common stock or warrants issued\nby us, depositary shares representing preferred stock issued by us,\ndebt obligations or other securities of an entity affiliated or not affiliated\nwith us or other property included in each unit, unless otherwise specified in the\napplicable prospectus supplement.\n\nAn investment in units may involve special risks, including risks associated with\nindexed securities and currency-related risks if the\nsecurities comprising the units are linked to an index or are payable in or\notherwise linked to a non-U.S. dollar currency.\n\n38\n\nBOOK-ENTRY ISSUANCE\n\nWe may issue series of any securities as global securities and deposit them with a\ndepositary with respect to that series for settlement and\nclearance through a book-entry settlement system, as indicated in the applicable\nprospectus supplement. The following is a summary of the depositary arrangements\napplicable to securities issued in permanent global form and for which The\nDepository\nTrust Company (\u0093DTC\u0094) will act as depositary (the \u0093global securities\u0094).\n\nEach global security will be deposited with,\nor on behalf of, DTC, as depositary, or its nominee and registered in the name of\na nominee of DTC. Except under the limited circumstances described below, global\nsecurities will not be exchangeable for certificated securities.\n\nOnly institutions that have accounts with DTC or its nominee (\u0093DTC participants\u0094)\nor persons that may hold interests through DTC\nparticipants may own beneficial interests in a global security. DTC will maintain\nrecords evidencing ownership of beneficial interests by DTC participants in the\nglobal securities and transfers of those ownership interests. DTC participants\nwill\nmaintain records evidencing ownership of beneficial interests in the global\nsecurities by persons that hold through those DTC participants and transfers of\nthose ownership interests within those DTC participants. DTC has no knowledge of\nthe actual\nbeneficial owners of the securities. You will not receive written confirmation\nfrom DTC of your purchase, but we do expect that you will receive written\nconfirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements\nof your\nholdings, from the DTC participant through which you entered the transaction. The\nlaws of some jurisdictions require that certain purchasers of securities take\nphysical delivery of those securities in certificated form. Those laws may impair\nyour\nability to transfer beneficial interests in a global security.\n\nDTC has advised us that upon the issuance of a global security and the\ndeposit of that global security with DTC, DTC will immediately credit, on its\nbook-entry registration and transfer system, the respective principal amounts or\nnumber of shares represented by that global security to the accounts of DTC\nparticipants.\n\nWe will make payments on securities represented by a global security to DTC or its\nnominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner\nand holder of the global security representing those securities. DTC has advised\nus that upon receipt of any payment on a global security, DTC will immediately\ncredit accounts of DTC participants with payments in amounts proportionate to\ntheir\nrespective beneficial interests in that security, as shown in the records of DTC.\nStanding instructions and customary practices will govern payments by DTC\nparticipants to owners of beneficial interests in a global security held through\nthose DTC\nparticipants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of\ncustomers in bearer form or registered in \u0093street name.\u0094 Those payments will be\nthe sole responsibility of those DTC participants, subject to any statutory or\nregulatory requirements in effect from time to time.\n\nNone of JPMorgan Chase, the trustees, the depositary or any of our respective\nagents\nwill have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records of DTC,\nany nominee or any DTC participant relating to, or payments made on account of,\nbeneficial interests in a global security or for maintaining, supervising or\nreviewing\nany of the records of DTC, any nominee or any DTC participant relating to those\nbeneficial interests.\n\nA global security is exchangeable\nfor certificated securities registered in the name of a person other than DTC or\nits nominee only if:\n                                                                                  \n      DTC notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary    \n      for that global security or DTC ceases                                      \n      to be registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      we determine in our discretion that the global security will be             \n      exchangeable for certificated securities in                                 \n      registered form; or                                                         \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      if applicable to the particular type of security, there shall have          \n      occurred and be continuing an event of default                              \n      or an event which, with notice or the lapse of time or both, would          \n      constitute an event of default under the securities.                        \n                                                                                  \n39\n\nAny global security that is exchangeable as described in the preceding sentence\nwill be\nexchangeable in whole for certificated securities in registered form, and, in the\ncase of global debt securities, of like tenor and of an equal aggregate principal\namount as the global security, in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples\nof\n$1,000 (or in denominations and integral multiples as otherwise specified in the\napplicable prospectus supplement). The registrar for the securities will register\nthe certificated securities in the name or names instructed by DTC. We expect that\nthose instructions may be based upon directions received by DTC from DTC\nparticipants with respect to ownership of beneficial interests in the global\nsecurity. In the case of global debt securities, we will make payment of any\nprincipal and interest\non the certificated securities and will register transfers and exchanges of those\ncertificated securities at the corporate trust office of The Bank of New York\nMellon or any successor paying agent that we may designate. However, we may elect\nto pay\ninterest by check mailed to the address of the person entitled to that interest\npayment as of the record date, as shown on the register for the securities.\n\nExcept as provided above, as an owner of a beneficial interest in a global\nsecurity, you will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of\nsecurities in certificated form and will not be considered a holder of securities\nfor any purpose under either of the indentures. No global security will be\nexchangeable except for another global security of like denomination and tenor to\nbe\nregistered in the name of DTC or its nominee. Accordingly, you must rely on the\nprocedures of DTC and the DTC participant through which you own your interest to\nexercise any rights of a holder under the global security or the applicable\nindenture.\n\nWe understand that, under existing industry practices, in the event that we\nrequest any action of holders, or an owner of a beneficial\ninterest in a global security desires to take any action that a holder is entitled\nto take under the securities or the indentures, DTC would authorize the DTC\nparticipants holding the relevant beneficial interests to take that action, and\nthose DTC\nparticipants would authorize beneficial owners owning through those DTC\nparticipants to take that action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of\nbeneficial owners owning through them.\n\nDTC has advised us that DTC is a limited purpose trust company organized under the\nNew York Banking Law, a \u0093banking organization\u0094\nwithin the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, a \u0093clearing corporation\u0094 within the meaning of the New York Uniform\nCommercial Code and a \u0093clearing agency\u0094 registered under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934.\n\nIf specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, investors may elect to hold\ninterests in the global\nsecurities deposited with DTC outside the United States through Clearstream\nBanking, S.A. (\u0093Clearstream\u0094) or Euroclear Bank SA/NV, as operator of the\nEuroclear System (\u0093Euroclear\u0094), if they are participants in those systems, or\nindirectly through organizations that are participants in those systems.\nClearstream and Euroclear will hold interests on behalf of their participants\nthrough customers\u0092 securities accounts in Clearstream\u0092s and Euroclear\u0092s names on\nthe books of their respective depositaries. Those depositaries in turn hold those\ninterests in customers\u0092 securities accounts in the depositaries\u0092 names on the\nbooks of DTC. Unless otherwise specified in the prospectus supplement, The Bank\nof New York Mellon will act as depositary for each of Clearstream and Euroclear in\nthe case of global debt securities.\n\nClearstream has\nadvised us that it is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg as a professional\ndepositary. Clearstream holds securities for its participants and facilitates the\nclearance and settlement of securities transactions between its participants\nthrough\nelectronic book-entry transfers between their accounts. Clearstream provides its\nparticipants with, among other things, services for safekeeping, administration,\nclearance and settlement of internationally traded securities and securities\nlending\nand borrowing. Clearstream interfaces with domestic securities markets in several\ncountries through established depository and custodial relationships. As a\nprofessional depositary, Clearstream is subject to regulation by the Luxembourg\nCommission\nfor the Supervision of the Financial Sector, also known as the Commission de\nSurveillance du Secteur Financier. Clearstream participants are recognized\nfinancial institutions around the world, including underwriters, securities\nbrokers and\ndealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and other organizations.\nClearstream\u0092s participants in the United States are limited to securities brokers\nand dealers and banks. Indirect access to Clearstream is also available to other\ninstitutions such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear\nthrough or maintain a custodial relationship with Clearstream participants.\n\n40\n\nDistributions with respect to interests in global securities held through\nClearstream will be\ncredited to cash accounts of its customers in accordance with its rules and\nprocedures, to the extent received by the U.S. depositary for Clearstream.\n\nEuroclear has advised us that it was created in 1968 to hold securities for its\nparticipants and to clear and settle transactions between\nEuroclear participants through simultaneous electronic book-entry delivery against\npayment, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates and\nany risk from lack of simultaneous transfers of securities and cash. Euroclear\nprovides various other services, including securities lending and borrowing, and\ninterfaces with domestic markets in several countries. Euroclear is operated by\nEuroclear Bank SA/NV under contract with Euroclear plc, a U.K. corporation.\nEuroclear\nparticipants include banks, including central banks, securities brokers and\ndealers and other professional financial intermediaries. Indirect access to\nEuroclear is also available to other firms that clear through or maintain a\ncustodial\nrelationship with a Euroclear participant, either directly or indirectly.\n\nDistributions with respect to interests in global securities\nheld beneficially through Euroclear will be credited to the cash accounts of\nEuroclear participants in accordance with Euroclear\u0092s terms and conditions and\noperating procedures and applicable Belgian law, to the extent received by the\nU.S.\ndepositary for Euroclear.\n\nGlobal Clearance and Settlement Procedures\n\nUnless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement with respect to a particular\nseries of global securities, initial settlement for global\nsecurities will be made in immediately available funds. DTC participants will\nconduct secondary market trading with other DTC participants in the ordinary way\nin accordance with DTC rules. Thereafter, secondary market trades will settle in\nimmediately available funds using DTC\u0092s same day funds settlement system.\n\nIf the prospectus supplement specifies that interests in\nthe global securities may be held through Clearstream or Euroclear, Clearstream\ncustomers and/or Euroclear participants will conduct secondary market trading with\nother Clearstream customers and/or Euroclear participants in the ordinary way in\naccordance with the applicable rules and operating procedures of Clearstream and\nEuroclear. Thereafter, secondary market trades will settle in immediately\navailable funds.\n\nCross-market transfers between persons holding directly or indirectly through DTC\non the one hand, and directly or indirectly through\nClearstream customers or Euroclear participants, on the other, will be effected in\nDTC in accordance with DTC\u0092s rules on behalf of the relevant European\ninternational clearing system by the U.S. depositary for that system; however,\nthose\ncross-market transactions will require delivery by the counterparty in the\nrelevant European international clearing system of instructions to that system in\naccordance with its rules and procedures and within its established deadlines\n(European\ntime). The relevant European international clearing system will, if the\ntransaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to the U.S.\ndepositary for that system to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf\nby delivering\nor receiving interests in global securities in DTC, and making or receiving\npayment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement\napplicable to DTC. Clearstream customers and Euroclear participants may not\ndeliver instructions\ndirectly to DTC.\n\nBecause of time-zone differences, credits of interests in global securities\nreceived in Clearstream or Euroclear as a\nresult of a transaction with a DTC participant will be made during subsequent\nsecurities settlement processing and will be credited the business day following\nthe DTC settlement date. Those credits or any transactions in global securities\nsettled\nduring that processing will be reported to the relevant Euroclear participants or\nClearstream customers on that business day. Cash received in Clearstream or\nEuroclear as a result of sales of interests in global securities by or through a\nClearstream customer or a Euroclear participant to a DTC participant will be\nreceived with value on the DTC settlement date but will be available in the\nrelevant Clearstream or Euroclear cash account only as of the business day\nfollowing settlement\nin DTC.\n\nAlthough DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear have agreed to the procedures described\nabove in order to facilitate transfers of\ninterests in global securities among DTC participants, Clearstream and Euroclear,\nthey are under no obligation to perform those procedures and those procedures may\nbe discontinued at any time.\n\n41\n\nSpecial Provisions Relating to Certain Foreign Currency Securities\n\nIf specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, book-entry securities\ndenominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars may be held\ndirectly through participants in the systems of Clearstream or Euroclear, or\nindirectly through organizations that are participants in such systems. Such\nsecurities will be issued in the form of one or more global certificates (the\n\u0093international global securities\u0094), which will be registered in the name of a\nnominee for, and shall be deposited with, a common depositary for Clearstream\nand/or Euroclear. If a particular tranche or series of securities is issued\nutilizing both a global security and an international global security, in order to\nallow transfers between account holders utilizing the different book-entry systems\nthe registrar will adjust the amounts of the global securities on the register for\nthe accounts of the nominees for the respective systems.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, with\nrespect to an international global security, distributions of principal and\ninterest for a global debt security and dividends for a global equity security\nwill be credited, in the specified currency, to the extent received by Clearstream\nor\nEuroclear, to the cash accounts of Clearstream or Euroclear customers in\naccordance with the relevant system\u0092s rules and procedures. If the prospectus\nsupplement provides for both a global security and an international global\nsecurity or if a\nbeneficial interest in a global security is held by a participant in Clearstream\nor Euroclear, then a holder of a beneficial interest in a global security will\nreceive all payments in U.S. dollars in accordance with DTC\u0092s rules and\nprocedures,\nunless it has, or participants through which it holds its beneficial interest\nhave, made other arrangements.\n\nRelationship of Accountholders with Clearing Systems\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, each of the\npersons shown in the records of\nClearstream, Euroclear or any other clearing system as the holder of the\nsecurities represented by the global securities must look solely to Clearstream or\nEuroclear for such holder\u0092s share of each payment made by or on behalf of JPMorgan\nChase\nto Clearstream or Euroclear, and in relation to all other rights arising under the\nglobal securities, subject to and in accordance with the respective rules and\nprocedures of Clearstream or Euroclear. Such persons shall have no claim directly\nagainst JPMorgan Chase in respect of payments due on the securities for so long as\nthe securities are represented by global securities and such obligations of\nJPMorgan Chase will be discharged by payment to Clearstream or Euroclear in\nrespect of\neach amount so paid.\n\n42\n\nPLAN OF DISTRIBUTION\n\nWe may sell the debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock,\nwarrants or units being offered by use of this prospectus\nand an applicable prospectus supplement:\n                             \n      through underwriters;  \n                             \n                        \n      through dealers;  \n                        \n                          \n      through agents; or  \n                          \n                               \n      directly to purchasers.  \n                               \nWe will set forth the terms of the offering of any securities being offered in the\napplicable prospectus supplement.\n\nIf we utilize underwriters in an offering of securities using this prospectus, we\nwill execute an underwriting agreement with those\nunderwriters.

(\u0093JPMorgan Chase\u0094)\nprovides that, to the fullest extent that the DGCL as from time to time in effect\npermits the limitation or elimination of the liability of directors, no director\nof JPMorgan Chase shall be personally liable to JPMorgan Chase or its stockholders\nfor\nmonetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u0092s certificate of incorporation empowers JPMorgan Chase\nto indemnify any director, officer, employee or agent of JPMorgan Chase or any\nother person who is serving at JPMorgan Chase\u0092s request in any such capacity with\nanother corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise\n(including, without limitation, any employee benefit plan) to the fullest extent\npermitted under the DGCL as from time to time in effect, and any such\nindemnification may continue as to any person who has ceased to be a director,\nofficer, employee\nor agent and may inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators\nof such a person.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u0092s certificate of\nincorporation also empowers JPMorgan Chase by action of its board of directors,\nnotwithstanding any interest of the directors in the action, to purchase and\nmaintain insurance in such amounts as the Board of Directors deems appropriate to\nprotect\nany director, officer, employee or agent of JPMorgan Chase or any other person who\nis serving at JPMorgan Chase\u0092s request in any such capacity with another\ncorporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including,\nwithout\nlimitation, any employee benefit plan) against any liability asserted against him\nor her or incurred by him or her in any such capacity or arising out of his or her\nstatus as such (including, without limitation, expenses, judgments, fines\n(including\nany excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to any employee benefit plan)\nand amounts paid in settlement) to the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL as\nfrom time to time in effect, whether or not JPMorgan Chase would have the power or\nbe\nrequired to indemnify any such person under the terms of any agreement or by-law\nor the DGCL.\n\nIn\naddition, JPMorgan Chase\u0092s by-laws require JPMorgan Chase to indemnify, to the\nfullest extent permitted under applicable law, as from time to time in effect, any\nperson who was or is involved in any\nmanner (including, without limitation, as a party or witness), or is threatened to\nbe made so involved, in any threatened, pending or completed investigation, claim,\naction, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or\ninvestigative (including without limitation, any action, suit or proceeding by or\nin the right of JPMorgan Chase to procure a judgment in its favor, but excluding\nany action, suit, or proceeding, or part thereof, brought by such person against\nJPMorgan Chase or any of its affiliates unless consented to by JPMorgan Chase) (a\n\u0093Proceeding\u0094) by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer,\nor employee of JPMorgan Chase, or is or was serving at the request of\nJPMorgan Chase as a director, officer or employee of another corporation,\npartnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against all expenses\n(including attorneys\u0092 fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement\nactually and\nreasonably incurred by him or her in connection with such Proceeding (or part\nthereof). The by-laws specify that the right to indemnification so provided is a\ncontract right, set forth certain procedural and\nevidentiary standards applicable to the enforcement of a claim under the by-laws\nand entitle the persons to be indemnified to receive payment in advance of any\nexpenses incurred in connection with such\nProceeding, consistent with the provisions of applicable law, as from time to time\nin effect. Such provisions, however, are intended to be in furtherance and not in\nlimitation of the general right to indemnification provided in the by-laws, which\nright of indemnification and of advancement of expenses is not exclusive of any\nother rights to which a person seeking indemnification may otherwise be entitled,\nunder any statute, by-law, agreement,\nvote or otherwise.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u0092s by-laws also provide that JPMorgan Chase may enter into\ncontracts with any director, officer or employee of JPMorgan Chase in furtherance\nof the indemnification provisions in the by-laws, as well as create a trust fund,\ngrant a security interest or use other means\n(including, without limitation, a letter of credit) to ensure payment of amounts\nindemnified.\n\nLastly, JPMorgan Chase\u0092s by-laws also provide that any repeal or modification of\nthe indemnification rights provided in the by-laws shall not adversely affect any\nright or protection thereunder\nof any person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of\nsuch repeal or modification.\n\nII-2\n\nThe foregoing statements are subject to the detailed provisions of Section 145 of\nthe DGCL\nand the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of JPMorgan Chase.\n                      \n  ITEM\u00a016.

Provided, however, that no statement made in a\nregistration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or\nmade in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the\nregistration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement\nwill, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such effective\ndate, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration\nstatement or\nprospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such\ndocument immediately prior to such effective date.\n\n(5) That, for the purpose of determining liability of the Registrant under the\nSecurities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the\ninitial distribution of the securities, the undersigned Registrant undertakes that\nin a primary offering of securities of the undersigned Registrant pursuant to this\nregistration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the\nsecurities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such\npurchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned\nRegistrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or\nsell such\nsecurities to such purchaser:\n\n(i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned Registrant\nrelating to the\noffering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;\n\n(ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by\nor on behalf of the undersigned Registrant or used or referred to by the\nundersigned Registrant;\n\n(iii) The portion of any\nother free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material\ninformation about the undersigned Registrant or its securities provided by or on\nbehalf of the undersigned Registrant; and\n\n(iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the\nundersigned Registrant to the purchaser.\n\nThe undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of determining any\nliability under the Securities Act of 1933 each filing of\nthe Registrant\u0092s annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee\nbenefit plan\u0092s annual report pursuant to Section 15(d) of\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that is incorporated by reference in the\nregistration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating\nto the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that\ntime\nshall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act\nof 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the\nRegistrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has\nbeen advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such\nindemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is,\ntherefore, unenforceable.
