JPMorgan\nChase & Co. is a bank holding company\n(\u201cBHC\u201d) and a financial holding company\n(\u201cFHC\u201d) under U.S. federal law, and is\nsubject to comprehensive consolidated\nsupervision, regulation and examination\nby the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System (the \u201cFederal\nReserve\u201d). The Federal Reserve acts as\nthe supervisor of the consolidated\noperations of BHCs. Certain of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s subsidiaries are also regulated\ndirectly by additional authorities\nbased on the activities or licenses of\nthose subsidiaries.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s national bank\nsubsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,\nis supervised and regulated by the\nOffice of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency (\u201cOCC\u201d) and, with respect to\ncertain matters, by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (the \u201cFDIC\u201d).\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s U.S. broker-dealers\nare supervised and regulated by the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission\n(\u201cSEC\u201d) and the Financial Industry\nRegulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d).\nSubsidiaries of the Firm that engage in\ncertain futures-related and swaps-\nrelated activities are supervised and\nregulated by the Commodity Futures\nTrading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d).

The\nBank Holding Company Act restricts BHCs\nfrom engaging in business activities\nother than the business of banking and\ncertain closely-related activities.\nFHCs can engage in a broader range of\nfinancial activities. The Federal\nReserve has the authority to limit an\nFHC\u2019s ability to conduct otherwise\npermissible activities if the FHC or\nany of its depository institution\nsubsidiaries ceases to meet applicable\neligibility requirements. The Federal\nReserve may also impose corrective\ncapital and/or managerial requirements\non the FHC, and if deficiencies are\npersistent, may require divestiture of\nthe FHC\u2019s depository institutions. If\nany depository institution controlled\nby an FHC fails to maintain a\nsatisfactory rating under the Community\nReinvestment Act, the Federal Reserve\nmust prohibit the FHC and its\nsubsidiaries from engaging in any new\nactivities other than those permissible\nfor BHCs, or acquiring a company\nengaged in such activities.\n\nCapital and liquidity requirements .\nThe Federal Reserve establishes\ncapital, liquidity and leverage\nrequirements for JPMorgan Chase that\nare generally consistent with the\n\ninternational Basel III capital and\nliquidity framework and evaluates the\nFirm\u2019s compliance with those\nrequirements. The OCC establishes\nsimilar requirements for JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. Certain of the Firm\u2019s\nnon-U.S. subsidiaries and branches are\nalso subject to local capital and\nliquidity requirements.\n\nBanking supervisors globally continue\nto refine and enhance the Basel III\ncapital framework for financial\ninstitutions. In January 2019, the\nBasel Committee issued \u201cMinimum capital\nrequirements for market risk.\u201d The\nBasel Committee expects national\nregulators to implement these revised\nmarket risk requirements for banking\norganizations in their jurisdictions by\nJanuary 2023, in line with the other\nelements of the Basel III Reforms. U.S.\nbanking regulators have announced their\nsupport for the issuance of the Basel\nIII Reforms and are considering how to\nappropriately apply such reforms in the\nU.S.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on\npages 86-96 and Liquidity Risk\nManagement on pages 97-104 .\n\nStress tests . As a large BHC, JPMorgan\nChase is subject to supervisory stress\ntesting administered by the Federal\nReserve as part of the Federal\nReserve\u2019s annual Comprehensive Capital\nAnalysis and Review (\u201cCCAR\u201d) framework.\nThe Firm must conduct annual company-\nrun stress tests and must also submit\nan annual capital plan to the Federal\nReserve, taking into account the\nresults of separate stress tests\ndesigned by the Firm and the Federal\nReserve. The Federal Reserve uses the\nresults under the severely adverse\nscenario from its supervisory stress\ntest to determine the Firm\u2019s Stress\nCapital Buffer (\u201cSCB\u201d) requirement for\nthe coming year, which forms part of\nthe Firm\u2019s applicable capital buffers.\nThe Firm is required to file its annual\nCCAR submission on April 5, 2022. The\nFederal Reserve will notify the Firm of\nits indicative SCB requirement by June\n30, 2022 and final SCB requirement by\nAugust 31, 2022. The Firm\u2019s final SCB\nrequirement will become effective on\nOctober 1, 2022. The OCC requires\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to perform\nseparate, similar stress tests\nannually. The Firm publishes each year\nthe results of the annual stress tests\nfor the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. under the supervisory \u201cseverely\nadverse\u201d scenarios provided by the\nFederal Reserve and the OCC.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on\npages 86-96 for more information\nconcerning the Firm\u2019s CCAR.\n\nEnhanced prudential standards . As part\nof its mandate to identify and monitor\nrisks to the financial stability of the\nU.S. posed by large banking\norganizations, the Financial Stability\nOversight Council (\u201cFSOC\u201d) recommends\nprudential standards and reporting\nrequirements to the Federal Reserve for\nsystemically important financial\ninstitutions (\u201cSIFIs\u201d), such as\nJPMorgan Chase. The Federal Reserve has\nadopted several rules to implement\nthose heightened prudential standards,\nincluding rules relating to risk\nmanagement and corporate governance of\nsubject BHCs. JPMorgan Chase is\nrequired under these rules to comply\nwith enhanced liquidity and overall\nrisk\n     \n  4  \n     \nmanagement standards, including\noversight by the board of directors of\nrisk management activities.\n\nResolution and recovery . The Firm is\nrequired to maintain a comprehensive\nrecovery plan, updated annually,\nsummarizing the actions it would take\nto avoid failure by remaining well-\ncapitalized and well-funded in the case\nof an adverse event. In addition,\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required\nto prepare and submit a recovery plan\nas directed by the OCC. The Firm is\nrequired to submit periodically to the\nFederal Reserve and the FDIC a plan for\nresolution in the event of material\ndistress or failure (a \u201cresolution\nplan\u201d). In 2019, the FDIC and Federal\nReserve revised the regulations\ngoverning resolution plan requirements,\nand on the basis of those revisions,\nthe Firm\u2019s resolution plan submissions\nwill alternate between \u201ctargeted\u201d and\n\u201cfull\u201d plans. The Firm\u2019s \u201ctargeted\u201d\nresolution plan was filed on June 28,\n2021. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is also\nrequired to prepare and submit a\nseparate resolution plan as directed by\nthe FDIC.\n\nCertain of the Firm\u2019s non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries and branches are also\nsubject to local resolution and\nrecovery planning requirements.\n\nOrderly liquidation authority . Certain\nfinancial companies, including JPMorgan\nChase and certain of its subsidiaries,\ncan also be subjected to resolution\nunder an \u201corderly liquidation\nauthority.\u201d The U.S. Treasury\nSecretary, in consultation with the\nPresident of the United States, must\nfirst make certain determinations\nconcerning extraordinary financial\ndistress and systemic risk, and action\nmust be recommended by the FDIC and the\nFederal Reserve. Absent such actions,\nthe Firm, as a BHC, would remain\nsubject to resolution under the\nBankruptcy Code. The FDIC has issued a\ndraft policy statement describing its\n\u201csingle point of entry\u201d strategy for\nresolution of SIFIs under the orderly\nliquidation authority, which seeks to\nkeep operating subsidiaries of a BHC\nopen and impose losses on shareholders\nand creditors of the BHC in\nreceivership according to their\nstatutory order of priority.\n\nHolding company as a source of\nstrength. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is\nrequired to serve as a source of\nfinancial strength for its depository\ninstitution subsidiaries and to commit\nresources to support those\nsubsidiaries, including when directed\nto do so by the Federal Reserve.\n\nRegulation of acquisitions .\nAcquisitions by BHCs and their banks\nare subject to requirements,\nlimitations and prohibitions\nestablished by law and by the Federal\nReserve and the OCC. For example, FHCs\nand BHCs are required to obtain the\napproval of the Federal Reserve before\nthey acquire more than 5% of the voting\nshares of an unaffiliated bank. In\naddition, acquisitions by financial\ncompanies are prohibited if, as a\nresult of the acquisition, the total\nliabilities of the financial company\nwould exceed 10% of the total\nliabilities of all financial companies.\nFurthermore, for certain acquisitions,\nthe Firm must provide written notice to\nthe Federal Reserve prior to acquiring\ndirect or indirect ownership or control\nof any\n\nvoting shares of any company with over\n$10 billion in assets that is engaged\nin activities that are \u201cfinancial in\nnature.\u201d\n\nOngoing obligations . The Firm is\nsubject to obligations under the terms\nof a Deferred Prosecution Agreement\nentered into with the Department of\nJustice on September 29, 2020 relating\nto precious metals and U.S. Treasuries\nmarkets investigations as well as under\na related order issued by the CFTC.\n\nSubsidiary banks:\n\nThe activities of JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A., the Firm\u2019s principal subsidiary\nbank, are limited to those specifically\nauthorized under the National Bank Act\nand related interpretations of the OCC.\nThe OCC has authority to bring an\nenforcement action against JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. for unsafe or unsound\nbanking practices, which could include\nlimiting JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s\nability to conduct otherwise\npermissible activities, or imposing\ncorrective capital or managerial\nrequirements on the bank.\n\nFDIC deposit insurance. The FDIC\ndeposit insurance fund provides\ninsurance coverage for certain deposits\nand is funded through assessments on\nbanks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A.\n\nFDIC powers upon a bank insolvency.\nUpon the insolvency of JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A., the FDIC could be appointed\nas conservator or receiver under the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Act. The FDIC\nhas broad powers to transfer assets and\nliabilities without the approval of the\ninstitution\u2019s creditors.\n\nPrompt corrective action. The Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation\nImprovement Act of 1991 requires the\nrelevant federal banking regulator to\ntake \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d with\nrespect to a depository institution if\nthat institution does not meet certain\ncapital adequacy standards. The Federal\nReserve is also authorized to take\nappropriate action against the parent\nBHC, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co.,\nbased on the undercapitalized status of\nany bank subsidiary. In certain\ninstances, the BHC would be required to\nguarantee the performance of the\ncapital restoration plan for its\nundercapitalized subsidiary.\n\nOCC Heightened Standards. The OCC has\nestablished guidelines setting forth\nheightened standards for large banks,\nincluding minimum standards for the\ndesign and implementation of a risk\ngovernance framework for banks. Under\nthese standards, a bank\u2019s risk\ngovernance framework must ensure that\nthe bank\u2019s risk profile is easily\ndistinguished and separate from that of\nits parent BHC for risk management\npurposes. The bank\u2019s board or risk\ncommittee is responsible for approving\nthe bank\u2019s risk governance framework,\nproviding active oversight of the\nbank\u2019s risk-taking activities, and\nholding management accountable for\nadhering to the risk governance\nframework.\n\nRestrictions on transactions with\naffiliates.

Morgan Securities LLC is also\nregistered with the CFTC as a futures\ncommission merchant and is a member of\nthe National Futures Association.\n\nData, privacy and security regulation:\n\nThe Firm and its subsidiaries are\nsubject to numerous U.S. federal, state\nand local as well as international\nlaws, rules and regulations concerning\ndata that are central to the Firm\u2019s\nbusinesses, functions and operations.\nThese include laws, rules and\nregulations relating to data\nprotection, privacy, data use,\nconfidentiality, secrecy,\ncybersecurity, technology, artificial\nintelligence, data localization and\nstorage, data retention and\ndestruction, disclosure, transfer,\navailability, integrity and other\nsimilar matters. Numerous jurisdictions\nhave passed laws, rules and regulations\nin these areas and many are considering\nnew or updated ones that could affect\nthe Firm\u2019s businesses. Many of these\nlaws apply not only to the Firm\u2019s\ntransactions with third parties but\nalso to interactions between and among\nthe Firm\u2019s own affiliates and\nsubsidiaries. The application,\ninterpretation and enforcement of these\nlaws, rules and regulations are often\nuncertain, particularly in light of new\nand rapidly evolving data-driven\ntechnologies and significant increase\nin computing power. These laws, rules\nand regulations are constantly\nevolving, remain a focus of regulators\nglobally, may be enforced by private\nparties or government bodies, and will\ncontinue to have a significant impact\non all of the Firm\u2019s businesses and\noperations.\n\nThe Bank Secrecy Act and Economic\nSanctions:\n\nThe Bank Secrecy Act (\u201cBSA\u201d) requires\nall financial institutions, including\nbanks and securities broker-dealers, to\nestablish a risk-based system of\ninternal controls reasonably designed\nto prevent money laundering and the\nfinancing of terrorism. The BSA\nincludes a variety of record-keeping\nand reporting requirements, as well as\ndue diligence/know-your-customer\ndocumentation requirements. The Firm is\nalso subject to the regulations and\neconomic sanctions programs\nadministered by the U.S. Treasury\u2019s\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control\n(\u201cOFAC\u201d). In addition, the EU and the\nU.K. have adopted various economic\nsanctions programs targeted at entities\nor individuals that are, or are located\nin countries that are, involved in\nterrorism, hostilities, embezzlement or\nhuman rights violations. The Firm is\nalso subject to economic sanctions\nlaws, rules and regulations in other\njurisdictions in which it operates,\nincluding those that conflict with or\nprohibit a firm such as JPMorgan Chase\nfrom complying with certain laws, rules\nand regulations to which it is\notherwise subject.\n\nAnti-Corruption:\n\nThe Firm is subject to laws and\nregulations relating to corrupt and\nillegal payments to government\nofficials and others in the\njurisdictions in which it operates,\nincluding the U.S. Foreign Corrupt\nPractices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act.\n\nCompensation practices:\n\nThe Firm\u2019s compensation practices are\nsubject to oversight by the Federal\nReserve, as well as other agencies. The\n\nFederal Reserve has jointly issued\nguidance with the FDIC and the OCC that\nis designed to ensure that incentive\ncompensation paid by banking\norganizations does not encourage\nimprudent risk-taking that threatens\nthe organizations\u2019 safety and\nsoundness. The Financial Stability\nBoard (\u201cFSB\u201d) has also established\nstandards covering compensation\nprinciples for banks. The Firm\u2019s\ncompensation practices are also subject\nto regulation and oversight by\nregulators in other jurisdictions,\nnotably the Fifth Capital Requirements\nDirective (\u201cCRD V\u201d), as implemented in\nthe EU and as adopted in the U.K, which\nincludes compensation-related\nprovisions. The European Banking\nAuthority has instituted guidelines on\ncompensation policies including under\nCRD V which in certain countries, such\nas Germany, are implemented or\nsupplemented by local regulations or\nguidelines. The U.K. regulators have\nalso instituted guidelines on CRD V\ncompensation policies. The Firm expects\nthat the implementation of regulatory\nguidelines regarding compensation in\nthe U.S. and other countries will\ncontinue to evolve, and may affect the\nmanner in which the Firm structures its\ncompensation programs and practices.\n\nOther significant international\nregulatory initiatives:\n\nPolicymakers in the U.K. and EU\ncontinue to implement an extensive\nprogram of regulatory enhancements\nrelating to financial services, several\nkey elements of which are discussed\nbelow.\n\nU.K. and EU policymakers have recently\nproposed changes to the Markets in\nFinancial Instruments Directive (\u201cMiFID\nII\u201d). MiFID II, which requires the\ntrading of shares and certain\nstandardized OTC derivatives to take\nplace on trading venues and also\nsignificantly enhanced requirements for\npre- and post-trade transparency,\ntransaction reporting and investor\nprotection, and introduced a position\nlimits and reporting regime for\ncommodities. In November 2021, the\nEuropean Commission published a draft\nlegislative proposal for amendments to\nMiFID II focused on changes to the\ntransparency and market structure\nrules, including the proposed creation\nof a consolidated tape intended to\nprovide investors with a holistic view\nof trading across the EU. This\nlegislation is subject to review by the\nEuropean Parliament and Council.\n\nIn the U.K., Her Majesty\u2019s Treasury\n(\u201cHMT\u201d) and the FCA have undertaken a\nreview of MiFID II, as adopted in the\nU.K. In July 2021, HMT published its\n\u2018Wholesale Markets Review\u2019\nconsultation, which proposed a broad\nrange of changes covering most parts of\nthe MiFID II legislation. HMT is\nexpected to release its related policy\nstatement in the first quarter of 2022.\nDetailed consultations with specific\nrule proposals relating to the HMT\npolicy statement are expected from the\nFCA during 2022.\n\nIn November 2021, EU legislators agreed\nto delay implementation of the\nmandatory buy-in rules required under\nthe Central Securities Depositories\nRegulation (\u201cCSDR\u201d), which were\npreviously scheduled to become\neffective on February 1, 2022. In the\ninterim, the European Securities and\nMarkets Authority published a letter\n     \n  7  \n     \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                        \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\ndirecting EU competent authorities to\nnot prioritize supervisory action\nagainst firms under the CSDR. The U.K.\npreviously announced in July 2020 that\nit would not be adopting the CSDR\nsettlement discipline regime, which\nincludes both the buy-in regime and the\npenalty regime.\n\nThe U.K. and EU have also proposed\nvarious reforms for the derivatives\nmarket, including proposed amendments\nto clearing obligations (\u201cCO\u201d) under\nthe European Markets and Infrastructure\nRegulation and to derivatives trading\nobligations (\u201cDTO\u201d) under the Markets\nin Financial Instruments Regulation,\nincluding issuing final rules to change\nthe CO and DTO to reflect industry\ntransition away from IBORs to risk-free\nreference rates.\n\nThe finalized Basel III capital and\nliquidity standards for banks and\ninvestment firms, including in relation\nto the leverage ratio, counterparty\ncredit risk capital, large exposures\nand the net stable funding ratio, have\nbeen implemented through legislation\nthat became effective in the EU in June\n2021 and in the U.K. on January 1,\n2022. The Firm\u2019s banking entities in\nthe U.K. and EU will also be required\nto comply with certain changes made by\nthe Basel Committee to the Basel III\nframework, including revisions to the\ncredit risk and operational risk\ncalculation methods, when they are\nimplemented in those jurisdictions. EU\nlegislation also requires that certain\nnon-EU banks operating in the EU\nestablish an intermediate parent\nundertaking (\u201cIPU\u201d) located in the EU.\nThe IPU legislation allows a second IPU\nto be established if a single IPU would\nconflict with \u201chome country\u201d bank\nseparation rules or impede\nresolvability. The Firm will be\nrequired to comply with the EU\u2019s IPU\nrequirements, to the extent applicable,\nby December 30, 2023.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s banking entities in the U.K.\nand EU are subject to supervisory\nexpectations published by the PRA and\nEuropean Central Bank (\u201cECB\u201d),\nrespectively, for management of\nfinancial risks arising from climate\nchange.

The\nCOVID-19 pandemic and governmental\nresponses to the pandemic, which\nincluded the institution of social\ndistancing and shelter-in-place\nrequirements in certain areas of the\nU.S. and other countries, resulted in\nadverse impacts on global economic\nconditions, including:\n\n\u2022 significant disruption and volatility\nin the financial markets\n\n\u2022 significant disruption of global\nsupply chains, and\n\n\u2022 closures of many businesses, leading\nto loss of revenues and increased\nunemployment.\n\nThe adverse economic conditions caused\nby the pandemic have had a negative\nimpact on certain of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbusinesses and results of operations,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 reduction in demand for certain\nproducts and services from JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s clients and customers,\nresulting in lower revenue, and\n\n\u2022 increases in the allowance for credit\nlosses during the early stages of the\npandemic.\n\nAlthough global economic conditions\nhave been improving despite the\ncontinuation of the COVID-19 pandemic,\nany ongoing negative economic impacts\narising from the pandemic or any\nprolongation or worsening of the\npandemic, including as a result of\nadditional waves or variants of the\nCOVID-19 disease or the emergence of\nother diseases that have similar\noutcomes, could have significant\nadverse effects on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbusinesses, results of operations and\nfinancial condition, including:\n\n\u2022 recognition of charge-offs and\nincreases in the allowance for credit\nlosses, including any delayed\nrecognition of charge-offs due to the\nimpact of government stimulus actions\nor payment assistance provided to\nclients and customers\n\n\u2022 material impacts on the value of\nsecurities, derivatives and other\nfinancial instruments which JPMorgan\nChase owns or in which it makes markets\n\n\u2022 downgrades in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit\nratings\n\n\u2022 constraints on liquidity or capital\ndue to elevated levels of deposits,\nincreases in risk-weighted assets\n(\u201cRWA\u201d) related to supporting client\nactivities, downgrades in client credit\nratings, regulatory actions or other\nfactors, any or all of which could\nrequire JPMorgan Chase to take or\nrefrain from taking actions that it\notherwise would under its liquidity and\ncapital management strategies, and\n\n\u2022 the possibility that significant\nportions of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s workforce\nare unable to work effectively,\nincluding because of illness,\nquarantines, shelter-in-place\narrangements, government actions or\nother restrictions in connection with\nthe pandemic.\n\nThe extent to which the COVID-19\npandemic negatively affects JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s businesses, results of\noperations and financial condition, as\nwell as its regulatory capital and\nliquidity ratios, will depend on future\ndevelopments that are uncertain and\ncannot be fully predicted, including:\n\n\u2022 the ultimate scope and duration of\nthe pandemic\n\n\u2022 the effectiveness and acceptance of\nvaccines, and their availability in\ncertain regions\n\n\u2022 actions taken by governmental\nauthorities and other third parties in\nresponse to the pandemic, and\n\n\u2022 the effect that the pandemic or any\nprolongation or worsening of the\npandemic may have on the pace of\neconomic growth, inflation, the\nstrength of labor markets, particularly\nin light of the expiration of\ngovernment assistance programs, and the\npotential for changes in consumer\n      \n  10  \n      \nbehavior that could have longer-term\nimpacts on certain economic sectors.\n\nIn addition, JPMorgan Chase's\nparticipation in U.S. government\nprograms designed to support\nindividuals, households and businesses\nimpacted by the economic disruptions\ncaused by the COVID-19 pandemic,\nwhether directly or indirectly,\nincluding on behalf of customers and\nclients or by affiliated entities,\nnewly-acquired businesses or companies\nin which JPMorgan Chase has made\nprincipal investments, could be\ncriticized and subject JPMorgan Chase\nto:\n\n\u2022 increased governmental and regulatory\nscrutiny\n\n\u2022 negative publicity, and\n\n\u2022 increased exposure to litigation,\n\nany or all of which could increase\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational, legal and\ncompliance costs and damage its\nreputation. To the extent that the\nCOVID-19 pandemic adversely affects\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business, results of\noperations and financial condition, it\nmay also have the effect of heightening\nmany of the other risks described\nbelow.\n                                                                                  \n  Regulatory                                                                      \n                                                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses are highly\nregulated, and the laws, rules and\nregulations that apply to JPMorgan\nChase have a significant impact on its\nbusiness and operations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase is a financial services\nfirm with operations worldwide.\nJPMorgan Chase must comply with the\nlaws, rules and regulations that apply\nto its operations in all of the\njurisdictions around the world in which\nit does business. Regulation of the\nfinancial services industry is\nextensive.\n\nThe regulation and supervision of\nfinancial services firms has expanded\nsignificantly over an extended period\nof time. The increased regulation and\nsupervision of JPMorgan Chase has\naffected the way that it conducts its\nbusiness and structures its operations.\nJPMorgan Chase could be required to\nmake further changes to its business\nand operations in response to expanded\nsupervision or to new or changed laws,\nrules and regulations. These types of\ndevelopments could result in JPMorgan\nChase incurring additional costs in\nconnection with complying with\napplicable laws, rules and regulations,\nwhich could reduce its profitability.\nFurthermore, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s entry\ninto or acquisition of a new business\nor an increase in its principal\ninvestments may require JPMorgan Chase\nto comply with additional laws, rules,\nand regulations.\n\nIn response to new and existing laws,\nrules and regulations and expanded\nsupervision, JPMorgan Chase has in the\npast been and could in the future be,\nrequired to:\n\n\u2022 limit the products and services that\nit offers\n\n\u2022 reduce the liquidity that it can\nprovide through its market-making\nactivities\n\n\u2022 refrain from engaging in business\nopportunities that it might otherwise\npursue\n\n\u2022 pay higher taxes, assessments, levies\nor other governmental charges,\nincluding in connection with the\nresolution of tax examinations\n\n\u2022 incur losses with respect to\nfraudulent transactions perpetrated\nagainst its customers\n\n\u2022 dispose of certain assets, and do so\nat times or prices that are\ndisadvantageous\n\n\u2022 impose restrictions on certain\nbusiness activities, or\n\n\u2022 increase the prices that it charges\nfor products and services, which could\nreduce the demand for them.\n\nIn particular, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbusinesses and results of operations\ncould be adversely impacted by changes\nin laws, rules and regulations, or\nchanges in the application,\ninterpretation or enforcement of laws,\nrules and regulations, that:\n\n\u2022 proscribe or institute more stringent\nrestrictions on certain financial\nservices activities\n\n\u2022 impose new requirements relating to\nthe impact of business activities on\nenvironmental, social and governance\n(\u201cESG\u201d) concerns, the management of\nrisks associated with those concerns\nand the offering of products intended\nto achieve ESG-related objectives, or\n\n\u2022 introduce changes to antitrust or\nanti-competition laws, rules and\nregulations that adversely affect the\nbusiness activities of JPMorgan Chase.\n\nDifferences in financial services\nregulation can be disadvantageous for\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses.\n\nThe content and application of laws,\nrules and regulations affecting\nfinancial services firms sometimes vary\naccording to factors such as the size\nof the firm, the jurisdiction in which\nit is organized or operates, and other\ncriteria. For example:\n\n\u2022 larger firms such as JPMorgan Chase\nare often subject to more stringent\nsupervision and regulation\n\n\u2022 financial technology companies and\nother non-traditional competitors may\nnot be subject to banking regulation,\nor may be supervised by a national or\nstate regulatory agency that does not\nhave the same resources or regulatory\npriorities as the regulatory agencies\nwhich supervise more diversified\nfinancial services firms, or\n\n\u2022 the financial services regulatory\nframework in a particular jurisdiction\nmay favor financial institutions that\nare based in that jurisdiction.\n\nThese types of differences in the\nregulatory framework can result in\nJPMorgan Chase losing market share to\ncompetitors that are less regulated or\nnot subject to regulation, especially\nwith respect to unregulated financial\nproducts.\n      \n  11  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                        \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\nThere can also be significant\ndifferences in the ways that similar\nregulatory initiatives affecting the\nfinancial services industry are\nimplemented in the U.S. and in other\ncountries and regions in which JPMorgan\nChase does business. For example, when\nadopting rules that are intended to\nimplement a global regulatory standard,\na national regulator may introduce\nadditional or more restrictive\nrequirements, which can create\ncompetitive disadvantages for financial\nservices firms, such as JPMorgan Chase,\nthat may be subject to those enhanced\nregulations.\n\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives\noutside the U.S. could require JPMorgan\nChase to make significant modifications\nto its operations and legal entity\nstructure in the relevant countries or\nregions in order to comply with those\nrequirements. These include laws, rules\nand regulations that have been adopted\nor proposed relating to:\n\n\u2022 the establishment of locally-based\nintermediate holding companies or\noperating subsidiaries\n\n\u2022 requirements to maintain minimum\namounts of capital or liquidity in\nlocally-based subsidiaries\n\n\u2022 the separation (or \u201cring fencing\u201d) of\ncore banking products and services from\nmarkets activities\n\n\u2022 the resolution of financial\ninstitutions\n\n\u2022 requirements for executing or\nsettling transactions on exchanges or\nthrough central counterparties (\u201cCCPs\u201d)\n\n\u2022 position limits and reporting rules\nfor derivatives\n\n\u2022 governance and accountability regimes\n\n\u2022 conduct of business and control\nrequirements, and\n\n\u2022 restrictions on compensation.\n\nThese types of differences,\ninconsistencies and conflicts in\nfinancial services regulation have\nrequired and could in the future\nrequire JPMorgan Chase to:\n\n\u2022 divest assets or restructure its\noperations\n\n\u2022 absorb increased operational, capital\nand liquidity costs\n\n\u2022 change the prices that it charges for\nits products and services\n\n\u2022 curtail the products and services\nthat it offers to its customers and\nclients\n\n\u2022 curtail other business opportunities,\nincluding acquisitions or principal\ninvestments, that it otherwise would\nhave pursued, or\n\n\u2022 incur higher costs for complying with\ndifferent legal and regulatory\nframeworks.\n\nAny or all of these factors could harm\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to compete\nagainst other firms that are not\nsubject to the same laws, rules and\nregulations or supervisory oversight,\nor harm JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses,\nresults of operations and\nprofitability.\n\nResolving regulatory investigations can\nsubject JPMorgan Chase to significant\npenalties and collateral consequences,\nand could result in higher compliance\ncosts or restrictions on its\noperations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations are subject\nto heightened oversight and scrutiny\nfrom regulatory authorities in many\njurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase has paid\nsignificant fines, provided other\nmonetary relief, incurred other\npenalties and experienced other\nrepercussions in connection with\nresolving investigations and\nenforcement actions by governmental\nagencies. JPMorgan Chase could become\nsubject to similar regulatory\nresolutions or other actions in the\nfuture, and addressing the requirements\nof any such resolutions or actions\ncould result in JPMorgan Chase\nincurring higher operational and\ncompliance costs, including devoting\nsubstantial resources to the required\nremediation, or needing to comply with\nother restrictions.\n\nIn connection with resolving specific\nregulatory investigations or\nenforcement actions, certain regulators\nhave required JPMorgan Chase and other\nfinancial institutions to admit\nwrongdoing with respect to the\nactivities that gave rise to the\nresolution. These types of admissions\ncan lead to:\n\n\u2022 greater exposure in litigation\n\n\u2022 damage to reputation\n\n\u2022 disqualification from doing business\nwith certain clients or customers, or\nin specific jurisdictions, or\n\n\u2022 other direct and indirect adverse\neffects.\n\nFurthermore, U.S. government officials\nhave demonstrated a willingness to\nbring criminal actions against\nfinancial institutions and have\nrequired that institutions plead guilty\nto criminal offenses or admit other\nwrongdoing in connection with resolving\nregulatory investigations or\nenforcement actions. Resolutions of\nthis type can have significant\ncollateral consequences for the subject\nfinancial institution, including:\n\n\u2022 loss of clients, customers and\nbusiness\n\n\u2022 restrictions on offering certain\nproducts or services, and\n\n\u2022 losing permission to operate certain\nbusinesses, either temporarily or\npermanently.\n\nJPMorgan Chase expects that:\n\n\u2022 it and other financial services firms\nwill continue to be subject to\nheightened regulatory scrutiny and\ngovernmental investigations and\nenforcement actions\n\n\u2022 regulators will continue to require\nthat financial institutions be\npenalized for actual or deemed\nviolations of law with formal and\npunitive enforcement actions, including\nthe imposition of significant monetary\nand other sanctions, rather than\nresolving these matters through\ninformal supervisory actions; and\n      \n  12  \n      \n\u2022 regulators will be more likely to\npursue formal enforcement actions and\nresolutions against JPMorgan Chase to\nthe extent that it has previously been\nsubject to other governmental\ninvestigations or enforcement actions.\n\nIf JPMorgan Chase fails to meet the\nrequirements of any resolution of a\ngovernmental investigation or\nenforcement action, or to maintain risk\nand control processes that meet the\nheightened standards and expectations\nof its regulators, it could be required\nto, among other things:\n\n\u2022 enter into further resolutions of\ninvestigations or enforcement actions\n\n\u2022 pay additional regulatory penalties\nor enter into judgments, or\n\n\u2022 accept material regulatory\nrestrictions on, or changes in the\nmanagement of, its businesses.\n\nIn these circumstances, JPMorgan Chase\ncould also become subject to other\nsanctions, or to prosecution or civil\nlitigation with respect to the conduct\nthat gave rise to an investigation or\nenforcement action.\n\nJPMorgan Chase can face greater risks\nof non-compliance and incur higher\noperational and compliance costs under\nlaws, rules and regulations relating to\nanti-money laundering, economic\nsanctions, embargo programs and anti-\ncorruption.\n\nJPMorgan Chase must comply with laws,\nrules and regulations throughout the\nworld relating to anti-money\nlaundering, economic sanctions, embargo\nprograms and anti-corruption which can\nincrease its risks of non-compliance\nand costs associated with the\nimplementation and maintenance of\ncomplex compliance programs. A\nviolation of any of these legal and\nregulatory requirements could subject\nJPMorgan Chase, or individual\nemployees, to regulatory enforcement\nactions as well as significant civil\nand criminal penalties. In addition,\ncertain national and multi-national\nbodies and governmental agencies\noutside the U.S. have adopted laws,\nrules or regulations that conflict with\nor prohibit a firm such as JPMorgan\nChase from complying with laws, rules\nand regulations to which it is\notherwise subject, creating conflict of\nlaw issues that also increase its risks\nof non-compliance in those\njurisdictions.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations and\nfinancial results can be negatively\nimpacted in countries with less\npredictable legal and regulatory\nframeworks .\n\nJPMorgan Chase conducts existing and\nnew business in certain countries in\nwhich the application of the rule of\nlaw is inconsistent or less\npredictable, including with respect to:\n\n\u2022 the absence of a statutory or\nregulatory basis or guidance for\nengaging in specific types of business\nor transactions\n\n\u2022 conflicting or ambiguous laws, rules\nand regulations, or the inconsistent\napplication or interpretation of\nexisting laws, rules and regulations\n\n\u2022 uncertainty concerning the\nenforceability of contractual,\nintellectual property or other\nobligations\n\n\u2022 difficulty in competing in economies\nin which the government controls or\nprotects all or a portion of the local\neconomy or specific businesses, or\nwhere graft or corruption may be\npervasive, and\n\n\u2022 the threat of arbitrary regulatory\ninvestigations, civil litigations or\ncriminal prosecutions, the termination\nof licenses required to operate in the\nlocal market or the suspension of\nbusiness relationships with\ngovernmental bodies.\n\nIf the application of the laws, rules\nand regulations in a particular country\nis susceptible to producing\ninconsistent or unexpected outcomes,\nthis can create a more difficult\nenvironment in which JPMorgan Chase\nconducts its business and could\nnegatively affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\noperations and reduce its earnings with\nrespect to that country. For example,\nconducting business could require\nJPMorgan Chase to devote significant\nadditional resources to understanding,\nand monitoring changes in, local laws,\nrules and regulations, as well as\nstructuring its operations to comply\nwith local laws, rules and regulations\nand implementing and administering\nrelated internal policies and\nprocedures.\n\nThere can be no assurance that JPMorgan\nChase will always be successful in its\nefforts to fully understand and to\nconduct its business in compliance with\nthe laws, rules and regulations of all\nof the jurisdictions in which it\noperates, and the risk of non-\ncompliance can be greater in countries\nthat have less predictable legal and\nregulatory systems.\n\nRequirements for the orderly resolution\nof JPMorgan Chase could result in\nJPMorgan Chase having to restructure or\nreorganize its businesses and could\nincrease its funding or operational\ncosts or curtail its businesses.\n\nJPMorgan Chase is required under\nFederal Reserve and FDIC rules to\nprepare and submit periodically to\nthose agencies a detailed plan for\nrapid and orderly resolution in\nbankruptcy, without extraordinary\ngovernment support, in the event of\nmaterial financial distress or failure.\nThe agencies\u2019 evaluation of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s resolution plan may change, and\nthe requirements for resolution plans\nmay be modified from time to time. Any\nsuch determinations or modifications\ncould result in JPMorgan Chase needing\nto make changes to its legal entity\nstructure or to certain internal or\nexternal activities, which could\nincrease its funding or operational\ncosts, or hamper its ability to serve\nclients and customers.\n\nIf the Federal Reserve and the FDIC\nwere both to determine that a\nresolution plan submitted by JPMorgan\nChase has deficiencies, they could\njointly impose more stringent capital,\nleverage or liquidity requirements or\nrestrictions on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\ngrowth, activities or operations. The\nagencies could also require that\nJPMorgan Chase restructure, reorganize\nor divest assets or businesses in\n      \n  13  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                        \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\nways that could materially and\nadversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\noperations and strategy.\n\nHolders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s debt\nand equity securities will absorb\nlosses if it were to enter into a\nresolution.\n\nFederal Reserve rules require that\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (the \u201cParent\nCompany\u201d) maintain minimum levels of\nunsecured external long-term debt and\nother loss-absorbing capacity with\nspecific terms (\u201celigible LTD\u201d) for\npurposes of recapitalizing JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s operating subsidiaries if the\nParent Company were to enter into a\nresolution either:\n\n\u2022 in a bankruptcy proceeding under\nChapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,\nor\n\n\u2022 in a receivership administered by the\nFDIC under Title II of the Dodd-Frank\nAct (\u201cTitle II\u201d).\n\nIf the Parent Company were to enter\ninto a resolution, holders of eligible\nLTD and other debt and equity\nsecurities of the Parent Company will\nabsorb the losses of the Parent Company\nand its subsidiaries.\n\nThe preferred \u201csingle point of entry\u201d\nstrategy under JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nresolution plan contemplates that only\nthe Parent Company would enter\nbankruptcy proceedings. JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s subsidiaries would be\nrecapitalized, as needed, so that they\ncould continue normal operations or\nsubsequently be divested or wound down\nin an orderly manner. As a result, the\nParent Company\u2019s losses and any losses\nincurred by its subsidiaries would be\nimposed first on holders of the Parent\nCompany\u2019s equity securities and\nthereafter on its unsecured creditors,\nincluding holders of eligible LTD and\nother debt securities. Claims of\nholders of those securities would have\na junior position to the claims of\ncreditors of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nsubsidiaries and to the claims of\npriority (as determined by statute) and\nsecured creditors of the Parent\nCompany.\n\nAccordingly, in a resolution of the\nParent Company in bankruptcy, holders\nof eligible LTD and other debt\nsecurities of the Parent Company would\nrealize value only to the extent\navailable to the Parent Company as a\nshareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. and its other subsidiaries, and\nonly after any claims of priority and\nsecured creditors of the Parent Company\nhave been fully repaid.\n\nThe FDIC has similarly indicated that a\nsingle point of entry recapitalization\nmodel could be a desirable strategy to\nresolve a systemically important\nfinancial institution, such as the\nParent Company, under Title II.\nHowever, the FDIC has not formally\nadopted a single point of entry\nresolution strategy.\n\nIf the Parent Company were to approach,\nor enter into, a resolution, none of\nthe Parent Company, the Federal Reserve\nor the FDIC is obligated to follow\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s preferred resolution\nstrategy, and losses to holders of\neligible LTD and other debt and equity\nsecurities of the\n\nParent Company, under whatever strategy\nis ultimately followed, could be\ngreater than they might have been under\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s preferred strategy.\n                                                                                  \n  Political                                                                       \n                                                                                  \nEconomic uncertainty or instability\ncaused by political developments can\nnegatively impact JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbusinesses.\n\nPolitical developments in the U.S. and\nother countries can cause uncertainty\nin the economic environment and market\nconditions in which JPMorgan Chase\noperates its businesses. Certain\nmonetary, fiscal and other policy\ninitiatives and proposals could\nsignificantly affect U.S. and global\neconomic growth and cause higher\nvolatility in the financial markets,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 monetary policies and actions taken\nby the Federal Reserve and other\ncentral banks or governmental\nauthorities, including any sustained\nlarge-scale asset purchases or any\nsuspension or reversal of those actions\n\n\u2022 fiscal policies, including with\nrespect to taxation and spending\n\n\u2022 actions that governments take or fail\nto take in response to the effects of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the\neffectiveness of any actions taken\n\n\u2022 isolationist foreign policies\n\n\u2022 an outbreak or escalation of\nhostilities or other geopolitical\ninstabilities\n\n\u2022 economic sanctions\n\n\u2022 the implementation of tariffs and\nother protectionist trade policies, or\n\n\u2022 other governmental policies or\nactions adopted or taken in response to\npolitical or social pressures.\n\nThese types of political developments,\nand uncertainty about the possible\noutcomes of these developments, could:\n\n\u2022 erode investor confidence in the U.S.\neconomy and financial markets, which\ncould potentially undermine the status\nof the U.S. dollar as a safe haven\ncurrency\n\n\u2022 provoke retaliatory countermeasures\nby other countries and otherwise\nheighten tensions in diplomatic\nrelations\n\n\u2022 lead to the withdrawal of government\nsupport for agencies and enterprises\nsuch as the U.S. Federal National\nMortgage Association and the U.S.\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation\n(together, the \u201cU.S. GSEs\u201d)\n\n\u2022 increase concerns about whether the\nU.S. government will be funded, and its\noutstanding debt serviced, at any\nparticular time\n\n\u2022 result in periodic shutdowns of the\nU.S. government or governments in other\ncountries\n      \n  14  \n      \n\u2022 increase investor reliance on actions\nby the Federal Reserve or other central\nbanks, or influence investor\nperceptions concerning government\nsupport of sectors of the economy or\nthe economy as a whole\n\n\u2022 adversely affect the financial\ncondition or credit ratings of clients\nand counterparties with which JPMorgan\nChase does business, or\n\n\u2022 cause JPMorgan Chase to refrain from\nengaging in business opportunities that\nit might otherwise pursue.\n\nThese factors could lead to:\n\n\u2022 slower growth rates, rising inflation\nor recession\n\n\u2022 greater market volatility\n\n\u2022 a contraction of available credit and\nthe widening of credit spreads\n\n\u2022 erosion of adequate risk premium on\ncertain financial assets\n\n\u2022 diminished investor and

a\npolitical or economic alliance or\ntreaty\n\n\u2022 potential expropriation or\nnationalization of assets, or\n\n\u2022 other market dislocations, including\nthe spread of unfavorable economic\nconditions from a particular country or\nregion to other countries or regions.\n\nAny of these potential outcomes could\ncause JPMorgan Chase to suffer losses\non its market-making positions or in\nits investment portfolio, reduce its\nliquidity and capital levels, increase\ncredit risk, hamper its ability to\ndeliver products and services to its\nclients and customers, and weaken its\nresults of operations and financial\ncondition.\n                                                                                  \n  Market

businesses and\ninvestment and market-making positions.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s results of operations\ncan be negatively affected by adverse\nchanges in any of the following:\n\n\u2022 investor, consumer and business\nsentiment\n\n\u2022 events that reduce confidence in the\nfinancial markets\n\n\u2022 inflation or deflation\n\n\u2022 high unemployment or, conversely, a\ntightening labor market\n\n\u2022 the availability and cost of capital,\nliquidity and credit\n\n\u2022 levels and volatility of interest\nrates, credit spreads and market prices\nfor currencies, equities and\ncommodities, and the duration of any\nchanges in levels or volatility\n\n\u2022 the economic effects of an outbreak\nor escalation of hostilities, terrorism\nor other geopolitical instabilities,\ncyber attacks, climate change, natural\ndisasters, severe weather conditions,\nhealth emergencies, the spread of\ninfectious diseases, epidemics or\npandemics or other extraordinary events\nbeyond JPMorgan Chase\u2019s control, and\n\n\u2022 the health of the U.S. and global\neconomies.\n\nAll of these are affected by global\neconomic, market and political events\nand conditions, as well as regulatory\nrestrictions.\n\nIn addition, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\ninvestment portfolio and market-making\nbusinesses can suffer losses due to\nunanticipated market events, including:\n\n\u2022 severe declines in asset values\n\n\u2022 unexpected credit events\n\n\u2022 unforeseen events or conditions that\nmay cause previously uncorrelated\nfactors to become correlated (and vice\nversa)\n\n\u2022 the inability to effectively hedge\nmarket and other risks related to\nmarket-making and investment portfolio\npositions, or\n\n\u2022 other market risks that may not have\nbeen appropriately taken into account\nin the development, structuring or\npricing of a financial instrument.\n\nIf JPMorgan Chase experiences\nsignificant losses in its investment\nportfolio or from market-making\nactivities, this could reduce JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s profitability and its liquidity\nand capital levels, and thereby\nconstrain the growth of its businesses.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer businesses\ncan be negatively affected by adverse\neconomic conditions and governmental\npolicies.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer businesses\nare particularly affected by U.S.

levels of unemployment or\nunderemployment that result in reduced\npersonal and household income could\nnegatively affect consumer credit\nperformance to the extent that\nconsumers are less able to service\ntheir debts. In addition, sustained low\ngrowth, low or negative interest rates,\ninflationary pressures or recessionary\nconditions could diminish customer\ndemand for the products and services\noffered by JPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer\nbusinesses.\n\nAdverse economic conditions could also\nlead to an increase in delinquencies,\nadditions to the allowance for credit\nlosses and higher net charge-offs,\nwhich can reduce JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nearnings. These consequences could be\nsignificantly worse in certain\ngeographies and industry segments where\ndeclining industrial or manufacturing\nactivity has resulted in or could\nresult in higher levels of\nunemployment, or where high levels of\nconsumer debt, such as outstanding\nstudent loans, could impair the ability\nof customers to pay their other\nconsumer loan obligations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings from its\nconsumer businesses could also be\nadversely affected by governmental\npolicies and actions that affect\nconsumers, including:\n\n\u2022 policies and initiatives relating to\nmedical insurance, education,\nimmigration, employment status and\nhousing, and\n\n\u2022 policies aimed at the economy more\nbroadly, such as higher taxes and\nincreased regulation which could result\nin reductions in consumer disposable\nincome.\n\nIn addition, governmental proposals to\npermit student loan obligations to be\ndischarged in bankruptcy proceedings\ncould, if enacted into law, encourage\ncertain of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s customers\nto declare personal bankruptcy and\nthereby trigger defaults and charge-\noffs of credit card and other consumer\nloans extended to those customers.\n\nUnfavorable market and economic\nconditions can have an adverse effect\non JPMorgan Chase\u2019s wholesale\nbusinesses.\n\nIn JPMorgan Chase\u2019s wholesale\nbusinesses, market and economic factors\ncan affect the volume of transactions\nthat JPMorgan Chase executes for its\nclients or for which it advises\nclients, and, therefore, the revenue\nthat JPMorgan Chase receives from those\ntransactions. These factors can also\ninfluence the willingness of other\nfinancial institutions and investors to\nparticipate in capital markets\ntransactions that JPMorgan Chase\nmanages, such as loan syndications or\nsecurities underwritings. Furthermore,\nif a significant and sustained\ndeterioration in market conditions were\nto occur, the profitability of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s capital markets businesses,\nincluding its loan syndication,\nsecurities underwriting and leveraged\nlending activities, could be reduced to\nthe extent that those businesses:\n\n\u2022 earn less fee revenue due to lower\ntransaction volumes, including when\nclients are unwilling or unable to\nrefinance their outstanding debt\nobligations in unfavorable market\nconditions, or\n\n\u2022 dispose of portions of credit\ncommitments at a loss, or hold larger\nresidual positions in credit\ncommitments that cannot be sold at\nfavorable prices.\n\nAn adverse change in market conditions\nin particular segments of the economy,\nsuch as a sudden and severe downturn in\noil and gas prices or an increase in\ncommodity prices, or sustained changes\nin consumer behavior that affect\nspecific economic sectors, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on clients of\nJPMorgan Chase whose operations or\nfinancial condition are directly or\nindirectly dependent on the health or\nstability of those market segments or\neconomic sectors, as well as clients\nthat are engaged in related businesses.\nJPMorgan Chase could incur losses on\nits loans and other credit commitments\nto clients that operate in, or are\ndependent on, any sector of the economy\nthat is under stress.\n\nThe fees that JPMorgan Chase earns from\nmanaging client assets or holding\nassets under custody for clients could\nbe diminished by declining asset values\nor other adverse macroeconomic\nconditions. For example, higher\ninterest rates or a downturn in\nfinancial markets could affect the\nvaluations of client assets that\nJPMorgan Chase manages or holds under\ncustody, which, in turn, could affect\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s revenue from fees that\nare based on the amount of assets under\nmanagement or custody. Similarly,\nadverse macroeconomic or market\nconditions could prompt outflows from\nJPMorgan Chase funds or accounts, or\ncause clients to invest in products\nthat generate lower revenue.\nSubstantial and unexpected withdrawals\nfrom a JPMorgan Chase fund can also\nhamper the investment performance of\nthe fund, particularly if the outflows\ncreate the need for the fund to dispose\nof fund assets at disadvantageous times\nor prices, and could lead to further\nwithdrawals based on the weaker\ninvestment performance.\n\nAn economic downturn or sustained\nchanges in consumer behavior that\nresults in shifts in consumer and\nbusiness spending could also have a\nnegative impact on certain of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s wholesale clients, and thereby\ndiminish JPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings from\nits wholesale operations. For example,\nthe businesses of certain of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s wholesale clients are dependent\non consistent streams of rental income\nfrom commercial real estate properties\nwhich are owned or being built by those\nclients. Sustained adverse economic\nconditions could result in reductions\nin the rental cash flows that owners or\ndevelopers receive from their tenants\nwhich, in turn, could depress the\nvalues of the properties and impair the\nability of borrowers to service or\nrefinance their commercial real estate\nloans. These consequences could result\nin JPMorgan Chase experiencing\nincreases in the allowance for credit\nlosses, higher delinquencies, defaults\nand charge-offs within its commercial\nreal estate loan portfolio and\nincurring higher costs for servicing a\nlarger volume of delinquent loans in\nthat portfolio, thereby reducing\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings from its\nwholesale businesses.\n      \n  16  \n      \nChanges in interest rates and credit\nspreads can adversely affect certain of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s revenue and income\nstreams related to its traditional\nbanking and funding activities.\n\nIn general, a low or negative interest\nrate environment may cause:\n\n\u2022 net interest margins to be\ncompressed, which could reduce the\namounts that JPMorgan Chase earns on\nits investment securities portfolio to\nthe extent that it is unable to\nreinvest contemporaneously in higher-\nyielding instruments\n\n\u2022 unanticipated or adverse changes in\ndepositor behavior, which could\nnegatively affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbroader asset and liability management\nstrategy\n\n\u2022 JPMorgan Chase to reduce the amount\nof deposits that it accepts from\ncustomers and clients, which could\nresult in lower revenues, and\n\n\u2022 a reduction in the value of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s mortgage servicing rights\n(\u201cMSRs\u201d) asset, thereby decreasing\nrevenues.\n\nWhen credit spreads widen, it becomes\nmore expensive for JPMorgan Chase to\nborrow. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit spreads\nmay widen or narrow not only in\nresponse to events and circumstances\nthat are specific to JPMorgan Chase but\nalso as a result of general economic\nand geopolitical events and conditions.\nChanges in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit\nspreads will affect, positively or\nnegatively, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings\non certain liabilities, such as\nderivatives, that are recorded at fair\nvalue.\n\nWhen interest rates are increasing,\nJPMorgan Chase can generally be\nexpected to earn higher net interest\nincome. However, higher interest rates\ncan also lead to:\n\n\u2022 fewer originations of commercial and\nresidential real estate loans\n\n\u2022 losses on underwriting exposures\n\n\u2022 the loss of deposits, including in\nthe event that JPMorgan Chase makes\nincorrect assumptions about depositor\nbehavior\n\n\u2022 unrealized mark-to-market losses on\navailable-for-sale (\u201cAFS\u201d) securities\nheld in the investment securities\nportfolio\n\n\u2022 lower net interest income if central\nbanks introduce interest rate increases\nmore quickly than anticipated and this\nresults in a misalignment in the\npricing of short-term and long-term\nborrowings\n\n\u2022 less liquidity in the financial\nmarkets, and\n\n\u2022 higher funding costs.\n\nAll of these outcomes could adversely\naffect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings or its\nliquidity and capital levels. Higher\ninterest rates can also negatively\naffect the payment\n\nperformance on loans within JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s consumer and wholesale loan\nportfolios that are linked to variable\ninterest rates. If borrowers of\nvariable rate loans are unable to\nafford higher interest payments, those\nborrowers may reduce or stop making\npayments, thereby causing JPMorgan\nChase to incur losses and increased\noperational costs related to servicing\na higher volume of delinquent loans.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s results may be\nmaterially affected by market\nfluctuations and significant changes in\nthe value of financial instruments.\n\nThe value of securities, derivatives\nand other financial instruments which\nJPMorgan Chase owns or in which it\nmakes markets can be materially\naffected by market fluctuations. Market\nvolatility, illiquid market conditions\nand other disruptions in the financial\nmarkets may make it extremely difficult\nto value certain financial instruments.\nSubsequent valuations of financial\ninstruments in future periods, in light\nof factors then prevailing, may result\nin significant changes in the value of\nthese instruments. In addition, at the\ntime of any disposition of these\nfinancial instruments, the price that\nJPMorgan Chase ultimately realizes will\ndepend on the demand and liquidity in\nthe market at that time and may be\nmaterially lower than their current\nfair value. Any of these factors could\ncause a decline in the value of\nfinancial instruments that JPMorgan\nChase owns or in which it makes\nmarkets, which may have an adverse\neffect on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s results of\noperations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s risk management and\nmonitoring processes, including its\nstress testing framework, seek to\nquantify and control JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nexposure to more extreme market moves.\nHowever, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s hedging and\nother risk management strategies may\nnot be effective, and it could incur\nsignificant losses, if extreme market\nevents were to occur.\n                                                                                  \n  Credit                                                                          \n                                                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase can be negatively\naffected by adverse changes in the\nfinancial condition of clients,\ncounterparties, custodians and CCPs.\n\nJPMorgan Chase routinely executes\ntransactions with clients and\ncounterparties such as corporations,\nfinancial institutions, asset managers,\nhedge funds, securities exchanges and\ngovernment entities within and outside\nthe U.S. Many of these transactions\nexpose JPMorgan Chase to the credit\nrisk of its clients and counterparties,\nand can involve JPMorgan Chase in\ndisputes and litigation if a client or\ncounterparty defaults. JPMorgan Chase\ncan also be subject to losses or\nliability where a financial institution\nthat it has appointed to provide\ncustodial services for client assets or\nfunds becomes insolvent as a result of\nfraud or the failure to abide by\nexisting laws and obligations.\n\nA default by, or the financial or\noperational failure of, a CCP through\nwhich JPMorgan Chase executes contracts\nwould require JPMorgan Chase to replace\nthose contracts, thereby\n      \n  17  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                        \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\nincreasing its operational costs and\npotentially resulting in losses. In\naddition, JPMorgan Chase can be exposed\nto losses if a member of a CCP in which\nJPMorgan Chase is also a member\ndefaults on its obligations to the CCP\nbecause of requirements that each\nmember of the CCP absorb a portion of\nthose losses. Furthermore, JPMorgan\nChase can be subject to bearing its\nshare of non-default losses incurred by\na CCP, including losses from custodial,\nsettlement or investment activities or\ndue to cyber or other security\nbreaches.\n\nAs part of its clearing services\nactivities, JPMorgan Chase is exposed\nto the risk of nonperformance by its\nclients, which it seeks to mitigate by\nrequiring clients to provide adequate\ncollateral. JPMorgan Chase is also\nexposed to intra-day credit risk of its\nclients in connection with providing\ncash management, clearing, custodial\nand other transaction services to those\nclients. If a client for which JPMorgan\nChase provides these services becomes\nbankrupt or insolvent, JPMorgan Chase\nmay incur losses, become involved in\ndisputes and litigation with one or\nmore CCPs, the client\u2019s bankruptcy\nestate and other creditors, or be\nsubject to regulatory investigations.\nAll of the foregoing events can\nincrease JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational\nand litigation costs, and JPMorgan\nChase may suffer losses to the extent\nthat any collateral that it has\nreceived is insufficient to cover those\nlosses.\n\nTransactions with government entities,\nincluding national, state, provincial,\nmunicipal and local authorities, can\nexpose JPMorgan Chase to enhanced\nsovereign, credit, operational and\nreputation risks. Government entities\nmay, among other things, claim that\nactions taken by government officials\nwere beyond the legal authority of\nthose officials or repudiate\ntransactions authorized by a previous\nincumbent government. These types of\nactions have in the past caused, and\ncould in the future cause, JPMorgan\nChase to suffer losses or hamper its\nability to conduct business in the\nrelevant jurisdiction.\n\nIn addition, local laws, rules and\nregulations could limit JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s ability to resolve disputes and\nlitigation in the event of a\ncounterparty default or unwillingness\nto make previously agreed-upon\npayments, which could subject JPMorgan\nChase to losses.\n\nDisputes may arise with counterparties\nto derivatives contracts with regard to\nthe terms, the settlement procedures or\nthe value of underlying collateral. The\ndisposition of those disputes could\ncause JPMorgan Chase to incur\nunexpected transaction, operational and\nlegal costs, or result in credit\nlosses. These consequences can also\nimpair JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to\neffectively manage its credit risk\nexposure from its market activities, or\ncause harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nreputation.\n\nThe financial or operational failure of\na significant market participant, such\nas a major financial institution or a\nCCP, or concerns about the\ncreditworthiness of such a market\nparticipant, can have a cascading\neffect within the financial markets.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses could be\n\nsignificantly disrupted by such an\nevent, particularly if it leads to\nother market participants incurring\nsignificant losses, experiencing\nliquidity issues or defaulting, and\nJPMorgan Chase is likely to have\nsignificant interrelationships with,\nand credit exposure to, such a\nsignificant market participant.\n\nJPMorgan Chase may suffer losses if the\nvalue of collateral declines in\nstressed market conditions.\n\nDuring periods of market stress or\nilliquidity, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit\nrisk may be further increased when:\n\n\u2022 JPMorgan Chase fails to realize the\nfair value of the collateral it holds\n\n\u2022 collateral is liquidated at prices\nthat are not sufficient to recover the\nfull amount owed to it, or\n\n\u2022 counterparties are unable to post\ncollateral, whether for operational or\nother reasons.\n\nFurthermore, disputes with\ncounterparties concerning the valuation\nof collateral may increase in times of\nsignificant market stress, volatility\nor illiquidity, and JPMorgan Chase\ncould suffer losses during these\nperiods if it is unable to realize the\nfair value of collateral or to manage\ndeclines in the value of collateral.\n\nJPMorgan Chase could incur significant\nlosses arising from concentrations of\ncredit and market risk.\n\nJPMorgan Chase is exposed to greater\ncredit and market risk to the extent\nthat groupings of its clients or\ncounterparties:\n\n\u2022 engage in similar or related\nbusinesses, or in businesses in related\nindustries\n\n\u2022 do business in the same geographic\nregion, or\n\n\u2022 have business profiles, models or\nstrategies that could cause their\nability to meet their obligations to be\nsimilarly affected by changes in\neconomic conditions.\n\nFor example, a significant\ndeterioration in the credit quality of\none of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s borrowers or\ncounterparties could lead to concerns\nabout the creditworthiness of other\nborrowers or counterparties in similar,\nrelated or dependent industries. This\ntype of interrelationship could\nexacerbate JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit,\nliquidity and market risk exposure and\npotentially cause it to incur losses,\nincluding fair value losses in its\nmarket-making businesses and investment\nportfolios. In addition, JPMorgan Chase\nmay be required to increase the\nallowance for credit losses with\nrespect to certain clients or\nindustries in order to align with\ndirectives or expectations of its\nbanking regulators.\n\nSimilarly, challenging economic\nconditions that affect a particular\nindustry or geographic area could lead\nto concerns about the credit quality of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s borrowers or\ncounterparties not only in that\nparticular industry or geography but in\nrelated or dependent industries,\nwherever located. These conditions\ncould also heighten concerns about the\nability of customers of\n      \n  18  \n      \nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer businesses\nwho live in those areas or work in\nthose affected industries or related or\ndependent industries to meet their\nobligations to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan\nChase regularly monitors various\nsegments of its credit and market risk\nexposures to assess the potential risks\nof concentration or contagion, but its\nefforts to diversify or hedge its\nexposures against those risks may not\nbe successful.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer businesses\ncan also be harmed by an excessive\nexpansion of consumer credit by bank or\nnon-bank competitors. Heightened\ncompetition for certain types of\nconsumer loans could prompt industry-\nwide reactions such as significant\nreductions in the pricing or margins of\nthose loans or the making of loans to\nless-creditworthy borrowers. If large\nnumbers of consumers subsequently\ndefault on their loans, whether due to\nweak credit profiles, an economic\ndownturn or other factors, this could\nimpair their ability to repay\nobligations owed to JPMorgan Chase and\nresult in higher charge-offs and other\ncredit-related losses. More broadly,\nwidespread defaults on consumer debt\ncould lead to recessionary conditions\nin the U.S. economy, and JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s consumer businesses may earn\nlower revenues in such an environment.\n\nIf JPMorgan Chase is unable to reduce\npositions effectively during a market\ndislocation, this can increase both the\nmarket and credit risks associated with\nthose positions and the level of RWA\nthat JPMorgan Chase holds on its\nbalance sheet. These factors could\nadversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\ncapital position, funding costs and the\nprofitability of its businesses.\n                                                                                  \n  Liquidity                                                                       \n                                                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to operate its\nbusinesses could be impaired if its\nliquidity is constrained.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s liquidity could be\nimpaired at any given time by factors\nsuch as:\n\n\u2022 market-wide illiquidity or disruption\n\n\u2022 unforeseen liquidity or capital\nrequirements, including as a result of\nchanges in laws, rules and regulations\n\n\u2022 inability to sell assets, or to sell\nassets at favorable times or prices\n\n\u2022 default by a CCP or other significant\nmarket participant\n\n\u2022 unanticipated outflows of cash or\ncollateral\n\n\u2022 unexpected loss of consumer deposits\nor higher than anticipated draws on\nlending-related commitments, and\n\n\u2022 lack of market or customer confidence\nin JPMorgan Chase or financial\ninstitutions in general.\n\nA reduction in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nliquidity may be caused by events over\nwhich it has little or no control. For\nexample, during periods of market\nstress, low investor confidence and\nsignificant market illiquidity could\nresult in higher\n\nfunding costs for JPMorgan Chase and\ncould limit its access to some of its\ntraditional sources of liquidity.\n\nJPMorgan Chase may need to raise\nfunding from alternative sources if its\naccess to stable and lower-cost sources\nof funding, such as deposits and\nborrowings from Federal Home Loan\nBanks, is reduced. Alternative sources\nof funding could be more expensive or\nlimited in availability. JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s funding costs could also be\nnegatively affected by actions that\nJPMorgan Chase may take in order to:\n\n\u2022 satisfy applicable liquidity coverage\nratio and net stable funding ratio\nrequirements\n\n\u2022 address obligations under its\nresolution plan, or\n\n\u2022 satisfy regulatory requirements in\njurisdictions outside the U.S. relating\nto the pre-positioning of liquidity in\nsubsidiaries that are material legal\nentities.\n\nMore generally, if JPMorgan Chase fails\nto effectively manage its liquidity,\nthis could constrain its ability to\nfund or invest in its businesses and\nsubsidiaries, and thereby adversely\naffect its results of operations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding\ncompany and depends on the cash flows\nof its subsidiaries to make payments on\nits outstanding securities.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding\ncompany that holds the stock of\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and an\nintermediate holding company, JPMorgan\nChase Holdings LLC (the \u201cIHC\u201d). The IHC\nin turn generally holds the stock of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s subsidiaries other\nthan JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its\nsubsidiaries.

Rating agencies\nevaluate both general and firm-specific\nand industry-specific factors when\ndetermining credit ratings for a\nparticular financial institution,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 expected future profitability\n\n\u2022 risk management practices\n\n\u2022 legal expenses\n\n\u2022 ratings differentials between bank\nholding companies and their bank and\nnon-bank subsidiaries\n\n\u2022 regulatory developments\n\n\u2022 assumptions about government support,\nand\n\n\u2022 economic and geopolitical\ndevelopments.\n\nJPMorgan Chase closely monitors and\nmanages, to the extent that it is able,\nfactors that could influence its credit\nratings. However, there is no assurance\nthat JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit ratings\nwill not be lowered in the future.\nFurthermore, any such downgrade could\noccur at times of broader market\ninstability when JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\noptions for responding to events may be\nmore limited and general investor\nconfidence is low.\n\nA reduction in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit\nratings could curtail JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbusiness activities and reduce its\nprofitability in a number of ways,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 reducing its access to capital\nmarkets\n\n\u2022 materially increasing its cost of\nissuing and servicing securities\n\n\u2022 triggering additional collateral or\nfunding requirements, and\n\n\u2022 decreasing the number of investors\nand counterparties that are willing or\npermitted to do business with or lend\nto JPMorgan Chase.\n\nAny rating reduction could also\nincrease the credit spreads charged by\nthe market for taking credit risk on\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. and its\nsubsidiaries. This could, in turn,\nadversely affect the value of debt and\nother obligations of JPMorgan Chase &\nCo. and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe reform and replacement of benchmark\nrates could adversely affect financial\ninstruments issued, funded, serviced or\nheld by JPMorgan Chase and expose it to\nlitigation and other disputes.\n\nInterest rate, equity, foreign exchange\nrate and other types of indices which\nare deemed to be \u201cbenchmarks,\u201d\nincluding those in widespread and\nlongstanding use, have been the subject\nof ongoing international, national and\nother regulatory scrutiny and\ninitiatives for reform, including:\n\n\u2022 changes to the rules and\nmethodologies under which certain\nbenchmarks are administered\n\n\u2022 initiatives designed to discourage or\nprohibit the use of certain benchmarks\nby market participants\n\n\u2022 the introduction of alternative\nreference rates to be used by market\nparticipants in lieu of certain\nbenchmarks, and\n\n\u2022 legislative proposals and actions\nproviding for the replacement of\nreference rates under existing\ncontracts and instruments that are\nlinked to certain benchmarks with\nalternative reference rates .\n\nSome of these reforms are already\neffective while others are still to be\nimplemented or are under consideration.\nThese and other reforms relating to\nbenchmarks could:\n\n\u2022 cause certain benchmarks to be\nsubstantially modified or to be\npermanently discontinued\n\n\u2022 lead to disruptions in the financial\nmarkets, including in connection with\nthe transition to alternative reference\nrates\n\n\u2022 give rise to litigation and other\ndisputes\n\n\u2022 cause reputational harm to the extent\nthat operational and technology systems\nare not sufficiently prepared for the\ntransition to alternative reference\nrates, or\n\n\u2022 have other consequences which cannot\nbe fully anticipated.\n\nAny of these developments, and any\nfuture initiatives to regulate, reform\nor change the administration of\nbenchmarks, could result in adverse\nconsequences to the return on, value of\nand market for loans, mortgages,\nsecurities, derivatives and other\nfinancial instruments whose returns are\nlinked to any such benchmark, including\nthose issued, funded, serviced or held\nby JPMorgan Chase.\n\nChanges in the manner in which certain\nbenchmarks are administered, or the\ngeneral increased regulatory scrutiny\nof those benchmarks, could increase the\ncosts and risks of administering or\notherwise participating in the setting\nof those benchmarks and complying with\nregulations or requirements relating to\nthose benchmarks. Such factors may have\nthe effect of discouraging market\nparticipants from continuing to\nadminister or contribute to certain\nbenchmarks, trigger further changes in\nthe rules or methodologies under which\ncertain benchmarks are\n      \n  20  \n      \nadministered or lead to the\ndiscontinuation of certain benchmarks.\n\nRegulators, industry bodies and other\nmarket participants in the U.S. and\nother countries continue to engage in\ninitiatives to develop, introduce and\nencourage the use of alternative\nreference rates to replace certain\nbenchmarks, and certain of these\nalternative rates have gained or are\ngaining acceptance among market\nparticipants. However, there is no\nassurance that:\n\n\u2022 any of these new rates will be\nsimilar to, or produce the economic\nequivalent of, the benchmarks that they\nseek to replace\n\n\u2022 arrangements by market participants\nto prepare for the discontinuation of\ncertain benchmarks and the transition\nto alternative reference rates will be\nfully effective, or\n\n\u2022 a particular alternative reference\nrate will be widely accepted by market\nparticipants, or that market acceptance\nof that rate will not be hindered by\nthe introduction of other reference\nrates.\n\nIf a particular benchmark were to be\ndiscontinued and an alternative\nreference rate has not been\nsuccessfully introduced or widely\naccepted within the market, this could\nresult in significant adverse effects\non the financial markets. For example,\nvast amounts of loans, mortgages,\nsecurities, derivatives and other\nfinancial instruments are linked to the\nLondon Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d)\nbenchmark. ICE Benchmark\nAdministration, the administrator of\nLIBOR, has announced that the\npublication of the principal tenors of\nU.S. dollar LIBOR will cease after June\n30, 2023, and significant progress has\nbeen made by regulators, industry\nbodies and market participants to\nintroduce and implement the Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as a\nreplacement rate for U.S. dollar LIBOR.\nHowever, if an alternative reference\nrate such as SOFR has not achieved\nsufficient market acceptance when the\npublication of the principal tenors of\nU.S. dollar LIBOR is discontinued, or\nif market participants have not\notherwise implemented effective\ntransitional arrangements to address\nthat discontinuation, this could result\nin widespread dislocation in the\nfinancial markets, volatility in the\npricing of securities, derivatives and\nother instruments, and the suppression\nof capital markets activities, all of\nwhich could have a negative impact on\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s results of operations\nand on U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked\nsecurities, credit or other instruments\nwhich are issued, funded, serviced or\nheld by JPMorgan Chase.\n\nJPMorgan Chase could also become\ninvolved in litigation and other types\nof disputes with clients, customers,\ncounterparties and investors as a\nconsequence of the transition from U.S.\ndollar LIBOR and other benchmark rates\nto replacement rates, including claims\nthat JPMorgan Chase has:\n\n\u2022 treated clients, customers,\ncounterparties or investors unfairly,\nor caused them to experience losses,\nhigher financing costs or lower returns\non investments\n\n\u2022 failed to appropriately communicate\nthe effects of the transition from\nbenchmark rates on the products that\nJPMorgan Chase has sold to its clients\nand customers, or failed to disclose\npurported conflicts of interest\n\n\u2022 made inappropriate product\nrecommendations to or investments on\nbehalf of its clients, or sold products\nthat did not serve their intended\npurpose, in connection with the\ntransition from benchmark rates\n\n\u2022 engaged in anti-competitive behavior,\nor in the manipulation of markets or\nspecific benchmarks, in connection with\nthe discontinuation of or transition\nfrom benchmark rates, or\n\n\u2022 disadvantaged clients, customers,\ncounterparties or investors when\ninterpreting or making determinations\nunder the terms of agreements or\nfinancial instruments.\n\nThese types of claims could subject\nJPMorgan Chase to higher legal expenses\nand operational costs, require it to\npay significant amounts in connection\nwith resolving litigation and other\ndisputes, and harm its reputation.\n                                                                                  \n  Capital                                                                         \n                                                                                  \nMaintaining the required level and\ncomposition of capital may impact\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to support\nbusiness activities, meet evolving\nregulatory requirements and distribute\ncapital to shareholders.\n\nJPMorgan Chase is subject to various\nregulatory capital requirements,\nincluding leverage- and risk-based\ncapital requirements. In addition, as a\nGlobally Systemically Important Bank\n(\u201cGSIB\u201d), JPMorgan Chase is required to\nhold additional capital buffers,\nincluding a GSIB surcharge, a SCB, and\na countercyclical buffer, each of which\nis reassessed at least annually. The\namount of capital that JPMorgan Chase\nis required to hold in order to satisfy\nthese leverage-and risk-based\nrequirements could increase at any\ngiven time due to factors such as:\n\n\u2022 actions by banking regulators,\nincluding changes in laws, rules, and\nregulations\n\n\u2022 actions taken by the Federal Reserve\nor the U.S. government in response to\nthe economic effects of systemic\nevents, such as the actions taken in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic which\nled to an expansion of the Federal\nReserve balance sheet, growth in\ndeposits held by JPMorgan Chase and\nother U.S. financial institutions and,\nconsequently, an increase in leverage\nexposure and the GSIB surcharge\n\n\u2022 changes in the composition of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s balance sheet or\ndevelopments that could increase risk\nweighted assets such as increased\nmarket risk, customer delinquencies,\nclient credit rating downgrades or\nother factors, and\n      \n  21  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                        \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\n\u2022 increases in estimated stress losses\nas determined by the Federal Reserve\nunder the Comprehensive Capital\nAnalysis and Review, which could\nincrease JPMorgan Chase\u2019s SCB.\n\nAny failure by or inability of JPMorgan\nChase to maintain the required level\nand composition of capital, or\nunfavorable changes in applicable\ncapital requirements, could have an\nadverse impact on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nshareholders, such as:\n\n\u2022 reducing the amount of common stock\nthat JPMorgan Chase is permitted to\nrepurchase\n\n\u2022 requiring the issuance of, or\nprohibiting the redemption of, capital\ninstruments in a manner inconsistent\nwith JPMorgan Chase\u2019s capital\nmanagement strategy\n\n\u2022 constraining the amount of dividends\nthat may be paid on common stock, or\n\n\u2022 curtailing JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business\nactivities or operations.\n                                                                                  \n  Operational                                                                     \n                                                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses are\ndependent on the effectiveness of its\noperational systems and those of other\nmarket participants.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses rely on the\nability of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s financial,\naccounting, transaction execution, data\nprocessing and other operational\nsystems to process, record, monitor and\nreport a large number of transactions\non a continuous basis, and to do so\naccurately, quickly and securely. In\naddition to proper design,\ninstallation, maintenance and training,\nthe effective functioning of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s operational systems depends on:\n\n\u2022 the quality of the information\ncontained in those systems, as\ninaccurate, outdated or corrupted data\ncan significantly compromise the\nfunctionality or reliability of a\nparticular system and other systems to\nwhich it transmits or from which it\nreceives information, and\n\n\u2022 the ability of JPMorgan Chase to\nappropriately maintain and upgrade its\nsystems on a regular basis, and to\nensure that any changes introduced to\nits systems are managed carefully to\nensure security and operational\ncontinuity and adhere to all applicable\nlegal and regulatory requirements.\n\nJPMorgan Chase also depends on its\nability to access and use the\noperational systems of its vendors,\ncustodians and other market\nparticipants, including clearing and\npayment systems, CCPs, securities\nexchanges and data processing, security\nand technology companies (including\nthose that provide cloud computing\nservices).\n\nThe ineffectiveness, failure or other\ndisruption of operational systems upon\nwhich JPMorgan Chase depends, including\ndue to a systems malfunction,\ncyberbreach or other systems failure,\ncould result in unfavorable ripple\n\neffects in the financial markets and\nfor JPMorgan Chase and its clients and\ncustomers, including:\n\n\u2022 delays or other disruptions in\nproviding services, liquidity or\ninformation to clients and customers\n\n\u2022 the inability to settle transactions\nor obtain access to funds and other\nassets, including those for which\nphysical settlement and delivery is\nrequired\n\n\u2022 failure to timely settle or confirm\ntransactions\n\n\u2022 the possibility that funds transfers,\ncapital markets trades or other\ntransactions are executed erroneously,\nas a result of illegal conduct or with\nunintended consequences\n\n\u2022 financial losses, including due to\nloss-sharing requirements of CCPs,\npayment systems or other market\ninfrastructures, or as possible\nrestitution to clients and customers\n\n\u2022 higher operational costs associated\nwith replacing services provided by a\nsystem that is unavailable\n\n\u2022 client or customer dissatisfaction\nwith JPMorgan Chase\u2019s products and\nservices\n\n\u2022 regulatory fines, penalties, or other\nsanctions against JPMorgan Chase\n\n\u2022 loss of confidence in the ability of\nJPMorgan Chase, or financial\ninstitutions generally, to protect\nagainst and withstand operational\ndisruptions, or\n\n\u2022 harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\n\nAs the speed, frequency, volume,\ninterconnectivity and complexity of\ntransactions continue to increase, it\ncan become more challenging to\neffectively maintain and upgrade\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational systems\nand infrastructure, especially due to\nthe heightened risks that:\n\n\u2022 attempts by third parties to defraud\nJPMorgan Chase or its clients and\ncustomers may increase, evolve or\nbecome more complex, particularly\nduring periods of market disruption or\neconomic uncertainty\n\n\u2022 errors made by JPMorgan Chase or\nanother market participant, whether\ninadvertent or malicious, cause\nwidespread system disruption\n\n\u2022 isolated or seemingly insignificant\nerrors in operational systems compound,\nor migrate to other systems over time,\nto become larger issues\n\n\u2022 failures in synchronization or\nencryption software, or degraded\nperformance of microprocessors, could\ncause disruptions in operational\nsystems, or the inability of systems to\ncommunicate with each other, and\n\n\u2022 third parties may attempt to block\nthe use of key technology solutions by\nclaiming that the use infringes on\ntheir intellectual property rights.\n\nIf JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational\nsystems, or those of newly-acquired\nbusinesses or of external parties on\nwhich\n      \n  22  \n      \nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses depend, are\nunable to meet the requirements of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses and\noperations or bank regulatory\nstandards, or if they fail or have\nother significant shortcomings,\nJPMorgan Chase could be materially and\nadversely affected.\n\nA successful cyber attack affecting\nJPMorgan Chase could cause significant\nharm to JPMorgan Chase and its clients\nand customers.\n\nJPMorgan Chase experiences numerous\nattempted cyber attacks on its computer\nsystems, software, networks and other\ntechnology assets on a daily basis from\nvarious actors, including groups acting\non behalf of hostile countries, cyber-\ncriminals, \u201chacktivists\u201d (i.e.,\nindividuals or groups that use\ntechnology to promote a political\nagenda or social change) and others.\nThese cyber attacks can take many\nforms, including attempts to introduce\ncomputer viruses or malicious code,\nwhich are commonly referred to as\n\u201cmalware,\u201d into JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nsystems. These attacks are often\ndesigned to:\n\n\u2022 obtain unauthorized access to\nconfidential information belonging to\nJPMorgan Chase or its clients,\ncustomers, counterparties or employees\n\n\u2022 manipulate data\n\n\u2022 destroy data or systems with the aim\nof rendering services unavailable\n\n\u2022 disrupt, sabotage or degrade service\non JPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems\n\n\u2022 steal money, or\n\n\u2022 extort money through the use of so-\ncalled \u201cransomware.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan Chase has also experienced\nsignificant distributed denial-of-\nservice attacks which are intended to\ndisrupt online banking services.\n\nJPMorgan Chase has experienced security\nbreaches due to cyber attacks in the\npast, and it is inevitable that\nadditional breaches will occur in the\nfuture. Any such breach could result in\nserious and harmful consequences for\nJPMorgan Chase or its clients and\ncustomers.\n\nA principal reason that JPMorgan Chase\ncannot provide absolute security\nagainst cyber attacks is that it may\nnot always be possible to anticipate,\ndetect or recognize threats to JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s systems, or to implement\neffective preventive measures against\nall breaches. This is because:\n\n\u2022 the techniques used in cyber attacks\nchange frequently and are increasingly\nsophisticated, and therefore may not be\nrecognized until launched\n\n\u2022 cyber attacks can originate from a\nwide variety of sources, including\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s own employees, cyber-\ncriminals, hacktivists, groups linked\nto terrorist organizations or hostile\ncountries, or third parties whose\nobjective is to disrupt the operations\nof financial institutions more\ngenerally\n\n\u2022 JPMorgan Chase does not have control\nover the cybersecurity of the systems\nof the large number of clients,\ncustomers, counterparties and third-\nparty service providers with which it\ndoes business, and\n\n\u2022 it is possible that a third party,\nafter establishing a foothold on an\ninternal network without being\ndetected, might obtain access to other\nnetworks and systems.\n\nThe risk of a security breach due to a\ncyber attack could increase in the\nfuture due to factors such as:\n\n\u2022 JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ongoing expansion of\nits mobile banking and other internet-\nbased product offerings and its\ninternal use of internet-based products\nand applications, including those that\nuse cloud computing services\n\n\u2022 the acquisition of new businesses,\nand\n\n\u2022 the increased use of remote access\nand third party video conferencing\nsolutions to facilitate work-from-home\narrangements for employees.\n\nIn addition, a third party could\nmisappropriate confidential information\nobtained by intercepting signals or\ncommunications from mobile devices used\nby JPMorgan Chase\u2019s employees.\n\nA successful penetration or\ncircumvention of the security of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems or the systems\nof a vendor, governmental body or\nanother market participant could cause\nserious negative consequences,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 significant disruption of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s operations and those of its\nclients, customers and counterparties,\nincluding losing access to operational\nsystems\n\n\u2022 misappropriation of confidential\ninformation of JPMorgan Chase or that\nof its clients, customers,\ncounterparties, employees or regulators\n\n\u2022 disruption of or damage to JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s systems and those of its\nclients, customers and counterparties\n\n\u2022 the inability, or extended delays in\nthe ability, to fully recover and\nrestore data that has been stolen,\nmanipulated or destroyed, or the\ninability to prevent systems from\nprocessing fraudulent transactions\n\n\u2022 violations by JPMorgan Chase of\napplicable privacy and other laws\n\n\u2022 financial loss to JPMorgan Chase or\nto its clients, customers,\ncounterparties or employees\n\n\u2022 loss of confidence in JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s cybersecurity and business\nresiliency measures\n\n\u2022 dissatisfaction among JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s clients, customers or\ncounterparties\n\n\u2022 significant exposure to litigation\nand regulatory fines, penalties or\nother sanctions, and\n\n\u2022 harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\n      \n  23  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                        \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\nThe extent of a particular cyber attack\nand the steps that JPMorgan Chase may\nneed to take to investigate the attack\nmay not be immediately clear, and it\nmay take a significant amount of time\nbefore such an investigation can be\ncompleted. While such an investigation\nis ongoing, JPMorgan Chase may not\nnecessarily know the full extent of the\nharm caused by the cyber attack, and\nthat damage may continue to spread.\nThese factors may inhibit JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s ability to provide rapid, full\nand reliable information about the\ncyber attack to its clients, customers,\ncounterparties and regulators, as well\nas the public. Furthermore, it may not\nbe clear how best to contain and\nremediate the harm caused by the cyber\nattack, and certain errors or actions\ncould be repeated or compounded before\nthey are discovered and remediated. Any\nor all of these factors could further\nincrease the costs and consequences of\na cyber attack.\n\nJPMorgan Chase can be negatively\naffected if it fails to identify and\naddress operational risks associated\nwith the introduction of or changes to\nproducts, services and delivery\nplatforms.\n\nWhen JPMorgan Chase launches a new\nproduct or service, introduces a new\nplatform for the delivery or\ndistribution of products or services\n(including mobile connectivity,\nelectronic trading and cloud\ncomputing), acquires or invests in a\nbusiness or makes changes to an\nexisting product, service or delivery\nplatform, it may not fully appreciate\nor identify new operational risks that\nmay arise from those changes, or may\nfail to implement adequate controls to\nmitigate the risks associated with\nthose changes. Any significant failure\nin this regard could diminish JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s ability to operate one or more\nof its businesses or result in:\n\n\u2022 potential liability to clients,\ncounterparties and customers\n\n\u2022 increased operating expenses\n\n\u2022 higher litigation costs, including\nregulatory fines, penalties and other\nsanctions\n\n\u2022 damage to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation\n\n\u2022 impairment of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nliquidity\n\n\u2022 regulatory intervention, or\n\n\u2022 weaker competitive standing.\n\nAny of the foregoing consequences could\nmaterially and adversely affect\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses and results\nof operations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational costs and\ncustomer satisfaction could be\nadversely affected by the failure of an\nexternal operational system.\n\nExternal operational systems with which\nJPMorgan is connected, whether directly\nor indirectly, can be sources of\noperational risk to JPMorgan Chase.\nJPMorgan Chase may be exposed not only\nto a systems failure or cyber attack\nthat may be experienced by a vendor or\nmarket\n\ninfrastructure with which JPMorgan\nChase is directly connected, but also\nto a systems breakdown or cyber attack\ninvolving another party to which such a\nvendor or infrastructure is connected.\nSimilarly, retailers, data aggregators\nand other external parties with which\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s customers do business\ncan increase JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\noperational risk. This is particularly\nthe case where activities of customers\nor those parties are beyond JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s security and control systems,\nincluding through the use of the\ninternet, cloud computing services, and\npersonal smart phones and other mobile\ndevices or services.\n\nIf an external party obtains access to\ncustomer account data on JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s systems, and that party\nexperiences a cyberbreach of its own\nsystems or misappropriates that data,\nthis could result in a variety of\nnegative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase\nand its clients and customers,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 heightened risk that external parties\nwill be able to execute fraudulent\ntransactions using JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nsystems\n\n\u2022 losses from fraudulent transactions,\nas well as potential liability for\nlosses that exceed thresholds\nestablished in consumer protection\nlaws, rules and regulations\n\n\u2022 increased operational costs to\nremediate the consequences of the\nexternal party\u2019s security breach, and\n\n\u2022 reputational harm arising from the\nperception that JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nsystems may not be secure.\n\nAs JPMorgan Chase\u2019s interconnectivity\nwith clients, customers and other\nexternal parties continues to expand,\nJPMorgan Chase increasingly faces the\nrisk of operational failure or cyber\nattacks with respect to the systems of\nthose parties. Security breaches\naffecting JPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients or\ncustomers, or systems breakdowns or\nfailures, security breaches or human\nerror or misconduct affecting other\nexternal parties, may require JPMorgan\nChase to take steps to protect the\nintegrity of its own operational\nsystems or to safeguard confidential\ninformation, including restricting the\naccess of customers to their accounts.\nThese actions can increase JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s operational costs and\npotentially diminish customer\nsatisfaction and confidence in JPMorgan\nChase.\n\nFurthermore, the widespread and\nexpanding interconnectivity among\nfinancial institutions, clearing banks,\nCCPs, payment processors, financial\ntechnology companies, securities\nexchanges, clearing houses and other\nfinancial market infrastructures\nincreases the risk that the disruption\nof an operational system involving one\ninstitution or entity, including due to\na cyber attack, may cause industry-wide\noperational disruptions that could\nmaterially affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nability to conduct business.\n      \n  24  \n      \nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations rely on its\nability, and the ability of key\nexternal parties, to maintain\nappropriately-staffed workforces, and\non the competence, trustworthiness,\nhealth and safety of employees.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to operate its\nbusinesses efficiently and profitably,\nto offer products and services that\nmeet the expectations of its clients\nand customers, and to maintain an\neffective risk management framework is\nhighly dependent on its ability to\nstaff its operations appropriately and\non the competence, integrity, health\nand safety of its employees. JPMorgan\nChase is similarly dependent on the\nworkforces of other parties on which\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations rely,\nincluding vendors, custodians and\nfinancial markets infrastructures.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses could be\nmaterially and adversely affected by:\n\n\u2022 the ineffective implementation of\nbusiness decisions\n\n\u2022 any failure to institute controls\nthat appropriately address risks\nassociated with business activities, or\nto appropriately train employees with\nrespect to those risks and controls\n\n\u2022 staffing shortages, particularly in\ntight labor markets\n\n\u2022 a significant operational breakdown\nor failure, theft, fraud or other\nunlawful conduct, or\n\n\u2022 other negative outcomes caused by\nhuman error or misconduct by an\nemployee of JPMorgan Chase or of\nanother party on which JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\noperations depend.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations could also\nbe impaired if the measures taken by it\nor by governmental authorities to help\nensure the health and safety of its\nemployees are ineffective, or if any\nexternal party on which JPMorgan Chase\nrelies fails to take appropriate and\neffective actions to protect the health\nand safety of its employees.\n\nJPMorgan Chase faces substantial legal\nand operational risks in safeguarding\npersonal information.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses are subject\nto complex and evolving laws, rules and\nregulations, both within and outside\nthe U.S., governing the privacy and\nprotection of personal information of\nindividuals. The protected parties can\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 JPMorgan Chase\u2019s current, prospective\nand former clients and customers\n\n\u2022 clients and customers of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s clients and customers\n\n\u2022 current, prospective and former\nemployees, and\n\n\u2022 employees of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nvendors, counterparties and other\nexternal parties.\n\nEnsuring that JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\ncollection, use, sharing and storage of\npersonal information comply with all\napplicable laws, rules and regulations\nin all relevant jurisdictions,\nincluding where the laws of different\njurisdictions are in conflict, can:\n\n\u2022 increase JPMorgan Chase\u2019s compliance\nand operating costs\n\n\u2022 hinder the development of new\nproducts or services, curtail the\noffering of existing products or\nservices, or affect how products and\nservices are offered to clients and\ncustomers\n\n\u2022 demand significant oversight by\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s management, and\n\n\u2022 require JPMorgan Chase to structure\nits businesses, operations and systems\nin less efficient ways.\n\nNot all of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients,\ncustomers, vendors, counterparties and\nother external parties may have\nappropriate controls in place to\nprotect the confidentiality of the\ninformation exchanged between them and\nJPMorgan Chase, particularly where\ninformation is transmitted by\nelectronic means. JPMorgan Chase could\nbe exposed to litigation or regulatory\nfines, penalties or other sanctions if\npersonal information of clients,\ncustomers, employees or others were to\nbe mishandled or misused, such as\nsituations where such information is:\n\n\u2022 erroneously provided to parties who\nare not permitted to have the\ninformation, or\n\n\u2022 intercepted or otherwise compromised\nby unauthorized third parties.\n\nConcerns regarding the effectiveness of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s measures to safeguard\npersonal information, or even the\nperception that those measures are\ninadequate, could cause JPMorgan Chase\nto lose existing or potential clients\nand customers, and thereby reduce\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s revenues. Furthermore,\nany failure or perceived failure by\nJPMorgan Chase to comply with\napplicable privacy or data protection\nlaws, rules and regulations may subject\nit to inquiries, examinations and\ninvestigations that could result in\nrequirements to modify or cease certain\noperations or practices, significant\nliabilities or regulatory fines,\npenalties or other sanctions. Any of\nthese could damage JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nreputation and otherwise adversely\naffect its businesses.\n\nIn recent years, well-publicized\nincidents involving the inappropriate\ncollection, use, sharing or storage of\npersonal information have led to\nexpanded governmental scrutiny of\npractices relating to the safeguarding\nof personal information by companies in\nthe U.S. and other countries. That\nscrutiny has in some cases resulted in,\nand could in the future lead to, the\nadoption of stricter laws, rules and\nregulations relating to the collection,\nuse, sharing and storage of personal\ninformation. These types of laws, rules\nand regulations could prohibit or\nsignificantly restrict financial\nservices firms such as JPMorgan Chase\nfrom sharing information among\naffiliates or with third parties such\nas vendors, and thereby increase\ncompliance costs, or could restrict\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s use of personal data\nwhen developing or offering products or\nservices to customers. These\nrestrictions could also inhibit\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n      \n  25  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                        \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\ndevelopment or marketing of certain\nproducts or services, or increase the\ncosts of offering them to customers.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations, results\nand reputation could be harmed by\noccurrences of extraordinary events\nbeyond its control.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business and\noperational systems could be seriously\ndisrupted, and its reputation could be\nharmed, by events or contributing\nfactors that are wholly or partially\nbeyond its control, including material\ninstances of:\n\n\u2022 cyber attacks\n\n\u2022 security breaches of its physical\npremises, including threats to health\nand safety\n\n\u2022 power, telecommunications or internet\noutages, or shutdowns of mass transit\n\n\u2022 failure of, or loss of access to,\ntechnology or operational systems,\nincluding any resulting loss of\ncritical data\n\n\u2022 damage to or loss of property or\nassets of JPMorgan Chase or third\nparties, and any consequent injuries,\nincluding in connection with any\nconstruction projects undertaken by\nJPMorgan Chase\n\n\u2022 effects of climate change\n\n\u2022 natural disasters or severe weather\nconditions\n\n\u2022 accidents such as explosions or\nstructural failures\n\n\u2022 health emergencies, the spread of\ninfectious diseases, epidemics or\npandemics, or\n\n\u2022 events arising from local or larger-\nscale civil unrest, any outbreak or\nescalation of hostilities or terrorist\nacts.\n\nJPMorgan Chase maintains a Firmwide\nresiliency program that is intended to\nenable it to recover critical business\nfunctions and supporting assets,\nincluding staff, technology and\nfacilities, in the event of a business\ndisruption, including due to the\noccurrence of an extraordinary event\nbeyond its control. There can be no\nassurance that JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nresiliency plans will fully mitigate\nall potential business continuity risks\nto JPMorgan Chase, its clients, and\ncustomers and third parties with which\nit does business, or that its\nresiliency plans will be adequate to\naddress the effects of simultaneous\noccurrences of multiple business\ndisruption events. In addition,\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to respond\neffectively to a business disruption\nevent could be hampered to the extent\nthat the members of its workforce,\nphysical assets or systems and other\nsupport infrastructure needed to\naddress the event are geographically\ndispersed, or conversely, if such an\nevent were to occur in an area in which\nthey are concentrated. Further, should\nextraordinary events or the factors\nthat cause or contribute to those\nevents become more chronic, the\ndisruptive effects of those events on\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business and\noperations, and on its clients,\ncustomers,\n\ncounterparties and employees, could\nbecome more significant and long-\nlasting.\n\nAny significant failure or disruption\nof JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations or\noperational systems, or the occurrence\nof one or more extraordinary events\nthat are beyond its control, could:\n\n\u2022 hinder JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to\nprovide services to its clients and\ncustomers or to transact with its\ncounterparties\n\n\u2022 require it to expend significant\nresources to correct the failure or\ndisruption or to address the event\n\n\u2022 cause it to incur losses or\nliabilities, including from loss of\nrevenue, damage to or loss of property,\nor injuries\n\n\u2022 disrupt market infrastructure systems\non which JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses\nrely\n\n\u2022 expose it to litigation or regulatory\nfines, penalties or other sanctions,\nand\n\n\u2022 harm its reputation.\n\nEnhanced regulatory and other standards\nfor the oversight of vendors and other\nservice providers can result in higher\ncosts and other potential exposures.\n\nJPMorgan Chase must comply with\nenhanced regulatory and other standards\nassociated with doing business with\nvendors and other service providers,\nincluding standards relating to the\noutsourcing of functions as well as the\nperformance of significant banking and\nother functions by subsidiaries.\nJPMorgan Chase incurs significant costs\nand expenses in connection with its\ninitiatives to address the risks\nassociated with oversight of its\ninternal and external service\nproviders. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s failure to\nappropriately assess and manage these\nrelationships, especially those\ninvolving significant banking\nfunctions, shared services or other\ncritical activities, could materially\nadversely affect JPMorgan Chase.\nSpecifically, any such failure could\nresult in:\n\n\u2022 potential harm to clients and\ncustomers, and any liability associated\nwith that harm\n\n\u2022 regulatory fines, penalties or other\nsanctions\n\n\u2022 lower revenues, and the opportunity\ncost from lost revenues\n\n\u2022 increased operational costs, or\n\n\u2022 harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s risk management\nframework may not be effective in\nidentifying and mitigating every risk\nto JPMorgan Chase.\n\nAny inadequacy or lapse in JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s risk management framework,\ngovernance structure, practices, models\nor reporting systems could expose it to\nunexpected losses, and its financial\ncondition or results of operations\ncould be materially and adversely\naffected. Any such inadequacy or lapse\ncould:\n      \n  26  \n      \n\u2022 hinder the timely escalation of\nmaterial risk issues to JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s senior management and Board of\nDirectors\n\n\u2022 lead to business decisions that have\nnegative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase\n\n\u2022 require significant resources and\ntime to remediate\n\n\u2022 lead to non-compliance with laws,\nrules and regulations\n\n\u2022 attract heightened regulatory\nscrutiny\n\n\u2022 expose JPMorgan Chase to regulatory\ninvestigations or legal proceedings\n\n\u2022 subject it to litigation or\nregulatory fines, penalties or other\nsanctions\n\n\u2022 lead to potential harm to customers\nand clients, and any liability\nassociated with that harm\n\n\u2022 harm its reputation, or\n\n\u2022 otherwise diminish confidence in\nJPMorgan Chase.\n\nJPMorgan Chase relies on data to assess\nits various risk exposures. Any\ndeficiencies in the quality or\neffectiveness of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s data\ngathering, analysis and validation\nprocesses could result in ineffective\nrisk management practices. These\ndeficiencies could also result in\ninaccurate risk reporting.\n\nMany of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s risk\nmanagement strategies and techniques\nconsider historical market behavior and\nto some degree are based on\nmanagement\u2019s subjective judgment or\nassumptions. For example, many models\nused by JPMorgan Chase are based on\nassumptions regarding historical\ncorrelations among prices of various\nasset classes or other market\nindicators. In times of market stress,\nincluding difficult or less liquid\nmarket environments, or in the event of\nother unforeseen circumstances,\npreviously uncorrelated indicators may\nbecome correlated. Conversely,\npreviously-correlated indicators may\nbecome uncorrelated at those times.\nSudden market movements and\nunanticipated market or economic\nmovements could, in some circumstances,\nlimit the effectiveness of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s risk management strategies,\ncausing it to incur losses.\n\nJPMorgan Chase could recognize\nunexpected losses, its capital levels\ncould be reduced and it could face\ngreater regulatory scrutiny if its\nmodels, estimations or judgments,\nincluding those used in its financial\nstatements, prove to be inadequate or\nincorrect.\n\nJPMorgan Chase has developed and uses a\nvariety of models and other analytical\nand judgment-based estimations to\nmeasure, monitor and implement controls\nover its market, credit, capital,\nliquidity, operational and other risks.\nJPMorgan Chase also uses internal\nmodels and estimations as a basis for\nits stress testing and in connection\nwith the preparation of its financial\nstatements under U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S.\nGAAP\u201d).\n\nThese models and estimations are based\non a variety of assumptions and\nhistorical trends, and are periodically\nreviewed and modified as necessary. The\nmodels and estimations that JPMorgan\nChase uses may not be effective in all\ncases to identify, observe and mitigate\nrisk due to a variety of factors, such\nas:\n\n\u2022 reliance on historical trends that\nmay not persist in the future,\nincluding assumptions underlying the\nmodels and estimations such as\ncorrelations among certain market\nindicators or asset prices\n\n\u2022 inherent limitations associated with\nforecasting uncertain economic and\nfinancial outcomes\n\n\u2022 historical trend information may be\nincomplete, or may not be indicative of\nseverely negative market conditions\nsuch as extreme volatility, dislocation\nor lack of liquidity\n\n\u2022 sudden illiquidity in markets or\ndeclines in prices of certain loans and\nsecurities may make it more difficult\nto value certain financial instruments\n\n\u2022 technology that is introduced to run\nmodels or estimations may not perform\nas expected, or may not be well\nunderstood by the personnel using the\ntechnology\n\n\u2022 models and estimations may contain\nerroneous data, valuations, formulas or\nalgorithms, and\n\n\u2022 review processes may fail to detect\nflaws in models and estimations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase may experience\nunexpected losses if models, estimates\nor judgments used or applied in\nconnection with its risk management\nactivities or the preparation of its\nfinancial statements prove to have been\ninadequate or incorrect. For example,\nwhere quoted market prices are not\navailable for certain financial\ninstruments that require a\ndetermination of their fair value,\nJPMorgan Chase may make fair value\ndeterminations based on internally\ndeveloped models or other means which\nultimately rely to some degree on\nmanagement estimates and judgment.\n\nSimilarly, JPMorgan Chase establishes\nan allowance for expected credit losses\nrelated to its credit exposures which\nrequires difficult, subjective and\ncomplex judgments including forecasts\nof how economic conditions might impair\nthe ability of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nborrowers and counterparties to repay\ntheir loans or other obligations. These\ntypes of estimates and judgments may\nnot prove to be accurate due to a\nvariety of factors, as noted above. In\naddition, certain models used by\nJPMorgan Chase as a basis for the\ndetermination of the allowance for\nexpected credit losses experienced\nheightened performance risk in the\neconomic environment during the early\nstages of the COVID-19 pandemic. These\nmodels are based on historical\nexperience of internally-developed\nmacroeconomic scenarios, and when the\ncurrent and forecasted environment is\nsignificantly different from the\nscenarios\n      \n  27  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                        \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\nunderlying those models, JPMorgan Chase\nmay need to apply a greater degree of\njudgment and analytics to inform any\nadjustments that it has made or may\nmake to model outputs.\n\nSome of the models and other analytical\nand judgment-based estimations used by\nJPMorgan Chase in managing risks are\nsubject to review by, and require the\napproval of, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nregulators. These reviews are required\nbefore JPMorgan Chase may use those\nmodels and estimations for calculating\nmarket risk RWA, credit risk RWA and\noperational risk RWA under Basel III.\nIf JPMorgan Chase\u2019s models or\nestimations are not approved by its\nregulators, it may be subject to higher\ncapital charges, which could adversely\naffect its financial results or limit\nthe ability to expand its businesses.\n\nLapses in controls over disclosure or\nfinancial reporting could materially\naffect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s profitability\nor reputation.\n\nThere can be no assurance that JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s disclosure controls and\nprocedures will be effective in every\ncircumstance, or that a material\nweakness or significant deficiency in\ninternal control over financial\nreporting will not occur. Any such\nlapses or deficiencies could result in\ninaccurate financial reporting which,\nin turn, could:\n\n\u2022 materially and adversely affect\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business and results\nof operations or financial condition\n\n\u2022 restrict its ability to access the\ncapital markets\n\n\u2022 require it to expend significant\nresources to correct the lapses or\ndeficiencies\n\n\u2022 expose it to litigation or regulatory\nfines, penalties or other sanctions\n\n\u2022 harm its reputation, or\n\n\u2022 otherwise diminish investor\nconfidence in JPMorgan Chase.\n                                                                                  \n  Strategic                                                                       \n                                                                                  \nIf JPMorgan Chase\u2019s management fails to\ndevelop and execute effective business\nstrategies, and to anticipate changes\naffecting those strategies, JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s competitive standing and\nresults could suffer.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business strategies\nsignificantly affect its competitive\nstanding and operations. These\nstrategies relate to:\n\n\u2022 the products and services that\nJPMorgan Chase offers\n\n\u2022 the geographies in which it operates\n\n\u2022 the types of clients and customers\nthat it serves\n\n\u2022 the businesses that it acquires or in\nwhich it invests\n\n\u2022 the counterparties with which it does\nbusiness, and\n\n\u2022 the methods and distribution channels\nby which it offers products and\nservices.\n\nIf management makes choices about these\nstrategies and goals that prove to be\nincorrect, do not accurately assess the\ncompetitive landscape and industry\ntrends, or fail to address changing\nregulatory and market environments or\nthe expectations of clients, customers,\ninvestors, employees and other\nstakeholders, then the franchise values\nand growth prospects of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s businesses may suffer and its\nearnings could decline.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s growth prospects also\ndepend on management\u2019s ability to\ndevelop and execute effective business\nplans to address these strategic\npriorities, both in the near term and\nover longer time horizons. Management\u2019s\neffectiveness in this regard will\naffect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to\ndevelop and enhance its resources,\ncontrol expenses and return capital to\nshareholders. Each of these objectives\ncould be adversely affected by any\nfailure on the part of management to:\n\n\u2022 devise effective business plans and\nstrategies\n\n\u2022 offer products and services that meet\nchanging expectations of clients and\ncustomers\n\n\u2022 allocate capital in a manner that\npromotes long-term stability to enable\nJPMorgan Chase to build and invest in\nmarket-leading businesses, even in a\nhighly stressed environment\n\n\u2022 allocate capital appropriately due to\nimprecise modeling or subjective\njudgments made in connection with those\nallocations\n\n\u2022 appropriately address concerns of\nclients, customers, investors,\nemployees and other stakeholders,\nincluding with respect to social and\nsustainability matters\n\n\u2022 react quickly to changes in market\nconditions or market structures, or\n\n\u2022 develop and enhance the operational,\ntechnology, risk, financial and\nmanagerial resources necessary to grow\nand manage JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses.\n\nFurthermore, JPMorgan Chase may incur\ncosts in connection with disposing of\nexcess properties, premises and\nfacilities, and those costs could be\nmaterial to its results of operations\nin a given period.\n\nJPMorgan Chase faces significant and\nincreasing competition in the rapidly\nevolving financial services industry.\n\nJPMorgan Chase operates in a highly\ncompetitive environment in which it\nmust evolve and adapt to the\nsignificant changes as a result of\nchanges in financial regulation,\ntechnological advances, increased\npublic scrutiny and changes in economic\nconditions. JPMorgan Chase expects that\ncompetition in the U.S. and global\nfinancial services industry will\ncontinue to be intense. Competitors\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 other banks and financial\ninstitutions\n\n\u2022 trading, advisory and investment\nmanagement firms\n      \n  28  \n      \n\u2022 finance companies\n\n\u2022 technology companies, and\n\n\u2022 other nonbank firms that are engaged\nin providing similar products and\nservices.\n\nJPMorgan Chase cannot provide assurance\nthat the significant competition in the\nfinancial services industry will not\nmaterially and adversely affect its\nfuture results of operations.\n\nNew competitors in the financial\nservices industry continue to emerge.\nFor example, technological advances and\nthe growth of e-commerce have made it\npossible for non-depository\ninstitutions to offer products and\nservices that traditionally were\nbanking products. These advances have\nalso allowed financial institutions and\nother companies to provide electronic\nand internet-based financial solutions,\nincluding electronic securities and\ncryptocurrency trading, payments\nprocessing and online automated\nalgorithmic-based investment advice.\nFurthermore, both financial\ninstitutions and their non-banking\ncompetitors face the risk that payments\nprocessing and other products and\nservices, including deposits and other\ntraditional banking products, could be\nsignificantly disrupted by the use of\nnew technologies, such as\ncryptocurrencies and other applications\nthat use secure distributed ledgers,\nthat require no intermediation. New\ntechnologies have required and could\nrequire JPMorgan Chase to spend more to\nmodify or adapt its products to attract\nand retain clients and customers or to\nmatch products and services offered by\nits competitors, including technology\ncompanies. In addition, new\ntechnologies may be used by customers,\nor breached or infiltrated by third\nparties, in unexpected ways, which can\nincrease JPMorgan Chase\u2019s costs for\ncomplying with laws, rules and\nregulations that apply to the offering\nof products and services through those\ntechnologies and reduce the income that\nJPMorgan Chase earns from providing\nproducts and services through those\ntechnologies.\n\nOngoing or increased competition may\nput pressure on the pricing for\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s products and services\nor may cause JPMorgan Chase to lose\nmarket share, particularly with respect\nto traditional banking products. This\ncompetition may be on the basis of\nquality and variety of products and\nservices offered, transaction\nexecution, innovation, reputation and\nprice. The failure of any of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s businesses to meet the\nexpectations of clients and customers,\nwhether due to general market\nconditions, under-performance, a\ndecision not to offer a particular\nproduct or service, changes in client\nand customer expectations or other\nfactors, could affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nability to attract or retain clients\nand customers. Any such impact could,\nin turn, reduce JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nrevenues. Increased competition also\nmay require JPMorgan Chase to make\nadditional capital investments in its\nbusinesses, or to extend more of its\ncapital on behalf of its clients in\norder to remain competitive.\n\nThe effects of climate change could\nadversely impact JPMorgan Chase and its\nclients.\n\nJPMorgan Chase operates in many\nregions, countries and communities\naround the world where its businesses,\nand the activities of its clients and\ncustomers, could be impacted by climate\nchange. Climate change could manifest\nas a financial risk to JPMorgan Chase\neither through changes in the physical\nclimate or from the process of\ntransitioning to a low-carbon economy,\nincluding changes in climate policy or\nin the regulation of financial\ninstitutions with respect to risks\nposed by climate change.\n\nClimate-related physical risks include\nacute weather events, such as\nhurricanes and floods, and chronic\nshifts in the climate, such as altered\ndistribution and intensity of rainfall,\nprolonged droughts or flooding,\nincreased frequency of wildfires,\nrising sea levels, or a rising heat\nindex. Climate-related physical risks\ncould have adverse financial and other\nimpacts on JPMorgan Chase, both\ndirectly on its business and operations\nand as a result of impacts to its\nclients and customers, including:\n\n\u2022 declines in asset values, including\ndue to the destruction or degradation\nof property\n\n\u2022 reduced availability of insurance\n\n\u2022 significant interruptions to business\noperations, including supply chain\ndisruption, and\n\n\u2022 systemic changes to geographies,\nregional economies and sectors, and any\nresulting population migration or\nunemployment.\n\nTransition risks arise from the process\nof adjusting to a low-carbon economy.\nIn addition to possible changes in\nclimate policy and financial\nregulation, potential transition risks\nmay include economic and other changes\nengendered by the development of low-\ncarbon technological advances (e.g.,\nelectric vehicles and renewable energy)\nand/or changes in consumer preferences\ntowards low-carbon goods and services.\nTransition risks could be further\naccelerated by the occurrence of\nchanges in the physical climate.

Conduct risk\nmanagement is also an integral\ncomponent of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s promotion\nand compensation processes.\n\nNotwithstanding these expectations,\npolicies and practices, certain\nemployees have engaged in improper or\nillegal conduct in the past. These\ninstances of misconduct have resulted\nin litigation, and resolutions of\ngovernmental investigations or\nenforcement actions involving consent\norders, deferred prosecution\nagreements, non-prosecution agreements\nand other civil or criminal sanctions.\nThere is no assurance that further\ninappropriate or unlawful actions by\nemployees will not occur, lead to a\nviolation of the terms of these\nresolutions (and associated\nconsequences), or that any such actions\nwill always be detected, deterred or\nprevented.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation could be\nharmed, and collateral consequences\ncould result, from a failure by one or\nmore employees to conduct themselves in\naccordance with JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nexpectations, policies and practices,\nincluding by acting in ways that harm\nclients, customers, other market\nparticipants or other employees. Some\nexamples of this include:\n\n\u2022 improperly selling and marketing\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s products or services\n\n\u2022 engaging in insider trading, market\nmanipulation or unauthorized trading\n\n\u2022 engaging in improper or fraudulent\nbehavior in connection with government\nrelief programs\n\n\u2022 facilitating a transaction where a\nmaterial objective is to achieve a\nparticular tax, accounting or financial\ndisclosure treatment that may be\nsubject to scrutiny by governmental or\nregulatory authorities, or where the\nproposed treatment is unclear or may\nnot reflect the economic substance of\nthe transaction\n\n\u2022 failing to fulfill fiduciary\nobligations or other duties owed to\nclients or customers\n\n\u2022 violating antitrust or anti-\ncompetition laws by colluding with\nother market participants\n\n\u2022 using electronic communications\nchannels that have not been approved by\nJPMorgan Chase\n\n\u2022 engaging in discriminatory behavior\nor harassment with respect to clients,\ncustomers or employees, or acting\ncontrary to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s goal of\nfostering a diverse and inclusive\nworkplace\n\n\u2022 managing or reporting risks in ways\nthat subordinate JPMorgan Chase\u2019s risk\nappetite to business performance goals\nor employee compensation objectives,\nand\n\n\u2022 misappropriating property,\nconfidential or proprietary\ninformation, or technology assets\nbelonging to JPMorgan Chase, its\nclients and customers or third parties.\n\nThe consequences of any failure by one\nor more employees to conduct themselves\nin accordance with JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nexpectations, policies or practices\ncould include litigation, or regulatory\nor other governmental investigations or\nenforcement actions. Any of these\nproceedings or actions could result in\njudgments, settlements, fines,\npenalties or other sanctions, or lead\nto:\n\n\u2022 financial losses\n\n\u2022 increased operational and compliance\ncosts\n\n\u2022 greater scrutiny by regulators and\nother parties\n\n\u2022 regulatory actions that require\nJPMorgan Chase to restructure, curtail\nor cease certain of its activities\n\n\u2022 the need for significant oversight by\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s management\n\n\u2022 loss of clients or customers, and\n\n\u2022 harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\n\nThe foregoing risks could be heightened\nwith respect to newly-acquired\nbusinesses if JPMorgan Chase fails to\nsuccessfully integrate employees of\nthose businesses or any of those\nemployees do not conduct themselves in\naccordance with JPMorgan Chase's\nexpectations, policies and practices.\n                                                                                  \n  Reputation                                                                      \n                                                                                  \nDamage to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation\ncould harm its businesses.\n\nMaintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is\ncritical to its ability to attract and\nretain clients, customers, investors\nand employees. Damage to JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s reputation can therefore cause\nsignificant harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbusiness and prospects, and can arise\nfrom numerous sources, including:\n\n\u2022 employee misconduct, including\ndiscriminatory behavior or harassment\nwith respect to clients, customers or\nemployees, or actions that are contrary\nto JPMorgan Chase\u2019s goal of fostering a\ndiverse and inclusive workplace\n      \n  30  \n      \n\u2022 security breaches, including as a\nresult of cyber attacks\n\n\u2022 failure to safeguard client, customer\nor employee information\n\n\u2022 failure to manage risks associated\nwith its business activities or those\nof its clients, including those that\nmay be unpopular among one or more\nconstituencies\n\n\u2022 failure to fully discharge publicly-\nannounced commitments to support social\nand sustainability initiatives\n\n\u2022 non-compliance with laws, rules, and\nregulations\n\n\u2022 operational failures\n\n\u2022 litigation or regulatory fines,\npenalties or other sanctions\n\n\u2022 actions taken in executing regulatory\nand governmental requirements during a\nglobal or regional health emergency\n\n\u2022 regulatory investigations or\nenforcement actions, or resolutions of\nthese matters, and\n\n\u2022 failure or perceived failure to\ncomply with laws, rules or regulations\nby JPMorgan Chase or its clients,\ncustomers, counterparties or other\nparties, including newly-acquired\nbusinesses, companies in which JPMorgan\nChase has made principal investments,\nparties to joint ventures with JPMorgan\nChase, and vendors with which JPMorgan\nChase does business.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation may be\nsignificantly damaged by adverse\npublicity or negative information\nregarding JPMorgan Chase, whether or\nnot true, that may be published or\nbroadcast by the media or posted on\nsocial media, non-mainstream news\nservices or other parts of the\ninternet. This latter risk can be\nmagnified by the speed and\npervasiveness with which information is\ndisseminated through those channels.\n\nSocial and environmental activists are\nincreasingly targeting financial\nservices firms such as JPMorgan Chase\nwith public criticism for their\nrelationships with clients that are\nengaged in certain sensitive\nindustries, including businesses whose\nproducts are or are perceived to be\nharmful to human health, or whose\nactivities negatively affect or are\nperceived to negatively affect the\nenvironment, workers\u2019 rights or\ncommunities. Activists have also\nengaged in public protests at JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s headquarters and other\nproperties. Activist criticism of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s relationships with\nclients in sensitive industries could\npotentially engender dissatisfaction\namong clients, customers, investors and\nemployees with how JPMorgan Chase\naddresses social and sustainability\nconcerns in its business activities.\nAlternatively, yielding to activism\ntargeted at certain sensitive\nindustries could damage JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s relationships with clients and\ncustomers, and with governmental or\nregulatory bodies in jurisdictions in\nwhich JPMorgan Chase does business,\nwhose views are not aligned with those\nof social and\n\nenvironmental activists. In either\ncase, the resulting harm to JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s reputation could:\n\n\u2022 cause certain clients and customers\nto cease doing business with JPMorgan\nChase\n\n\u2022 impair JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to\nattract new clients and customers, or\nto expand its relationships with\nexisting clients and customers\n\n\u2022 diminish JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to\nhire or retain employees\n\n\u2022 prompt JPMorgan Chase to cease doing\nbusiness with certain clients or\ncustomers.\n\n\u2022 cause certain investors to divest\nfrom investments in securities of\nJPMorgan Chase, or\n\n\u2022 attract scrutiny from governmental or\nregulatory bodies.\n\nActions by the financial services\nindustry generally or individuals in\nthe industry can also affect JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s reputation. For example, the\nreputation of the industry as a whole\ncan be damaged by concerns that:\n\n\u2022 consumers have been treated unfairly\nby a financial institution, or\n\n\u2022 a financial institution has acted\ninappropriately with respect to the\nmethods used to offer products to\ncustomers\n\nIf JPMorgan Chase is perceived to have\nengaged in these types of behaviors,\nthis could weaken its reputation among\nclients or customers.\n\nFailure to effectively manage potential\nconflicts of interest or to satisfy\nfiduciary obligations can result in\nlitigation and enforcement actions, as\nwell as damage JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nreputation.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to manage\npotential conflicts of interest is\nhighly complex due to the broad range\nof its business activities which\nencompass a variety of transactions,\nobligations and interests with and\namong JPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients and\ncustomers. JPMorgan Chase can become\nsubject to litigation and enforcement\nactions, and its reputation can be\ndamaged, by the failure or perceived\nfailure to:\n\n\u2022 adequately address or appropriately\ndisclose conflicts of interest,\nincluding potential conflicts of\ninterest that may arise in connection\nwith providing multiple products and\nservices in, or having one or more\ninvestments related to, the same\ntransaction\n\n\u2022 deliver appropriate standards of\nservice and quality\n\n\u2022 treat clients and customers with the\nappropriate standard of care\n\n\u2022 use client and customer data\nresponsibly and in a manner that meets\nlegal requirements and regulatory\nexpectations\n      \n  31  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                        \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\n\u2022 provide fiduciary products or\nservices in accordance with the\napplicable legal and regulatory\nstandards, or\n\n\u2022 handle or use confidential\ninformation of customers or clients\nappropriately or in compliance with\napplicable data protection and privacy\nlaws, rules and regulations.\n\nA failure or perceived failure to\nappropriately address conflicts of\ninterest or fiduciary obligations could\nresult in customer dissatisfaction,\nlitigation and regulatory fines,\npenalties or other sanctions, and\nheightened regulatory scrutiny and\nenforcement actions, all of which can\nlead to lost revenue and higher\noperating costs and cause serious harm\nto JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\n                                                                                  \n  Country                                                                         \n                                                                                  \nAn outbreak or escalation of\nhostilities between countries or within\na country or region could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the global\neconomy and on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbusinesses within the affected region\nor globally.\n\nAggressive actions by hostile\ngovernments or groups, including armed\nconflict or intensified cyber attacks,\ncould expand in unpredictable ways by\ndrawing in other countries or\nescalating into full-scale war with\npotentially catastrophic consequences,\nparticularly if one or more of the\ncombatants possess nuclear weapons.\nDepending on the scope of the conflict,\nthe hostilities could result in:\n\n\u2022 worldwide economic disruption\n\n\u2022 heightened volatility in financial\nmarkets\n\n\u2022 severe declines in asset values,\naccompanied by widespread sell-offs of\ninvestments\n\n\u2022 substantial depreciation of local\ncurrencies, potentially leading to\ndefaults by borrowers and\ncounterparties in the affected region\n\n\u2022 disruption of global trade, and\n\n\u2022 diminished consumer, business and\ninvestor confidence.\n\nAny of the above consequences could\nhave significant negative effects on\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations and\nearnings, both in the countries or\nregions directly affected by the\nhostilities or globally. Further, if\nthe U.S. were to become directly\ninvolved in such a conflict, this could\nlead to a curtailment of any operations\nthat JPMorgan Chase may have in the\naffected countries or region, as well\nas in any nation that is aligned\nagainst the U.S. in the hostilities.\nJPMorgan Chase could also experience\nmore numerous and aggressive cyber\nattacks launched by or under the\nsponsorship of one or more of the\nadversaries in such a conflict.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business and\noperations in certain countries can be\nadversely affected by local economic,\npolitical, regulatory and social\nfactors.\n\nSome of the countries in which JPMorgan\nChase conducts business have economies\nor markets that are less developed and\nmore volatile or may have political,\nlegal and\n\nregulatory regimes that are less\nestablished or predictable than other\ncountries in which JPMorgan Chase\noperates. In addition, in some\njurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase\nconducts business, the local economy\nand business activity are subject to\nsubstantial government influence or\ncontrol. Some of these countries have\nin the past experienced economic\ndisruptions, including:\n\n\u2022 extreme currency fluctuations\n\n\u2022 high inflation\n\n\u2022 low or negative growth, and\n\n\u2022 defaults or reduced ability to\nservice sovereign debt.\n\nThe governments in these countries have\nsometimes reacted to these developments\nby imposing restrictive policies that\nadversely affect the local and regional\nbusiness environment, such as:\n\n\u2022 price, capital or exchange controls,\nincluding imposition of punitive\ntransfer and convertibility\nrestrictions or forced currency\nexchange\n\n\u2022 expropriation or nationalization of\nassets or confiscation of property,\nincluding intellectual property, and\n\n\u2022 changes in laws, rules and\nregulations.\n\nThe impact of these actions could be\naccentuated in trading markets that are\nsmaller, less liquid and more volatile\nthan more-developed markets. These\ntypes of government actions can\nnegatively affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\noperations in the relevant country,\neither directly or by suppressing the\nbusiness activities of local clients or\nmulti-national clients that conduct\nbusiness in the jurisdiction.\n\nIn addition, emerging markets\ncountries, as well as certain more\ndeveloped countries, have been\nsusceptible to unfavorable social\ndevelopments arising from poor economic\nconditions or governmental actions,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 widespread demonstrations, civil\nunrest or general strikes\n\n\u2022 crime and corruption\n\n\u2022 security and personal safety issues\n\n\u2022 an outbreak or escalation of\nhostilities\n\n\u2022 overthrow of incumbent governments\n\n\u2022 terrorist attacks, and\n\n\u2022 other forms of internal discord.\n\nThese economic, political, regulatory\nand social developments have in the\npast resulted in, and in the future\ncould lead to, conditions that can\nadversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\noperations in those countries and\nimpair the revenues, growth and\nprofitability of those operations. In\naddition, any of these events or\ncircumstances in one country can affect\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations and\ninvestments in another country or\ncountries, including in the U.S.\n      \n  32  \n      \n                                                                                  \n  People                                                                          \n                                                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to attract and\nretain qualified and diverse employees\nis critical to its success.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s employees are its most\nimportant resource, and in many areas\nof the financial services industry,\ncompetition for qualified personnel is\nintense. JPMorgan Chase endeavors to\nattract talented and diverse new\nemployees and retain, develop and\nmotivate its existing employees.\nJPMorgan Chase's efforts to retain\ntalented and diverse employees can be\nparticularly challenging when members\nof its workforce are targeted for\nrecruitment by competitors. If JPMorgan\nChase were unable to continue to\nattract or retain qualified and diverse\nemployees, including successors to the\nChief Executive Officer, members of the\nOperating Committee and other senior\nleaders, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s performance,\nincluding its competitive position,\ncould be materially and adversely\naffected.\n\nUnfavorable changes in immigration or\ntravel policies could adversely affect\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses and\noperations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase relies on the skills,\nknowledge and expertise of employees\nlocated throughout the world. Changes\nin immigration or travel policies in\nthe U.S. and other countries that\nunduly restrict or otherwise make it\nmore difficult for employees or their\nfamily members to work in, or travel to\nor transfer between, jurisdictions in\nwhich JPMorgan Chase has operations or\nconducts its business could inhibit\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to attract and\nretain qualified employees, and thereby\ndilute the quality of its workforce, or\ncould prompt JPMorgan Chase to make\nstructural changes to its worldwide or\nregional operating models that cause\nits operations to be less efficient or\nmore costly.\n                                                                                  \n  Legal                                                                           \n                                                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase faces significant legal\nrisks from litigation and formal and\ninformal regulatory and government\ninvestigations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant\nor is otherwise involved in many legal\nproceedings, including class actions\nand other litigation or disputes with\nthird parties. Actions currently\npending against JPMorgan Chase may\nresult in judgments, settlements,\nfines, penalties or other sanctions\nadverse to JPMorgan Chase. Any of these\nmatters could materially and adversely\naffect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business,\nfinancial condition or results of\noperations, or cause serious\nreputational harm. As a participant in\nthe financial services industry, it is\nlikely that JPMorgan Chase will\ncontinue to experience a high level of\nlitigation and regulatory and\ngovernment investigations related to\nits businesses and operations.\n\nRegulators and other government\nagencies conduct examinations of\nJPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries\nboth on a routine basis and in targeted\nexams, and JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses\nand operations are subject to\n\nheightened regulatory oversight. This\nheightened regulatory scrutiny, or the\nresults of such an investigation or\nexamination, may lead to additional\nregulatory investigations or\nenforcement actions. There is no\nassurance that those actions will not\nresult in resolutions or other\nenforcement actions against JPMorgan\nChase. Furthermore, a single event\ninvolving a potential violation of law\nor regulation may give rise to numerous\nand overlapping investigations and\nproceedings, either by multiple\nfederal, state or local agencies and\nofficials in the U.S. or, in some\ninstances, regulators and other\ngovernmental officials in non-U.S.\njurisdictions.\n\nIf another financial institution\nviolates a law or regulation relating\nto a particular business activity or\npractice, this will often give rise to\nan investigation by regulators and\nother governmental agencies of the same\nor similar activity or practice by\nJPMorgan Chase.\n\nThese and other initiatives by U.S. and\nnon-U.S. governmental authorities may\nsubject JPMorgan Chase to judgments,\nsettlements, fines, penalties or other\nsanctions, and may require JPMorgan\nChase to restructure its operations and\nactivities or to cease offering certain\nproducts or services. All of these\npotential outcomes could harm JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s reputation or lead to higher\noperational costs, thereby reducing\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s profitability, or\nresult in collateral consequences. In\naddition, the extent of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s exposure to legal and\nregulatory matters can be unpredictable\nand could, in some cases, exceed the\namount of reserves that JPMorgan Chase\nhas established for those matters.\n      \n  33  \n      \n                                                                                  \n  Parts I and II                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                                                                \u2502\n\u2502  Item 1B.

The\nFirm continues to be authorized to repurchase common shares under its existing\ncommon share repurchase program previously approved by the Board of Directors.\n\nShares repurchased pursuant to the common share repurchase program during 2021\nwere as follows.\n                                                                                  \n                                                      Aggregate           Dollar  \n                                                       purchase            value  \n                      Total                            price of               of  \n                  number of           Average            common        remaining  \n                  shares of        price paid             stock       authorized  \n  Year ended         common         per share       repurchases       repurchase  \n  December            stock         of common               (in              (in  \n  31, 2021      repurchased          stock(a)       millions)(\u2026       millions)\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  First          34,652,594    $       144.25    $        4,999    $      25,001  \n  quarter                                                                         \n  Second         39,544,940            156.83             6,201           18,800  \n  quarter                                                                         \n  Third          33,400,817            156.87             5,240           13,560  \n  quarter                                                                         \n  October         6,840,122            167.89             1,148           12,412  \n  November        2,528,754            166.08               420           11,992  \n  December        2,769,076            158.94               440           11,552  \n  Fourth         12,137,952            165.47             2,008           11,552  \n  quarter                                                                         \n  Year-to-d\u2026    119,736,303    $       154.08    $       18,448    $      11,552  \n                                                                                  \n(a) Excludes commissions cost.\n\n(b) Represents the amount remaining under the $30 billion repurchase program.\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                                                                \u2502\n\u2502  Item 6.

The cessation of the\npublication of the principal tenors of\nU.S. dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight,\none-month, three-month, six-month and\n12-month LIBOR) is scheduled for June\n30, 2023.\n\nIn joint statements issued by the\nFederal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC,\nthe banking regulators encouraged U.S.\nbanks to cease entering into new\ncontracts that use U.S. dollar LIBOR as\na reference rate by December 31, 2021.\nThe Firm has ceased executing contracts\nthat reference U.S. dollar LIBOR, with\ncertain permissible limited exceptions,\nand now offers various floating rate\nproducts, and provides and arranges\nvarious types of floating rate debt\nfinancings, across its businesses that\nreference replacement rates, including\nthe Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n(\u201cSOFR\u201d). The Firm continues to engage\nwith clients in relation to the\ntransition from the principal tenors of\nU.S. dollar LIBOR and to support\nclients as they move to replacement\nrates.\n\nOn November 16, 2021 the Financial\nConduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) confirmed\nthat it will allow, for a period of at\nleast one year, the use of \u201csynthetic\u201d\nU.K. sterling and Japanese yen LIBOR\nrates in all legacy LIBOR contracts,\nother than cleared derivatives, that\nhad not been transitioned to\nreplacement rates by January 1, 2022.\nThe use of these synthetic LIBORs, will\nallow market participants additional\ntime to complete their transition to\nreplacement rates or otherwise to\nreduce their exposure to contracts that\ndo not have robust fallback mechanisms\nand that are difficult to amend.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, the\nprincipal central counterparties\n(\u201cCCPs\u201d) converted cleared derivatives\ncontracts linked to non-U.S. dollar\nLIBOR to replacement rates before the\ncessation of the publication of those\nLIBORs on December 31, 2021.\n\nThe Firm has made significant progress\ntowards reducing its exposure to IBOR-\nreferencing contracts, including in\nderivatives, bilateral and syndicated\nloans, securities, and debt and\npreferred stock issuances, and is on-\ntrack to meet its internal milestones\nfor contract remediation as well as the\nindustry milestones and recommendations\npublished by National Working Groups,\nincluding the Alternative Reference\nRates Committee in the U.S.\n\nIn connection with the transition from\nLIBOR, as of December 31, 2021 the Firm\nhad remediated substantially all of the\nnotional amount of its bilateral\nderivatives contracts linked to U.S.\ndollar LIBOR and non-U.S. dollar\n                                             \n  50    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                             \nLIBOR, and substantially all of its\nnon-U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked loans. The\nFirm continues its client outreach with\nrespect to U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked\nloans.\n\nThe Firm is also on schedule to\nimplement further necessary changes to\nrisk management systems in order to\ntransition from LIBOR, including\nmodifications to its operational\nsystems and models. In 2021, the Firm\nchanged the rate basis of its transfer\npricing methodology for U.S. dollar-\ndenominated contracts to SOFR and\nimplemented internal controls to\nrestrict the use of LIBOR in new\ntransactions.\n\nLegislation intended to reduce the\nlikelihood of disputes arising from the\ncessation of LIBOR has been adopted or\nproposed in certain jurisdictions.

Refer to Note 25 for further information. 2021 compared with 2020\nInvestment banking fees increased across products in CIB, reflecting: \u2022 higher\nadvisory fees driven by increased M&A activity and wallet share gains \u2022 higher\nequity underwriting fees due to a strong IPO market and wallet share gains , and \u2022\nhigher debt underwriting fees predominantly driven by an active leveraged loan\nmarket primarily related to acquisition financing. Refer to CIB segment results on\npages 67-72 and Note 6 for additional information. Principal transactions revenue\ndecreased, reflecting: \u2022 lower revenue in CIB Fixed Income Markets, primarily in\nRates, Currencies & Emerging Markets, Credit and Commodities, compared to a strong\nprior year, and an increase in Securitized Products, and \u2022 lower net valuation\ngains on several legacy equity investments in Corporate, partially offset by \u2022\nhigher revenue in CIB Equity Markets driven by strong performance across\nderivatives, prime brokerage, and Cash Equities\n\n\u2022 favorable results in CIB\u2019s Credit Adjustments & Other, with a net gain of $250\nmillion predominantly driven by valuation adjustments related to derivatives,\ncompared with a $29 million net loss in the prior year, and \u2022 the absence of\nlosses recorded in the prior year in Treasury and CIO related to cash deployment\ntransactions, which were more than offset by the related net interest income\nearned on these transactions, also in the prior year. Refer to CIB and Corporate\nsegment results on pages 67-72 and pages 79-80, respectively, and Note 6 for\nadditional information. Lending- and deposit-related fees increased as a result\nof: \u2022 higher cash management fees in CIB and CB, and higher lending-related fees,\nparticularly loan commitment fees in CIB, predominantly offset by \u2022 lower\noverdraft fee revenue in CCB. Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment results on pages\n63-66, pages 67-72 and pages 73-75, respectively, and Note 6 for additional\ninformation. Asset management, administration and commissions revenue increased\ndriven by: \u2022 higher asset management fees in AWM and CCB as a result of higher\naverage market levels and net inflows, and \u2022 higher custody fees in CIB Securities\nServices, primarily associated with higher assets under custody. Refer to CCB, CIB\nand AWM segment results on pages 63-66, pages 67-72 and pages 76-78, respectively,\nand Note 6 for additional information. Investment securities gains/(losses)\nreflected net losses related to repositioning the investment securities portfolio,\ncompared with net gains in the prior year from sales of U.S. GSE and government\nagency MBS. Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 79-80 and Note 10 for\nadditional information. Mortgage fees and related income decreased due to: \u2022 lower\nnet mortgage servicing revenue, reflecting a net loss in MSR risk management\nresults primarily driven by updates to model inputs related to prepayment\nexpectations, and \u2022 lower mortgage production revenue on lower production margins.\nRefer to CCB segment results on pages 63-66, Note 6 and 15 for further\ninformation. Card income increased due to: \u2022 higher net interchange income in CCB\ndriven by an increase in debit and credit card sales volume above pre-pandemic\nlevels, partially offset by the impact of a renegotiation of a co-brand partner\ncontract, as well as an increase to the rewards liability, and\n                                             \n  52    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                             \n\u2022 higher payments revenue related to commercial card and merchant processing in CB\nand CIB on higher volume, partially offset by \u2022 higher amortization related to new\naccount origination costs in CCB. Refer to CCB, CIB and CB seg ment results on\npages 63-66, pages 67-72 and pages 73-75, respectively, and Note 6 for further\ninformation. Other income decreased reflecting: \u2022 lower auto operating lease\nincome in CCB as a result of a decline in volume, and \u2022 increased amortization on\na higher level of alternative energy investments in the tax-oriented investment\nportfolio in CIB. The increased amortization was more than offset by lower income\ntax expense from the associated tax credits, predominantly offset by \u2022 net gains\non several investments, primarily in CIB and AWM, and \u2022 the absence of losses\nrecorded in the prior year related to the early termination of certain of the\nFirm's long-term debt in Treasury and CIO. Net interest income decreased driven by\nthe impact of lower market rates and changes in the balance sheet mix, partially\noffset by balance sheet growth. The Firm\u2019s average interest-earning assets were\n$3.2 trillion, up $436 billion, predominantly driven by higher deposits with banks\nand investment securities, and the yield was 1.81%, down 53 basis points (\u201cbps\u201d).\nThe net yield on these assets, on an FTE basis, was 1.64%, a decrease of 34 bps.\nThe net yield excluding CIB Markets was 1.91%, down 39 bps. Net yield excluding\nCIB Markets is a non-GAAP financial measure.

The\nnet benefit in consumer was driven by:\n\u2022 a $9.5 billion reduction in the\nallowance for credit losses, reflecting\nimprovements in the Firm's\nmacroeconomic outlook, including $7.6\nbillion in Card, and $1.2 billion in\nHome Lending, which also reflects\ncontinued improvements in Home Price\nIndex (\"HPI\") expectations, and \u2022 lower\nnet charge-offs predominantly in Card,\nas consumer cash balances remained\nelevated; \u2022 the prior year included a\n$7.4 billion net addition to the\nallowance for credit losses.

The Firm believes that cash flows\nfrom operations, available cash and other liquidity sources, and its capacity to\ngenerate cash through secured and unsecured sources, are sufficient to meet its\noperating liquidity needs. \u2022 In 2021, cash provided resulted from lower trading\nassets and higher accounts payable and other liabilities, partially offset by\nhigher securities borrowed and lower trading liabilities. \u2022 In 2020, cash used\nprimarily reflected higher trading assets, other assets, and securities borrowed,\npartially offset by higher trading liabilities and net income excluding noncash\nadjustments.\n\nInvesting activities The Firm\u2019s investing activities predominantly include\noriginating held-for-investment loans and investing in the investment securities\nportfolio, and other short-term instruments. \u2022 In 2021, cash used resulted from\nnet purchases of investment securities and higher net originations of loans,\npartially offset by lower securities purchased under resale agreements. \u2022 In 2020,\ncash used primarily reflected net purchases of investment securities, higher net\noriginations of loans, and higher securities purchased under resale agreements.\nFinancing activities The Firm\u2019s financing activities include acquiring customer\ndeposits and issuing long-term debt and preferred stock. \u2022 In 2021, cash provided\nreflected higher deposits and net proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings,\npartially offset by a decrease in securities loaned or sold under repurchase\nagreements. \u2022 In 2020, cash provided reflected higher deposits and an increase in\nsecurities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, partially offset by net\npayments of long-term borrowings. \u2022 For both periods, cash was used for\nrepurchases of common stock and cash dividends on common and preferred stock. * *\n* Refer to Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 55-56, Capital Risk\nManagement on pages 86-96, and Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 for a\nfurther discussion of the activities affecting the Firm\u2019s cash flows.\n                                             \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    57  \n                                             \n                                                                                  \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                    \n  EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM\u2019S USE  \n  OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES                    \n                                                    \n                                                                                  \n  Non-GAAP financial measures                                                     \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm prepares its Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in accordance with\nU.S. GAAP; these financial statements\nappear on pages 160-164. That\npresentation, which is referred to as\n\u201creported\u201d basis, provides the reader\nwith an understanding of the Firm\u2019s\nresults that can be tracked\nconsistently from year-to-year and\nenables a comparison of the Firm\u2019s\nperformance with the U.S. GAAP\nfinancial statements of other\ncompanies.\n\nIn addition to analyzing the Firm\u2019s\nresults on a reported basis, management\nreviews Firmwide results, including the\noverhead ratio, on a \u201cmanaged\u201d basis;\nthese Firmwide managed basis results\nare non-GAAP financial measures. The\nFirm also reviews the results of the\nLOBs on a managed basis. The Firm\u2019s\ndefinition of managed basis starts, in\neach case, with the reported U.S. GAAP\nresults and includes certain\nreclassifications to present total net\nrevenue for the Firm (and each of the\nreportable business segments) on an FTE\nbasis. Accordingly, revenue from\ninvestments that receive tax credits\nand tax-exempt securities is presented\nin the managed results on a basis\ncomparable to taxable investments and\nsecurities. These financial measures\nallow\n\nmanagement to assess the comparability\nof revenue from year-to-year arising\nfrom both taxable and tax-exempt\nsources. The corresponding income tax\nimpact related to tax-exempt items is\nrecorded within income tax expense.\nThese adjustments have no impact on net\nincome as reported by the Firm as a\nwhole or by the LOBs.\n\nManagement also uses certain non-GAAP\nfinancial measures at the Firm and\nbusiness-segment level because these\nother non-GAAP financial measures\nprovide information to investors about\nthe underlying operational performance\nand trends of the Firm or of the\nparticular business segment, as the\ncase may be, and, therefore, facilitate\na comparison of the Firm or the\nbusiness segment with the performance\nof its relevant competitors. Refer to\nBusiness Segment Results on pages 61-80\nfor additional information on these\nnon-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial\nmeasures used by the Firm may not be\ncomparable to similarly named non-GAAP\nfinancial measures used by other\ncompanies.\n\nThe following summary table provides a\nreconciliation from the Firm\u2019s reported\nU.S. GAAP results to managed basis.\n                                                                                  \n                                       \u2026                                          \n                                       \u2026                  \u2026                  \u2026    \n                                       \u2026                  \u2026                  \u2026    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                       \u2026      $           \u2026      $           \u2026    \n                                       \u2026                  \u2026                  \u2026    \n                                       \u2026                  \u2026                  \u2026    \n                                       \u2026                  \u2026                  \u2026    \n                                                          \u2026           \u2026      \u2026    \n                                       \u2026                  \u2026                  \u2026    \n                                                          \u2026           \u2026      \u2026    \n                                       \u2026                  \u2026                  \u2026    \n                                       \u2026                  \u2026                  \u2026    \n                                              $           \u2026           \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                   %      \u2026           \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                                  \n(a) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current\npresentation.

The\nmanagement reporting process that\nderives business segment results\nincludes the allocation of certain\nincome and expense items. The Firm also\nassesses the level of capital required\nfor each LOB on at least an annual\nbasis. The Firm periodically assesses\nthe assumptions, methodologies and\nreporting classifications used for\nsegment reporting, and further\nrefinements may be implemented in\nfuture periods. The Firm\u2019s LOBs also\nprovide various business metrics which\nare utilized by the Firm and its\ninvestors and analysts in assessing\nperformance.\n\nRevenue sharing\n\nWhen business segments join efforts to\nsell products and services to the\nFirm\u2019s clients, the participating\nbusiness segments may agree to share\nrevenue from those transactions.\nRevenue is generally recognized in the\nsegment responsible for the related\nproduct or service, with allocations to\nthe other segment(s) involved in the\ntransaction. The segment results\nreflect these revenue-sharing\nagreements.\n\nExpense Allocation\n\nWhere business segments use services\nprovided by corporate support units, or\nanother business segment, the costs of\nthose services are allocated to the\nrespective business segments. The\nexpense is generally allocated based on\nthe actual cost and use of services\nprovided. In contrast, certain costs\nand investments related to corporate\nsupport units, technology and\noperations not currently utilized by\nany LOB, are not allocated to the\nbusiness segments and are retained in\nCorporate. Expense retained in\nCorporate generally includes costs that\nwould not be incurred if the segments\nwere stand-alone businesses; and other\nitems not aligned with a particular\nbusiness segment.\n\nFunds transfer pricing\n\nFunds transfer pricing (\u201cFTP\u201d) is the\nprocess by which the Firm allocates\ninterest income and expense to each\nbusiness segment and transfers the\nprimary interest rate risk and\nliquidity risk to Treasury and CIO\nwithin Corporate.\n\nThe funds transfer pricing process\nconsiders the interest rate and\nliquidity risk characteristics of\nassets and liabilities and off-balance\nsheet products. Periodically the\nmethodology and assumptions utilized in\nthe FTP process are adjusted to reflect\neconomic conditions and other factors,\nwhich may impact the allocation of net\ninterest income to the business\nsegments.\n                                             \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    61  \n                                             \n                                                                                  \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                            \n                                                                                  \nAs a result of the current interest\nrate environment and the excess\nliquidity stemming from government and\ncentral bank actions since the onset of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, the cost of\nfunds for assets and the credits earned\nfor liabilities have generally\ndeclined, impacting the business\nsegments net interest income. As such,\nduring the period ended December 31,\n2021, this has resulted in lower cost\nof funds for loans and margin\ncompression on deposits across the\nLOBs.\n\nDebt expense and preferred stock\ndividend allocation\n\nAs part of the funds transfer pricing\nprocess, almost all of the cost of the\ncredit spread component of outstanding\nunsecured long-term debt and preferred\nstock dividends is allocated to the\nreportable business segments, while the\nbalance of the cost is retained in\nCorporate. The methodology to allocate\nthe cost of unsecured long-term debt\nand preferred stock dividends to the\nbusiness segments is aligned with the\nrelevant regulatory capital\nrequirements, as applicable. The\nallocated cost of unsecured long-term\ndebt is included in a business\nsegment\u2019s net interest income, and net\nincome is reduced\n\nby preferred stock dividends to arrive\nat a business segment\u2019s net income\napplicable to common equity.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on\npages 86-96 for additional information.\n\nCapital allocation\n\nThe amount of capital assigned to each\nsegment is referred to as equity.The\nFirm\u2019s allocation methodology\nincorporates Basel III Standardized\nRWA, Basel III Advanced RWA, the GSIB\nsurcharge, and a simulation of capital\nin a severe stress environment. As of\nJanuary 1, 2022, the Firm has changed\nits line of business capital\nallocations primarily as a result of\nchanges in RWA for each LOB and to\nreflect an increase in the Firm\u2019s GSIB\nsurcharge to 4.0% that will be\neffective January 1, 2023. The\nassumptions and methodologies used to\nallocate capital are periodically\nreassessed and as a result, the capital\nallocated to the LOBs may change from\ntime to time.\n\nRefer to Line of business equity on\npage 93 for additional information on\ncapital allocation .\n                                                                                  \n   Segment Results \u2013 Managed Basis                                                \n                                                                                  \nThe following tables summarize the Firm\u2019s results by segment for the periods\nindicated.\n                                                                                  \n         \u2026                          \u2026                                             \n         &                          &                         \u2026                   \n         \u2026                          \u2026                         \u2026                   \n         \u2026  \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026  \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2026              \u2026    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $     \u2026  $    \u2026  $    \u2026    $  \u2026     $    \u2026  $    \u2026      \u2026    $    \u2026         \n            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026          \u2026       \u2026      \u2026         \u2026         \n            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026          \u2026       \u2026      \u2026         \u2026         \n            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026          \u2026       \u2026      \u2026         \u2026         \n            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026          \u2026       \u2026      \u2026         \u2026         \n            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026  %       \u2026       \u2026      \u2026         \u2026         \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n         \u2026                                                                        \n         &                                                                        \n         \u2026                                                                        \n         \u2026  \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026  \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026     $    \u2026  $    \u2026    $     \u2026  $    \u2026  $    \u2026    $       $      $      \n         \u2026          \u2026       \u2026          \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                          \n         \u2026          \u2026       \u2026          \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                          \n         \u2026          \u2026       \u2026          \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                          \n         \u2026          \u2026       \u2026          \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                          \n         \u2026  %       \u2026       \u2026          \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                          \n                                                                                  \nThe following sections provide a comparative discussion of the Firm\u2019s results by\nsegment as of or for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n                                             \n  62    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                             \n                                \n  CONSUMER & COMMUNITY BANKING  \n                                \n                                                      \n  Consumer & Community Banking offers services to     \n  consumers and businesses through bank branches,     \n  ATMs, digital (including mobile and online) and     \n  telephone banking.

Prior-period tax-equivalent adjustment amounts have been revised to\nconform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 25 for further information.\n\n2021 compared with 2020 Net income was $5.2 billion, up $2.7 billion,\npredominantly driven by a net benefit in the provision for credit losses, compared\nto an expense in the prior year. Net revenue was $10.0 billion, up 7%. Net\ninterest income was $6.0 billion, down 3%, driven by the net impact of margin\ncompression on higher deposits and a decrease in loans, largely offset by lower\nfunding costs. Noninterest revenue was $3.9 billion, up 28%, predominantly driven\nby higher investment banking and payments revenue. Noninterest expense was $4.0\nbillion, up 6%, predominantly driven by investments in the business, including\nhigher compensation expense, and higher volume- and revenue-related expense.

Management business was renamed\nGlobal Private Bank.\n\n2021 compared with 2020 Net income was $4.7 billion, an increase of 58%. Net\nrevenue was $17.0 billion, an increase of 19%. Net interest income was $3.9\nbillion, up 14%. Noninterest revenue was $13.1 billion, up 21%. Revenue from Asset\nManagement was $9.2 billion, up 21%, predominantly driven by: \u2022 higher asset\nmanagement fees, net of liquidity fee waivers, on higher average market levels and\nstrong cumulative net inflows into long-term and liquidity products, \u2022 higher\nperformance fees, and \u2022 higher net investment valuation gains. Revenue from Global\nPrivate Bank was $7.7 billion, up 17%, predominantly driven by: \u2022 higher loans\nincluding the impact of lower funding costs, and higher asset management fees,\npartially offset by \u2022 the net impact of margin compression on higher deposits. The\nprovision for credit losses was a net benefit of $227 million, driven by a\nreduction in the allowance for credit losses, compared with an expense of $263\nmillion in the prior year. Noninterest expense was $10.9 billion, up 10%, driven\nby higher volume- and revenue-related compensation expense and distribution fees,\nhigher structural expense, and higher investments in the business, partially\noffset by lower legal expense.\n                                             \n  76    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                             \n                                                                                  \n  Asset Management has two high-level measures of                                 \n  its overall fund performance.                                                   \n  Effective September 2021, AWM changed the source for the peer group quartile    \n  rankings of its funds from Lipper to Morningstar for U.S.-domiciled funds       \n  (except for \u201cMunicipals\u201d and \u201cInvestor\u201d funds, for which the source remains     \n  Lipper) and Taiwan domiciled funds. AWM evaluates fund performance utilizing    \n  this peer group ranking and believes that it provides investors with            \n  comparability across the industry. This change resulted in both positive and    \n  negative impacts on the quartile rankings for prior periods, as compared to     \n  how they would have been ranked by Lipper. In addition, AWM has changed its     \n  selection of the \u201cprimary share class\u201d for certain non-                         \n  U.S. funds, as set forth below, in order to establish a more consistent         \n  approach across these products. Prior periods in the following table have been  \n  revised to conform to the current presentation.                                 \n  \u2022Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds rated 4- or         \n  5-star:Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on their risk adjusted      \n  performance over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and        \n  represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating           \n  represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating        \n  represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating          \n  represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is     \n  the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of industrywide ranked funds.    \n  An overall Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted average of the         \n  performance associated with a fund\u2019s three-, five and ten- year (if             \n  applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds, separate      \n  star ratings are provided at the individual share                               \n  class level. The Nomura \u201cstar rating\u201d is based on three-year risk-adjusted      \n  performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not rated    \n  and hence excluded from these rankings. All ratings, the assigned peer          \n  categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from  \n  the applicable fund rating provider. Where applicable, the fund rating          \n  providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM    \n  is based on star ratings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds,     \n  and at a \u201cprimary share class\u201d level to represent the star rating of all other  \n  funds, except for Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the fund level.   \n  The performance data may have been different if all share classes had been      \n  included.

The percentage of                               \n  AUM is based on fund performance and associated                                 \n  peer rankings at the share class level for                                      \n  U.S.-domiciled funds, at a \u201cprimary share class\u201d                                \n  level to represent the quartile ranking for U.K.,                               \n  Luxembourg and Hong Kong SAR funds and at the fund                              \n  level for all other funds.

Net revenue was a loss of $3.5 billion,\ncompared with a loss of $1.2 billion in the prior year. Net interest income\ndecreased primarily driven by: \u2022 limited opportunities to deploy funds in response\nto significant deposit growth across the LOBs, and \u2022 the impact of faster\nprepayments on mortgage-backed securities in the first half of 2021, partially\noffset by \u2022 higher net interest income on growth in investment securities.\nNoninterest revenue decreased primarily due t o: \u2022 net investment securities\nlosses related to repositioning the investment securities portfolio, compared with\nnet gains in the prior year from sales of U.S. GSE and government agency MBS , \u2022\nlower net valuation gains on several legacy equity investments partially offset by\n\u2022 the absence of losses recorded in the prior year in Treasury and CIO related to\ncash deployment transactions, which were more than offset by the related net\ninterest income earned on these transactions, also in the prior year, and \u2022 the\nabsence of losses recorded in the prior year related to the early termination of\ncertain of the Firm's long-term debt in Treasury and CIO Noninterest expense of\n$1.8 billion was up $429 million primarily due to a higher contribution to the\nFirm\u2019s Foundation, investments related to the Firm\u2019s international consumer\nexpansion, technology initiatives, and higher legal expense, largely offset by the\nabsence of an impairment on a legacy investment recorded in the prior year. Refer\nto Note 10 and Note 13 for additional information on the investment securities\nportfolio and the allowance for credit losses. The current period income tax\nbenefit was driven by changes in the level and mix of income and expenses subject\nto U.S. federal and state and local taxes as well as other tax adjustments,\npartially offset by the resolutions of certain tax audits.\n                                             \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    79  \n                                             \n                                                                                  \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                            \n                                                                                  \nTreasury and CIO overview Treasury and CIO is predominantly responsible for\nmeasuring, monitoring, reporting and managing the Firm\u2019s liquidity, funding,\ncapital, structural interest rate and foreign exchange risks. The risks managed by\nTreasury and CIO arise from the activities undertaken by the Firm\u2019s four major\nreportable business segments to serve their respective client bases, which\ngenerate both on- and off-balance sheet assets and liabilities. Treasury and CIO\nseek to achieve the Firm\u2019s asset-liability management objectives generally by\ninvesting in high-quality securities that are managed for the longer-term as part\nof the Firm\u2019s investment securities portfolio. Treasury and CIO also use\nderivatives to meet the Firm \u2019 s asset-liability management objectives. Refer to\nNote 5 for further information on derivatives. In addition, Treasury and CIO\nmanage the Firm\u2019s cash position primarily through deposits at central banks and\ninvestments in short-term instruments.

The Firm\u2019s overall\nobjective is to manage its businesses,\nand the associated risks, in a manner\nthat balances serving the interests of\nits clients, customers and investors\nand protects the safety and soundness\nof the Firm.\n\nThe Firm believes that effective risk\nmanagement requires, among other\nthings:\n\n\u2022 Acceptance of responsibility,\nincluding identification and escalation\nof risks by all individuals within the\nFirm;\n\n\u2022 Ownership of risk identification,\nassessment, data and management within\neach of the LOBs and Corporate; and\n\n\u2022 Firmwide structures for risk\ngovernance.\n\nThe Firm follows a disciplined and\nbalanced compensation framework with\nstrong internal governance and\nindependent oversight by the Board of\nDirectors (the \u201cBoard\u201d). The impact of\nrisk and control issues is carefully\nconsidered in the Firm\u2019s performance\nevaluation and incentive compensation\nprocesses.\n                                                                                  \n  Risk governance and oversight framework                                         \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm\u2019s risk management governance\nand oversight framework involves\nunderstanding drivers of risks, types\nof risks, and impacts of risks.\n\nDrivers of Risks are factors that cause\na risk to exist. Drivers of risks\ninclude the economic environment,\nregulatory and government policy,\ncompetitor and market evolution,\nbusiness decisions, process and\njudgment error, deliberate wrongdoing,\ndysfunctional markets, and natural\ndisasters.\n\nTypes of Risks are categories by which\nrisks manifest themselves. Risks are\ngenerally categorized in the following\nfour risk types:\n\n\u2022 Strategic risk is the risk to\nearnings, capital, liquidity or\nreputation associated with poorly\ndesigned or failed business plans or\ninadequate response to changes in the\noperating environment.\n\n\u2022 Credit and investment risk is the\nrisk associated with the default or\nchange in credit profile of a client,\ncounterparty or customer; or loss of\nprincipal or a reduction in expected\nreturns on investments, including\n\nconsumer credit risk, wholesale credit\nrisk, and investment portfolio risk.\n\n\u2022 Market risk is the risk associated\nwith the effect of changes in market\nfactors, such as interest and foreign\nexchange rates, equity and commodity\nprices, credit spreads or implied\nvolatilities, on the value of assets\nand liabilities held for both the short\nand long term.\n\n\u2022 Operational risk is the risk\nassociated with an adverse outcome\nresulting from inadequate or failed\ninternal processes or systems; human\nfactors; or external events impacting\nthe Firm\u2019s processes or systems. It\nincludes compliance, conduct, legal,\nand estimations and model risk.\n\nImpacts of Risks are consequences of\nrisks, both quantitative and\nqualitative. There may be many\nconsequences of risks manifesting,\nincluding quantitative impacts such as\na reduction in earnings and capital,\nliquidity outflows, and fines or\npenalties, or qualitative impacts such\nas reputation damage, loss of clients\nand customers, and regulatory and\nenforcement actions.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s risk governance and\noversight framework is managed on a\nFirmwide basis. The Firm has an\nIndependent Risk Management (\u201cIRM\u201d)\nfunction, which consists of the Risk\nManagement and Compliance\norganizations. The Chief Executive\nOfficer (\u201cCEO\u201d) appoints, subject to\napproval by the Risk Committee of the\nBoard (\u201cBoard Risk Committee\u201d), the\nFirm\u2019s Chief Risk Officer (\u201cCRO\u201d) to\nlead the IRM organization and manage\nthe risk governance structure of the\nFirm. The framework is subject to\napproval by the Board Risk Committee in\nthe form of the Risk Governance and\nOversight Policy. The Firm\u2019s CRO\noversees and delegates authorities to\nLOB CROs, Firmwide Risk Executives\n(\u201cFREs\u201d), and the Firm\u2019s Chief\nCompliance Officer (\u201cCCO\u201d), who each\nestablish Risk Management and\nCompliance organizations, set the\nFirm\u2019s risk governance policies and\nstandards, and define and oversee the\nimplementation of the Firm\u2019s risk\ngovernance. The LOB CROs are\nresponsible for risks that arise in\ntheir LOBs, while FREs oversee risk\nareas that span across the individual\nLOBs, functions and regions.\n                                                                                  \n  Three lines of defense                                                          \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm relies upon each area of the\nFirm giving rise to risk to operate\nwithin the parameters identified by the\nIRM function, and within its own\nmanagement-identified risk and control\nstandards.\n\nEach LOB and Treasury & CIO, including\ntheir aligned Operations, Technology\nand Control Management, are the Firm\u2019s\n\u201cfirst line of defense\u201d and own the\nidentification of risks, as well as the\ndesign and execution of controls to\nmanage those risks. The first line of\ndefense is responsible for adherence to\napplicable laws, rules and regulations\nand for the implementation of the risk\nmanagement structure (which may include\npolicy, standards, limits, thresholds\nand controls) established by IRM.\n                                             \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    81  \n                                             \n                                                                                  \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                            \n                                                                                  \nThe IRM function is independent of the\nbusinesses and is the Firm\u2019s \u201csecond\nline of defense.\u201d The IRM function\nindependently assesses and challenges\nthe first line of defense risk\nmanagement practices. IRM is also\nresponsible for its own adherence to\napplicable laws, rules and regulations\nand for the implementation of policies\nand standards established by IRM with\nrespect to its own processes.\n\nInternal Audit is an independent\nfunction that provides objective\nassessment on the adequacy and\neffectiveness of Firmwide processes,\ncontrols, governance and risk\nmanagement as the \u201cthird line of\ndefense.\u201d The Internal Audit Function\nis headed by the General Auditor, who\nreports to the Audit Committee and\nadministratively to the CEO.\n\nIn addition, there are other functions\nthat contribute to the Firmwide control\nenvironment but are not considered part\nof a particular line of defense,\nincluding Finance, Human Resources and\nLegal, and are responsible for\nadherence to applicable laws, rules and\nregulations and policies and standards\nestablished by IRM with respect to\ntheir own processes.\n                                                                                  \n  Risk identification and ownership                                               \n                                                                                  \nEach LOB and Corporate owns the ongoing\nidentification of risks, as well as the\ndesign and execution of controls,\nincluding IRM-specified controls, to\nmanage those risks. To support this\nactivity, the Firm has a formal Risk\nIdentification framework designed to\nfacilitate each LOB and Corporate\u2019s\nresponsibility to identify material\nrisks inherent to the Firm, catalog\nthem in a central repository and review\nthe most material risks on a regular\nbasis. The IRM function reviews and\nchallenges the LOB and Corporate\u2019s\nidentified risks, maintains the central\nrepository and provides the\nconsolidated Firmwide results to the\nFirmwide Risk Committee (\u201cFRC\u201d) and\nBoard Risk Committee.\n                                                                                  \n  Risk appetite                                                                   \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm\u2019s overall appetite for risk is\ngoverned by \u201cRisk Appetite\u201d frameworks\nfor quantitative and qualitative risks.\nPeriodically the Firm\u2019s risk appetite\nis set and approved by senior\nmanagement (including the CEO and CRO)\nand approved by the Board Risk\nCommittee. Quantitative and qualitative\nrisks are assessed to monitor and\nmeasure the Firm\u2019s capacity to take\nrisk consistent with its stated risk\nappetite.

The Firm\u2019s Audit Committee is\nresponsible for reviewing and approving\nthe capital stress testing control\nframework.\n\nStress testing assesses the potential\nimpact of alternative economic and\nbusiness scenarios on the Firm\u2019s\nearnings and capital. Economic\nscenarios, and the parameters\nunderlying those scenarios, are defined\ncentrally and applied uniformly across\nthe businesses.

The U.S.\ncapital requirements generally follow\nthe Capital Accord of the Basel\nCommittee, as amended from time to\ntime.\n\nBasel III Overview\n\nThe capital rules under Basel III\nestablish minimum capital ratios and\noverall capital adequacy standards for\nlarge and internationally active U.S.\nBHCs and banks, including the Firm and\nits IDI subsidiaries, including\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum\namount of regulatory capital that must\nbe held by BHCs and banks is determined\nby calculating risk-weighted assets\n(\u201cRWA\u201d), which are on-balance sheet\nassets and off-balance sheet exposures,\n\nweighted according to risk. Two\ncomprehensive approaches are prescribed\nfor calculating RWA: a standardized\napproach (\u201cBasel III Standardized\u201d),\nand an advanced approach (\u201cBasel III\nAdvanced\u201d). For each of the risk-based\ncapital ratios, the capital adequacy of\nthe Firm is evaluated against the lower\nof the Standardized or Advanced\napproaches compared to their respective\nregulatory capital ratio requirements.\nThe Firm\u2019s Basel III Standardized risk-\nbased ratios are currently more binding\nthan the Basel III Advanced risk-based\nratios.\n\nBasel III establishes capital\nrequirements for calculating credit\nrisk RWA and market risk RWA, and in\nthe case of Basel III Advanced,\noperational risk RWA. Key differences\nin the calculation of credit risk RWA\nbetween the Standardized and Advanced\napproaches are that for Basel III\nAdvanced, credit risk RWA is based on\nrisk-sensitive approaches which largely\nrely on the use of internal credit\nmodels and parameters, whereas for\nBasel III Standardized, credit risk RWA\nis generally based on supervisory risk-\nweightings which vary primarily by\ncounterparty type and asset class.\nMarket risk RWA is calculated on a\ngenerally consistent basis between\nBasel III Standardized and Basel III\nAdvanced. In addition to the RWA\ncalculated under these approaches, the\nFirm may supplement such amounts to\nincorporate management judgment and\nfeedback from its regulators.\n\nBasel III also includes a requirement\nfor Advanced Approaches banking\norganizations, including the Firm, to\ncalculate the SLR. The Firm\u2019s SLR is\ncurrently more binding than the Basel\nIII Standardized-risk-based ratios.\nRefer to SLR on page 93 for additional\ninformation.\n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\n\nThe Firm has been impacted by market\nevents as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic, but has remained well-\ncapitalized.\n\nKey Regulatory Developments\n\nCECL regulatory capital transition. The\nFirm elected to apply the CECL capital\ntransition provisions as permitted by\nthe federal banking agencies which\ndelayed the effects of CECL on\nregulatory capital for two years until\nJanuary 1, 2022, followed by a three-\nyear transition period (\u201cCECL capital\ntransition provisions\u201d).\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the capital\nmetrics of the Firm reflected the\nbenefit of the CECL capital transition\nprovisions of $2.9 billion, which will\nbe phased in at 25% per year beginning\nJanuary 1, 2022.\n\nThe CECL capital transition provisions\nhave also been incorporated into Tier 2\ncapital, adjusted average assets, and\ntotal leverage exposure and are also\nsubject to the three-year transition\nperiod beginning January 1, 2022.\n\nRefer to Note 1 for further information\non the CECL accounting guidance.\n\nPaycheck Protection Program. The\nfederal banking agencies issued a final\nrule in September 2020 to neutralize\nthe regulatory capital effects of\nparticipating in the PPP on risk-based\ncapital ratios by applying a zero\npercent risk weight to loans originated\nunder the program. The Firm does not\n                                             \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    87  \n                                             \n                                                                                  \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                            \n                                                                                  \nexpect to realize material credit\nlosses on PPP loans because the loans\nare guaranteed by the SBA. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, the Firm had $6.7\nbillion of loans remaining under the\nprogram.\n\nTotal leverage exposure for purposes of\ncalculating the SLR includes PPP loans\nas the Firm did not participate in the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s Paycheck Protection\nProgram Lending Facility, which would\nhave allowed the Firm to exclude them\nunder the final rule.\n\nTLAC Holdings rule. On October 20,\n2020, the federal banking agencies\nissued a final rule prescribing the\nregulatory capital treatment for\nholdings of Total Loss-Absorbing\nCapacity (\u201cTLAC\u201d) debt instruments by\ncertain large banking organizations,\nsuch as the Firm and JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. This rule expanded the scope\nof the prior capital deductions rule\nrelating to the holdings of capital\ninstruments of financial institutions\nto also include TLAC debt instruments\nissued by systemically important\nbanking organizations. The final rule\nbecame effective April 1, 2021 and did\nnot have a material impact on the\nFirm\u2019s risk-based capital metrics.\n\nStandardized Approach for Counterparty\nCredit Risk . In November 2019, the\nU.S. banking regulators adopted a rule\nimplementing \u201cStandardized Approach for\nCounterparty Credit Risk\u201d (\u201cSA-CCR\u201d),\nwhich replaced the current exposure\nmethod used to measure derivatives\ncounterparty exposure under\nStandardized approach RWA, as well as\nleverage exposure used to calculate the\nSLR in the regulatory capital\nframework. The rule applies to Basel\nIII Advanced Approaches banking\norganizations, such as the Firm and\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., with a\nmandatory compliance date of January 1,\n2022.\n\nBased on the derivatives exposure as of\nDecember 31, 2021, the adoption of SA-\nCCR is estimated to increase the Firm\u2019s\nStandardized RWA by approximately $40\nbillion and result in a modest decrease\nin its total leverage exposure. These\nestimates may differ from the actual\nimpact based on the composition of the\nFirm\u2019s derivatives exposure as of March\n31, 2022.\n                                             \n  88    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                             \nRisk-based Capital Regulatory\nRequirements\n\nThe following chart presents the Firm\u2019s\nBasel III CET1 capital ratio\nrequirements under the Basel III rules\ncurrently in effect.\n\nAll banking institutions are currently\nrequired to have a minimum CET1 capital\nratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets.\n\nCertain banking organizations,\nincluding the Firm, are required to\nhold additional levels of capital to\nserve as a \u201ccapital conservation\nbuffer\u201d. The capital conservation\nbuffer incorporates a global\nsystemically important bank (\u201cGSIB\u201d)\nsurcharge, a discretionary\ncountercyclical capital buffer and a\nfixed capital conservation buffer of\n2.5% for Advanced regulatory capital\nrequirements and a variable SCB\nrequirement, floored at 2.5%, for\nStandardized regulatory capital\nrequirements.\n\nUnder the Federal Reserve\u2019s GSIB rule,\nthe Firm is required to assess its GSIB\nsurcharge on an annual basis under two\nseparately prescribed methods based on\ndata for the previous fiscal year-end,\nand is subject to the higher of the\ntwo. \u201cMethod 1\u201d, reflects the GSIB\nsurcharge as prescribed by the Basel\nCommittee\u2019s assessment methodology, and\nis calculated by the Financial\nStability Board (\u201cFSB\u201d) across five\ncriteria: size, cross-jurisdictional\nactivity, interconnectedness,\ncomplexity and substitutability.\n\u201cMethod 2\u201d, calculated by the Firm,\nmodifies the Method 1 requirements to\ninclude a measure of short-term\nwholesale funding in place of\nsubstitutability, and introduces a GSIB\nscore \u201cmultiplication factor\u201d.\n                                             \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    89  \n                                             \n                                                                                  \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                            \n                                                                                  \nThe following table presents the Firm\u2019s\neffective GSIB surcharge for the years\nended December 31, 2021 and 2020. For\n2022, the Firm\u2019s effective GSIB\nsurcharge under both Method 1 and\nMethod 2 remains unchanged at 2.0% and\n3.5%, respectively.\n                                                   \n                   2022         2021         2020  \n  Method 1    2.0     %    2.0     %    2.5     %  \n  Method 2    3.5     %    3.5     %    3.5     %  \n                                                   \nOn November 23, 2021, the FSB released its annual GSIB list based upon data as of\nDecember 31, 2020, which announced the Firm\u2019s Method 1 GSIB surcharge of 2.5% (up\nfrom 2.0%) effective January 1, 2023, unless the Firm\u2019s Method 1 GSIB surcharge,\nas determined by the FSB, is lower based upon data as of December 31, 2021. The\nFirm\u2019s Method 2 surcharge calculated using data as of December 31, 2020 is 4.0%,\nwhich will be effective January 1, 2023. The Firm\u2019s estimated Method 2 surcharge\ncalculated using data as of December 31, 2021 is 4.5%. Accordingly, based on the\nGSIB rule currently in effect, the Firm\u2019s effective GSIB surcharge is expected to\nincrease to 4.5% on January 1, 2024 unless the Firm\u2019s Method 2 GSIB surcharge\ncalculation based upon data as of December 31, 2022 is lower. The U.S. federal\nregulatory capital standards include a framework for setting a discretionary\ncountercyclical capital buffer taking into account the macro financial environment\nin which large, internationally active banks function. As of December 31, 2021,\nthe U.S. countercyclical capital buffer remained at 0%. The Federal Reserve will\ncontinue to review the buffer at least annually. The buffer can be increased if\nthe Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC determine that systemic risks are meaningfully\nabove normal and can be calibrated up to an additional 2.5% of RWA subject to a\n12-month implementation period. Failure to maintain regulatory capital equal to or\nin excess of the risk-based regulatory capital minimum plus the capital\nconservation buffer (inclusive of the GSIB surcharge) and any countercyclical\nbuffer will result in limitations to the amount of capital that the Firm may\ndistribute, such as through dividends and common share repurchases, as well as\ncertain executive discretionary bonus payments. The Firm believes that it will\noperate with a Basel III Standardized CET1 capital ratio between 12.0% and 13.0%\nin the near term, based on the Basel III capital rules currently in effect, and\nwith consideration for an increase in the GSIB surcharge in 2023. Total Loss-\nAbsorbing Capacity The Federal Reserve\u2019s TLAC rule requires the U.S. GSIB top-tier\nholding companies, including the Firm, to maintain minimum levels of external TLAC\nand eligible long-term debt (\u201celigible LTD\u201d). Refer to TLAC on page 95 for\nadditional information.\n\nLeverage-based Capital Regulatory Requirements Supplementary leverage ratio\nBanking organizations subject to the Basel III Advanced approach are currently\nrequired to have a minimum SLR of 3.0%. Certain banking organizations, including\nthe Firm, are also required to hold an additional 2.0% leverage buffer. The SLR is\ndefined as Tier 1 capital under Basel III divided by the Firm\u2019s total leverage\nexposure. Total leverage exposure is calculated by taking the Firm\u2019s total average\non-balance sheet assets, less amounts permitted to be deducted for Tier 1 capital,\nand adding certain off-balance sheet exposures, such as undrawn commitments and\nderivatives potential future exposure. Failure to maintain an SLR equal to or\ngreater than the regulatory requirement will result in limitations on the amount\nof capital that the Firm may distribute such as through dividends and common share\nrepurchases, as well as on certain executive discretionary bonus payments. Other\nregulatory capital In addition to meeting the capital ratio requirements of Basel\nIII, the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries must also maintain minimum capital and\nleverage ratios in order to be \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d under the regulations issued by\nthe Federal Reserve and the Prompt Corrective Action (\u201cPCA\u201d) requirements of the\nFDIC Improvement Act (\u201cFDICIA\u201d), respectively. Refer to Note 27 for additional\ninformation. Additional information regarding the Firm\u2019s capital ratios, as well\nas the U.S. federal regulatory capital standards to which the Firm is subject, is\npresented in Note 27.

Contingency\nfunding plan The Firm\u2019s Contingency\nFunding Plan (\u201cCFP\u201d) sets out the\nstrategies for addressing and managing\nliquidity resource needs during a\nliquidity stress event and incorporates\nliquidity risk limits, indicators and\nrisk appetite tolerances. The CFP also\nidentifies the alternative contingent\nfunding and liquidity resources\navailable to the Firm and its legal\nentities in a period of stress.\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio and HQLA The\nLCR rule requires that the Firm and\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintain an\namount of eligible HQLA that is\nsufficient to meet its estimated total\nnet cash outflows over a prospective 30\ncalendar-day period of significant\nstress. Eligible HQLA, for purposes of\ncalculating the LCR, is the amount of\nunencumbered HQLA that satisfy certain\noperational considerations as defined\nin the LCR rule. HQLA primarily consist\nof cash and certain high-quality liquid\nsecurities as defined in the LCR rule.\nUnder the LCR rule, the amount of\neligible HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. that is in excess of its\nstand-alone 100% minimum LCR\nrequirement, and that is not\ntransferable to non-bank affiliates,\nmust be excluded from the Firm\u2019s\nreported eligible HQLA. Estimated net\ncash outflows are based on standardized\nstress outflow and inflow rates\nprescribed in the LCR rule, which are\napplied to the balances of the Firm\u2019s\nassets, sources of funds, and\nobligations. The LCR for both the Firm\nand JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is\nrequired to be a minimum of 100%.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Firm\nand JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s average\nLCR for the three months ended December\n31, 2021, September 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020 based on the Firm\u2019s\ninterpretation of the LCR framework.\n                                                                                  \n                        Three months                                              \n  Average                      ended                                              \n  amount                December 31,        September 30,        December 31,     \n  (in millions)                 2021                 2021                2020     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  JPMorgan                                                                        \n  Chase & Co.:                                                                    \n  HQLA                                                                            \n  Eligible         $         703,384     $        690,013     $       455,612     \n  cash(a)                                                                         \n  Eligible                    34,738               34,049             241,447     \n  securities(b\u2026                                                                   \n  Total HQLA(d)    $         738,122     $        724,062     $       697,059     \n  Net cash         $         664,801     $        645,557     $       634,037     \n  outflows                                                                        \n  LCR                            111  %               112  %              110  %  \n  Net excess                                                                      \n  eligible         $          73,321     $         78,505     $        63,022     \n  HQLA(d)                                                                         \n  JPMorgan                                                                        \n  Chase Bank,                                                                     \n  N.A.:                                                                           \n  LCR                            178  %               174  %              160  %  \n  Net excess       $         555,300     $        516,374     $       401,903     \n  eligible HQLA                                                                   \n                                                                                  \n(a) Represents cash on deposit at\ncentral banks, primarily the Federal\nReserve Banks.

A\nsignificant portion of the Firm\u2019s\ndeposits are consumer deposits and\nwholesale operating deposits, which are\nboth considered to be stable sources of\nliquidity. Wholesale operating deposits\nare considered to be stable sources of\nliquidity because they are generated\nfrom customers that maintain operating\nservice relationships with the Firm.\nFurthermore, certain deposits are\ncovered by insurance protection that\nprovides additional funding stability\nand results in a benefit to the LCR.\nDeposit insurance protection may be\navailable to depositors in the\ncountries in which the deposits are\nplaced. For example, the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d)\nprovides deposit insurance protection\nfor deposits placed in a U.S.\nDepository Institution. At December 31,\n2021 and 2020, the Firmwide estimated\nuninsured deposits were $1,489.6\nbillion and $1,275.9 billion,\nrespectively, primarily reflecting\nwholesale operating deposits.\n\nTotal uninsured deposits include time\ndeposits. The table below presents an\nestimate of uninsured U.S. and non-U.S.\ntime deposits, and their remaining\nmaturities. The Firm\u2019s estimates of its\nuninsured U.S. time deposits are based\non data that the Firm calculates\nperiodically under applicable FDIC\nregulations. For purposes of this\npresentation, all non-U.S. time\ndeposits are deemed to be uninsured.\n                                                                                  \n

sources of short-term\nsecured funding primarily consist of\nsecurities loaned or sold under\nagreements to repurchase. These\ninstruments are secured predominantly\nby high-quality securities collateral,\nincluding government-issued debt and\nU.S. GSE and government agency MBS.\nSecurities sold under agreements to\nrepurchase decreased at December 31,\n2021, compared with December 31, 2020,\ndue to lower secured financing of AFS\ninvestment securities in Treasury and\nCIO, and trading assets in CIB Markets.\n\nThe balances associated with securities\nloaned or sold under agreements to\nrepurchase fluctuate over time due to\ninvestment and financing activities of\nclients, the Firm\u2019s demand for\nfinancing, the ongoing management of\nthe mix of the Firm\u2019s liabilities,\nincluding its secured and unsecured\nfinancing (for both the investment\nsecurities and market-making\nportfolios), and other market and\nportfolio factors.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s sources of short-term\nunsecured funding primarily consist of\nissuances of wholesale commercial paper\nand other borrowed funds. The increase\nin commercial paper at December 31,\n2021, from December 31, 2020 was due to\nhigher net issuance primarily for\nshort-term liquidity management.\n\nThe increase in unsecured other\nborrowed funds at December 31, 2021\nfrom December 31, 2020, and for the\naverage year ended December 31, 2021\ncompared to the prior year period, was\nprimarily due to net issuances of\nstructured notes.\n                                              \n  102    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n  Long-term funding and issuance                                                  \n                                                                                  \nLong-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity\nfor the Firm. The Firm\u2019s long-term funding plan is driven primarily by expected\nclient activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, including\nTLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing\nmarket access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding\nmarkets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan.\n\nThe significant majority of the Firm\u2019s long-term unsecured funding is issued by\nthe Parent Company to provide flexibility in support of both bank and non-bank\nsubsidiary funding needs.

As reputation risk is\ninherently challenging to identify,\nmanage, and quantify, a reputation risk\nmanagement function is particularly\nimportant.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s reputation risk management\nfunction includes the following\nactivities:\n\n\u2022 Maintaining a Firmwide Reputation\nRisk Governance policy and standard\nconsistent with the reputation risk\nframework\n\n\u2022 Overseeing the governance execution\nthrough processes and infrastructure\nthat support consistent identification,\nescalation, management and monitoring\nof reputation risk issues Firmwide\n\nThe types of events that result in\nreputation risk are wide-ranging and\nmay be introduced by the Firm\u2019s\nemployees and the clients, customers\nand counterparties with which the Firm\ndoes business. These events could\nresult in financial losses, litigation\nand regulatory fines, as well as other\nharm to the Firm.\n                                                                                  \n  Governance and oversight                                                        \n                                                                                  \nThe Reputation Risk Governance policy\nestablishes the principles for managing\nreputation risk for the Firm. It is the\nresponsibility of employees in each LOB\nand Corporate to consider the\nreputation of the Firm when deciding\nwhether to offer a new product, engage\nin a transaction or client\nrelationship, enter a new jurisdiction,\ninitiate a business process or consider\nany other activity.

In its consumer businesses,\nthe Firm is exposed to credit risk\nprimarily through its home lending,\ncredit card, auto, and business banking\nbusinesses. In its wholesale\nbusinesses, the Firm is exposed to\ncredit risk through its underwriting,\nlending, market-making, and hedging\nactivities with and for clients and\ncounterparties, as well as through its\noperating services activities (such as\ncash management and clearing\nactivities), and securities financing\nactivities. The Firm is also exposed to\ncredit risk through its investment\nsecurities portfolio and cash placed\nwith banks.\n\nCredit Risk Management monitors,\nmeasures and manages credit risk\nthroughout the Firm and defines credit\nrisk policies and procedures. The\nFirm\u2019s credit risk management\ngovernance includes the following\nactivities:\n\n\u2022 Maintaining a credit risk policy\nframework\n\n\u2022 Monitoring, measuring and managing\ncredit risk across all portfolio\nsegments, including transaction and\nexposure approval\n\n\u2022 Setting industry and geographic\nconcentration limits, as appropriate,\nand establishing underwriting\nguidelines\n\n\u2022 Assigning and managing credit\nauthorities in connection with the\napproval of credit exposure\n\n\u2022 Managing criticized exposures and\ndelinquent loans, and\n\n\u2022 Estimating credit losses and\nsupporting appropriate credit risk-\nbased capital management\n                                                                                  \n  Risk identification and measurement                                             \n                                                                                  \nTo measure credit risk, the Firm\nemploys several methodologies for\nestimating the likelihood of obligor or\ncounterparty default. Methodologies for\nmeasuring credit risk vary depending on\nseveral factors, including type of\nasset (e.g., consumer versus\nwholesale), risk measurement parameters\n(e.g., delinquency status and\nborrower\u2019s credit score versus\nwholesale risk-rating) and risk\nmanagement and collection processes\n(e.g., retail collection center versus\ncentrally managed workout groups).\nCredit risk measurement is based on the\nprobability of default of an obligor or\ncounterparty, the loss severity given a\ndefault event and the exposure at\ndefault.\n\nBased on these factors and the\nmethodology and estimates described in\nNote 13 and Note 10, the Firm estimates\ncredit losses for its exposures. The\nallowance for loan losses reflects\nestimated credit losses related to the\nconsumer and wholesale held-for-\ninvestment loan portfolios, the\nallowance for lending-related\ncommitments reflects estimated credit\nlosses related to the Firm\u2019s lending-\nrelated commitments and the allowance\nfor investment securities reflects\nestimated credit losses related to the\ninvestment securities portfolio. Refer\nto Note 13, Note 10 and Critical\nAccounting Estimates used by the Firm\non pages 150-153 for further\ninformation.\n\nIn addition, potential and unexpected\ncredit losses are reflected in the\nallocation of credit risk capital and\nrepresent the potential volatility of\nactual losses relative to the\nestablished allowances for loan losses\nand lending-related commitments. The\nanalyses for these losses include\nstress testing that considers\nalternative economic scenarios as\ndescribed below.\n                                                                                  \n  Stress testing                                                                  \n                                                                                  \nStress testing is important in\nmeasuring and managing credit risk in\nthe Firm\u2019s credit portfolio. The stress\ntesting process assesses the potential\nimpact of alternative economic and\nbusiness scenarios on estimated credit\nlosses for the Firm. Economic scenarios\nand the underlying parameters are\ndefined centrally, articulated in terms\nof macroeconomic factors and applied\nacross the businesses. The stress test\nresults may indicate credit migration,\nchanges in delinquency trends and\npotential losses in the credit\nportfolio. In addition to the periodic\nstress testing processes, management\nalso considers additional stresses\noutside these scenarios, including\nindustry and country- specific stress\nscenarios, as necessary. The Firm uses\nstress testing to inform decisions on\nsetting risk appetite both at a Firm\nand LOB level, as well as to assess the\nimpact of stress on individual\ncounterparties.\n                                              \n  106    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n  Risk monitoring and management                                                  \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm has developed policies and\npractices that are designed to preserve\nthe independence and integrity of the\napproval and decision-making process\nfor extending credit to ensure credit\nrisks are assessed accurately, approved\nproperly, monitored regularly and\nmanaged actively at both the\ntransaction and portfolio levels. The\npolicy framework establishes credit\napproval authorities, concentration\nlimits, risk-rating methodologies,\nportfolio review parameters and\nguidelines for management of distressed\nexposures. In addition, certain models,\nassumptions and inputs used in\nevaluating and monitoring credit risk\nare independently validated by groups\nthat are separate from the LOBs.\n\nConsumer credit risk is monitored for\ndelinquency and other trends, including\nany concentrations at the portfolio\nlevel, as certain of these trends can\nbe addressed through changes in\nunderwriting policies and portfolio\nguidelines. Consumer Risk Management\nevaluates delinquency and other trends\nagainst business expectations, current\nand forecasted economic conditions, and\nindustry benchmarks. Historical and\nforecasted economic performance and\ntrends are incorporated into the\nmodeling of estimated consumer credit\nlosses and are part of the monitoring\nof the credit risk profile of the\nportfolio.\n\nWholesale credit risk is monitored\nregularly at an aggregate portfolio,\nindustry, and individual client and\ncounterparty level with established\nconcentration limits that are reviewed\nand revised periodically as deemed\nappropriate by management. Industry and\ncounterparty limits, as measured in\nterms of exposure and economic risk\nappetite, are subject to stress-based\nloss constraints. Wrong-way risk is the\nrisk that exposure to a counterparty is\npositively correlated with the impact\nof a default by the same counterparty,\nwhich could cause exposure to increase\nat the same time as the counterparty\u2019s\ncapacity to meet its obligations is\ndecreasing.\n\nManagement of the Firm\u2019s wholesale\ncredit risk exposure is accomplished\nthrough a number of means, including:\n\n\u2022 Loan underwriting and credit approval\nprocesses\n\n\u2022 Loan syndications and participations\n\n\u2022 Loan sales and securitizations\n\n\u2022 Credit derivatives\n\n\u2022 Master netting agreements, and\n\n\u2022 Collateral and other risk-reduction\ntechniques\n\nIn addition to Credit Risk Management,\nan independent Credit Review function\nis responsible for:\n\n\u2022 I ndependently validating or changing\nthe risk grades assigned to exposures\nin the Firm\u2019s wholesale credit\nportfolio, and assessing the timeliness\nof risk grade changes initiated by\nresponsible business units; and\n\n\u2022 Evaluating the effectiveness of the\ncredit management processes of the LOBs\nand Corporate, including the adequacy\nof credit analyses and risk\ngrading/loss given default (\u201cLGD\u201d)\nrationales, proper monitoring and\nmanagement of credit exposures, and\ncompliance with applicable grading\npolicies and underwriting guidelines.\n\nRefer to Note 12 for further discussion\nof consumer and wholesale loans.\n                                                                                  \n  Risk reporting                                                                  \n                                                                                  \nTo enable monitoring of credit risk and\neffective decision-making, aggregate\ncredit exposure, credit quality\nforecasts, concentration levels and\nrisk profile changes are reported\nregularly to senior members of Credit\nRisk Management.

When\ncertain criteria are met, PPP loans are\nsubject to forgiveness and the Firm\nwill receive payment of the forgiveness\namount from the SBA. PPP loans have a\ncontractual term of two or five years\nand provide borrowers with an automatic\npayment deferral of principal and\ninterest. The SBA will pay accrued\ninterest through the payment deferral\nperiod and additional interest up to a\nmaximum of 120 days past due. Based\nupon these servicing guidelines, the\nFirm continues to accrue interest for\nPPP loans 90 or more days past due\nuntil delinquency reaches 120 days past\ndue. PPP processing fees are deferred\nand accreted into interest income over\nthe contractual life of the loans, but\nmay be accelerated upon forgiveness or\nprepayment.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Firm\nhad $6.7 billion and $27.2 billion,\nrespectively, of PPP loans, including\n$5.4 billion and $19.2 billion,\nrespectively, in consumer, and $1.3\nbillion and $8.0 billion, respectively,\nin wholesale. The PPP ended for new\napplications on May 31, 2021.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately\n$34 billion of PPP loans have been\nrepaid through payments of forgiveness\namounts to the Firm from the SBA.\nDuring the year ended December 31,\n2021, this resulted in accelerated\nrecognition in interest income of the\nassociated deferred processing fees,\nprimarily in CCB.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, $633 million of\nPPP loans 90 or more days past due have\nbeen excluded from the Firm\u2019s\nnonaccrual loans as they are guaranteed\nby the SBA.\n\nRefer to CCB segment results on pages\n63-66 and Note 12 for a further\ndiscussion of the PPP.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    109  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                            \n                                                                                  \n                             \n  CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO  \n                             \nThe Firm\u2019s retained consumer portfolio\nconsists primarily of residential real\nestate loans, credit card loans, scored\nauto and business banking loans, as\nwell as associated lending-related\ncommitments.

Retained loans were\nrelatively flat compared to December\n31, 2020 as the decline in Home Lending\ndriven by paydowns outpacing\noriginations of prime mortgage loans\nwas predominantly offset by growth in\nAWM. Retained nonaccrual loans\ndecreased from December 31, 2020\nreflecting improved credit performance.\nNet recoveries for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 were higher when\ncompared with the prior year as the\ncurrent year benefited from further\nimprovement in HPI and higher reversals\nof prior write-downs due to prepayments\nas a result of the low rate\nenvironment. Loans at fair value\nincreased from December 31, 2020,\nreflecting loan purchase activity in\nCIB driven by higher client demand, as\nwell as increased originations in Home\nLending due to the continued low rate\nenvironment. Nonaccrual loans at fair\nvalue decreased from December 31, 2020\ndue to sales in CIB. The carrying value\nof home equity lines of credit\noutstanding was $18.7 billion at\nDecember 31, 2021. This amount included\n$6.2 billion of HELOCs that have recast\nfrom interest-only to fully amortizing\npayments or have been modified and $6.0\nbillion of interest-only balloon\nHELOCs, which primarily mature after\n2030. The Firm manages the risk of\nHELOCs during their revolving period by\nclosing or reducing the undrawn line to\nthe extent permitted by law when\nborrowers are exhibiting a material\ndeterioration in their credit risk\nprofile. At December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nthe carrying value of interest-only\nresidential mortgage loans were $30.0\nbillion and $25.6 billion,\nrespectively.

Auto and other : The\nauto and other loan portfolio,\nincluding loans at fair value,\npredominantly consists of prime-quality\nscored auto and business banking loans,\nas well as overdrafts. The portfolio\ndecreased when compared with December\n31, 2020 due to a decrease in business\nbanking loans largely offset by growth\nin the scored auto portfolio. Business\nBanking loans declined predominantly\ndue to PPP loan forgiveness, partially\noffset by originations.

A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm\u2019s\nwholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm\ndistributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the\nmarket as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio\nconcentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in\npart by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and\ntransaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry,\nproduct and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages\n119-123 for further information. The Firm\u2019s wholesale credit portfolio includes\nexposure held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated exposures held\nin CCB, including business banking and auto dealer exposure for which the\nwholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for credit losses.\nIn 2021 the credit environment continued to improve following the broad-based\ndeterioration during the earlier stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December\n31, 2021, retained loans increased $45.4 billion driven by CIB and AWM, partially\noffset by decreases in CCB. Lending-related commitments increased $36.6 billion,\npredominantly driven by net portfolio activity in CB and CIB, including an\nincrease in held for sale commitments intended to be syndicated. As of December\n31, 2021, the investment-grade percentage of the portfolio remained relatively\nflat at 71%, while criticized exposure decreased $3.4 billion from $41.6 billion\nto $38.2 billion. The decrease in criticized exposure was driven by net portfolio\nactivity and client-specific upgrades, primarily in Oil & Gas and Automotive,\nlargely offset by client-specific downgrades. Nonperforming exposure decreased\n$1.2 billion driven by lower nonperforming loans, primarily in Oil & Gas and\nIndividuals and Individual Entities, with net portfolio activity and client-\nspecific upgrades partially offset by client-specific downgrades. The decrease in\nnonperforming loans was partially offset by increases in derivatives and lending-\nrelated commitments.\n

The Firm\nuses lending-related financial\ninstruments, such as commitments\n(including revolving credit facilities)\nand guarantees, to address the\nfinancing needs of its clients. The\ncontractual amounts of these financial\ninstruments represent the maximum\npossible credit risk should the clients\ndraw down on these commitments or when\nthe Firm fulfills its obligations under\nthese guarantees, and the clients\nsubsequently fail to perform according\nto the terms of these contracts. Most\nof these commitments and guarantees\nhave historically been refinanced,\nextended, cancelled, or expired without\nbeing drawn upon or a default\noccurring. As a result, the Firm does\nnot believe that the total contractual\namount of these wholesale lending-\nrelated commitments is representative\nof the Firm\u2019s expected future credit\nexposure or funding requirements. Refer\nto Note 28 for further information on\nwholesale lending-related commitments.\nReceivables from customers Receivables\nfrom customers reflect held-for-\ninvestment margin loans to brokerage\nclients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are\ncollateralized by assets maintained in\nthe clients\u2019 brokerage accounts (e.g.,\ncash on deposit, and liquid and readily\nmarketable debt or equity securities).\nBecause of this collateralization, no\nallowance for credit losses is\ngenerally held against these\nreceivables. To manage its credit risk\nthe Firm establishes margin\nrequirements and monitors the required\nmargin levels on an ongoing basis, and\nrequires clients to deposit additional\ncash or other collateral, or to reduce\npositions, when appropriate. These\nreceivables are reported within accrued\ninterest and accounts receivable on the\nFirm\u2019s Consolidated balance sheets.\nDerivative contracts Derivatives enable\nclients and counterparties to manage\nrisk including credit risk and risks\narising from fluctuations in interest\nrates, foreign exchange and equities\nand commodities prices. The Firm makes\nmarkets in derivatives in order to meet\nthese needs and uses derivatives to\nmanage certain risks associated with\nnet open risk positions from its\nmarket-making activities, including the\ncounterparty credit risk arising from\nderivative receivables. The Firm also\nuses derivative instruments to manage\nits own credit risk and other market\nrisk exposure. The nature of the\ncounterparty and the settlement\nmechanism of the derivative affect the\ncredit risk to which the Firm is\nexposed. For OTC derivatives the Firm\nis exposed to the credit risk of the\nderivative counterparty. For exchange-\ntraded derivatives (\u201cETD\u201d), such as\nfutures and options, and cleared over-\nthe-counter (\u201cOTC-cleared\u201d)\nderivatives, the Firm can also be\nexposed to the credit risk of the\nrelevant CCP. Where possible, the Firm\nseeks to mitigate its credit risk\nexposures arising from derivative\ncontracts through the use of legally\nenforceable master netting arrangements\nand collateral agreements. The\npercentage of the Firm\u2019s OTC derivative\ntransactions subject to collateral\nagreements \u2014 excluding foreign exchange\nspot trades, which are not typically\ncovered by collateral agreements due to\ntheir short\n\nmaturity and centrally cleared trades\nthat are settled daily \u2014 was\napproximately 88% at both December 31,\n2021 and 2020. Refer to Note 5 for\nadditional information on the Firm\u2019s\nuse of collateral agreements. Refer to\nNote 5 for a further discussion of\nderivative contracts, counterparties\nand settlement types. The fair value of\nderivative receivables reported on the\nConsolidated balance sheets were $57.1\nbillion and $75.4 billion at December\n31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The\ndecrease was primarily driven by market\nmovements and maturities of certain\ntrades in CIB, partially offset by an\nincrease in commodity derivatives.\nDerivative receivables represent the\nfair value of the derivative contracts\nafter giving effect to legally\nenforceable master netting agreements\nand the related cash collateral held by\nthe Firm. In addition, the Firm held\nliquid securities and other cash\ncollateral that the Firm believes is\nlegally enforceable and may be used as\nsecurity when the fair value of the\nclient\u2019s exposure is in the Firm\u2019s\nfavor. For these purposes, the\ndefinition of liquid securities is\nconsistent with the definition of high\nquality liquid assets as defined in the\nLCR rule. In management\u2019s view, the\nappropriate measure of current credit\nrisk should also take into\nconsideration other collateral, which\ngenerally represents securities that do\nnot qualify as high quality liquid\nassets under the LCR rule, but that the\nFirm believes is legally enforceable.\nThe collateral amounts for each\ncounterparty are limited to the net\nderivative receivables for the\ncounterparty. The Firm also holds\nadditional collateral (primarily cash,\nG7 government securities, other liquid\ngovernment agency and guaranteed\nsecurities, and corporate debt and\nequity securities) delivered by clients\nat the initiation of transactions, as\nwell as collateral related to contracts\nthat have a non-daily call frequency\nand collateral that the Firm has agreed\nto return but has not yet settled as of\nthe reporting date. Although this\ncollateral does not reduce the balances\nand is not included in the tables\nbelow, it is available as security\nagainst potential exposure that could\narise should the fair value of the\nclient\u2019s derivative contracts move in\nthe Firm\u2019s favor. Refer to Note 5 for\nadditional information on the Firm\u2019s\nuse of collateral agreements.

To\ncapture the potential future\nvariability of credit exposure, the\nFirm calculates, on a client-by-client\nbasis, three measures of potential\nderivatives-related credit loss: Peak,\nDerivative Risk Equivalent (\u201cDRE\u201d), and\nAverage exposure (\u201cAVG\u201d). These\nmeasures all incorporate netting and\ncollateral benefits, where applicable.\n\nPeak represents a conservative measure\nof potential derivative exposure,\nincluding the benefit of collateral, to\na counterparty calculated in a manner\nthat is broadly equivalent to a 97.5%\nconfidence level over the life of the\ntransaction. Peak is the primary\nmeasure used by the Firm for setting\ncredit limits for derivative contracts,\nsenior management reporting and\nderivatives exposure management.\n\nDRE exposure is a measure that\nexpresses the risk of derivative\nexposure, including the benefit of\ncollateral, on a basis intended to be\nequivalent to the risk of loan\nexposures. DRE is a less extreme\nmeasure of potential credit loss than\nPeak and is used as an input for\naggregating derivative credit risk\nexposures with loans and other credit\nrisk.\n\nFinally, AVG is a measure of the\nexpected fair value of the Firm\u2019s\nderivative exposure, including the\nbenefit of collateral, at future time\nperiods. AVG over the total life of the\nderivative contract is used as the\nprimary metric for pricing purposes and\nis used to calculate credit risk\ncapital and CVA, as further described\nbelow.\n\nThe fair value of the Firm\u2019s derivative\nreceivables incorporates CVA to reflect\nthe credit quality of counterparties.\nCVA is based on the Firm\u2019s AVG to a\ncounterparty and the counterparty\u2019s\ncredit spread in the credit derivatives\nmarket. The Firm believes that active\nrisk management is essential to\ncontrolling the dynamic credit risk in\nthe derivatives portfolio. In addition,\nthe Firm\u2019s risk\n\nmanagement process for derivatives\nexposures takes into consideration the\npotential impact of wrong-way risk,\nwhich is broadly defined as the risk\nthat exposure to a counterparty is\npositively correlated with the impact\nof a default by the same counterparty,\nwhich could cause exposure to increase\nat the same time as the counterparty\u2019s\ncapacity to meet its obligations is\ndecreasing. Many factors may influence\nthe nature and magnitude of these\ncorrelations over time. To the extent\nthat these correlations are identified,\nthe Firm may adjust the CVA associated\nwith a particular counterparty\u2019s AVG.\nThe Firm risk manages exposure to\nchanges in CVA by entering into credit\nderivative contracts, as well as\ninterest rate, foreign exchange, equity\nand commodity derivative contracts.\n\nThe below graph shows exposure profiles\nto the Firm\u2019s current derivatives\nportfolio over the next 10 years as\ncalculated by the Peak, DRE and AVG\nmetrics. The three measures generally\nshow that exposure will decline after\nthe first year, if no new trades are\nadded to the portfolio.\n                                                                                  \n  Exposure profile of derivatives measures                                        \n                                                                                  \nDecember 31, 2021\n\n(in billions)\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    127  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                            \n                                                                                  \nCredit derivatives The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes:\nfirst, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-user, to manage\nthe Firm\u2019s own credit risk associated with various exposures. Credit portfolio\nmanagement activities Included in the Firm\u2019s end-user activities are credit\nderivatives used to mitigate the credit risk associated with traditional lending\nactivities (loans and lending-related commitments) and derivatives counterparty\nexposure in the Firm\u2019s wholesale businesses (collectively, \u201ccredit portfolio\nmanagement activities\u201d).

The credit derivatives\nused in credit portfolio management\nactivities do not qualify for hedge\naccounting under U.S. GAAP; these\nderivatives are reported at fair value,\nwith gains and losses recognized in\nprincipal transactions revenue. In\ncontrast, the loans and lending-related\ncommitments being risk-managed are\naccounted for on an accrual basis. This\nasymmetry in accounting treatment,\nbetween loans and lending-related\ncommitments and the credit derivatives\nused in credit portfolio management\nactivities, causes earnings volatility\nthat is not representative, in the\nFirm\u2019s view, of the true changes in\nvalue of the Firm\u2019s overall credit\nexposure. The effectiveness of credit\ndefault swaps (\u201cCDS\u201d) as a hedge\nagainst the Firm\u2019s exposures may vary\ndepending on a number of factors,\nincluding the named reference entity\n(i.e., the Firm may experience losses\non specific exposures that are\ndifferent than the named reference\nentities in the purchased CDS); the\ncontractual terms of the CDS (which may\nhave a defined credit event that does\nnot align with an actual loss realized\nby the Firm); and the maturity of the\nFirm\u2019s CDS protection (which in some\ncases may be shorter than the Firm\u2019s\nexposures). However, the Firm generally\nseeks to purchase credit protection\nwith a maturity date that is the same\nor similar to the maturity date of the\nexposure for which the protection was\npurchased, and remaining differences in\nmaturity are actively monitored and\nmanaged by the Firm.

The Firm\u2019s\nallowance for credit losses comprises:\n\u2022 the allowance for loan losses, which\ncovers the Firm\u2019s retained loan\nportfolios (scored and risk-rated) and\nis presented separately on the\nConsolidated balance sheets, \u2022 the\nallowance for lending-related\ncommitments, which is presented on the\nConsolidated balance sheets in accounts\npayable and other liabilities, and \u2022\nthe allowance for credit losses on\ninvestment securities, which is\nrecognized within Investment Securities\non the Consolidated balance sheets.\nDiscussion of changes in the allowance\nThe allowance for credit losses as of\nDecember 31, 2021 was $18.7 billion, a\ndecrease from $30.8 billion at December\n31, 2020. The decrease in the allowance\nfor credit losses was primarily driven\nby improvements in the macroeconomic\nenvironment, consisting of: \u2022 a $9.5\nbillion reduction in consumer,\npredominantly in the credit card\nportfolio; and \u2022 a $2.6 billion net\nreduction in wholesale, across the\nLOBs. The Firm\u2019s allowance for credit\nlosses is estimated using a weighted\naverage of five internally developed\nmacroeconomic scenarios. As of December\n31, 2021, the Firm assigned more\nbalanced weightings to both its adverse\nand upside scenarios compared to the\nsignificant weighting that the Firm\nplaced on its adverse scenarios as of\nDecember 31, 2020, reflecting the\nsustained improvement and resilience of\nthe macroeconomic environment, despite\nthe ongoing impact of the COVID-19\npandemic. In addition, because the\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic and\ngovernmental actions taken in response\nto the pandemic caused a dislocation in\ncertain historical relationships used\nfor modeling credit loss estimates, the\nFirm continues to place reliance on\nmanagement judgment and make\nadjustments specific to that\ndislocation, although to a lesser\nextent than in 2020. The allowance for\ncredit losses of $18.7 billion reflects\nremaining uncertainties, including the\npotential impact that additional waves\nor variants of COVID-19 may have on the\npace of economic growth and near-term\nsupply chain disruptions.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s central case assumptions\nreflected U.S. unemployment rates and\nyear over year growth in U.S. real GDP\nas follows:\n                                                                                  \n                                Assumptions at December                           \n                                               31, 2021                           \n                                                   2Q22       4Q22       2Q23     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. unemployment                                 4.2  %     4.0  %     3.9  %  \n  rate(a)                                                                         \n  YoY growth in U.S. real                           3.1  %     2.8  %     2.1  %  \n  GDP(b)                                                                          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                Assumptions at December                           \n                                               31, 2020                           \n                                                   2Q21       4Q21       2Q22     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. unemployment                                 6.8  %     5.7  %     5.1  %  \n  rate(a)                                                                         \n  YoY growth in U.S. real                           9.2  %     3.5  %     3.9  %  \n  GDP(b)                                                                          \n                                                                                  \n(a) Reflects quarterly average of\nforecasted U.S. unemployment rate.

The investment securities\nportfolio is predominantly held by\nTreasury and CIO in connection with the\nFirm's balance sheet and asset-\nliability management objectives.\nPrincipal investments are predominantly\nprivately-held financial instruments\nand are managed in the LOBs and\nCorporate. Investments are typically\nintended to be held over extended\nperiods and, accordingly, the Firm has\nno expectation for short-term realized\ngains with respect to these\ninvestments. Investment securities risk\nInvestment securities risk includes the\nexposure associated with a default in\nthe payment of principal and interest.\nThis risk is mitigated given that the\ninvestment securities portfolio held by\nTreasury and CIO predominantly consists\nof high-quality securities. At December\n31, 2021, the Treasury and CIO\ninvestment securities portfolio, net of\nallowance for credit losses, was $670.1\nbillion, and the average credit rating\nof the securities comprising the\nportfolio was AA+ (based upon external\nratings where available, and where not\navailable, based primarily upon\ninternal risk ratings). Refer to\nCorporate segment results on pages\n79-80 and Note 10 for further\ninformation on the investment\nsecurities portfolio and internal risk\nratings. Refer to Market Risk\nManagement on pages 133-140 for further\ninformation on the market risk inherent\nin the portfolio. Refer to Liquidity\nRisk Management on pages 97-104 for\nfurther information on related\nliquidity risk. Governance and\noversight Investment securities risks\nare governed by the Firm\u2019s Risk\nAppetite framework, and reviewed at the\nCTC Risk Committee with regular updates\nto the Board Risk Committee. The Firm\u2019s\nindependent control functions are\nresponsible for reviewing the\nappropriateness of the carrying value\nof investment securities in accordance\nwith relevant policies. Approved levels\nfor investment securities are\nestablished for each risk category,\nincluding capital and credit risks.\n\nPrincipal investment risk Principal\ninvestments are typically privately-\nheld financial instruments representing\nownership interests or other forms of\njunior capital. In general, principal\ninvestments include tax-oriented\ninvestments and investments made to\nenhance or accelerate the Firm\u2019s\nbusiness strategies and exclude those\nthat are consolidated on the Firm's\nbalance sheets. These investments are\nmade by dedicated investing businesses\nor as part of a broader business\nstrategy. The Firm\u2019s principal\ninvestments are managed by the LOBs and\nCorporate and are reflected within\ntheir respective financial results.

Refer to Note 25 for\nfurther information. Governance and\noversight The Firm\u2019s approach to\nmanaging principal risk is consistent\nwith the Firm\u2019s risk governance\nstructure. A Firmwide risk policy\nframework exists for all principal\ninvesting activities and includes\napproval by executives who are\nindependent from the investing\nbusinesses, as appropriate. The Firm\u2019s\nindependent control functions are\nresponsible for reviewing the\nappropriateness of the carrying value\nof investments in accordance with\nrelevant policies. As part of the risk\ngovernance structure, approved levels\nfor investments are established and\nmonitored for each relevant business or\nsegment in order to manage the overall\nsize of the portfolios. The Firm also\nconducts stress testing on these\nportfolios using specific scenarios\nthat estimate losses based on\nsignificant market moves and/or other\nrisk events.\n                                              \n  132    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                          \n  MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT  \n                          \nMarket risk is the risk associated with\nthe effect of changes in market factors\nsuch as interest and foreign exchange\nrates, equity and commodity prices,\ncredit spreads or implied volatilities,\non the value of assets and liabilities\nheld for both the short and long term.\n                                                                                  \n  Market Risk Management                                                          \n                                                                                  \nMarket Risk Management monitors market\nrisks throughout the Firm and defines\nmarket risk policies and procedures.\n\nMarket Risk Management seeks to manage\nrisk, facilitate efficient risk/return\ndecisions, reduce volatility in\noperating performance and provide\ntransparency into the Firm\u2019s market\nrisk profile for senior management, the\nBoard of Directors and regulators.\nMarket Risk Management is responsible\nfor the following functions:\n\n\u2022 Maintaining a market risk policy\nframework\n\n\u2022 Independently measuring, monitoring\nand controlling LOB, Corporate, and\nFirmwide market risk\n\n\u2022 Defining, approving and monitoring of\nlimits\n\n\u2022 Performing stress testing and\nqualitative risk assessments\n                                                                                  \n  Risk measurement                                                                \n                                                                                  \nMeasures used to capture market risk\n\nThere is no single measure to capture\nmarket risk and therefore Market Risk\nManagement uses various metrics, both\nstatistical and nonstatistical, to\nassess risk including:\n\n\u2022 Value-at-risk (VaR)\n\n\u2022 Stress testing\n\n\u2022 Profit and loss drawdowns\n\n\u2022 Earnings-at-risk\n\n\u2022 Other sensitivity-based measures\n                                                                                  \n  Risk monitoring and control                                                     \n                                                                                  \nMarket risk exposure is managed\nprimarily through a series of limits\nset in the context of the market\nenvironment and business strategy. In\nsetting limits, Market Risk Management\ntakes into consideration factors such\nas market volatility, product\nliquidity, accommodation of client\nbusiness, and management judgment.\nMarket Risk Management maintains\ndifferent levels of limits. Firm level\nlimits include VaR and stress limits.\nSimilarly, LOB and Corporate limits\ninclude VaR and stress limits and may\nbe supplemented by certain\nnonstatistical risk measures such as\nprofit and loss drawdowns. Limits may\nalso be set within the LOBs and\nCorporate, as well as at the legal\nentity level.\n\nMarket Risk Management sets limits and\nregularly reviews and updates them as\nappropriate. Senior management is\nresponsible for reviewing and approving\ncertain of these risk limits on an\nongoing basis. Limits that have not\nbeen reviewed within specified time\nperiods by Market Risk Management are\nreported to senior management. The LOBs\nand Corporate are responsible for\nadhering to established limits against\nwhich exposures are monitored and\nreported.\n\nLimit breaches are required to be\nreported in a timely manner to limit\napprovers, which include Market Risk\nManagement and senior management. In\nthe event of a breach, Market Risk\nManagement consults with senior members\nof appropriate groups within the Firm\nto determine the suitable course of\naction required to return the\napplicable positions to compliance,\nwhich may include a reduction in risk\nin order to remedy the breach or\ngranting a temporary increase in limits\nto accommodate an expected increase in\nclient activity and/or market\nvolatility. Certain Firm, Corporate or\nLOB-level limit breaches are escalated\nas appropriate.\n\nMarket Risk Management continues to\nactively monitor the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic on market risk\nexposures by leveraging existing risk\nmeasures and controls.\n\nModels used to measure market risk are\ninherently imprecise and are limited in\ntheir ability to measure certain risks\nor to predict losses. This imprecision\nmay be heightened when sudden or severe\nshifts in market conditions occur. For\nadditional discussion on model\nuncertainty refer to Estimations and\nModel Risk Management on page 149.\n\nMarket Risk Management periodically\nreviews the Firm\u2019s existing market risk\nmeasures to identify opportunities for\nenhancement, and to the extent\nappropriate, will calibrate those\nmeasures accordingly over time.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    133  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                            \n                                                                                  \nThe following table summarizes the predominant business activities and related\nmarket risks, as well as positions which give rise to market risk and certain\nmeasures used to capture those risks, for each LOB and Corporate.\n\nIn addition to the predominant business activities, each LOB and Corporate may\nengage in principal investing activities.

statistical risk measure, to\nestimate the potential loss from\nadverse market moves in the current\nmarket environment. The Firm has a\nsingle VaR framework used as a basis\nfor calculating Risk Management VaR and\nRegulatory VaR.\n\nThe framework is employed across the\nFirm using historical simulation based\non data for the previous 12 months. The\nframework\u2019s approach assumes that\nhistorical changes in market values are\nrepresentative of the distribution of\npotential outcomes in the immediate\nfuture. The Firm believes the use of\nRisk Management VaR provides a daily\nmeasure of risk that is closely aligned\nto risk management decisions made by\nthe LOBs and Corporate and, along with\nother market risk measures, provides\nthe appropriate information needed to\nrespond to risk events.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR is\ncalculated assuming a one-day holding\nperiod and an expected tail-loss\nmethodology which approximates a 95%\nconfidence level. Risk Management VaR\nprovides a consistent framework to\nmeasure risk profiles and levels of\ndiversification across product types\nand is used for aggregating risks and\nmonitoring limits across businesses.\nVaR results are reported to senior\nmanagement, the Board of Directors and\nregulators.\n\nUnderlying the overall VaR model\nframework are individual VaR models\nthat simulate historical market returns\nfor individual risk factors and/or\nproduct types. To capture material\nmarket risks as part of the Firm\u2019s risk\nmanagement framework, comprehensive VaR\nmodel calculations are performed daily\nfor businesses whose activities give\nrise to market risk. These VaR models\nare granular and incorporate numerous\nrisk factors and inputs to simulate\ndaily changes in market values over the\nhistorical period; inputs are selected\nbased on the risk profile of each\nportfolio, as sensitivities and\nhistorical time series used to generate\ndaily market values may be different\nacross product types or risk management\nsystems. The VaR model results across\nall portfolios are aggregated at the\nFirm level.\n\nAs VaR is based on historical data, it\nis an imperfect measure of market risk\nexposure and potential future losses.\nIn addition, based on their reliance on\navailable historical data, limited time\nhorizons, and other factors, VaR\nmeasures are inherently limited in\ntheir ability to measure certain risks\nand to predict losses, particularly\nthose associated with market\nilliquidity and sudden or severe shifts\nin market conditions.\n\nFor certain products, specific risk\nparameters are not captured in VaR due\nto the lack of liquidity and\navailability of appropriate historical\ndata. The Firm uses proxies to estimate\nthe VaR for these and other products\nwhen daily time series are not\navailable. It is likely that using an\nactual price-based time series for\nthese products, if available, would\naffect the VaR results presented. The\nFirm therefore considers other\nnonstatistical measures such as stress\n\ntesting, in addition to VaR, to capture\nand manage its market risk positions.\n\nThe daily market data used in VaR\nmodels may be different than the\nindependent third-party data collected\nfor VCG price testing in its monthly\nvaluation process. For example, in\ncases where market prices are not\nobservable, or where proxies are used\nin VaR historical time series, the data\nsources may differ. Refer to Valuation\nprocess in Note 2 for further\ninformation on the Firm\u2019s valuation\nprocess. As VaR model calculations\nrequire daily data and a consistent\nsource for valuation, it may not be\npractical to use the data collected in\nthe VCG monthly valuation process for\nVaR model calculations.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s VaR model calculations are\nperiodically evaluated and enhanced in\nresponse to changes in the composition\nof the Firm\u2019s portfolios, changes in\nmarket conditions, improvements in the\nFirm\u2019s modeling techniques and\nmeasurements, and other factors. Such\nchanges may affect historical\ncomparisons of VaR results. Refer to\nEstimations and Model Risk Management\non page 149 for information regarding\nmodel reviews and approvals.\n\nThe Firm calculates separately a daily\naggregated VaR in accordance with\nregulatory rules (\u201cRegulatory VaR\u201d),\nwhich is used to derive the Firm\u2019s\nregulatory VaR-based capital\nrequirements under Basel III capital\nrules. This Regulatory VaR model\nframework currently assumes a ten\nbusiness-day holding period and an\nexpected tail loss methodology which\napproximates a 99% confidence level.\nRegulatory VaR is applied to \u201ccovered\u201d\npositions as defined by Basel III\ncapital rules, which may be different\nthan the positions included in the\nFirm\u2019s Risk Management VaR. For\nexample, credit derivative hedges of\naccrual loans are included in the\nFirm\u2019s Risk Management VaR, while\nRegulatory VaR excludes these credit\nderivative hedges. In addition, in\ncontrast to the Firm\u2019s Risk Management\nVaR, Regulatory VaR currently excludes\nthe diversification benefit for certain\nVaR models.\n\nRefer to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Basel III\nPillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures\nreports, which are available on the\nFirm\u2019s website, for additional\ninformation on Regulatory VaR and the\nother components of market risk\nregulatory capital for the Firm (e.g.,\nVaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based\nmeasure and the respective\nbacktesting).\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    135  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                            \n                                                                                  \nThe table below shows the results of the Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR measure using\na 95% confidence level.

This reflects the non-\nadditive nature of VaR due to imperfect\ncorrelation across LOBs, Corporate, and\nrisk types.\n\n(b) Average and maximum Corporate and\nother LOB VaR were primarily driven by\na private equity position that became\npublicly traded at the end of the third\nquarter of 2020. As of March 31, 2021\nthe Firm no longer held this position.\n\n(c) The maximum and minimum VaR for\neach portfolio may have occurred on\ndifferent trading days than the\ncomponents and consequently\ndiversification benefit is not\nmeaningful.\n\nGenerally, average VaR across risk\ntypes and LOBs was lower due to\nvolatility which occurred at the onset\nof the COVID-19 pandemic rolling out of\nthe one-year historical look-back\nperiod, predominantly impacting\nexposures in fixed income and\ncommodities. As a result, average Total\nVaR decreased by $40 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2021 when\ncompared with the prior year. In the\ncurrent year, maximum VaR remained\nelevated relative to average VaR as the\naforementioned volatility was still\nincluded in the historical look-back\nperiod in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nEffective July 1, 2020, the Firm\nrefined the scope of VaR to exclude\ncertain real estate-related fair value\noption elected loans, and included them\nin other sensitivity-based measures to\nmore effectively measure the risk from\nthese loans. In the absence of this\nrefinement, the average Total VaR and\neach of the components would have been\nhigher by the amounts reported in the\nfollowing table:\n                                                                                  \n                                          Amount by which                         \n                                          reported average VaR                    \n  For the year ended                      would have                              \n  December 31,          (in millions)     been higher            2021       2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  CIB fixed income VaR                 $                            5  $      11  \n  CIB trading VaR                                                   5          9  \n  CIB VaR                                                           5          9  \n  Total VaR                                                         4          9  \n                                                                                  \nThe following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the four trailing\nquarters.

The definition of\nbacktesting gains and losses above is\nconsistent with the requirements for\nbacktesting under Basel III capital\nrules.\n\nA backtesting exception occurs when the\ndaily backtesting loss exceeds the\ndaily Risk Management VaR for the prior\nday. Under the Firm\u2019s Risk Management\nVaR methodology, assuming current\nchanges in market values are consistent\nwith the historical changes used in the\nsimulation, the Firm would expect to\nincur VaR backtesting exceptions on\n\naverage five times every 100 trading\ndays. The number of VaR backtesting\nexceptions observed can differ from the\nstatistically expected number of\nbacktesting exceptions if the current\nlevel of market volatility is\nmaterially different from the level of\nmarket volatility during the 12 months\nof historical data used in the VaR\ncalculation.\n\nFor the 12 months ended December 31,\n2021, the Firm posted backtesting gains\non 145 of the 260 days, and observed 20\nVaR backtesting exceptions. Twelve of\nthe backtesting exceptions were in the\nthree months ended December 31, 2021 as\nmarket volatility, particularly related\nto interest rates, was materially\nhigher than the market volatility in\nthe 12 months of historical data used\nfor the VaR calculation. Firmwide\nbacktesting loss days can differ from\nthe loss days for which Fixed Income\nMarkets and Equity Markets posted\nlosses, as disclosed in CIB Markets\nrevenue, as the population of positions\nwhich compose each metric are different\nand due to the exclusion of select\ncomponents of total net revenue in\nbacktesting gains and losses as\ndescribed above. For more information\non CIB Markets revenue, refer to pages\n70-71.\n\nThe following chart presents the\ndistribution of Firmwide daily\nbacktesting gains and losses for the\ntrailing 12 months and three months\nended December 31, 2021.

The results are used\nto understand the exposures responsible\nfor those potential losses and are\nmeasured against limits.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s stress framework covers\nmarket risk sensitive positions in the\nLOBs and Corporate. The framework is\nused to calculate multiple magnitudes\nof potential stress for both market\nrallies and market sell-offs, assuming\nsignificant changes in market factors\nsuch as credit spreads, equity prices,\ninterest rates, currency rates and\ncommodity prices, and combines them in\nmultiple ways to capture an array of\nhypothetical economic and market\nscenarios.\n\nThe Firm generates a number of\nscenarios that focus on tail events in\nspecific asset classes and geographies,\nincluding how the event may impact\nmultiple market factors simultaneously.\nScenarios also incorporate specific\nidiosyncratic risks and stress basis\nrisk between different products. The\nflexibility in the stress framework\nallows the Firm to construct new\nscenarios that can test the outcomes\nagainst possible future stress events.\nStress testing results are reported\nperiodically to senior management of\nthe Firm, as appropriate.\n\nStress scenarios are governed by the\noverall stress framework, under the\noversight of Market Risk Management,\nand the models to calculate the stress\nresults are subject to the Firm\u2019s\nEstimations and Model Risk Management\nPolicy. The Firmwide Market Risk Stress\nMethodology Committee reviews and\napproves changes to stress testing\nmethodology and scenarios across the\nFirm. Significant changes to the\nframework are escalated to senior\nmanagement, as appropriate.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s stress testing framework is\nutilized in calculating the Firm\u2019s CCAR\nand other stress test results, which\nare reported periodically to the Board\nof Directors. In addition, stress\ntesting results are incorporated into\nthe Firm\u2019s Risk Appetite framework, and\nare reported periodically to the Board\nRisk Committee.\n                                                                                  \n  Profit and loss drawdowns                                                       \n                                                                                  \nProfit and loss drawdowns are used to\nhighlight trading losses above certain\nlevels of risk tolerance. A profit and\nloss drawdown is a decline in revenue\nfrom its year-to-date peak level.\n                                                                                  \n  Earnings-at-risk                                                                \n                                                                                  \nThe effect of interest rate exposure on\nthe Firm\u2019s reported net income is\nimportant as interest rate risk\nrepresents one of the Firm\u2019s\nsignificant market risks. Interest rate\nrisk arises not only from trading\nactivities but also from the\n\nFirm\u2019s traditional banking activities,\nwhich include extension of loans and\ncredit facilities, taking deposits,\nissuing debt and the investment\nsecurities portfolio. Refer to the\ntable on page 134 for a summary by LOB\nand Corporate, identifying positions\nincluded in earnings-at-risk .\n\nThe CTC Risk Committee establishes the\nFirm\u2019s structural interest rate risk\npolicy and related limits, which are\nsubject to approval by the Board Risk\nCommittee. Treasury and CIO, working in\npartnership with the LOBs, calculates\nthe Firm\u2019s structural interest rate\nrisk profile and reviews it with senior\nmanagement, including the CTC Risk\nCommittee. In addition, oversight of\nstructural interest rate risk is\nmanaged through a dedicated risk\nfunction reporting to the CTC CRO. This\nrisk function is responsible for\nproviding independent oversight and\ngovernance around assumptions and\nestablishing and monitoring limits for\nstructural interest rate risk. The Firm\nmanages structural interest rate risk\ngenerally through its investment\nsecurities portfolio and interest rate\nderivatives.\n\nStructural interest rate risk can occur\ndue to a variety of factors, including:\n\n\u2022 Differences in timing among the\nmaturity or repricing of assets,\nliabilities and off-balance sheet\ninstruments\n\n\u2022 Differences in the amounts of assets,\nliabilities and off-balance sheet\ninstruments that are maturing or\nrepricing at the same time\n\n\u2022 Differences in the amounts by which\nshort-term and long-term market\ninterest rates change (for example,\nchanges in the slope of the yield\ncurve)\n\n\u2022 The impact of changes in the maturity\nof various assets, liabilities or off-\nbalance sheet instruments as interest\nrates change\n\nThe Firm manages interest rate exposure\nrelated to its assets and liabilities\non a consolidated, Firmwide basis.\nBusiness units transfer their interest\nrate risk to Treasury and CIO through\nfunds transfer pricing, which takes\ninto account the elements of interest\nrate exposure that can be risk-managed\nin financial markets. These elements\ninclude asset and liability balances\nand contractual rates of interest,\ncontractual principal payment\nschedules, expected prepayment\nexperience, interest rate reset dates\nand maturities, rate indices used for\nrepricing, and any interest rate\nceilings or floors for adjustable rate\nproducts.\n\nOne way the Firm evaluates its\nstructural interest rate risk is\nthrough earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-\nrisk estimates the Firm\u2019s interest rate\nexposure for a given interest rate\nscenario. It is presented as a\nsensitivity to a baseline, which\nincludes net interest income and\ncertain interest rate sensitive fees.\nThe baseline uses market interest rates\nand in the case of deposits, pricing\nassumptions. The Firm conducts\nsimulations of changes to this baseline\nfor interest rate-sensitive assets and\nliabilities denominated in U.S. dollars\nand other currencies (\u201cnon-U.S. dollar\u201d\ncurrencies). These simulations\nprimarily include retained loans,\ndeposits, deposits with banks,\ninvestment securities, long-\n                                              \n  138    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nterm debt and any related interest rate\nhedges, and funds transfer pricing of\nother positions in risk management VaR\nand other sensitivity-based measures as\ndescribed on page 134. Earnings-at-risk\nscenarios estimate the potential change\nto a net interest income baseline, over\nthe following 12 months utilizing\nmultiple assumptions. These scenarios\ninclude a parallel shift involving\nchanges to both short-term and long-\nterm rates by an equal amount; a\nsteeper yield curve involving holding\nshort-term rates constant and\nincreasing long-term rates; and a\nflatter yield curve involving\nincreasing short-term rates and holding\nlong-term rates constant. These\nscenarios consider many different\nfactors, including: \u2022 The impact on\nexposures as a result of instantaneous\nchanges in interest rates from baseline\nrates. \u2022 Forecasted balance sheet, as\nwell as modeled prepayment and\nreinvestment behavior, but exclude\nassumptions about actions that could be\ntaken by the Firm or its clients and\ncustomers in response to any such\ninstantaneous rate changes. Mortgage\nprepayment assumptions are based on the\ninterest rates used in the scenarios\ncompared with underlying contractual\nrates, the time since origination, and\nother factors which are updated\nperiodically based on historical\nexperience. Deposit forecasts used in\nthe baseline and scenarios do not\ninclude assumptions to account for the\nreversal of Quantitative Easing. \u2022 The\npricing sensitivity of deposits, known\nas deposit betas, represent the amount\nby which deposit rates paid could\nchange upon a given change in market\ninterest rates. The deposit rates paid\nin these scenarios differ from actual\ndeposit rates paid, due to repricing\nlags and other factors. The Firm\u2019s\nearnings-at-risk scenarios are\nperiodically evaluated and enhanced in\nresponse to changes in the composition\nof the Firm\u2019s balance sheet, changes in\nmarket conditions, improvements in the\nFirm\u2019s simulation and other factors.\nWhile a relevant measure of the Firm\u2019s\ninterest rate exposure, the earnings-\nat-risk analysis does not represent a\nforecast of the Firm\u2019s net interest\nincome (Refer to Outlook on page 49 for\nadditional information) .\n\nThe Firm\u2019s U.S. dollar sensitivities\nare presented in the table below.\n                                                            \n  December 31,                                              \n  (in billions)                                             \n  Parallel shift:                          2021       2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  +100 bps shift in rates               $   5.0    $   6.9  \n  Steeper yield curve:                                      \n  +100 bps shift in long-term rates         1.8        2.4  \n  Flatter yield curve:                                      \n  +100 bps shift in short-term rates        3.2        4.5  \n                                                            \nThe change in the Firm\u2019s U.S. dollar\nsensitivities as of December 31, 2021\ncompared to December 31, 2020 reflected\nupdates to the Firm\u2019s baseline for\nhigher rates as well as the impact of\nchanges in the Firm\u2019s balance sheet.\nThe Firm\u2019s sensitivity to rates is\nprimarily a result of assets repricing\nat a faster pace than deposits.

Country exposure\nincludes activity with both government\nand private-sector entities in a\ncountry.\n\nUnder the Firm\u2019s internal country risk\nmanagement approach, attribution of\nexposure to an individual country is\nbased on the country where the largest\nproportion of the assets of the\ncounterparty, issuer, obligor or\nguarantor are located or where the\nlargest proportion of its revenue is\nderived, which may be different than\nthe domicile (i.e. legal residence) or\ncountry of incorporation.\n\nIndividual country exposures reflect an\naggregation of the Firm\u2019s risk to an\nimmediate default, with zero recovery,\nof the counterparties, issuers,\nobligors or guarantors attributed to\nthat country. Activities which result\nin contingent or indirect exposure to a\ncountry are not included in the country\nexposure measure (for exa mple,\nproviding clearing services or\nsecondary exposure to collateral on\nsecurities financing receivables).\n\nAssumptions are sometimes required in\ndetermining the measurement and\nallocation of country exposure,\nparticularly in the case of certain\nnon-linear or index products, or where\nthe nature of the counterparty, issuer,\nobligor or guarantor is not suitable\nfor attribution to an\n\nindividual country. The use of\ndifferent measurement approaches or\nassumptions could affect the amount of\nreported country exposure.\n\nUnder the Firm\u2019s internal country risk\nmeasurement framework:\n\n\u2022 Lending exposures are measured at the\ntotal committed amount (funded and\nunfunded), net of the allowance for\ncredit losses and eligible cash and\nmarketable securities collateral\nreceived\n\n\u2022 Deposits are measured as the cash\nbalances placed with central and\ncommercial banks\n\n\u2022 Securities financing exposures are\nmeasured at their receivable balance,\nnet of eligible collateral received\n\n\u2022 Debt and equity securities are\nmeasured at the fair value of all\npositions, including both long and\nshort positions\n\n\u2022 Counterparty exposure on derivative\nreceivables is measured at the\nderivative\u2019s fair value, net of the\nfair value of the eligible collateral\nreceived\n\n\u2022 Credit derivatives protection\npurchased and sold is reported based on\nthe underlying reference entity and is\nmeasured at the notional amount of\nprotection purchased or sold, net of\nthe fair value of the recognized\nderivative receivable or payable.\nCredit derivatives protection purchased\nand sold in the Firm\u2019s market-making\nactivities is measured on a net basis,\nas such activities often result in\nselling and purchasing protection\nrelated to the same underlying\nreference entity; this reflects the\nmanner in which the Firm manages these\nexposures\n\nThe Firm\u2019s internal country risk\nreporting differs from the reporting\nprovided under the FFIEC bank\nregulatory requirements.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    141  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                            \n                                                                                  \nStress testing Stress testing is an important component of the Firm\u2019s country risk\nmanagement framework, which aims to estimate and limit losses arising from a\ncountry crisis by measuring the impact of adverse asset price movements to a\ncountry based on market shocks combined with counterparty specific assumptions.\nCountry Risk Management periodically designs and runs tailored stress scenarios to\ntest vulnerabilities to individual countries or sets of countries in response to\nspecific or potential market events, sector performance concerns, sovereign\nactions and geopolitical risks. These tailored stress results are used to inform\npotential risk reduction across the Firm, as necessary. COVID-19 Pandemic Country\nRisk Management continues to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on\nindividual countries. Risk reporting Country exposure and stress are measured and\nreported regularly, and used by Country Risk Management to identify trends, and\nmonitor high usages and breaches against limits. For country risk management\npurposes, the Firm may report exposure to jurisdictions that are not fully\nautonomous, including Special Administrative Regions (\u201cSAR\u201d) and dependent\nterritories, separately from the independent sovereign states with which they are\nassociated. The following table presents the Firm\u2019s top 20 exposures by country\n(excluding the U.S.) as of December 31, 2021, and their comparative exposures as\nof December 31, 2020. The selection of countries represents the Firm\u2019s largest\ntotal exposures by individual country, based on the Firm\u2019s internal country risk\nmanagement approach, and does not represent the Firm\u2019s view of any existing or\npotentially adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluct uate from\nperiod to period due to client activity and market flows. The decrease in exposure\nto Germany and the increase in exposure to the United Kingdom were primarily due\nto changes in cash placements with the central banks of those countries driven by\nbalance sheet and liquidity management activities in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nThe increase in exposure to Australia was due to increased cash placements with\nthe central bank of Australia, largely driven by client activity following\nmonetary policy decisions in the country and growth in client deposits.\n                                                                                  \n  Top                                                                             \n  20                                                                              \n  cou\u2026                                                                            \n  (ex\u2026                                                                            \n  the                                                                             \n  U.S\u2026                                                                            \n  Dec\u2026                                                                            \n  31,                Lend\u2026       Tra\u2026                                             \n  (in                  and        and                   Tot\u2026                Tot\u2026  \n  bil\u2026    2021       depo\u2026       inv\u2026       Othe\u2026       exp\u2026    2020\u2026       exp\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Uni\u2026            $   81.7    $  12.7    $    2.0    $  96.4             $  68.4  \n  Kin\u2026                                                                            \n  Ger\u2026                65.3       -4.2         0.6       61.7                127\u2026  \n  Jap\u2026                38.8        6.4         0.3       45.5                45.6  \n  Aus\u2026                29.2        9.9           \u2014       39.1                15.9  \n  Swi\u2026                14.7        1.4         4.8       20.9                18.7  \n  Chi\u2026                10.1        7.1         1.4       18.6                21.2  \n  Can\u2026                14.7        2.0         0.2       16.9                14.5  \n  Ind\u2026                 5.8        7.1         1.8       14.7                10.5  \n  Fra\u2026                11.0        2.0         1.0       14.0                18.8  \n  Sin\u2026                 6.8        4.6         0.9       12.3                 8.7  \n  Bra\u2026                 5.3        6.7           \u2014       12.0                10.8  \n  Lux\u2026                10.1        1.4           \u2014       11.5                12.4  \n  Spa\u2026                 9.2        0.9           \u2014       10.1                 5.8  \n  Sau\u2026                 6.9        2.2           \u2014        9.1                 5.8  \n  Ara\u2026                                                                            \n  Sou\u2026                 3.9        4.5         0.3        8.7                10.1  \n  Kor\u2026                                                                            \n  Ita\u2026                 6.2        1.8         0.4        8.4                 9.7  \n  Net\u2026                 5.5        0.7         0.6        6.8                 7.7  \n  Bel\u2026                 5.0        1.8           \u2014        6.8                 4.0  \n  Hong                                                                            \n  Kong                 3.6        2.0         0.3        5.9                 6.2  \n  SAR                                                                             \n  Mex\u2026                 4.3        0.6           \u2014        4.9                 4.9  \n                                                                                  \n(a) Country exposures presented in the\ntable reflect 89% and 90% of total\nFirmwide non-U.S. exposure, where\nexposure is attributed to an individual\ncountry, at December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.

Operational Risk includes\ncompliance, conduct, legal, and\nestimations and model risk. Operational\nrisk is inherent in the Firm\u2019s\nactivities and can manifest itself in\nvarious ways, including fraudulent\nacts, business disruptions (including\nthose caused by extraordinary events\nbeyond the Firm's control) cyber\nattacks, inappropriate employee\nbehavior, failure to comply with\napplicable laws, rules and regulations\nor failure of vendors or other third\nparty providers to perform in\naccordance with their agreements.\nOperational Risk Management attempts to\nmanage operational risk at appropriate\nlevels in light of the Firm\u2019s financial\nposition, the characteristics of its\nbusinesses, and the markets and\nregulatory environments in which it\noperates.\n                                                                                  \n   Operational Risk Management Framework                                          \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm\u2019s Compliance, Conduct, and\nOperational Risk (\u201cCCOR\u201d) Management\nFramework is designed to enable the\nFirm to govern, identify, measure,\nmonitor and test, manage and report on\nthe Firm\u2019s operational risk.\n\nOperational Risk Governance\n\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible\nfor the management of operational risk.\nThe Control Management Organization,\nwhich consists of control managers\nwithin each LOB and Corporate, is\nresponsible for the day-to-day\nexecution of the CCOR Framework and the\nevaluation of the effectiveness of\ntheir control environments to determine\nwhere targeted remediation efforts may\nbe required.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s Global Chief Compliance\nOfficer (\u201cCCO\u201d) and FRE for Operational\nRisk and Qualitative Risk Appetite is\nresponsible for defining the CCOR\nManagement Framework and establishing\nminimum standards for its execution.\nThe LOB and Corporate aligned CCOR Lead\nOfficers report to the Global CCO and\nFRE for Operational Risk and\nQualitative Risk Appetite and are\nindependent of the respective\nbusinesses or functions they oversee.\nThe CCOR Management Framework is\nincluded in the Risk Governance and\nOversight Policy that is reviewed and\napproved by the Board Risk Committee\nperiodically.\n\nOperational Risk Identification\n\nThe Firm utilizes a structured risk and\ncontrol self-assessment process that is\nexecuted by the LOBs and Corporate. As\npart of this process, the LOBs and\nCorporate evaluate the effectiveness of\ntheir control environment to assess\nwhere controls have failed, and to\ndetermine where remediation efforts may\nbe required. The Firm\u2019s Operational\nRisk and Compliance organization\n(\u201cOperational Risk and Compliance\u201d)\nprovides oversight of and challenge to\nthese evaluations and may also perform\nindependent assessments of significant\noperational risk events and areas of\nconcentrated or emerging risk.\n\nOperational Risk Measurement\n\nOperational Risk and Compliance\nperforms an independent assessment of\nthe operational risks inherent within\nthe LOBs and Corporate, which includes\nevaluating the effectiveness of the\ncontrol environments and reporting the\nresults to senior management.\n\nIn addition, Operational Risk and\nCompliance assesses operational risks\nthrough quantitative means, including\noperational risk-based capital and\nestimation of operational risk losses\nunder both baseline and stressed\nconditions.\n\nThe primary component of the\noperational risk capital estimate is\nthe Loss Distribution Approach (\u201cLDA\u201d)\nstatistical model, which simulates the\nfrequency and severity of future\noperational risk loss projections based\non historical data. The LDA model is\nused to estimate an aggregate\noperational risk loss over a one-year\ntime horizon, at a 99.9% confidence\nlevel. The LDA model incorporates\nactual internal operational risk losses\nin the quarter following the period in\nwhich those losses were realized, and\nthe calculation generally continues to\nreflect such losses even after the\nissues or business activities giving\nrise to the losses have been remediated\nor reduced.\n\nAs required under the Basel III capital\nframework, the Firm\u2019s operational risk-\nbased capital methodology, which uses\nthe Advanced Measurement Approach\n(\u201cAMA\u201d), incorporates internal and\nexternal losses as well as management\u2019s\nview of tail risk captured through\noperational risk scenario analysis, and\nevaluation of key business environment\nand internal control metrics. The Firm\ndoes not reflect the impact of\ninsurance in its AMA estimate of\noperational risk capital.\n\nThe Firm considers the impact of\nstressed economic conditions on\noperational risk losses and develops a\nforward looking view of material\noperational risk events that may occur\nin a stressed environment. The Firm\u2019s\noperational risk stress testing\nframework is utilized in calculating\nresults for the Firm\u2019s CCAR and other\nstress testing processes.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on\npages 86-96 for information related to\noperational risk RWA, and CCAR.\n\nOperational Risk Monitoring and testing\n\nThe results of risk assessments\nperformed by Operational Risk and\nCompliance are leveraged as one of the\nkey criteria in the independent\nmonitoring and testing of the LOBs and\nCorporate\u2019s compliance with laws, rules\nand regulation. Through monitoring and\ntesting, Operational Risk and\nCompliance independently identify areas\nof heightened operational risk and\ntests the effectiveness of controls\nwithin the LOBs and Corporate.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    143  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                            \n                                                                                  \nManagement of Operational Risk\n\nThe operational risk areas or issues\nidentified through monitoring and\ntesting are escalated to the LOBs and\nCorporate to be remediated through\naction plans, as needed, to mitigate\noperational risk. Operational Risk and\nCompliance may advise the LOBs and\nCorporate in the development and\nimplementation of action plans.\n\nOperational Risk Reporting\n\nEscalation of risks is a fundamental\nexpectation for employees at the Firm.\nRisks identified by Operational Risk\nand Compliance are escalated to the\nappropriate LOB and Corporate Control\nCommittees, as needed. Operational Risk\nand Compliance has established\nstandards to ensure that consistent\noperational risk reporting and\noperational risk reports are produced\non a Firmwide basis as well as by the\nLOBs and Corporate. Reporting includes\nthe evaluation of key risk and\nperformance indicators against\nestablished thresholds as well as the\nassessment of different types of\noperational risk against stated risk\nappetite. The standards reinforce\nescalation protocols to senior\nmanagement and to the Board of\nDirectors.\n                                                                                  \n  Subcategories and examples of operational risks                                 \n                                                                                  \nOperational risk can manifest itself in\nvarious ways. Operational risk\nsubcategories such as Compliance risk,\nConduct risk, Legal risk, and\nEstimations and Model risk as well as\nother operational risks, can lead to\nlosses which are captured through the\nFirm\u2019s operational risk measurement\nprocesses. Refer to pages 146, 147, 148\nand 149, respectively for more\ninformation on Compliance, Conduct,\nLegal, and Estimations and Model risk.\nDetails on other select examples of\noperational risks are provided below.\n\nCybersecurity risk\n\nCybersecurity risk is the risk of the\nFirm\u2019s exposure to harm or loss\nresulting from misuse or abuse of\ntechnology by malicious actors.\nCybersecurity risk is an important and\ncontinuously evolving focus for the\nFirm. Significant resources are devoted\nto protecting and enhancing the\nsecurity of computer systems, software,\nnetworks, storage devices, and other\ntechnology assets. The Firm\u2019s security\nefforts are designed to protect\nagainst, among other things,\ncybersecurity attacks by unauthorized\nparties attempting to obtain access to\nconfidential information, destroy data,\ndisrupt or degrade service, sabotage\nsystems or cause other damage.\n\nOngoing business expansions may expose\nthe Firm to potential new threats as\nwell as expanded regulatory scrutiny\nincluding the introduction of new\ncybersecurity requirements. The Firm\ncontinues to make significant\ninvestments in enhancing its cyber\ndefense capabilities and to strengthen\nits partnerships with the appropriate\ngovernment and law enforcement agencies\nand other businesses in order to\nunderstand the full spectrum of\ncybersecurity risks in the operating\nenvironment, enhance defenses and\nimprove resiliency against\ncybersecurity threats. The Firm\nactively participates in discussions\nand simulations of cybersecurity risks\nboth internally and with\n\nlaw enforcement, government officials,\npeer and industry groups, and has\nsignificantly increased efforts to\neducate employees and certain clients\non the topic of cybersecurity risks.\n\nThird parties with which the Firm does\nbusiness or that facilitate the Firm\u2019s\nbusiness activities (e.g., vendors,\nsupply chain, exchanges, clearing\nhouses, central depositories, and\nfinancial intermediaries) are also\nsources of cybersecurity risk to the\nFirm. Third party cybersecurity\nincidents such as system breakdowns or\nfailures, misconduct by the employees\nof such parties, or cyberattacks,\nincluding ransomware and supply-chain\ncompromises could affect their ability\nto deliver a product or service to the\nFirm or result in lost or compromised\ninformation of the Firm or its clients.\nClients are also sources of\ncybersecurity risk to the Firm and its\ninformation assets, particularly when\ntheir activities and systems are beyond\nthe Firm\u2019s own security and control\nsystems. As a result, the Firm engages\nin regular and ongoing discussions with\ncertain vendors and clients regarding\ncybersecurity risks and opportunities\nto improve security. However, where\ncybersecurity incidents occur as a\nresult of client failures to maintain\nthe security of their own systems and\nprocesses, clients are responsible for\nlosses incurred.\n\nTo protect the confidentiality,\nintegrity and availability of the\nFirm\u2019s infrastructure, resources and\ninformation, the Firm maintains a\ncybersecurity program designed to\nprevent, detect, and respond to\ncyberattacks. The Audit Committee is\nperiodically provided with updates on\nthe Firm\u2019s Information Security\nProgram, recommended changes,\ncybersecurity policies and practices,\nongoing efforts to improve security, as\nwell as its efforts regarding\nsignificant cybersecurity events. In\naddition, the Firm has a cybersecurity\nincident response plan (\u201cIRP\u201d) designed\nto enable the Firm to respond to\nattempted cybersecurity incidents,\ncoordinate such responses with law\nenforcement and other government\nagencies, and notify clients and\ncustomers, as applicable. Among other\nkey focus areas, the IRP is designed to\nmitigate the risk of insider trading\nconnected to a cybersecurity incident,\nand includes various escalation points.\n\nDue to the impact of the COVID-19\npandemic, the Firm increased the use of\nremote access and video conferencing\nsolutions provided by third parties to\nfacilitate remote work. As a result the\nFirm deployed additional precautionary\nmeasures and controls to mitigate\ncybersecurity risks and those measures\nand controls remain in place.\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Technology\nControl functions are responsible for\ngovernance and oversight of the Firm\u2019s\nInformation Security Program. In\npartnership with the Firm\u2019s LOBs and\nCorporate, the Cybersecurity and\nTechnology Control organization\nidentifies information security risk\nissues and oversees programs for the\ntechnological protection of the Firm\u2019s\ninformation resources including\napplications, infrastructure as well as\nconfidential\n                                              \n  144    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nand personal information related to the\nFirm\u2019s employees and customers.

These\nforums are established at multiple\nlevels throughout the Firm and include\nrepresentatives from each LOB and\nCorporate. The forums are used to\nescalate information security risks or\nother matters as appropriate.\n\nThe IRM function provides oversight of\nthe activities designed to identify,\nassess, measure, and mitigate\ncybersecurity risk.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s Security Awareness Program\nincludes training that reinforces the\nFirm's Information Technology Risk and\nSecurity Management policies, standards\nand practices, as well as the\nexpectation that employees comply with\nthese policies. The Security Awareness\nProgram engages personnel through\ntraining on how to identify potential\ncybersecurity risks and protect the\nFirm\u2019s resources and information. This\ntraining is mandatory for all employees\nglobally on a periodic basis, and it is\nsupplemented by Firmwide testing\ninitiatives, including periodic\nphishing tests. The Firm provides\nspecialized security training for\ncertain employee roles such as\napplication developers. Finally, the\nFirm\u2019s Global Privacy Program requires\nall employees to take periodic\nawareness training on data privacy.\nThis privacy-focused training includes\ninformation about confidentiality and\nsecurity, as well as responding to\nunauthorized access to or use of\ninformation.\n\nBusiness and technology resiliency risk\n\nDisruptions can occur due to forces\nbeyond the Firm\u2019s control such as the\nspread of infectious diseases or\npandemics, severe weather, power or\ntelecommunications loss, failure of a\nthird party to provide expected\nservices, cyberattacks and, terrorism.\nThe Firmwide Business Resiliency\nProgram is designed to enable the Firm\nto prepare for, adapt to, withstand and\nrecover from business disruptions\nincluding occurrence of an\nextraordinary event beyond its control\nthat may impact critical business\nfunctions and supporting assets (i.e.,\nstaff, technology, facilities and third\nparties). The program includes\ngovernance, awareness training,\nplanning and testing of recovery\nstrategies, as well as strategic and\ntactical initiatives to identify,\nassess, and manage business\ninterruption and public safety risks.\n\nPayment fraud risk\n\nPayment fraud risk is the risk of\nexternal and internal parties\nunlawfully obtaining personal monetary\nbenefit through misdirected or\notherwise improper payment. The risk of\npayment fraud normalized in 2021 since\nthe heightened levels experienced\nduring earlier stages of the COVID-19\npandemic. The Firm continues to employ\nvarious controls for managing payment\nfraud risk as well as providing\nemployee and client education and\nawareness trainings.\n\nThird-party outsourcing risk\n\nThe Firm\u2018s Third-Party Oversight\n(\u201cTPO\u201d) and Inter-affiliates Oversight\n(\u201cIAO\u201d) frameworks assist the LOBs and\nCorporate in selecting, documenting,\nonboarding, monitoring and managing\ntheir supplier relationships including\nservices provided by affiliates. The\nobjectives of the TPO framework are to\nhold suppliers and other third parties\nto a high level of operational\nperformance and to mitigate key risks,\nincluding data loss and business\ndisruptions. The Corporate Third-Party\nOversight group is responsible for\nFirmwide training, monitoring,\nreporting and standards.\n                                                                                  \n  Insurance                                                                       \n                                                                                  \nOne of the ways in which operational\nrisk may be mitigated is through\ninsurance maintained by the Firm.

The estimation methods\nare of varying levels of sophistication\nand are used for many purposes, such as\nthe valuation of positions and\nmeasurement of risk, assessing\nregulatory capital requirements,\nconducting stress testing, evaluating\nthe allowance for credit losses and\nmaking business decisions. A dedicated\nindependent function, Model Risk\nGovernance and Review (\u201cMRGR\u201d), defines\nand governs the Firm\u2019s policies\nrelating to the management of model\nrisk and risks associated with certain\nanalytical and judgment-based\nestimations, such as those used in risk\nmanagement, budget forecasting and\ncapital planning and analysis.\n\nThe governance of analytical and\njudgment-based estimations within\nMRGR\u2019s scope follows a consistent\napproach which is used for models, as\ndescribed in detail below.\n\nModel risks are owned by the users of\nthe models within the Firm based on the\nspecific purposes of such models. Users\nand developers of models are\nresponsible for developing,\nimplementing and testing their models,\nas well as referring models to the MRGR\nfor review and approval. Once models\nhave been approved, model users and\ndevelopers are responsible for\nmaintaining a robust operating\nenvironment, and must monitor and\nevaluate the performance of the models\non an ongoing basis. Model users and\ndevelopers may seek to enhance models\nin response to changes in the\nportfolios and in product and market\ndevelopments, as well as to capture\nimprovements in available modeling\ntechniques and systems capabilities.\n\nModels are tiered based on an internal\nstandard according to their complexity,\nthe exposure associated with the model\nand the Firm\u2019s reliance on the model.\nThis tiering is subject to the approval\nof the MRGR. In its review of a model,\nthe MRGR considers whether the model is\nsuitable for the specific purposes for\nwhich it will be used. When reviewing a\nmodel, the MRGR analyzes and challenges\nthe model methodology and the\nreasonableness of model assumptions,\nand may perform or require additional\ntesting, including back-testing of\nmodel outcomes. Model reviews are\napproved by the appropriate level of\nmanagement within the MRGR based on the\nrelevant model tier.\n\nUnder the Firm\u2019s Estimations and Model\nRisk Management Policy, the MRGR\nreviews and approves new models, as\nwell as material changes to existing\nmodels, prior to their use. In certain\ncircumstances exceptions may be granted\nto the Firm\u2019s policy to allow a model\nto be used prior to review or approval.\nThe MRGR may also require the user to\ntake appropriate actions to mitigate\nthe model risk if it is to be used in\nthe interim. These actions will depend\non the model and may include, for\nexample, limitation of trading\nactivity.\n\nWhile models are inherently imprecise,\nthe degree of imprecision or\nuncertainty can be heightened by the\nmarket or economic environment. This is\nparticularly true when the current and\nforecasted environment is significantly\ndifferent from the historical\nmacroeconomic environments upon which\nthe models were trained, as the Firm\nexperienced during the early stages of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. This uncertainty\nmay necessitate a greater degree of\njudgment and analytics to inform\nadjustments to model outputs than in\ntypical periods.\n\nRefer to Critical Accounting Estimates\nUsed by the Firm on pages 150-153 and\nNote 2 for a summary of model-based\nvaluations and other valuation\ntechniques.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    149  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                  \n  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM  \n                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s accounting policies\nand use of estimates are integral to\nunderstanding its reported results.

The\nallowance for credit losses comprises:\n\n\u2022 The allowance for loan losses, which\ncovers the Firm\u2019s retained loan\nportfolios (scored and risk-rated),\n\n\u2022 The allowance for lending-related\ncommitments, and\n\n\u2022 The allowance for credit losses on\ninvestment securities.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses\ninvolves significant judgment on a\nnumber of matters including development\nand weighting of macroeconomic\nforecasts, incorporation of historical\nloss experience, assessment of risk\ncharacteristics, assignment of risk\nratings, valuation of collateral, and\nthe determination of remaining expected\nlife. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for\nfurther information on these judgments\nas well as the Firm\u2019s policies and\nmethodologies used to determine the\nFirm\u2019s allowance for credit losses.\n\nOne of the most significant judgments\ninvolved in estimating the Firm\u2019s\nallowance for credit losses relates to\nthe macroeconomic forecasts used to\nestimate credit losses over the eight-\nquarter forecast period within the\nFirm\u2019s methodology. The eight-quarter\nforecast incorporates hundreds of MEVs\nthat are relevant for exposures across\nthe Firm, with modeled credit losses\nbeing driven primarily by a subset of\nless than twenty variables. The\nspecific variables that have the\ngreatest effect on the modeled losses\nof each portfolio vary by portfolio and\ngeography.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio\ninclude U.S. unemployment, HPI and U.S.\nreal GDP.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio\ninclude U.S. real GDP, U.S.\nunemployment, U.S. equity prices,\ncorporate credit spreads, oil prices,\ncommercial real estate prices and HPI.\n\nChanges in the Firm\u2019s assumptions and\nforecasts of economic conditions could\nsignificantly affect its estimate of\nexpected credit losses in the portfolio\nat the balance sheet date or lead to\nsignificant changes in the estimate\nfrom one reporting period to the next.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses\nis estimated using a weighted average\nof five internally developed\nmacroeconomic scenarios. As of December\n31, 2021, the Firm assigned more\nbalanced weightings to both its adverse\nand upside scenarios compared to the\nsignificant weighting that the Firm\nplaced on its adverse scenarios as of\nDecember 31, 2020, reflecting the\nsustained improvement and resilience of\nthe macroeconomic environment, despite\nthe ongoing impact of the COVID-19\npandemic. In addition, because the\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic and\ngovernmental actions taken in response\nto the pandemic caused a dislocation in\ncertain historical relationships used\nfor modeling credit loss estimates, the\nFirm continues to place reliance on\nmanagement judgment and make\nadjustments specific to that\ndislocation, although to a lesser\nextent than in 2020. The allowance for\ncredit losses of $18.7 billion reflects\nremaining uncertainties, including the\npotential impact that additional waves\nor variants of COVID-19 may have on the\npace of economic growth and near-term\nsupply chain disruptions.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate how\npotential changes in any one factor or\ninput might affect the overall\nallowance for credit losses because\nmanagement considers a wide variety of\nfactors and inputs in estimating the\nallowance for credit losses. Changes in\nthe factors and inputs considered may\nnot occur at the same rate and may not\nbe consistent across all geographies or\nproduct types, and changes in factors\nand inputs may be directionally\ninconsistent, such that improvement in\none factor or input may offset\ndeterioration in others.\n\nTo consider the impact of a\nhypothetical alternate macroeconomic\nforecast, the Firm compared the modeled\ncredit losses determined using its\ncentral and relative adverse\nmacroeconomic scenarios, which are two\nof the five scenarios considered in\nestimating the allowances for loan\nlosses and lending-related commitments.\nThe central and relative adverse\nscenarios each included a full suite of\nMEVs, but differed in the levels, paths\nand peaks/troughs of those variables\nover the eight-quarter forecast period.\n\nFor example, compared to the Firm\u2019s\ncentral scenario shown on page 129 and\nin Note 13, the Firm\u2019s relative adverse\nscenario assumes a significantly\nelevated U.S. unemployment rate,\naveraging approximately 2.8% higher\nover the eight-quarter forecast, with a\npeak difference of approximately 4.4%\nin the second quarter of 2022; lower\nU.S. real GDP with a slower recovery,\nremaining nearly\n                                              \n  150    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n3.2% lower at the end of the eight-\nquarter forecast, with a peak\ndifference of approximately 6.5% in the\nsecond quarter of 2022; and lower\nnational HPI with a peak difference of\nnearly 15.8% in the second quarter of\n2023. This analysis is not intended to\nestimate expected future changes in the\nallowance for credit losses as the\nimpacts of changes in many MEVs are\nboth interrelated and nonlinear, so the\nresults of this analysis cannot be\nsimply extrapolated for more severe\nchanges in macroeconomic variables.\nAdditionally, expectations of future\nchanges in portfolio composition and\nborrower behavior can significantly\naffect the allowance for credit losses.\nTo demonstrate the sensitivity of\ncredit loss estimates to macroeconomic\nforecasts as of December 31, 2021, the\nFirm compared the modeled estimates\nunder its relative adverse scenario to\nits central scenario. Without\nconsidering offsetting or correlated\neffects in other qualitative components\nof the Firm\u2019s allowance for credit\nlosses, the comparison between these\ntwo scenarios for the lending exposures\nbelow reflect the following\ndifferences: \u2022 An increase of\napproximately $550 million for\nresidential real estate loans and\nlending-related commitments \u2022 An\nincrease of approximately $2.6 billion\nfor credit card loans \u2022 An increase of\napproximately $3.0 billion for\nwholesale loans and lending-related\ncommitments This analysis relates only\nto the modeled credit loss estimates\nand is not intended to estimate changes\nin the overall allowance for credit\nlosses as it does not reflect any\npotential changes in other adjustments\nto the quantitative calculation, which\nwould also be influenced by the\njudgment management applies to the\nmodeled lifetime loss estimates to\nreflect the uncertainty and imprecision\nof these modeled lifetime loss\nestimates based on then-current\ncircumstances and conditions.\nRecognizing that forecasts of\nmacroeconomic conditions are inherently\nuncertain, particularly in light of the\nrecent economic conditions, the Firm\nbelieves that its process to consider\nthe available information and\nassociated risks and uncertainties is\nappropriately governed and that its\nestimates of expected credit losses\nwere reasonable and appropriate for the\nperiod ended December 31, 2021 .

The level 3 balances would\nbe reduced if netting were applied,\nincluding the netting benefit\nassociated with cash collateral.\nValuation Details of the Firm\u2019s\nprocesses for determining fair value\nare set out in Note 2. Estimating fair\nvalue requires the application of\njudgment. The type and level of\njudgment required is largely dependent\non the amount of observable market\ninformation available to the Firm. For\ninstruments valued using internally\ndeveloped valuation models and other\nvaluation techniques that use\nsignificant unobservable inputs and are\ntherefore classified within level 3 of\nthe fair value hierarchy, judgments\nused to estimate fair value are more\nsignificant than those required when\nestimating the fair value of\ninstruments classified within levels 1\nand 2. In arriving at an estimate of\nfair value for an instrument within\nlevel 3, management must first\ndetermine the appropriate valuation\nmodel or other valuation technique to\nuse. Second, the lack of observability\nof certain significant inputs requires\nmanagement to assess relevant empirical\ndata in deriving valuation inputs\nincluding, for example, transaction\ndetails, yield curves, interest rates,\nprepayment speed, default rates,\nvolatilities, correlations, prices\n(such as commodity, equity or debt\nprices), valuations of comparable\ninstruments, foreign exchange rates and\ncredit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a\nfurther discussion of the valuation of\nlevel 3 instruments, including\nunobservable inputs used.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    151  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                            \n                                                                                  \nFor instruments classified in levels 2\nand 3, management judgment must be\napplied to assess the appropriate level\nof valuation adjustments to reflect\ncounterparty credit quality, the Firm\u2019s\ncreditworthiness, market funding rates,\nliquidity considerations, unobservable\nparameters, and for portfolios that\nmeet specified criteria, the size of\nthe net open risk position. The\njudgments made are typically affected\nby the type of product and its specific\ncontractual terms, and the level of\nliquidity for the product or within the\nmarket as a whole. In periods of\nheightened market volatility and\nuncertainty judgments are further\naffected by the wider variation of\nreasonable valuation estimates,\nparticularly for positions that are\nless liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a\nfurther discussion of valuation\nadjustments applied by the Firm.\n\nImprecision in estimating unobservable\nmarket inputs or other factors can\naffect the amount of gain or loss\nrecorded for a particular position.\nFurthermore, while the Firm believes\nits valuation methods are appropriate\nand consistent with those of other\nmarket participants, the methods and\nassumptions used reflect management\njudgment and may vary across the Firm\u2019s\nbusinesses and portfolios.\n\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and\nassumptions in the determination of\nfair value. The use of methodologies or\nassumptions different than those used\nby the Firm could result in a different\nestimate of fair value at the reporting\ndate. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed\ndiscussion of the Firm\u2019s valuation\nprocess and hierarchy, and its\ndetermination of fair value for\nindividual financial instruments.\n                                                                                  \n  Goodwill impairment                                                             \n                                                                                  \nUnder U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be\nallocated to reporting units and tested\nfor impairment at least annually. The\nFirm\u2019s process and methodology used to\nconduct goodwill impairment testing is\ndescribed in Note 15.\n\nManagement applies significant judgment\nwhen testing goodwill for impairment.\nThe goodwill associated with each\nbusiness combination is allocated to\nthe related reporting units for\ngoodwill impairment testing.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021,\nthe Firm reviewed current economic\nconditions, including the potential\nimpacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on\nbusiness performance, estimated market\ncost of equity, as well as actual\nbusiness results and projections of\nbusiness performance for its reporting\nunits. The Firm has concluded that the\ngoodwill allocated to its reporting\nunits was not impaired as of December\n31, 2021. For each of the reporting\nunits, fair value exceeded carrying\nvalue by at least 10% and there was no\nindication of a significant risk of\ngoodwill impairment based on current\nprojections and valuations.\n\nThe projections for the Firm\u2019s\nreporting units are consistent with\nmanagement\u2019s current business outlook\nassumptions in the short term, and the\nFirm\u2019s best estimates of long-term\ngrowth and return on equity in the\nlonger term. Where possible, the Firm\nuses third-party and peer data to\nbenchmark its assumptions and\nestimates.\n\nRefer to Note 15 for additional\ninformation on goodwill, including the\ngoodwill impairment assessment as of\nDecember 31, 2021.\n                                                                                  \n  Credit card rewards liability                                                   \n                                                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase offers credit cards with\nvarious rewards programs which allow\ncardholders to earn rewards points\nbased on their account activity and the\nterms and conditions of the rewards\nprogram. Generally, there are no limits\non the points that an eligible\ncardholder can earn, nor do the points\nexpire, and the points can be redeemed\nfor a variety of rewards, including\ncash (predominantly in the form of\naccount credits), gift cards and\ntravel. The Firm maintains a rewards\nliability which represents the\nestimated cost of rewards points earned\nand expected to be redeemed by\ncardholders. The liability is accrued\nas the cardholder earns the benefit and\nis reduced when the cardholder redeems\npoints. This liability was $9.8 billion\nand $7.7 billion at December 31, 2021\nand 2020, respectively, and is recorded\nin accounts payable and other\nliabilities on the Consolidated balance\nsheets. The increase in the liability\nwas driven by continued growth in\nrewards points earned on increased\nspend and promotional offers outpacing\nredemptions throughout 2021, and to a\nlesser extent adjustments to redemption\nrate assumptions.\n\nThe rewards liability is sensitive to\nredemption rate (\u201cRR\u201d) and cost per\npoint (\u201cCPP\u201d) assumptions. The RR\nassumption is used to estimate the\nnumber of points earned by customers\nthat will be redeemed over the life of\nthe account. The CPP assumption is used\nto estimate the cost of future point\nredemptions. These assumptions are\nevaluated periodically considering\nhistorical actuals, cardholder\nredemption behavior and management\njudgment. Updates to these assumptions\nwill impact the rewards liability. As\nof December 31, 2021, a combined\nincrease of 25 basis points in RR and 1\nbasis point in CPP would increase the\nrewards liability by approximately $265\nmillion.\n                                                                                  \n  Income taxes                                                                    \n                                                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase is subject to the income\ntax laws of the various jurisdictions\nin which it operates, including U.S.\nfederal, state and local, and non-U.S.\njurisdictions. These laws are often\ncomplex and may be subject to different\ninterpretations. To determine the\nfinancial statement impact of\naccounting for income taxes, including\nthe provision for income tax expense\nand unrecognized tax benefits, JPMorgan\nChase must make assumptions and\njudgments about how to interpret and\napply these complex tax laws to\nnumerous transactions and business\nevents, as well as make judgments\nregarding the timing of when certain\nitems may affect taxable income in the\nU.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s interpretations of tax\nlaws around the world are subject to\nreview and examination by the various\ntaxing authorities in the jurisdictions\nwhere the Firm operates, and disputes\nmay occur regarding its view on a tax\nposition. These disputes over\ninterpretations with the various taxing\nauthorities may be settled by audit,\nadministrative appeals or adjudication\nin the court systems\n                                              \n  152    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nof the tax jurisdictions in which the\nFirm operates. JPMorgan Chase regularly\nreviews whether it may be assessed\nadditional income taxes as a result of\nthe resolution of these matters, and\nthe Firm records additional\nunrecognized tax benefits, as\nappropriate. In addition, the Firm may\nrevise its estimate of income taxes due\nto changes in income tax laws, legal\ninterpretations, and business\nstrategies. It is possible that\nrevisions in the Firm\u2019s estimate of\nincome taxes may materially affect the\nFirm\u2019s results of operations in any\nreporting period.\n\nDeferred taxes arise from differences\nbetween assets and liabilities measured\nfor financial reporting versus income\ntax return purposes. Deferred tax\nassets are recognized if, in\nmanagement\u2019s judgment, their\nrealizability is determined to be more\nlikely than not . Deferred taxes are\nmeasured using enacted tax rates\nexpected to apply to taxable income in\nthe years in which those temporary\ndifferences are expected to be\nrecovered or settled. The effect on\ndeferred taxes of a change in tax rates\nis recognized within the provision for\nincome taxes in the period enacted.\n\nThe Firm has also recognized deferred\ntax assets in connection with certain\ntax attributes, including net operating\nloss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards and foreign\ntax credit (\u201cFTC\u201d) carryforwards. The\nFirm performs regular reviews to\nascertain whether its deferred tax\nassets are realizable. These reviews\ninclude management\u2019s estimates and\nassumptions regarding future taxable\nincome , including foreign source\nincome, and may incorporate various tax\nplanning strategies, including\nstrategies that may be available to\nutilize NOLs and FTCs before they\nexpire. In connection with these\nreviews, if it is determined that a\ndeferred tax asset is not realizable, a\nvaluation allowance is established. The\nvaluation allowance may be reversed in\na subsequent reporting period if the\nFirm determines that, based on revised\nestimates of future taxable income or\nchanges in tax planning strategies, it\nis more likely than not that all or\npart of the deferred tax asset will\nbecome realizable. As of December 31,\n2021, management has determined it is\nmore likely than not that the Firm will\nrealize its deferred tax assets, net of\nthe existing valuation allowance.\n\nThe Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax\nbenefits as necessary when new\ninformation becomes available,\nincluding changes in tax law and\nregulations, and interactions with\ntaxing authorities. Uncertain tax\npositions that meet the more-likely-\nthan-not recognition threshold are\nmeasured to determine the amount of\nbenefit to recognize. An uncertain tax\nposition is measured at the largest\namount of benefit that management\nbelieves is more likely than not to be\nrealized upon settlement. It is\npossible that the reassessment of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s unrecognized tax\nbenefits may have a material impact on\nits effective income tax rate in the\nperiod in which the reassessment\noccurs. Although the Firm believes that\nits estimates are reasonable, the final\ntax amount could be different from the\namounts reflected in the Firm\u2019s income\ntax provisions and accruals. To the\nextent that the final outcome of these\n\namounts is different than the amounts\nrecorded, such differences will\ngenerally impact the Firm\u2019s provision\nfor income taxes in the period in which\nsuch a determination is made.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s provision for income taxes\nis composed of current and deferred\ntaxes. The current and deferred tax\nprovisions are calculated based on\nestimates and assumptions that could\ndiffer from the actual results\nreflected in income tax returns filed\nduring the subsequent year. Adjustments\nbased on filed returns are generally\nrecorded in the period when the tax\nreturns are filed and the global tax\nimplications are known, which could\nimpact the Firm\u2019s effective tax rate.\n\nRefer to Note 25 for additional\ninformation on income taxes.\n                                                                                  \n  Litigation reserves                                                             \n                                                                                  \nRefer to Note 30 for a description of\nthe significant estimates and judgments\nassociated with establishing litigation\nreserves.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    153  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                            \n                                                                                  \n                                         \n  ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS  \n                                         \n                                                                                  \n  Financial Accounting                                                            \n  Standards Board                                                                 \n  (\u201cFASB\u201d) Standards                                                              \n  Adopted since January                                                           \n  1, 2021                                                                         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Standard                   Summary of guidance        Effects on financial      \n                                                        statements                \n                             \u2022Provides optional                                   \n                             expedients and                                       \n                             exceptions to current                                \n                             accounting guidance                                  \n                             when financial                                       \n                             instruments, hedge                                   \n                             accounting                                           \n                             relationships, and                                   \n                             other transactions are                               \n                             amended due to                                       \n                             reference rate reform.                               \n                             \u2022Provides an election                                \n                             to account for certain     \u2022Issued and effective     \n                             contract amendments        March 12, 2020.

The portfolio-based\ncomponent of the Firm\u2019s allowance for\nloan losses for the wholesale and\ncredit card retained loan portfolios\nbegins with a quantitative calculation\nof expected credit losses over the\nexpected life of the loan by applying\ncredit loss factors to the estimated\nexposure at default. The credit loss\nfactors applied are determined based on\nthe weighted average of five internally\ndeveloped macroeconomic scenarios that\ntake into consideration the Firm's\neconomic outlook as derived through\nforecast macroeconomic variables, the\nmost significant of which are U.S.\nunemployment and U.S. real gross\ndomestic product. This quantitative\ncalculation is further adjusted to take\ninto consideration model imprecision,\nemerging risk assessments, trends and\nother subjective factors that are not\nyet otherwise reflected in the credit\nloss estimate.\n\nThe principal considerations for our\ndetermination that performing\nprocedures relating to the allowance\nfor loan losses for the portfolio-based\ncomponent of the wholesale and credit\ncard loan portfolios is a critical\naudit matter are (i) the significant\njudgment and estimation by management\nin the forecast of macroeconomic\nvariables, specifically U.S.\nunemployment and U.S. real gross\ndomestic product, as the Firm\u2019s\nforecasts of economic conditions\nsignificantly affect its estimate of\nexpected credit losses at the balance\nsheet date, (ii) the significant\njudgment and estimation by management\nin determining the quantitative\ncalculation utilized in their credit\nloss estimates and the adjustments to\ntake into consideration model\nimprecision, emerging risk assessments,\ntrends and other subjective factors\nthat are not yet otherwise reflected in\nthe credit loss estimate, which both in\nturn led to a high degree of auditor\njudgment, subjectivity and effort in\nperforming procedures and in\n\nevaluating audit evidence obtained\nrelating to the credit loss estimates\nand the appropriateness of the\nadjustments to the credit loss\nestimates, and (iii) the audit effort\ninvolved the use of professionals with\nspecialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved\nperforming procedures and evaluating\naudit evidence in connection with\nforming our overall opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nThese procedures included testing the\neffectiveness of controls relating to\nthe Firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses,\nincluding controls over model\nvalidation and generation of\nmacroeconomic scenarios. These\nprocedures also included, among others,\ntesting management\u2019s process for\nestimating the allowance for loan\nlosses, which involved (i) evaluating\nthe appropriateness of the models and\nmethodologies used in quantitative\ncalculations; (ii) evaluating the\nreasonableness of forecasts of U.S.\nunemployment and U.S. real gross\ndomestic product; (iii) testing the\ncompleteness and accuracy of data used\nin the estimate; and (iv) evaluating\nthe reasonableness of management\u2019s\nadjustments to the quantitative output\nfor the impacts of model imprecision,\nemerging risk assessments, trends and\nother subjective factors that are not\nyet otherwise reflected in the credit\nloss estimate. These procedures also\nincluded the use of professionals with\nspecialized skill and knowledge to\nassist in evaluating the\nappropriateness of certain models,\nmethodologies and macroeconomic\nvariables .\n\nFair Value of Certain Level 3 Financial\nInstruments\n\nAs described in Notes 2 and 3 to the\nconsolidated financial statements, the\nFirm carries $1.2 trillion of its\nassets and $403.1 billion of its\nliabilities at fair value on a\nrecurring basis. Included in these\nbalances are $9.6 billion of trading\nassets and $41.5 billion of liabilities\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring\nbasis, collectively financial\ninstruments, which are classified as\nlevel 3 as they contain one or more\ninputs to valuation which are\nunobservable and significant to their\nfair value measurement. The Firm\nutilized internally developed valuation\nmodels and unobservable inputs to\nestimate fair value of the level 3\nfinancial instruments. The unobservable\ninputs used by management to estimate\nthe fair value of certain of these\nfinancial instruments include forward\nequity prices, volatility relating to\ninterest rates and equity prices and\ncorrelation relating to interest rates,\nequity prices, credit and foreign\nexchange rates.\n\nThe principal considerations for our\ndetermination that performing\nprocedures relating to the fair value\nof certain level 3 financial\ninstruments is a critical audit matter\nare (i) the significant judgment and\nestimation by management in determining\nthe inputs to estimate fair value,\nwhich in turn led to a high degree of\nauditor judgment, subjectivity, and\neffort in performing procedures and in\nevaluating audit evidence obtained\nrelated to the fair value of these\nfinancial instruments, and (ii) the\naudit effort involved the use of\nprofessionals with specialized skill\nand knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved\nperforming procedures and evaluating\naudit evidence in connection with\nforming our\n                                              \n  158    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nReport of Independent Registered Public\nAccounting Firm\n\noverall opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements. These procedures\nincluded testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to the Firm\u2019s\ndetermination of the fair value,\nincluding controls over models, inputs,\nand data. These procedures also\nincluded, among others, the involvement\nof professionals with specialized skill\nand knowledge to assist in developing\nan independent estimate of fair value\nfor a sample of these financial\ninstruments and comparing management\u2019s\nestimate to the independently developed\nestimate of fair value. Developing the\nindependent estimate involved testing\nthe completeness and accuracy of data\nprovided by management, developing\nindependent inputs and, as appropriate,\nevaluating and utilizing management\u2019s\naforementioned unobservable inputs.\n\nFebruary 22, 2022\n\nWe have served as the Firm\u2019s auditor\nsince 1965.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase

(\u201cJPMorgan Chase\u201d or the \u201cFirm\u201d), a financial holding company\nincorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading financial services firm\nbased in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment\nbanking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial\nbanking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 32\nfor a further discussion of the Firm\u2019s business segments. The accounting and\nfinancial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to\nU.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting\nand reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. Certain amounts\nreported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current\npresentation. Notably in the first quarter of 2021, the Firm reclassified certain\ndeferred investment tax credits from accounts payable and other liabilities to\nother assets to be a reduction to the carrying value of the associated tax-\noriented investments.Refer to Note 25 for further information. Consolidation The\nConsolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other\nentities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material\nintercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Assets held for\nclients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan\nChase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm determines\nwhether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating\nwhether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity.\nVoting interest entities Voting interest entities are entities that have\nsufficient equity and provide the equity investors voting rights that enable them\nto make significant decisions relating to the entity\u2019s operations. For these types\nof entities, the Firm\u2019s determination of whether it has a controlling interest is\nprimarily based on the amount of voting equity interests held. Entities in which\nthe Firm has a controlling financial interest, through ownership of the majority\nof the entities\u2019 voting equity interests, or through other contractual rights that\ngive the Firm control, are consolidated by the Firm. Investments in companies in\nwhich the Firm has significant influence over operating and financing decisions\n(but does not own a majority of the voting equity interests) are accounted for (i)\nin accordance with the equity method of accounting (which requires the Firm to\nrecognize its proportionate share of the entity\u2019s net earnings), or (ii) at fair\nvalue if the fair value option was elected. These investments are generally\nincluded in other assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue.\nCertain Firm-sponsored asset management funds are structured as limited\npartnerships or limited liability companies. For many of these entities, the Firm\nis the general partner or managing member, but the non-affiliated partners or\nmembers have the ability to remove the Firm as the general partner or managing\nmember without cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on a simple majority vote, or\nthe non-affiliated partners or members have rights to participate in important\ndecisions. Accordingly, the Firm does not consolidate these voting interest\nentities. However, in the limited cases where the non-managing partners or members\ndo not have substantive kick-out or participating rights, the Firm evaluates the\nfunds as VIEs and consolidates the funds if the Firm is the general partner or\nmanaging member and has both power and a potentially significant interest. The\nFirm\u2019s investment companies and asset management funds have investments in both\npublicly-held and privately-held entities, including investments in buyouts,\ngrowth equity and venture opportunities. These investments are accounted for under\ninvestment company guidelines and, accordingly, irrespective of the percentage of\nequity ownership interests held, are carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at\nfair value, and are recorded in other assets, with income or loss included in\nnoninterest revenue. If consolidated, the Firm retains the accounting under such\nspecialized investment company guidelines. Variable interest entities VIEs are\nentities that, by design, either (1) lack sufficient equity to permit the entity\nto finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from\nother parties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the ability to make\nsignificant decisions relating to the entity\u2019s operations through voting rights,\nor do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the\nright to receive the residual returns of the entity. The most common type of VIE\nis an SPE. SPEs are commonly used in securitization transactions in order to\nisolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to\ninvestors. The basic SPE structure involves a company selling assets to the SPE;\nthe SPE funds the purchase of those assets by issuing securities to investors. The\nlegal documents that govern the transaction specify how the cash earned on the\nassets must be allocated to the SPE\u2019s investors and other parties that have rights\nto those cash flows. SPEs are generally structured to insulate investors from\nclaims on the SPE\u2019s assets by creditors of other entities, including the creditors\nof the seller of the assets. The primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party\nthat has a controlling financial interest) is required to consolidate the assets\nand liabilities of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is the party that has both (1)\nthe power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the\nVIE\u2019s economic performance; and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    165  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \nobligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that\ncould potentially be significant to the VIE. To assess whether the Firm has the\npower to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s\neconomic performance, the Firm considers all the facts and circumstances,\nincluding its role in establishing the VIE and its ongoing rights and\nresponsibilities. This assessment includes, first, identifying the activities that\nmost significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance; and second, identifying\nwhich party, if any, has power over those activities. In general, the parties that\nmake the most significant decisions affecting the VIE (such as asset managers,\ncollateral managers, servicers, or owners of call options or liquidation rights\nover the VIE\u2019s assets) or have the right to unilaterally remove those decision-\nmakers are deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE. To assess\nwhether the Firm has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to\nreceive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE,\nthe Firm considers all of its economic interests, including debt and equity\ninvestments, servicing fees, and derivatives or other arrangements deemed to be\nvariable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires that the Firm apply\njudgment in determining whether these interests, in the aggregate, are considered\npotentially significant to the VIE. Factors considered in assessing significance\ninclude: the design of the VIE, including its capitalization structure;\nsubordination of interests; payment priority; relative share of interests held\nacross various classes within the VIE\u2019s capital structure; and the reasons why the\ninterests are held by the Firm. The Firm performs on-going reassessments of: (1)\nwhether entities previously evaluated under the majority voting-interest framework\nhave become VIEs, based on certain events, and are therefore subject to the VIE\nconsolidation framework; and (2) whether changes in the facts and circumstances\nregarding the Firm\u2019s involvement with a VIE cause the Firm\u2019s consolidation\nconclusion to change. Refer to Note 14 for further discussion of the Firm\u2019s VIEs.\nRevenue recognition Interest income The Firm recognizes interest income on loans,\ndebt securities, and other debt instruments, generally on a level-yield basis,\nbased on the underlying contractual rate. Refer to Note 7 for further discussion\nof interest income. Revenue from contracts with customers JPMorgan Chase\nrecognizes noninterest revenue from certain contracts with customers , in\ninvestment banking fees, deposit-related fees, asset management administration and\ncommissions, and components of card income, when the Firm\u2019s related performance\nobligations are satisfied. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion of the Firm\u2019s\nrevenue from contracts with customers. Principal transactions revenue JPMorgan\nChase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. Changes in\nfair value are reported primarily in principal transactions revenue. Refer to\nNotes 2 and 3 for further discussion of fair value measurement. Refer to Note 6\nfor further discussion of principal transactions revenue. Use of estimates in the\npreparation of consolidated financial statements The preparation of the\nConsolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue\nand expense, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results\ncould be different from these estimates. Foreign currency translation JPMorgan\nChase revalues assets, liabilities, revenue and expense denominated in non-U.S.\ncurrencies into U.S. dollars using applicable exchange rates. Gains and losses\nrelating to translating functional currency financial statements for U.S.\nreporting are included in the Consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nGains and losses relating to nonfunctional currency transactions, including\nnon-U.S. operations where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, are reported\nin the Consolidated statements of income. Offsetting assets and liabilities U.S.\nGAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables\nwith the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and\npayables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally\nenforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities\nsold and purchased under repurchase agreements and securities borrowed or loaned\nunder securities loan agreements to be presented net when specified conditions are\nmet, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement.\nThe Firm has elected to net such balances where it has determined that the\nspecified conditions are met. The Firm uses master netting agreements to mitigate\ncounterparty credit risk in certain transactions, including derivative contracts,\nresale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements. A master\nnetting agreement is a single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple\ntransactions governed by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and\nsettled through a single payment in a single currency in the event of a default\n(e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or\ndeliver collateral or margin when due). Upon the exercise of derivatives\ntermination rights by the non-defaulting party (i) all transactions are\nterminated, (ii) all transactions are valued and the positive values of \u201cin the\nmoney\u201d transactions are netted against the negative values of \u201cout of the money\u201d\ntransactions and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the\nparties to pay the netted termination amount. Upon exercise of default rights\nunder repurchase\n                                              \n  166    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nagreements and securities loan agreements in general (i) all transactions are\nterminated and accelerated, (ii) all values of securities or cash held or to be\ndelivered are calculated, and all such sums are netted against each other and\n(iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the\nnetted termination amount. Typical master netting agreements for these types of\ntransactions also often contain a collateral/margin agreement that provides for a\nsecurity interest in, or title transfer of, securities or cash collateral/margin\nto the party that has the right to demand margin (the \u201cdemanding party\u201d). The\ncollateral/margin agreement typically requires a party to transfer\ncollateral/margin to the demanding party with a value equal to the amount of the\nmargin deficit on a net basis across all transactions governed by the master\nnetting agreement, less any threshold. The collateral/margin agreement grants to\nthe demanding party, upon default by the counterparty, the right to set-off any\namounts payable by the counterparty against any posted collateral or the cash\nequivalent of any posted collateral/margin. It also grants to the demanding party\nthe right to liquidate collateral/margin and to apply the proceeds to an amount\npayable by the counterparty.

Statements of cash flows For JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nConsolidated statements of cash flows, cash is defined as those amounts included\nin cash and due from banks and deposits with banks on the Consolidated balance\nsheets. Accounting standard adopted January 1, 2020 Financial Instruments \u2013 Credit\nLosses (\u201cCECL\u201d) The adoption of this guidance established a single allowance\nframework for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-\nbalance sheet credit exposures. This framework requires that management\u2019s estimate\nreflects credit losses over the instrument\u2019s remaining expected life and considers\nexpected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. Prior to the adoption of the\nCECL accounting guidance, the Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses represented\nmanagement\u2019s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Firm\u2019s retained\nloan portfolios and certain lending-related commitments. The adoption of CECL on\nJanuary 1, 2020, resulted in a $2.7 billion decrease to retained earnings.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    167  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \nSignificant accounting policies\nThe following table identifies JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s other significant accounting\npolicies and the Note and page where a\ndetailed description of each policy can\nbe found.\n                                                                 \n  Fair value measurement                    Note 2     page 169  \n  Fair value option                         Note 3     page 190  \n  Derivative instruments                    Note 5     page 196  \n  Noninterest revenue and noninterest       Note 6     page 211  \n  expense                                                        \n  Interest income and Interest expense      Note 7     page 214  \n  Pension and other postretirement          Note 8     page 215  \n  employee benefit plans                                         \n  Employee share-based incentives           Note 9     page 218  \n  Investment securities                     Note 10    page 220  \n  Securities financing activities           Note 11    page 226  \n  Loans                                     Note 12    page 229  \n  Allowance for credit losses               Note 13    page 248  \n  Variable interest entities                Note 14    page 253  \n  Goodwill and Mortgage servicing rights    Note 15    page 261  \n  Premises and equipment                    Note 16    page 265  \n  Leases                                    Note 18    page 266  \n  Long-term debt                            Note 20    page 269  \n  Earnings per share                        Note 23    page 274  \n  Income taxes                              Note 25    page 277  \n  Off\u2013balance sheet lending-related                              \n  financial instruments, guarantees and     Note 28    page 283  \n  other commitments                                              \n  Litigation                                Note 30    page 290  \n                                                                 \n                                              \n  168    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n  Note 2 \u2013 Fair value measurement                                                 \n                                                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its\nassets and liabilities at fair value.\nThese assets and liabilities are\npredominantly carried at fair value on\na recurring basis (i.e., assets and\nliabilities that are measured and\nreported at fair value on the Firm\u2019s\nConsolidated balance sheets). Certain\nassets, liabilities and unfunded\nlending-related commitments are\nmeasured at fair value on a\nnonrecurring basis; that is, they are\nnot measured at fair value on an\nongoing basis but are subject to fair\nvalue adjustments only in certain\ncircumstances (for example, when there\nis evidence of impairment). Fair value\nis defined as the price that would be\nreceived to sell an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants\nat the measurement date. Fair value is\nbased on quoted market prices or\ninputs, where available. If prices or\nquotes are not available, fair value is\nbased on valuation models and other\nvaluation techniques that consider\nrelevant transaction characteristics\n(such as maturity) and use, as inputs,\nobservable or unobservable market\nparameters, including yield curves,\ninterest rates, volatilities, prices\n(such as commodity, equity or debt\nprices), correlations, foreign exchange\nrates and credit curves. Valuation\nadjustments may be made to ensure that\nfinancial instruments are recorded at\nfair value, as described below. The\nlevel of precision in estimating\nunobservable market inputs or other\nfactors can affect the amount of gain\nor loss recorded for a particular\nposition. Furthermore, while the Firm\nbelieves its valuation methods are\nappropriate and consistent with those\nof other market participants, the\nmethods and assumptions used reflect\nmanagement judgment and may vary across\nthe Firm\u2019s businesses and portfolios.\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and\nassumptions in the determination of\nfair value. The use of different\nmethodologies or assumptions by other\nmarket participants compared with those\nused by the Firm could result in the\nFirm deriving a different estimate of\nfair value at the reporting date.\nValuation process Risk-taking functions\nare responsible for providing fair\nvalue estimates for assets and\nliabilities carried on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets at fair value. The\nFirm\u2019s Valuation Control Group (\u201cVCG\u201d),\nwhich is part of the Firm\u2019s Finance\nfunction and independent of the risk-\ntaking functions, is responsible for\nverifying these estimates and\ndetermining any fair value adjustments\nthat may be required to ensure that the\nFirm\u2019s positions are recorded at fair\nvalue. In addition, the Firm\u2019s\nValuation Governance Forum (\u201cVGF\u201d),\nwhich is composed of senior finance and\nrisk executives, is responsible for\noverseeing the management of risks\narising from valuation activities\nconducted across the Firm. The Firmwide\nVGF is chaired by the Firmwide head of\nthe VCG (under the direction of the\nFirm\u2019s Controller), and includes sub-\nforums covering the\n\nCIB, CCB, CB, AWM and certain corporate\nfunctions including Treasury and CIO.\nPrice verification process The VCG\nverifies fair value estimates provided\nby the risk-taking functions by\nleveraging independently derived\nprices, valuation inputs and other\nmarket data, where available. Where\nindependent prices or inputs are not\navailable, the VCG performs additional\nreview to ensure the reasonableness of\nthe estimates. The additional review\nmay include evaluating the limited\nmarket activity including client\nunwinds, benchmarking valuation inputs\nto those used for similar instruments,\ndecomposing the valuation of structured\ninstruments into individual components,\ncomparing expected to actual cash\nflows, reviewing profit and loss\ntrends, and reviewing trends in\ncollateral valuation. There are also\nadditional levels of management review\nfor more significant or complex\npositions. The VCG determines any\nvaluation adjustments that may be\nrequired to the estimates provided by\nthe risk-taking functions. No\nadjustments to quoted prices are\napplied for instruments classified\nwithin level 1 of the fair value\nhierarchy (refer to the discussion\nbelow for further information on the\nfair value hierarchy). For other\npositions, judgment is required to\nassess the need for valuation\nadjustments to appropriately reflect\nliquidity considerations, unobservable\nparameters, and, for certain portfolios\nthat meet specified criteria, the size\nof the net open risk position. The\ndetermination of such adjustments\nfollows a consistent framework across\nthe Firm: \u2022 Liquidity valuation\nadjustments are considered where an\nobservable external price or valuation\nparameter exists but is of lower\nreliability, potentially due to lower\nmarket activity. Liquidity valuation\nadjustments are made based on current\nmarket conditions. Factors that may be\nconsidered in determining the liquidity\nadjustment include analysis of: (1) the\nestimated bid-offer spread for the\ninstrument being traded; (2)\nalternative pricing points for similar\ninstruments in active markets; and (3)\nthe range of reasonable values that the\nprice or parameter could take. \u2022 The\nFirm manages certain portfolios of\nfinancial instruments on the basis of\nnet open risk exposure and, as\npermitted by U.S. GAAP, has elected to\nestimate the fair value of such\nportfolios on the basis of a transfer\nof the entire net open risk position in\nan orderly transaction. Where this is\nthe case, valuation adjustments may be\nnecessary to reflect the cost of\nexiting a larger-than-normal market-\nsize net open risk position. Where\napplied, such adjustments are based on\nfactors that a relevant market\nparticipant would consider in the\ntransfer of the net open risk position,\nincluding the size of the adverse\nmarket move that is likely to occur\nduring the period required to reduce\nthe net open risk position to a normal\nmarket-size. \u2022 Uncertainty adjustments\nrelated to unobservable parameters may\nbe made when positions are valued\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    169  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \nusing prices or input parameters to\nvaluation models that are unobservable\ndue to a lack of market activity or\nbecause they cannot be implied from\nobservable market data. Such prices or\nparameters must be estimated and are,\ntherefore, subject to management\njudgment. Adjustments are made to\nreflect the uncertainty inherent in the\nresulting valuation estimate. \u2022 Where\nappropriate, the Firm also applies\nadjustments to its estimates of fair\nvalue in order to appropriately reflect\ncounterparty credit quality (CVA), the\nFirm\u2019s own creditworthiness (DVA) and\nthe impact of funding (FVA), using a\nconsistent framework across the Firm.\nRefer to Credit and funding adjustments\non page 186 of this Note for more\ninformation on such adjustments.\nValuation model review and approval If\nprices or quotes are not available for\nan instrument or a similar instrument,\nfair value is generally determined\nusing valuation models that consider\nrelevant transaction terms such as\nmaturity and use as inputs market-based\nor independently sourced parameters.\nWhere this is the case the price\nverification process described above is\napplied to the inputs in those models.\nUnder the Firm\u2019s Estimations and Model\nRisk Management Policy, the MRGR\nreviews and approves new models, as\nwell as material changes to existing\nmodels, prior to implementation in the\noperating environment. In certain\ncircumstances exceptions may be granted\nto the Firm\u2019s policy to allow a model\nto be used prior to review or approval.\nThe MRGR may also require the user to\ntake appropriate actions to mitigate\nthe model risk if it is to be used in\nthe interim. These actions will depend\non the model and may include, for\nexample, limitation of trading\nactivity. Fair value hierarchy A three-\nlevel fair value hierarchy has been\nestablished under U.S. GAAP for\ndisclosure of fair value measurements.\nThe fair value hierarchy is based on\nthe observability of inputs to the\nvaluation of an asset or liability as\nof the measurement date. The three\nlevels are defined as follows. \u2022 Level\n1 \u2013 inputs to the valuation methodology\nare quoted prices (unadjusted) for\nidentical assets or liabilities in\nactive markets. \u2022 Level 2 \u2013 inputs to\nthe valuation methodology include\nquoted prices for similar assets and\nliabilities in active markets, and\ninputs that are observable for the\nasset or liability, either directly or\nindirectly, for substantially the full\nterm of the financial instrument. \u2022\nLevel 3 \u2013 one or more inputs to the\nvaluation methodology are unobservable\nand significant to the fair value\nmeasurement. A financial instrument\u2019s\ncategorization within the fair value\nhierarchy is based on the lowest level\nof input that is significant to the\nfair value measurement.\n

mortgage-related.\n\n(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of\ncost or net realizable value. \u201cNet realizable value\u201d is a term defined in U.S.\nGAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (\u201ctransaction costs\u201d).\nTransaction costs for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories are either not\napplicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable\nvalue approximates fair value for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories.\nWhen fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below\ncost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because\nunder fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair\nvalue. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of the Firm\u2019s hedge accounting\nrelationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all\nphysical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.\n\n(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the\namount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    175  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \n(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value\nper share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be\nclassified in the fair value hierarchy. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the fair\nvalues of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity\nfunds, real estate and other funds, were $ 801million and $ 670million,\nrespectively. Included in these balances at December 31, 2021 and 2020, were\ntrading assets of $ 51million and $ 52million, respectively, and other assets of $\n750million and $ 618million, respectively.\n\n(e) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, included $ 26.2billion and $ 15.1billion,\nrespectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $ 8.2billion and $\n6.3billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage\nloans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S.\nGSEs and government agencies of $ 13.6billion and $ 8.4billion, respectively.\n\n(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative\nreceivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and\npaid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3\nbalances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit\nassociated with cash collateral.\n\n(g) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current\npresentation.\n                                              \n  176    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nLevel 3 valuations\n\nThe Firm has established well-structured processes for determining fair value,\nincluding for instruments where fair value is estimated using significant\nunobservable inputs (level 3). Refer to pages 169-173 of this Note for further\ninformation on the Firm\u2019s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the\ndetermination of fair value for individual financial instruments. Estimating fair\nvalue requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment\nrequired is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information\navailable to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation\nmodels and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and\nare therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments\nused to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when\nestimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2. In\narriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management\nmust first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique\nto use. Second, due to the lack of observability of significant inputs, management\nmust assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including\ntransaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default\nrates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt\nprices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit\ncurves. The following table presents the Firm\u2019s primary level 3 financial\ninstruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those\nfinancial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values\nfor those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the\ndetermination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the\nsignificance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement,\nlevel 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is,\ncomponents that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in\naddition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not\nincluded in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable\ncomponents of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative\npositions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nThe range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and\nlowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a\nproduct/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the\ninput values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the\ninstruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm\u2019s view, the input\nrange, weighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of input\nuncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm\u2019s estimates and\nassumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments\nheld by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of\ncharacteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of\nmarket risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly\ndifferent implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different\nunderlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted average values\nwill therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the\ncharacteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    177  \n                                              \n

The impact of changes in inputs may not be\nindependent, as a change in one unobservable input may give rise to a change in\nanother unobservable input. Where relationships do exist between two unobservable\ninputs, those relationships are discussed below. Relationships may also exist\nbetween observable and unobservable inputs (for example, as observable interest\nrates rise, unobservable prepayment rates decline); such relationships have not\nbeen included in the discussion below. In addition, for each of the individual\nrelationships described below, the inverse relationship would also generally\napply. The following discussion also provides a description of attributes of the\nunderlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs\nused in the valuation of the Firm\u2019s positions. Yield \u2013 The yield of an asset is\nthe interest rate used to discount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow\ncalculation. An increase in the yield, in isolation, would result in a decrease in\na fair value measurement. Credit spread \u2013 The credit spread is the amount of\nadditional annualized return over the market interest rate that a market\nparticipant would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument.\nThe credit spread for an instrument forms part of the discount rate used in a\ndiscounted cash flow calculation. Generally, an increase in the credit spread\nwould result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The yield and the credit\nspread of a particular mortgage-backed security primarily reflect the risk\ninherent in the instrument. The yield is also impacted by the absolute level of\nthe coupon paid by the instrument (which may not correspond directly to the level\nof inherent risk). Therefore, the range of yield and credit spreads reflects the\nrange of risk inherent in various instruments owned by the Firm. The risk inherent\nin mortgage-backed securities is driven by the subordination of the security being\nvalued and the characteristics of the underlying mortgages within the\ncollateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores, LTV ratios for residential\nmortgages and the nature of the property and/or any tenants for commercial\nmortgages. For corporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and\nmunicipalities and other similar instruments, credit spreads reflect the credit\nquality of the obligor and the tenor of the obligation. Prepayment speed \u2013 The\nprepayment speed is a measure of the voluntary unscheduled principal repayments of\na prepayable obligation in a collateralized pool. Prepayment speeds generally\ndecline as borrower delinquencies rise. An increase in prepayment speeds, in\nisolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued\nat a premium to par and an increase in a fair value measurement of assets valued\nat a discount to par. Prepayment speeds may vary from collateral pool to\ncollateral pool, and are driven by the type and location of the underlying\nborrower, and the remaining tenor of the obligation as well as the level and type\n(e.g., fixed or floating) of interest rate being paid by the borrower. Typically\ncollateral pools with higher borrower credit quality have a higher prepayment rate\nthan those with lower borrower credit quality, all other factors being equal.\nConditional default rate \u2013 The conditional default rate is a measure of the\nreduction in the outstanding collateral balance underlying a collateralized\nobligation as a result of defaults. While there is typically no direct\nrelationship between conditional default rates and prepayment speeds,\ncollateralized obligations for which the underlying collateral has high prepayment\nspeeds will tend to have lower conditional default rates. An increase in\nconditional default rates would generally be accompanied by an increase in loss\nseverity and an increase in credit spreads. An increase in the conditional default\nrate, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.\nConditional default rates reflect the quality of the collateral underlying a\nsecuritization and the structure of the securitization itself. Based on the types\nof securities owned in the Firm\u2019s market-making portfolios, conditional default\nrates are most typically at the lower end of the range presented. Loss severity \u2013\nThe loss severity (the inverse concept is the recovery rate) is the expected\namount of future realized losses resulting from the ultimate liquidation of a\nparticular loan, expressed as the net amount of loss relative to the outstanding\nloan balance. An increase in loss severity is generally accompanied by an increase\nin conditional default rates. An increase in the loss severity, in isolation,\nwould result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The loss severity applied\nin valuing a mortgage-backed security investment depends on factors relating to\nthe underlying mortgages, including the LTV ratio, the nature of the lender\u2019s lien\non the property and other instrument-specific factors.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    179  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \nCorrelation \u2013 Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements\nof two variables. Correlation is a pricing input for a derivative product where\nthe payoff is driven by one or more underlying risks. Correlation inputs are\nrelated to the type of derivative (e.g., interest rate, credit, equity, foreign\nexchange and commodity) due to the nature of the underlying risks. When parameters\nare positively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in an increase\nin the other parameter. When parameters are negatively correlated, an increase in\none parameter will result in a decrease in the other parameter. An increase in\ncorrelation can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement.\nGiven a short correlation position, an increase in correlation, in isolation,\nwould generally result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The level of\ncorrelation used in the valuation of derivatives with multiple underlying risks\ndepends on a number of factors including the nature of those risks. For example,\nthe correlation between two credit risk exposures would be different than that\nbetween two interest rate risk exposures. Similarly, the tenor of the transaction\nmay also impact the correlation input, as the relationship between the underlying\nrisks may be different over different time periods. Furthermore, correlation\nlevels are very much dependent on market conditions and could have a relatively\nwide range of levels within or across asset classes over time, particularly in\nvolatile market conditions. Volatility \u2013 Volatility is a measure of the\nvariability in possible returns for an instrument, parameter or market index given\nhow much the particular instrument, parameter or index changes in value over time.\nVolatility is a pricing input for options, including equity options, commodity\noptions, and interest rate options. Generally, the higher the volatility of the\nunderlying, the riskier the instrument. Given a long position in an option, an\nincrease in volatility, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a\nfair value measurement. The level of volatility used in the valuation of a\nparticular option-based derivative depends on a number of factors, including the\nnature of the risk underlying the option (e.g., the volatility of a particular\nequity security may be significantly different from that of a particular commodity\nindex), the tenor of the derivative as well as the strike price of the option.\nInterest rate curve \u2013 represents the relationship of interest rates over differing\ntenors. The interest rate curve is used to set interest rate and foreign exchange\nderivative cash flows and is also a pricing input used in the discounting of any\nderivative cash flow. Forward price - Forward price is the price at which the\nbuyer agrees to purchase the asset underlying a forward contract on the\npredetermined future delivery date, and is such that the value of the contract is\nzero at inception. The forward price is used as an input in the valuation of\ncertain derivatives and depends on a number of factors including interest rates,\nthe current price of the underlying asset, and the expected income to be received\nand costs to be incurred by the seller as a result of holding that asset until the\ndelivery date. An increase in the forward can result in an increase or a decrease\nin a fair value measurement. Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements\nThe following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets\namounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by\nthe Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the years ended December\n31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. When a determination is made to classify a financial\ninstrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the\nunobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3\nfinancial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level\n3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted\nand can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in\nthe table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors\nthat are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the\nobservable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and\nderivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value\nhierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not\nincluded below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the\neffect of the Firm\u2019s risk management activities

Therefore, it is generally\nnecessary to make adjustments to the\nbase estimate of fair value to reflect\nthese factors. CVA represents the\nadjustment, relative to the relevant\nbenchmark interest rate, necessary to\nreflect counterparty nonperformance\nrisk. The Firm estimates CVA using a\nscenario analysis to estimate the\nexpected positive credit exposure\nacross all of the Firm\u2019s existing\npositions with each counterparty, and\nthen estimates losses based on the\nprobability of default and estimated\nrecovery rate as a result of a\ncounterparty credit event considering\ncontractual factors designed to\nmitigate the Firm\u2019s credit exposure,\nsuch as collateral and legal rights of\noffset. The key inputs to this\nmethodology are (i) the probability of\na default event occurring for each\ncounterparty, as derived from observed\nor estimated CDS spreads; and (ii)\nestimated recovery rates implied by CDS\nspreads, adjusted to consider the\ndifferences in recovery rates as a\nderivative creditor relative to those\nreflected in CDS spreads, which\ngenerally reflect senior unsecured\ncreditor risk. FVA represents the\nadjustment to reflect the impact of\nfunding and is recognized where there\nis evidence that a market participant\nin the principal market would\nincorporate it in a transfer of the\ninstrument. The Firm\u2019s FVA framework,\napplied to uncollateralized (including\npartially collateralized) over-the-\ncounter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives\nincorporates key inputs such as: (i)\nthe expected funding requirements\narising from the Firm\u2019s positions with\n\neach counterparty and collateral\narrangements; and (ii) the estimated\nmarket funding cost in the principal\nmarket which, for derivative\nliabilities, considers the Firm\u2019s\ncredit risk (DVA). For collateralized\nderivatives, the fair value is\nestimated by discounting expected\nfuture cash flows at the relevant\novernight indexed swap rate given the\nunderlying collateral agreement with\nthe counterparty, and therefore a\nseparate FVA is not necessary.\nThe following table provides the impact\nof credit and funding adjustments on\nprincipal transactions revenue in the\nrespective periods, excluding the\neffect of any associated hedging\nactivities. The FVA presented below\nincludes the impact of the Firm\u2019s own\ncredit quality on the inception value\nof liabilities as well as the impact of\nchanges in the Firm\u2019s own credit\nquality over time.\n                                                                    \n  Year ended December 31,                                           \n  (in millions)                         2021       2020       2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Credit and funding adjustments:                                   \n  Derivatives CVA                    $   362    $  -337    $   241  \n  Derivatives FVA                         47        -64        199  \n                                                                    \nValuation adjustments on fair value\noption elected liabilities\n\nThe valuation of the Firm\u2019s liabilities\nfor which the fair value option has\nbeen elected requires consideration of\nthe Firm\u2019s own credit risk.

In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that\nthe fair value of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., demand,\nsavings and certain money market deposits) be equal to their carrying value;\nrecognition of the inherent funding value of these instruments is not permitted.\n                                              \n  188    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nThe following table presents by fair value hierarchy classification the carrying\nvalues and estimated fair values at December 31, 2021 and 2020, of financial\nassets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments that are carried at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis, and their classification within the fair value\nhierarchy.\n                                                                                  \n         \u2026                                       \u2026                                \n         \u2026                                       \u2026                                \n         \u2026                                       \u2026                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                 \u2026                                       \u2026                        \n                 \u2026                                       \u2026                        \n                 \u2026                                       \u2026                        \n                 \u2026                                       \u2026                        \n                                         \u2026                                        \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                \n         \u2026       1       2       3       \u2026       \u2026       1       2                \n                                         \u2026                                        \n                                                                                  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014                \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026                \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026                \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026                \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026                \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026                \n                                                                                  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026                \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026                \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026                \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026                \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026                \n                                                                                  \n(a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that\nincorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal,\ncontractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including\nexpected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary\norigination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is\nmeasured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the\nloan takes into account the loan\u2019s allowance for loan losses, which represents the\nloan\u2019s expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference\nbetween the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally\nattributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market\nliquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do\nnot affect its carrying value.\nThe majority of the Firm\u2019s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis on the Consolidated balance sheets.

The Firm has elected to measure\ncertain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income\nstatement volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of\nelected instruments (e.g., certain instruments that otherwise would be accounted\nfor on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements that are\naccounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those\ninstruments that are managed on a fair value basis.

Refer to Note 7 for further information\nregarding interest income and interest expense.\n(f) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current\npresentation.\nDetermination of instrument-specific credit risk for items for which the fair\nvalue option was elected The following describes how the gains and losses that are\nattributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, were determined. \u2022\nLoans and lending-related commitments: For floating-rate instruments, all changes\nin value are attributed to instrument-specific credit risk. For fixed-rate\ninstruments, an allocation of the changes in value for the period is made between\nthose changes in value that are interest rate-related and changes in value that\nare credit-related. Allocations are generally based on an analysis of borrower-\nspecific credit spread and recovery information, where available, or benchmarking\nto similar entities or industries. \u2022 Long-term debt: Changes in value attributable\nto instrument-specific credit risk were derived principally from observable\nchanges in the Firm\u2019s credit spread as observed in the bond market. \u2022 Securities\nfinancing agreements: Generally, for these types of agreements, there is a\nrequirement that collateral be maintained with a market value equal to or in\nexcess of the principal amount loaned; as a result, there would be no adjustment\nor an immaterial adjustment for instrument-specific credit risk related to these\nagreements.\n                                              \n

JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its\ncredit portfolios to assess potential credit risk concentrations and to obtain\nadditional collateral when deemed necessary and permitted under the Firm\u2019s\nagreements. Senior management is significantly involved in the credit approval and\nreview process, and risk levels are adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm\u2019s risk\nappetite. In the Firm\u2019s consumer portfolio, concentrations are managed primarily\nby product and by U.S. geographic region, with a key focus on trends and\nconcentrations at the portfolio level, where potential credit risk concentrations\ncan be remedied through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines.\nRefer to Note 12 for additional information on the geographic composition of the\nFirm\u2019s consumer loan portfolios. In the wholesale portfolio, credit risk\nconcentrations are evaluated primarily by industry and monitored regularly on both\nan aggregate portfolio level and on an individual client or counterparty basis.\nThe Firm\u2019s wholesale exposure is managed through loan syndications and\nparticipations, loan sales, securitizations, credit derivatives, master netting\nagreements, collateral and other risk-reduction techniques. Refer to Note 12 for\nadditional information on loans. The Firm does not believe that its exposure to\nany particular loan product or industry segment results in a significant\nconcentration of credit risk. Terms of loan products and collateral coverage are\nincluded in the Firm\u2019s assessment when extending credit and establishing its\nallowance for loan losses.\n                                              \n  194    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nThe table below presents both on\u2013balance sheet and off\u2013balance sheet consumer and\nwholesale credit exposure by the Firm\u2019s three credit portfolio segments as of\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020.

Because of this collateralization, no\nallowance for credit losses is generally held against these receivables. To manage\nits credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required\nmargin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash\nor other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate.

JPMorgan\nChase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge\nor manage its own risk exposures. Predominantly all of the Firm\u2019s derivatives are\nentered into for market-making or risk management purposes. Market-making\nderivatives The majority of the Firm\u2019s derivatives are entered into for market-\nmaking purposes. Clients use derivatives to mitigate or modify interest rate,\ncredit, foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks. The Firm actively manages\nthe risks from its exposure to these derivatives by entering into other derivative\ncontracts or by purchasing or selling other financial instruments that partially\nor fully offset the exposure from client derivatives. Risk management derivatives\nThe Firm manages certain market and credit risk exposures using derivative\ninstruments, including derivatives in hedge accounting relationships and other\nderivatives that are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and\nliabilities. The Firm generally uses interest rate derivatives to manage the risk\nassociated with changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate assets and liabilities\nappreciate or depreciate in market value as interest rates change. Similarly,\ninterest income and expense increase or decrease as a result of variable-rate\nassets and liabilities resetting to current market rates, and as a result of the\nrepayment and subsequent origination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and\nliabilities at current market rates. Gains and losses on the derivative\ninstruments related to these assets and liabilities are expected to substantially\noffset this variability. Foreign currency derivatives are used to manage the\nforeign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency\u2013denominated (i.e.,\nnon-U.S. dollar) assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as\nthe Firm\u2019s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose\nfunctional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. As a result of fluctuations in\nforeign currencies, the U.S. dollar\u2013equivalent values of the foreign\ncurrency\u2013denominated assets and liabilities or the forecasted revenues or expenses\nincrease or decrease. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments related to\nthese foreign currency\u2013denominated assets or liabilities, or forecasted\ntransactions, are expected to substantially offset this variability. Commodities\nderivatives are used to manage the price risk of certain commodities inventories.\nGains or losses on these derivative instruments are expected to substantially\noffset the depreciation or appreciation of the related inventory. Credit\nderivatives are used to manage the counterparty credit risk associated with loans\nand lending-related commitments. Credit derivatives compensate the purchaser when\nthe entity referenced in the contract experiences a credit event, such as\nbankruptcy or a failure to pay an obligation when due. Credit derivatives\nprimarily consist of CDS. Refer to the Credit derivatives section on pages 207-210\nof this Note for a further discussion of credit derivatives. Refer to the risk\nmanagement derivatives gains and losses table on page 207 of this Note, and the\nhedge accounting gains and losses tables on pages 204-206 of this Note for more\ninformation about risk management derivatives. Derivative counterparties and\nsettlement types The Firm enters into OTC derivatives, which are negotiated and\nsettled bilaterally with the derivative counterparty. The Firm also enters into,\nas principal, certain ETD such as futures and options, and OTC-cleared derivative\ncontracts with CCPs. ETD contracts are generally standardized contracts traded on\nan exchange and cleared by the CCP, which is the Firm\u2019s counterparty from the\ninception of the transactions. OTC-cleared derivatives are traded on a bilateral\nbasis and then novated to the CCP for clearing. Derivative clearing services The\nFirm provides clearing services for clients in which the Firm acts as a clearing\nmember at certain exchanges and clearing houses. The Firm does not reflect the\nclients\u2019 derivative contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to\nNote 28 for further information on the Firm\u2019s clearing services. Accounting for\nderivatives All free-standing derivatives that the Firm executes for its own\naccount are required to be recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair\nvalue. As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets derivative assets and\nliabilities, and the related cash collateral receivables and payables, when a\nlegally enforceable master netting agreement exists between the Firm and the\nderivative counterparty. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting\nof assets and liabilities. The accounting for changes in value of a derivative\ndepends on whether or not the transaction has been designated and qualifies for\nhedge accounting. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are reported and\nmeasured at fair value through earnings. The tabular disclosures on pages 200-207\nof this Note provide additional information on the amount of, and reporting for,\nderivative assets, liabilities, gains and losses. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for a\nfurther discussion of derivatives embedded in structured notes.\n                                              \n  196    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nDerivatives designated as hedges The Firm applies hedge accounting to certain\nderivatives executed for risk management purposes \u2013 generally interest rate,\nforeign exchange and commodity derivatives. However, JPMorgan Chase does not seek\nto apply hedge accounting to all of the derivatives involved in the Firm\u2019s risk\nmanagement activities. For example, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to\npurchased CDS used to manage the credit risk of loans and lending-related\ncommitments, because of the difficulties in qualifying such contracts as hedges.\nFor the same reason, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to certain interest\nrate, foreign exchange, and commodity derivatives used for risk management\npurposes. To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly effective\nat reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. In addition, for a\nderivative to be designated as a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy\nmust be documented. Hedge documentation must identify the derivative hedging\ninstrument, the asset or liability or forecasted transaction and type of risk to\nbe hedged, and how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed prospectively\nand retrospectively. To assess effectiveness, the Firm uses statistical methods\nsuch as regression analysis, nonstatistical methods such as dollar-value\ncomparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative to the change in the\nfair value or cash flows of the hedged item, and qualitative comparisons of\ncritical terms and the evaluation of any changes in those terms. The extent to\nwhich a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective\nat offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item must be\nassessed and documented at least quarterly. If it is determined that a derivative\nis not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is\ndiscontinued. There are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair value\nhedges, cash flow hedges and net investment hedges. JPMorgan Chase uses fair value\nhedges primarily to hedge fixed-rate long-term debt, AFS securities and certain\ncommodities inventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, the changes in the fair\nvalue of the derivative, and in the value of the hedged item for the risk being\nhedged, are recognized in earnings. Certain amounts excluded from the assessment\nof effectiveness are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings over the life of\nthe derivative. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the adjustment to\nthe hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the hedged item,\nand for benchmark interest rate hedges, is amortized to earnings as a yield\nadjustment. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with\nthe classification of the hedged item \u2013 primarily net interest income and\nprincipal transactions revenue. JPMorgan Chase uses cash flow hedges primarily to\nhedge the exposure to variability in forecasted cash flows from floating-rate\nassets and liabilities and foreign currency\u2013denominated revenue and expense. For\nqualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are\nrecorded in OCI and recognized in earnings as the hedged item affects earnings.\nDerivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the\nclassification of the hedged item \u2013 primarily noninterest revenue, net interest\nincome and compensation expense. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the\nchange in value of the derivative recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when\nthe cash flows that were hedged affect earnings. For hedge relationships that are\ndiscontinued because a forecasted transaction is expected to not occur according\nto the original hedge forecast, any related derivative values recorded in AOCI are\nimmediately recognized in earnings. JPMorgan Chase uses net investment hedges to\nprotect the value of the Firm\u2019s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries\nor branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. For qualifying\nnet investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to changes\nin spot foreign exchange rates are recorded in OCI as translation adjustments.\nAmounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded directly in\nearnings.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    197  \n

It is the policy of JPMorgan\nChase to actively pursue, where possible, the use of legally enforceable master\nnetting arrangements and collateral agreements to mitigate derivative counterparty\ncredit risk inherent in derivative receivables.\n\nWhile derivative receivables expose the Firm to credit risk, derivative payables\nexpose the Firm to liquidity risk, as the derivative contracts typically require\nthe Firm to post cash or securities collateral with counterparties as the fair\nvalue of the contracts moves in the counterparties\u2019 favor or upon specified\ndowngrades in the Firm\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 respective credit ratings.

Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in\nprincipal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 6 for information on principal\ntransactions revenue.\n\nCredit derivatives Credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is\nderived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the\nreference entity) and which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer\nthat risk to another party (the protection seller). Credit derivatives expose the\nprotection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller, as the\nprotection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the\nreference entity experiences a credit event, such as a bankruptcy, a failure to\npay its obligation or a restructuring. The seller of credit protection receives a\npremium for providing protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument\nreferenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event. The Firm is both a\npurchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these\nderivatives for two primary purposes. First, in its capacity as a market-maker,\nthe Firm actively manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and\nselling credit protection, predominantly on corporate debt obligations, to meet\nthe needs of customers. Second, as an end-user, the Firm uses credit derivatives\nto manage credit risk associated with lending exposures (loans and unfunded\ncommitments) in its wholesale and consumer businesses and derivatives counterparty\nexposures in its wholesale businesses, and to manage the credit risk arising from\ncertain financial instruments in the Firm\u2019s market-making businesses. Following is\na summary of various types of credit derivatives.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    207  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \nCredit default swaps Credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a\nsingle reference entity (\u201csingle-name\u201d), broad-based index or portfolio. The Firm\npurchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-reference\nobligations. Single-name CDS and index CDS contracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared\nderivative contracts. Single-name CDS are used to manage the default risk of a\nsingle reference entity, while index CDS contracts are used to manage the credit\nrisk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments. Like\nthe S&P 500 and other market indices, a CDS index consists of a portfolio of CDS\nacross many reference entities. New series of CDS indices are periodically\nestablished with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect\nchanges in the credit markets. If one of the reference entities in the index\nexperiences a credit event, then the reference entity that defaulted is removed\nfrom the index. CDS can also be referenced against specific portfolios of\nreference names or against customized exposure levels based on specific client\ndemands: for example, to provide protection against the first $ 1million of\nrealized credit losses in a $ 10million portfolio of exposure. Such structures are\ncommonly known as tranche CDS. For both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS\ncontracts, upon the occurrence of a credit event, under the terms of a CDS\ncontract neither party to the CDS contract has recourse to the reference entity.\nThe protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference\nbetween the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value of the reference\nobligation at settlement of the credit derivative contract, also known as the\nrecovery value. The protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument\nof the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the CDS\ncontract when a credit event occurs. Credit-related notes A credit-related note is\na funded credit derivative where the issuer of the credit-related note purchases\nfrom the note investor credit protection on a reference entity or an index. Under\nthe contract, the investor pays the issuer the par value of the note at the\ninception of the transaction, and in return, the issuer pays periodic payments to\nthe investor, based on the credit risk of the referenced entity. The issuer also\nrepays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference\nentity (or one of the entities that makes up a reference index) experiences a\nspecified credit event. If a credit event occurs, the issuer is not obligated to\nrepay the par value of the note, but rather, the issuer pays the investor the\ndifference between the par value of the note and the fair value of the defaulted\nreference obligation at the time of settlement. Neither party to the credit-\nrelated note has recourse to the defaulting reference entity. The following tables\npresent a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related\nnotes the Firm sold and purchased as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. Upon a credit\nevent, the Firm as a seller of protection would typically pay out only a\npercentage of the full notional amount of net protection sold, as the amount\nactually required to be paid on the contracts takes into account the recovery\nvalue of the reference obligation at the time of settlement. The Firm manages the\ncredit risk on contracts to sell protection by purchasing protection with\nidentical or similar underlying reference entities. Other purchased protection\nreferenced in the following tables includes credit derivatives bought on related,\nbut not identical, reference positions (including indices, portfolio coverage and\nother reference points) as well as protection purchased by CIB through credit-\nrelated notes primarily in its market-making businesses. In addition, the Firm\nobtains credit protection against certain loans in the retained consumer portfolio\nthrough the issuance of credit-related notes. Since these credit-related notes are\nnot part of the market-making businesses they are not included in the table below.\n                                              \n  208    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nThe Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary\nmeasure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does\nnot take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the\nrecovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and\neconomic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm\u2019s view, the risks associated\nwith such derivatives.\n                                                                                  \n  Tot\u2026

investment\nbanking fees, deposit-related fees,\nasset management, administration, and\ncommissions, and components of card\nincome. The related contracts are often\nterminable on demand and the Firm has\nno remaining obligation to deliver\nfuture services. For arrangements with\na fixed term, the Firm may commit to\ndeliver services in the future. Revenue\nassociated with these remaining\nperformance obligations typically\ndepends on the occurrence of future\nevents or underlying asset values, and\nis not recognized until the outcome of\nthose events or values are known.\nInvestment banking fees This revenue\ncategory includes debt and equity\nunderwriting and advisory fees. As an\nunderwriter, the Firm helps clients\nraise capital via public offering and\nprivate placement of various types of\ndebt and equity instruments.\nUnderwriting fees are primarily based\non the issuance price and quantity of\nthe underlying instruments, and are\nrecognized as revenue typically upon\nexecution of the client\u2019s transaction.\nThe Firm also manages and syndicates\nloan arrangements. Credit arrangement\nand syndication fees, included within\ndebt underwriting fees, are recorded as\nrevenue after satisfying certain\nretention, timing and yield criteria.\nThe Firm also provides advisory\nservices, by assisting its clients with\nmergers and acquisitions, divestitures,\nrestructuring and other complex\ntransactions. Advisory fees are\nrecognized as revenue typically upon\nexecution of the client\u2019s transaction.\nThe following table presents the components of investment banking fees.\n                                                                      \n  Year ended December 31,                                             \n  (in millions)                         2021        2020        2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Underwriting                                                        \n  Equity                           $   3,969    $  2,759    $  1,648  \n  Debt                                 4,853       4,362       3,513  \n  Total underwriting                   8,822       7,121       5,161  \n  Advisory                             4,394       2,365       2,340  \n  Total investment banking fees    $  13,216    $  9,486    $  7,501  \n                                                                      \nInvestment banking fees are earned\nprimarily by CIB. Refer to Note 32 for\nsegment results.\n\nPrincipal transactions Principal\ntransactions revenue is driven by many\nfactors, including: \u2022 the bid-offer\nspread, which is the difference between\nthe price at which a market participant\nis willing and able to sell an\ninstrument to the Firm and the price at\nwhich another market participant is\nwilling and able to buy it from the\nFirm, and vice versa; and \u2022 realized\nand unrealized gains and losses on\nfinancial instruments and commodities\ntransactions, including those accounted\nfor under the fair value option,\nprimarily used in client-driven market-\nmaking activities, and on private\nequity investments. \u2013 Realized gains\nand losses result from the sale of\ninstruments, closing out or termination\nof transactions, or interim cash\npayments. \u2013 Unrealized gains and losses\nresult from changes in valuation. In\nconnection with its client-driven\nmarket-making activities, the Firm\ntransacts in debt and equity\ninstruments, derivatives and\ncommodities, including physical\ncommodities inventories and financial\ninstruments that reference commodities.\nPrincipal transactions revenue also\nincludes realized and unrealized gains\nand losses related to: \u2022 derivatives\ndesignated in qualifying hedge\naccounting relationships, primarily\nfair value hedges of commodity and\nforeign exchange risk; \u2022 derivatives\nused for specific risk management\npurposes, primarily to mitigate credit\nrisk and foreign exchange risk. Refer\nto Note 5 for further information on\nthe income statement classification of\ngains and losses from derivatives\nactivities. In the financial commodity\nmarkets, the Firm transacts in OTC\nderivatives (e.g., swaps, forwards,\noptions) and ETD that reference a wide\nrange of underlying commodities. In the\nphysical commodity markets, the Firm\nprimarily purchases and sells precious\nand base metals and may hold other\ncommodities inventories under financing\nand other arrangements with clients.\nThe following table presents all\nrealized and unrealized gains and\nlosses recorded in principal\ntransactions revenue.

The principal defined benefit pension plan in the U.S., which\ncovered substantially all U.S. employees, was closed to new participants and\nfrozen for existing participants on January 1, 2020, (and January 1, 2019 for new\nhires on or after December 2, 2017). Interest credits continue to accrue to\nparticipants\u2019 accounts based on their accumulated balances. The Firm maintains\nfunded and unfunded postretirement benefit plans that provide medical and life\ninsurance for certain eligible employees and retirees as well as their dependents\ncovered under these programs. None of these plans have a material impact on the\nFirm\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Firm also provides a qualified\ndefined contribution plan in the U.S. and maintains other similar arrangements in\ncertain non-U.S. locations. The most significant of these plans is the JPMorgan\nChase 401(k) Savings Plan (\u201cthe 401(k) Savings Plan\u201d), which covers substantially\nall U.S. employees. Employees can contribute to the 401(k) Savings Plan on a\npretax and/or Roth 401(k) after-tax basis.

Returns on asset classes are\ndeveloped using a forward-looking\napproach and are not strictly based on\nhistorical returns, with consideration\ngiven to current market conditions and\nthe portfolio mix of each plan. The\ndiscount rates used in determining the\nbenefit obligations are generally\nprovided by the Firm\u2019s actuaries, with\nthe Firm\u2019s principal defined benefit\npension plan using a rate that was\nselected by reference to the yields on\nportfolios of bonds with maturity dates\nand coupons that closely match each of\nthe plan\u2019s projected cash flows.\n\nInvestment strategy and asset\nallocation The assets of the Firm\u2019s\ndefined benefit pension plans are held\nin various trusts and are invested in\nwell-diversified portfolios of equity\nand fixed income securities, cash and\ncash equivalents, and alternative\ninvestments. The Firm regularly reviews\nthe asset allocations and asset\nmanagers, as well as other factors that\ncould impact the portfolios, which are\nrebalanced when deemed necessary. The\napproved asset allocation ranges by\nasset class for the Firm\u2019s principal\ndefined benefit plan are 42- 100% debt\nsecurities, 0- 40% equity securities,\n0- 3% real estate, and 0- 12%\nalternatives as of December 31, 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2021, assets held by\nthe Firm\u2019s defined benefit pension and\nOPEB plans do not include securities\nissued by JPMorgan Chase or its\naffiliates, except through indirect\nexposures through investments in\nexchange traded funds, mutual funds and\ncollective investment funds managed by\nthird-parties. The defined benefit\npension and OPEB plans hold investments\nthat are sponsored or managed by\naffiliates of JPMorgan Chase in the\namount of $ 2.5billion and $\n2.7billion, as of December 31, 2021

The LTIP is the only active\nplan under which the Firm is currently granting share-based incentive awards. In\nthe following discussion, the LTIP, plus prior Firm plans and plans assumed as the\nresult of acquisitions, are referred to collectively as the \u201cLTI Plans,\u201d and such\nplans constitute the Firm\u2019s share-based incentive plans. RSUs are awarded at no\ncost to the recipient upon their grant. Generally, RSUs are granted annually and\nvest at a rate of 50% after two yearsand 50% after three yearsand are converted\ninto shares of common stock as of the vesting date. In addition, RSUs typically\ninclude full-career eligibility provisions, which allow employees to continue to\nvest upon voluntary termination based on age or service-related requirements,\nsubject to post-employment and other restrictions. All RSU awards are subject to\nforfeiture until vested and contain clawback provisions that may result in\ncancellation under certain specified circumstances. Predominantly all RSUs entitle\nthe recipient to receive cash payments equivalent to any dividends paid on the\nunderlying common stock during the period the RSUs are outstanding. Performance\nshare units (\u201cPSUs\u201d) are granted annually, and approved by the Firm\u2019s Board of\nDirectors, to members of the Firm\u2019s Operating Committee under the variable\ncompensation program. PSUs are subject to the Firm\u2019s achievement of specified\nperformance criteria over a three-year period. The number of awards that vest can\nrange from zeroto 150% of the grant amount. In addition, dividends that accrue\nduring the vesting period are reinvested in dividend equivalent share units. PSUs\nand the related dividend equivalent share units are converted into shares of\ncommon stock after vesting. Once the PSUs and dividend equivalent share units have\nvested, the shares of common stock that are delivered, after applicable tax\nwithholding, must be held for an additional two-year period, for a total combined\nvesting and holding period of approximately fiveto eightyears from the grant date\ndepending on regulations in certain countries. Under the LTI Plans, stock\nappreciation rights (\u201cSARs\u201d) and stock options have generally been granted with an\nexercise price equal to the fair value of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s common stock on the\ngrant date. SARs and stock options generally expire ten yearsafter the grant date.\nIn 2021, the Firm awarded its Chairman and CEO and its President and Chief\nOperating Officer 1.5million and 750,000SARs, respectively. There were no material\ngrants of SARs or stock options in 2020 and 2019. The Firm separately recognizes\ncompensation expense for each tranche of each award, net of estimated forfeitures,\nas if it were a separate award with its own vesting date. Generally, for each\ntranche granted, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from\nthe grant date until the vesting date of the respective tranche, provided that the\nemployees will not become full-career eligible during the vesting period. For\nawards with full-career eligibility provisions and awards granted with no future\nsubstantive service requirement, the Firm accrues the estimated value of awards\nexpected to be awarded to employees as of the grant date without giving\nconsideration to the impact of post-employment restrictions. For each tranche\ngranted to employees who will become full-career eligible during the vesting\nperiod, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant\ndate until the earlier of the employee\u2019s full-career eligibility date or the\nvesting date of the respective tranche. The Firm\u2019s policy for issuing shares upon\nsettlement of employee share-based incentive awards is to issue either new shares\nof common stock or treasury shares. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Firm settled\nall of its employee share-based awards by issuing treasury shares.

Debt securities classified as\ntrading assets are discussed in Note 2.\nPredominantly all of the Firm\u2019s AFS and\nHTM securities are held by Treasury and\nCIO in connection with its asset-\nliability management activities. AFS\nsecurities are carried at fair value on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets.\nUnrealized gains and losses, after any\napplicable hedge accounting adjustments\nor allowance for credit losses, are\nreported in AOCI. The specific\nidentification method is used to\ndetermine realized gains and losses on\nAFS securities, which are included in\ninvestment securities gains/(losses) on\nthe Consolidated statements of income.\nHTM securities, which the Firm has the\nintent and ability to hold until\nmaturity, are carried at amortized\ncost, net of allowance for credit\nlosses, on the Consolidated balance\nsheets. For both AFS and HTM\nsecurities, purchase discounts or\npremiums are generally amortized into\ninterest income on a level-yield basis\nover the contractual life of the\nsecurity. However, premiums on certain\ncallable debt securities are amortized\nto the earliest call date. During the\nsecond quarter of 2021, the Firm\ntransferred $ 104.5billion of\ninvestment securities from AFS to HTM\nfor capital management purposes. AOCI\nincluded pretax unrealized gains of $\n425million on the securities at the\ndate of transfer. Unrealized gains or\nlosses at the date of transfer of these\nsecurities continue to be reported in\nAOCI and are amortized into interest\nincome on a level-yield basis over the\nremaining life of the securities. This\namortization will offset the effect on\ninterest income of the amortization of\nthe premium or discount resulting from\nthe transfer recorded at fair value.\nTransfers of securities from AFS to HTM\nare non-cash transactions and are\nrecorded at fair value.\n                                              \n  220    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n

and 2019, respectively.\n(b) The amortized cost of investment securities is reported net of allowance for\ncredit losses of $ 42million and $ 78million at December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.\n(c) Excludes $ 1.9billion and $ 2.1billion of accrued interest receivables at\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, included in accrued interest and\naccounts receivables on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm generally does\nnot recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivables,\nconsistent with its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by\nreversing interest income. The Firm did not reverse through interest income any\naccrued interest receivables for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nAt December 31, 2021 , the investment securities portfolio consisted of debt\nsecurities with an average credit rating of AA+ (based upon external ratings where\navailable, and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings).\nRisk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of securities and\ndifferentiate risk within the portfolio. The Firm\u2019s internal risk ratings\ngenerally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to\nmeet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic\nenvironment) defined by S&P and Moody\u2019s, however the quantitative characteristics\n(e.g., probability of default (\u201cPD\u201d) and loss given default (\u201cLGD\u201d)) may differ as\nthey reflect internal historical experiences and assumptions. Risk ratings are\nassigned at acquisition, reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk\nManagement and adjusted as necessary over the life of the investment for updated\ninformation affecting the issuer\u2019s ability to fulfill its obligations.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    221  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \nAFS securities impairment\nThe following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses by aging\ncategory for AFS securities at December 31, 2021 and 2020.

The Firm recognizes\nimpairment losses in earnings if the\nFirm has the intent to sell the debt\nsecurity, or if it is more likely than\nnot that the Firm will be required to\nsell the debt security before recovery\nof its amortized cost. In these\ncircumstances the impairment loss\nrecognized in investment securities\ngains/(losses) is equal to the full\ndifference between the amortized cost\n(net of allowance if applicable) and\nthe fair value of the security. For\nimpaired debt securities that the Firm\nhas the intent and ability to hold, the\nsecurities are evaluated to determine\nif a credit loss exists. If it is\ndetermined that a credit loss exists,\nthat loss is recognized as an allowance\nfor credit losses through the provision\nfor credit losses in the Consolidated\nStatements of Income, limited by the\namount of impairment. Any impairment\nnot due to credit losses is recorded in\nOCI. Factors considered in evaluating\ncredit losses include adverse\nconditions specifically related to the\nindustry, geographic area or financial\ncondition of the issuer or underlying\ncollateral of a security; and payment\nstructure of the security. When\nassessing securities issued in a\nsecuritization for credit losses, the\nFirm estimates cash flows considering\nrelevant market and economic data,\nunderlying loan-level data, and\nstructural features of the\nsecuritization, such as subordination,\nexcess spread, overcollateralization or\nother forms of credit enhancement, and\ncompares the losses projected for the\nunderlying collateral (\u201cpool losses\u201d)\nagainst the level of credit enhancement\nin the securitization structure to\ndetermine whether these features are\nsufficient to absorb the pool losses,\nor whether a credit loss exists. For\nbeneficial interests in securitizations\nthat are rated below \u201cAA\u201d at their\nacquisition, or that can be\ncontractually prepaid or otherwise\nsettled in such a way that the Firm\nwould not recover substantially all of\nits recorded investment, the Firm\nevaluates impairment for credit losses\nwhen there is an adverse change in\nexpected cash flows.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    223  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \nHTM securities \u2013 credit risk Allowance\nfor credit losses The allowance for\ncredit losses represents expected\ncredit losses over the remaining\nexpected life of HTM securities. The\nallowance for credit losses on HTM\nobligations of U.S. states and\nmunicipalities and commercial mortgage-\nbacked securities is calculated by\napplying statistical credit loss\nfactors (estimated PD and LGD) to the\namortized cost. The credit loss factors\nare derived using a weighted average of\nfive internally developed eight-quarter\nmacroeconomic scenarios, followed by a\nsingle year straight-line interpolation\nto revert to long run historical\ninformation for periods beyond the\nforecast period. Refer to Note 13 for\nfurther information on the eight-\nquarter macroeconomic forecast. The\nallowance for credit losses on HTM\ncollateralized loan obligations and\nU.S. residential mortgage-backed\nsecurities is calculated as the\ndifference between the amortized cost\nand the present value of the cash flows\nexpected to be collected, discounted at\nthe security\u2019s effective interest rate.\nThese cash flow estimates are developed\nbased on expectations of underlying\ncollateral performance derived using\nthe eight-quarter macroeconomic\nforecast and the single year straight-\nline interpolation, as well as\nconsidering the structural features of\nthe security. The application of\ndifferent inputs and assumptions into\nthe calculation of the allowance for\ncredit losses is subject to significant\nmanagement judgment, and emphasizing\none input or assumption over another,\nor considering other inputs or\nassumptions, could affect the estimate\nof the allowance for credit losses on\nHTM securities. Credit quality\nindicator The primary credit quality\nindicator for HTM securities is the\nrisk rating assigned to each security.\nAt both December 31, 2021 and 2020, all\nHTM securities were rated investment\ngrade and were current and accruing,\nwith approximately 98% rated at least\nAA+.\n\nAllowance for credit losses on\ninvestment securities The allowance for\ncredit losses on investment securities\nwas $ 42million and $ 78million as of\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.

weighted based on the amortized cost of each security. The\neffective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and\naccretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-\nequivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes\nunscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of\nsecurities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain\nsecurities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the\naverage yield is calculated to the earliest call date.\n(b) Substantially all of the Firm\u2019s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized\nmortgage obligations are due in 10years or more, based on contractual maturity.\nThe estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future\nprepayments, is approximately 6years for agency residential MBS, 4years for agency\nresidential collateralized mortgage obligations and 3years for nonagency\nresidential collateralized mortgage obligations.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    225  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Note 11 \u2013 Securities financing activities                                       \n                                                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase enters into resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities\nloaned agreements (collectively, \u201csecurities financing agreements\u201d) primarily to\nfinance the Firm\u2019s inventory positions, acquire securities to cover short sales,\naccommodate customers\u2019 financing needs, settle other securities obligations and to\ndeploy the Firm\u2019s excess cash. Securities financing agreements are treated as\ncollateralized financings on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated balance sheets. Where\nappropriate under applicable accounting guidance, securities financing agreements\nwith the same counterparty are reported on a net basis. Refer to Note 1 for\nfurther discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. Fees received and\npaid in connection with securities financing agreements are recorded over the life\nof the agreement in interest income and interest expense on the Consolidated\nstatements of income. The Firm has elected the fair value option for certain\nsecurities financing agreements. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding\nthe fair value option. The securities financing agreements for which the fair\nvalue option has been elected are reported within securities purchased under\nresale agreements, securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, and\nsecurities borrowed on the Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements\ncarried at fair value, current-period interest accruals are recorded within\ninterest income and interest expense, with changes in fair value reported in\nprincipal transactions revenue. However, for financial instruments containing\nembedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with\naccounting guidance for hybrid instruments, all changes in fair value, including\nany interest elements, are reported in principal transactions revenue. Securities\nfinancing agreements not elected under the fair value option are measured at\namortized cost. As a result of the Firm\u2019s credit risk mitigation practices\ndescribed below, the Firm did not hold any allowance for credit losses with\nrespect to resale and securities borrowed arrangements as of December 31, 2021 and\n2020. Credit risk mitigation practices Securities financing agreements expose the\nFirm primarily to credit and liquidity risk. To manage these risks, the Firm\nmonitors the value of the underlying securities (predominantly high-quality\nsecurities collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. GSEs and\ngovernment agencies MBS) that it has received from or provided to its\ncounterparties compared to the value of cash proceeds and exchanged collateral,\nand either requests additional collateral or returns securities or collateral when\nappropriate. Margin levels are initially established based upon the counterparty,\nthe type of underlying securities, and the permissible collateral, and are\nmonitored on an ongoing basis. In resale and securities borrowed agreements, the\nFirm is exposed to credit risk to the extent that the value of the securities\nreceived is less than initial cash principal advanced and any collateral amounts\nexchanged. In repurchase and securities loaned agreements, credit risk exposure\narises to the extent that the value of underlying securities advanced exceeds the\nvalue of the initial cash principal received, and any collateral amounts\nexchanged. Additionally, the Firm typically enters into master netting agreements\nand other similar arrangements with its counterparties, which provide for the\nright to liquidate the underlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged\nin the event of a counterparty default. It is also the Firm\u2019s policy to take\npossession, where possible, of the securities underlying resale and securities\nborrowed agreements. Refer to Note 29 for further information regarding assets\npledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements.\n                                              \n  226    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nThe table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm\u2019s securities\nfinancing agreements, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. When the Firm has obtained\nan appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a\ncounterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met,\nthe Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under\nits securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the\nFirm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce\nthe economic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible\nfor net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an\nappropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master netting\nagreement, such collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not\nmeet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the\ntable below as \u201cAmounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,\u201d and\nreduces the \u201cNet amounts\u201d presented. Where a legal opinion has not been either\nsought or obtained, the securities financing balances are presented gross in the\n\u201cNet amounts\u201d below. In transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a\nsecurities-for-securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be\npledged or sold as collateral, the Firm recognizes the securities received at fair\nvalue within other assets and the obligation to return those securities within\naccounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n

The Firm accounts for loans based on the following\ncategories: \u2022 Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., \u201cretained\u201d)\n\u2022 Loans held-for-sale \u2022 Loans at fair value The following provides a detailed\naccounting discussion of the Firm\u2019s loans by category: Loans held-for-investment\nOriginated or purchased loans held-for-investment, including PCD, are recorded at\namortized cost, reflecting the principal amount outstanding, net of the following:\nunamortized deferred loan fees, costs, premiums or discounts; charge-offs;\ncollection of cash; and foreign exchange. Credit card loans also include billed\nfinance charges and fees. Interest income Interest income on performing loans\nheld-for-investment is accrued and recognized as interest income at the\ncontractual rate of interest. Purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net\ndeferred loan fees or costs, are amortized into interest income over the\ncontractual life of the loan as an adjustment of yield. The Firm classifies\naccrued interest on loans, including accrued but unbilled interest on credit card\nloans, in accrued interest and accounts receivables on the Consolidated balance\nsheets. For credit card loans, accrued interest once billed is then recognized in\nthe loan balances, with the related allowance recorded in the allowance for credit\nlosses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses on accrued interest on credit\ncard loans are recognized in the provision for credit losses and charge-offs are\nrecognized by reversing interest income. Expected losses related to accrued\ninterest on certain performing, modified loans to borrowers impacted by COVID-19\nare considered in the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses. For other loans, the Firm\ngenerally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest\nreceivables, consistent with its policy to write them off no later than 90 days\npast due by reversing interest income. Nonaccrual loans Nonaccrual loans are those\non which the accrual of interest has been suspended. Loans (other than credit card\nloans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed\non nonaccrual status and considered nonperforming when full payment of principal\nand interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal\nand interest has been in default for a period of 90days or more, unless the loan\nis both well-secured and in the process of collection. A loan is determined to be\npast due when the minimum payment is not received from the borrower by the\ncontractually specified due date or for certain loans (e.g., residential real\nestate loans), when a monthly payment is due and unpaid for 30days or more.\nFinally, collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status.\nOn the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all interest accrued but not\ncollected is reversed against interest income. In addition, the amortization of\ndeferred amounts is suspended. Interest income on nonaccrual loans may be\nrecognized as cash interest payments are received (i.e., on a cash basis) if the\nrecorded loan balance is deemed fully collectible; however, if there is doubt\nregarding the ultimate collectibility of the recorded loan balance, all interest\ncash receipts are applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan (the cost\nrecovery method). For consumer loans, application of this policy typically results\nin the Firm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual consumer loans on a cash\nbasis. A loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is reasonably\nassured and there has been demonstrated performance under the terms of the loan\nor, if applicable, the terms of the restructured loan. As permitted by regulatory\nguidance, credit card loans are generally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual\nstatus; accordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans continue to\naccrue until the loan is charged off or paid in full. Allowance for loan losses\nThe allowance for loan losses represents the estimated expected credit losses in\nthe held-for-investment loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and is recognized\non the balance sheet as a contra asset, which brings the amortized cost to the net\ncarrying value. Changes in the allowance for loan losses are recorded in the\nprovision for credit losses on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated statements of income. Refer\nto Note 13 for further information on the Firm\u2019s accounting policies for the\nallowance for loan losses. Charge-offs Consumer loans are generally charged off or\ncharged down to the lower of the amortized cost or the net realizable value of the\nunderlying collateral (i.e., fair value less estimated costs to sell), with an\noffset to the allowance for loan losses, upon reaching specified stages of\ndelinquency in accordance with standards established by the FFIEC. Residential\nreal estate loans, unmodified credit card loans and scored business banking loans\nare generally charged off no later than 180days past due. Scored auto and modified\ncredit card loans are charged off no later than 120days past due. Certain consumer\nloans are charged off or charged down to their net realizable value earlier than\nthe FFIEC charge-off standards in certain circumstances as follows: \u2022 Loans\nmodified in a TDR that are determined to be collateral-dependent.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    229  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \n\u2022 Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event that suggests a loss is either\nknown or highly certain are subject to accelerated charge-off standards (e.g.,\nresidential real estate and auto loans are charged off or charged down within\n60days of receiving notification of a bankruptcy filing). \u2022 Auto loans upon\nrepossession of the automobile. Other than in certain limited circumstances, the\nFirm typically does not recognize charge-offs on the government-guaranteed portion\nof loans. Wholesale loans are charged off when it is highly certain that a loss\nhas been realized. The determination of whether to recognize a charge-off includes\nmany factors, including the prioritization of the Firm\u2019s claim in bankruptcy,\nexpectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and valuation of the\nborrower\u2019s equity or the loan collateral. When a loan is charged down to the lower\nof its amortized cost or the estimated net realizable value of the underlying\ncollateral, the determination of the fair value of the collateral depends on the\ntype of collateral (e.g., securities, real estate). In cases where the collateral\nis in the form of liquid securities, the fair value is based on quoted market\nprices or broker quotes. For illiquid securities or other financial assets, the\nfair value of the collateral is generally estimated using a discounted cash flow\nmodel. For residential real estate loans, collateral values are based upon\nexternal valuation sources. When it becomes likely that a borrower is either\nunable or unwilling to pay, the Firm utilizes a broker\u2019s price opinion, appraisal\nand/or an automated valuation model of the home based on an exterior-only\nvaluation (\u201cexterior opinions\u201d), which is then updated at least every 12months, or\nmore frequently depending on various market factors. As soon as practicable after\nthe Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt (e.g., by taking legal\ntitle or physical possession), the Firm generally obtains an appraisal based on an\ninspection that includes the interior of the home (\u201cinterior appraisals\u201d).\nExterior opinions and interior appraisals are discounted based upon the Firm\u2019s\nexperience with actual liquidation values as compared with the estimated values\nprovided by exterior opinions and interior appraisals, considering state-specific\nfactors. For commercial real estate loans, collateral values are generally based\non appraisals from internal and external valuation sources. Collateral values are\ntypically updated every sixto twelve months, either by obtaining a new appraisal\nor by performing an internal analysis, in accordance with the Firm\u2019s policies. The\nFirm also considers both borrower- and market-specific factors, which may result\nin obtaining appraisal updates or broker price opinions at more frequent\nintervals. Loans held-for-sale Loans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of\ncost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in noninterest revenue. For\nconsumer loans, the valuation is performed on a portfolio basis. For wholesale\nloans, the valuation is performed on an individual loan basis. Interest income on\nloans held-for-sale is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of\ninterest. Loan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts or premiums\nare deferred in a contra loan account until the related loan is sold. The deferred\nfees or costs and discounts or premiums are an adjustment to the basis of the loan\nand therefore are included in the periodic determination of the lower of cost or\nfair value adjustments and/or the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale.\nBecause these loans are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value, the Firm\u2019s\nallowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans.\nHowever, loans held-for-sale are subject to the nonaccrual policies described\nabove. Loans at fair value Loans for which the fair value option has been elected\nare measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest\nrevenue. Interest income on these loans is accrued and recognized based on the\ncontractual rate of interest. Changes in fair value are recognized in noninterest\nrevenue. Loan origination fees are recognized upfront in noninterest revenue. Loan\norigination costs are recognized in the associated expense category as incurred.\nBecause these loans are recognized at fair value, the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan\nlosses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans at fair\nvalue are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above. Refer to Note 3 for\nfurther information on the Firm\u2019s elections of fair value accounting under the\nfair value option. Refer to Note 2 and Note 3 for further information on loans\ncarried at fair value and classified as trading assets.\n                                              \n  230    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nLoan classification changes Loans in the held-for-investment portfolio that\nmanagement decides to sell are transferred to the held-for-sale portfolio at the\nlower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer. Credit-related losses are\ncharged against the allowance for loan losses; non-credit related losses such as\nthose due to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are\nrecognized in noninterest revenue. In the event that management decides to retain\na loan in the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to the held-for-\ninvestment portfolio at amortized cost on the date of transfer. These loans are\nsubsequently assessed for impairment based on the Firm\u2019s allowance methodology.\nRefer to Note 13 for a further discussion of the methodologies used in\nestablishing the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses. Loan modifications The Firm\nseeks to modify certain loans in conjunction with its loss mitigation activities.\nThrough the modification, JPMorgan Chase grants one or more concessions to a\nborrower who is experiencing financial difficulty in order to minimize the Firm\u2019s\neconomic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral, and to\nultimately maximize payments received by the Firm from the borrower. The\nconcessions granted vary by program and by borrower-specific characteristics, and\nmay include interest rate reductions, term extensions, payment delays, principal\nforgiveness, or the acceptance of equity or other assets in lieu of payments. Such\nmodifications are accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term and\nother insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not\nTDRs. Loans, except for credit card loans, modified in a TDR are generally placed\non nonaccrual status, although in many cases such loans were already on nonaccrual\nstatus prior to modification. These loans may be returned to performing status\n(the accrual of interest is resumed) if the following criteria are met: (i) the\nborrower has performed under the modified terms for a minimum of six monthsand/or\nsixpayments, and (ii) the Firm has an expectation that repayment of the modified\nloan is reasonably assured based on, for example, the borrower\u2019s debt capacity and\nlevel of future earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other current market\nconsiderations. In certain limited and well-defined circumstances in which the\nloan is current at the modification date, such loans are not placed on nonaccrual\nstatus at the time of modification. Loans modified in TDRs are generally measured\nfor impairment using the Firm\u2019s established asset-specific allowance methodology,\nwhich considers the expected re-default rates for the modified loans. A loan\nmodified in a TDR generally remains subject to the asset-specific component of the\nallowance throughout its remaining life, regardless of whether the loan is\nperforming and has been returned to accrual status. Refer to Note 13 for further\ndiscussion of the methodology used to estimate the Firm\u2019s asset-specific\nallowance. The Firm granted various forms of assistance to customers and clients\nimpacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including payment deferrals and covenant\nmodifications. The majority of the Firm\u2019s COVID-19 related loan modifications have\nnot been considered TDRs because: \u2022 they represent short-term or other\ninsignificant modifications, whether under the Firm\u2019s regular loan modification\nassessments or as permitted by regulatory guidance, or \u2022 the Firm elected to\nsuspend TDR accounting guidance under the option provided by the CARES Act, as\nextended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act and which expired on January 1,\n2022. To the extent that certain modifications did not meet any of the above\ncriteria, the Firm accounted for them as TDRs. As permitted by regulatory\nguidance, the Firm did not place loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 on\nnonaccrual status where such loans were not otherwise reportable as nonaccrual.\nThe Firm considered expected losses of principal and accrued interest associated\nwith all COVID-19 related loan modifications in its allowance for credit losses.\nAssistance provided in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could delay the\nrecognition of delinquencies, nonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for those\ncustomers who would have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status.\nForeclosed property The Firm acquires property from borrowers through loan\nrestructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. Property acquired may include real\nproperty (e.g., residential real estate, land, and buildings) and commercial and\npersonal property (e.g., automobiles, aircraft, railcars, and ships). The Firm\nrecognizes foreclosed property upon receiving assets in satisfaction of a loan\n(e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession). For loans collateralized by\nreal property, the Firm generally recognizes the asset received at foreclosure\nsale or upon the execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction with the\nborrower. Foreclosed assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets and initially recognized at fair value less estimated costs to\nsell. Each quarter the fair value of the acquired property is reviewed and\nadjusted, if necessary, to the lower of cost or fair value. Subsequent adjustments\nto fair value are charged/credited to noninterest revenue. Operating expense, such\nas real estate taxes and maintenance, are charged to other expense. Foreclosures\nhave resumed after having been temporarily suspended in response to the COVID-19\npandemic.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    231  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \nLoan portfolio\nThe Firm\u2019s loan portfolio is divided into threeportfolio segments, which are the\nsame segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses:\nConsumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale.

As the loan continues to age, it becomes more clear whether the\nborrower is likely to be unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential\nreal estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater than 150 days past due) are a\nstrong indicator of loans that will ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar\nliquidation transaction. In addition to delinquency rates, other credit quality\nindicators for consumer loans vary based on the class of loan, as follows: \u2022 For\nresidential real estate loans, the current estimated LTV ratio, or the combined\nLTV ratio in the case of junior lien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss\nseverity in the event of default. Additionally, LTV or combined LTV ratios can\nprovide insight into a borrower\u2019s continued willingness to pay, as the delinquency\nrate of high-LTV loans tends to be greater than that for loans where the borrower\nhas equity in the collateral. The geographic distribution of the loan collateral\nalso provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio, as factors such\nas the regional economy, home price changes and specific events such as natural\ndisasters, will affect credit quality. The borrower\u2019s current or \u201crefreshed\u201d FICO\nscore is a secondary credit quality indicator for certain loans, as FICO scores\nare an indication of the borrower\u2019s credit payment history. Thus, a loan to a\nborrower with a low FICO score (less than 660) is considered to be of higher risk\nthan a loan to a borrower with a higher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower\nwith a high LTV ratio and a low FICO score is at greater risk of default than a\nloan to a borrower that has both a high LTV ratio and a high FICO score. \u2022 For\nscored auto and business banking loans, geographic distribution is an indicator of\nthe credit performance of the portfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans,\ngeographic distribution provides insights into the portfolio performance based on\nregional economic activity and events.\n                                              \n  234    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nResidential real estate\nThe following tables provide information on delinquency, which is the primary\ncredit quality indicator for retained residential real estate loans.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                      \u2026           \n                                  \u2026                                               \n                   \u2026              \u2026                                               \n                                  \u2026                                               \n                                                                                  \n                   \u2026    $         \u2026    $             $         \u2026             \u2026    \n                   \u2026              \u2026                            \u2026             \u2026    \n                   \u2026              \u2026                            \u2026             \u2026    \n                   \u2026    $         \u2026    $             $         \u2026             \u2026    \n                   \u2026         %    \u2026         %             %    \u2026             \u2026    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n(a) Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S.\ngovernment agencies as follows: current included $ 35million and $ 36million;\n30\u2013149 days past due included $ 11million and $ 16million; and 150 or more days\npast due included $ 20million and $ 24million at December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.\n(b) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, loans under payment deferral programs offered\nin response to the COVID-19 pandemic which are still within their deferral period\nand performing according to their modified terms are generally not considered\ndelinquent.\n(c) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, residential real estate loans excluded mortgage\nloans insured by U.S. government agencies of $ 31million and $ 40million,\nrespectively, that are 30 or more days past due.

residential real estate loans that are charged\ndown to the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm\nreports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans\nthat have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the\nborrower (\u201cChapter 7 loans\u201d) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless\nof their delinquency status. At December 31, 2021, approximately 7% of Chapter 7\nresidential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.\n\n(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with\nregulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-\ndependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value\nof their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying\ncollateral improves subsequent to the charge down, the related allowance may be\nnegative.\n\n(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $\n172million and $ 161million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.\n\n(d) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response\nto the COVID-19 pandemic. Includes loans to customers that have exited COVID-19\npayment related deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly\nall of which were considered collateral-dependent at time of exit.\n\n(e) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed\nby U.S government agencies. Typically the principal balance of the loans is\ninsured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to\nmeeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, these\nbalances were no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing\nguidelines. There were noloans that were not guaranteed by U.S. government\nagencies that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at December\n31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n(f) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the\nestimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a\nminimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized\nhome price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent\navailable and forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current\nestimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available\nlien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.\n\n(g) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower\u2019s most recent credit score,\nwhich is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.\n\n(h) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, included residential real estate loans,\nprimarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO score. These\nloans have been included in a FICO band based on management\u2019s estimation of the\nborrower\u2019s credit quality.\n\n(i) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current\npresentation.\n\n(j) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.\n\n(k) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the\nmagnitude of the corresponding loan balances at December 31, 2021.\n\n(l) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, included mortgage loans insured by U.S.\ngovernment agencies of $ 66million and $ 76million, respectively.

Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications\nthat are not considered concessions are not TDRs nor are loans for which the Firm\nhas elected to suspend TDR accounting guidance under the option provided by the\nCARES Act. The carrying value of new TDRs was $ 866million, $ 819million and $\n490million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThere were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real\nestate loans have been modified in TDRs. Nature and extent of modifications The\nFirm\u2019s proprietary modification programs as well as government programs, including\nU.S. GSE programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled\nborrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment\nextensions and delays of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise\nhave been required under the terms of the original agreement. The following table\nprovides information about how residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs\nunder the Firm\u2019s loss mitigation programs described above during the periods\npresented. This table excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted\nis the discharge of debt, loans with short-term or other insignificant\nmodifications that are not considered concessions, and loans for which the Firm\nhas elected to suspend TDR accounting guidance under the option provided by the\nCARES Act.\n                                                                                  \n  Year ended December 31,                     2021           2020           2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Number of loans approved for a                                                  \n  trial                                6,246          5,522          5,872        \n  modification                                                                    \n  Number of loans permanently          4,588          6,850          4,918        \n  modified                                                                        \n  Concession granted:(a)                                                          \n  Interest rate reduction                 74  %          50  %          77  %     \n  Term or payment extension               53             49             71        \n  Principal and/or interest               23             14             13        \n  deferred                                                                        \n  Principal forgiveness                    2              2              5        \n  Other(b)                                36             66             63        \n                                                                                  \n(a) Represents concessions granted in permanent modifications as a percentage of\nthe number of loans permanently modified.

Typically the principal\nbalance of the loans is insured and\ninterest is guaranteed at a specified\nreimbursement rate subject to meeting\nthe guidelines set by the SBA. There\nwere noloans that were not guaranteed\nby the SBA that are 90 or more days\npast due and still accruing interest at\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual\nloans have an allowance. In accordance\nwith regulatory guidance, certain\nnonaccrual loans that are considered\ncollateral-dependent have been charged\ndown to the lower of amortized cost or\nthe fair value of their underlying\ncollateral less costs to sell. If the\nvalue of the underlying collateral\nimproves subsequent to the charge down,\nthe related allowance may be negative.\n\n(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans\nrecognized on a cash basis was not\nmaterial for the years ended December\n31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n(d) The geographic regions presented in\nthis table are ordered based on the\nmagnitude of the corresponding loan\nbalances at December 31, 2021.\n\nLoan modifications Certain auto and\nother loan modifications are considered\nto be TDRs as they provide various\nconcessions to borrowers who are\nexperiencing financial difficulty.\nLoans with short-term or other\ninsignificant modifications that are\nnot considered concessions are not\nTDRs. The impact of these\nmodifications, as well as new TDRs,\nwere not material to the Firm for the\nyears ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and\n2019. Additional commitments to lend to\nborrowers whose loans have been\nmodified in TDRs as of December 31,\n2021 and 2020 were not material.\n                                              \n  240    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nCredit card loan portfolio\n\nThe credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans originated and\npurchased by the Firm. Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator\nfor credit card loans as they provide an early warning that borrowers may be\nexperiencing difficulties (30 days past due); information on those borrowers that\nhave been delinquent for a longer period of time (90 days past due) is also\nconsidered. In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of the\nloans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on the\nregional economy. While the borrower\u2019s credit score is another general indicator\nof credit quality, the Firm does not view credit scores as a primary indicator of\ncredit quality because the borrower\u2019s credit score tends to be a lagging\nindicator. The distribution of such scores provides a general indicator of credit\nquality trends within the portfolio; however, the score does not capture all\nfactors that would be predictive of future credit performance. Refreshed FICO\nscore information, which is obtained at least quarterly, for a statistically\nsignificant random sample of the credit card portfolio is indicated in the\nfollowing table. FICO is considered to be the industry benchmark for credit\nscores. The Firm generally originates new card accounts to prime consumer\nborrowers. However, certain cardholders\u2019 FICO scores may decrease over time,\ndepending on the performance of the cardholder and changes in the credit score\ncalculation.\n\nThe following tables provide information on delinquency, which is the primary\ncredit quality indicator for retained credit card loans.\n                                                                                  \n  (in

modifications\n\nThe Firm may offer loan modification\nprograms granting concessions to credit\ncard borrowers who are experiencing\nfinancial difficulty. The Firm grants\nconcessions for most of the credit card\nloans under long-term programs. These\nmodifications involve placing the\ncustomer on a fixed payment plan,\ngenerally for 60months, and typically\ninclude reducing the interest rate on\nthe credit card. Substantially all\nmodifications under the Firm\u2019s long-\nterm programs are considered to be\nTDRs. Loans with short-term or other\ninsignificant modifications that are\nnot considered concessions are not\nTDRs. If the cardholder does not comply\nwith the modified payment terms, then\nthe credit card loan continues to age\nand will ultimately be charged-off in\naccordance with the Firm\u2019s standard\ncharge-off policy. In most cases, the\nFirm does not reinstate the borrower\u2019s\nline of credit.\n\nFinancial effects of modifications and\nredefaults\n\nThe following table provides\ninformation about the financial effects\nof the concessions granted on credit\ncard loans modified in TDRs and\nredefaults for the periods presented.\nFor all periods disclosed, new\nenrollments were less than 1% of total\nretained credit card loans.\n                                                                                  \n  Year ended December 31,                                                         \n  (in millions, except                                                            \n  weighted-average data)                    2021            2020            2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Balance of new TDRs(a)          $    393        $    818        $    961        \n  Weighted-average interest                                                       \n  rate of loans                      17.75  %        18.04  %        19.07  %     \n  \u2013 before TDR                                                                    \n  Weighted-average interest                                                       \n  rate of loans                       5.14            4.64            4.70        \n  \u2013 after TDR                                                                     \n  Balance of loans that                                                           \n  redefaulted within              $     57        $    110        $    148        \n  one year of modification(b)                                                     \n                                                                                  \n(a) Represents the outstanding balance\nprior to modification.\n\n(b) Represents loans modified in TDRs\nthat experienced a payment default in\nthe periods presented, and for which\nthe payment default occurred within one\nyearof the modification.

The primary\ncredit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the internal risk rating assigned\nto each loan. Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of loans and\ndifferentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings on loans consider the PD and\nthe LGD. The PD is the likelihood that a loan will default. The LGD is the\nestimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon the default of the borrower\nand takes into consideration collateral and structural support for each credit\nfacility. Management considers several factors to determine an appropriate\ninternal risk rating, including the obligor\u2019s debt capacity and financial\nflexibility, the level of the obligor\u2019s earnings, the amount and sources for\nrepayment, the level and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the\nindustry and geography in which the obligor operates. The Firm\u2019s internal risk\nratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower\ncapacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the\neconomic environment) defined by S&P and Moody\u2019s, however the quantitative\ncharacteristics (e.g., PD and LGD) may differ as they reflect internal historical\nexperiences and assumptions. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with\nqualitative characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade,\nand these ratings have a lower PD and/or lower LGD than non-investment grade\nratings. Noninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as noncriticized and\ncriticized, and the criticized portion is further subdivided into performing and\nnonaccrual loans, representing management\u2019s assessment of the collectibility of\nprincipal and interest. Criticized loans have a higher PD than noncriticized\nloans. The Firm\u2019s definition of criticized aligns with the U.S. banking regulatory\ndefinition of criticized exposures, which consist of special mention, substandard\nand doubtful categories. Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis\nby Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary for updated information\naffecting the obligor\u2019s ability to fulfill its obligations.

The allowance for credit losses comprises: \u2022 the allowance for loan\nlosses, which covers the Firm\u2019s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated)\nand is presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets, \u2022 the allowance\nfor lending-related commitments, which is presented on the Consolidated balance\nsheets in accounts payable and other liabilities, and \u2022 the allowance for credit\nlosses on investment securities, which is recognized within investment securities\non the Consolidated balance sheets. The income statement effect of all changes in\nthe allowance for credit losses is recognized in the provision for credit losses.\nDetermining the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is complex and\nrequires significant judgment by management about the effect of matters that are\ninherently uncertain. At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is\nreviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the Firm. Subsequent\nevaluations of credit exposures, considering the macroeconomic conditions,\nforecasts and other factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in\nthe allowance for credit losses in future periods. The Firm\u2019s policies used to\ndetermine its allowance for loan losses and its allowance for lending-related\ncommitments are described in the following paragraphs. Refer to Note 10 for a\ndescription of the policies used to determine the allowance for credit losses on\ninvestment securities. Methodology for allowances for loan losses and lending-\nrelated commitments The allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-\nrelated commitments represents expected credit losses over the remaining expected\nlife of retained loans and lending-related commitments that are not\nunconditionally cancellable. The Firm does not record an allowance for future\ndraws on unconditionally cancellable lending-related commitments (e.g., credit\ncards). Expected losses related to accrued interest on credit card loans and\ncertain performing, modified loans to borrowers impacted by COVID-19 are\nconsidered in the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses. However, the Firm does not\nrecord an allowance on other accrued interest receivables, due to its policy to\nwrite t hese receivables off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest\nincome. The expected life of each instrument is determined by considering its\ncontractual term, expected prepayments, cancellation features, and certain\nextension and call options. The expected life of funded credit card loans is\ngenerally estimated by considering expected future payments on the credit card\naccount, and determining how much of those amounts should be allocated to\nrepayments of the funded loan balance (as of the balance sheet date) versus other\naccount activity. This allocation is made using an approach that incorporates the\npayment application requirements of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility\nand Disclosure Act of 2009, generally paying down the highest interest rate\nbalances first. The estimate of expected credit losses includes expected\nrecoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off, even\nif such recoveries result in a negative allowance. Collective and Individual\nAssessments When calculating the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for\nlending-related commitments, the Firm assesses whether exposures share similar\nrisk characteristics. If similar risk characteristics exist, the Firm estimates\nexpected credit losses collectively, considering the risk associated with a\nparticular pool and the probability that the exposures within the pool will\ndeteriorate or default. The assessment of risk characteristics is subject to\nsignificant management judgment. Emphasizing one characteristic over another or\nconsidering additional characteristics could affect the allowance. \u2022 Relevant risk\ncharacteristics for the consumer portfolio include product type, delinquency\nstatus, current FICO scores, geographic distribution, and, for collateralized\nloans, current LTV ratios. \u2022 Relevant risk characteristics for the wholesale\nportfolio include LOB, geography, risk rating, delinquency status, level and type\nof collateral, industry, credit enhancement, product type, facility purpose,\ntenor, and payment terms. The majority of the Firm\u2019s credit exposures share risk\ncharacteristics with other similar exposures, and as a result are collectively\nassessed for impairment (\u201cportfolio-based component\u201d). The portfolio-based\ncomponent covers consumer loans, performing risk-rated loans and certain lending-\nrelated commitments. If an exposure does not share risk characteristics with other\nexposures, the Firm generally estimates expected credit losses on an individual\nbasis, considering expected repayment and conditions impacting that individual\nexposure (\u201casset-specific component\u201d). The asset-specific component covers\nmodified PCD loans, loans modified or reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR,\ncollateral-dependent loans, as well as, risk-rated loans that have been placed on\nnonaccrual status. Portfolio-based component The portfolio-based component begins\nwith a quantitative calculation that considers the likelihood of the borrower\nchanging delinquency status or moving from one risk rating to another. The\nquantitative calculation covers expected credit losses over an instrument\u2019s\nexpected life and is estimated by applying credit loss factors to the Firm\u2019s\nestimated exposure at default. The credit loss factors incorporate the probability\nof borrower default as well as loss severity in the event of default. They are\nderived using\n                                              \n  248    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                              \na weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios over an\neight-quarter forecast period, followed by a single year straight-line\ninterpolation to revert to long run historical information for periods beyond the\neight-quarter forecast period. The five macroeconomic scenarios consist of a\ncentral, relative adverse, extreme adverse, relative upside and extreme upside\nscenario, and are updated by the Firm\u2019s central forecasting team. The scenarios\ntake into consideration the Firm\u2019s macroeconomic outlook, internal perspectives\nfrom subject matter experts across the Firm, and market consensus and involve a\ngoverned process that incorporates feedback from senior management across LOBs,\nCorporate Finance and Risk Management. The quantitative calculation is adjusted to\ntake into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and\nother subjective factors that are not yet reflected in the calculation. These\nadjustments are accomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss experience,\nincluding during stressed periods, for each major product or model. Management\napplies judgment in making this adjustment, including taking into account\nuncertainties associated with the economic and political conditions, quality of\nunderwriting standards, borrower behavior, credit concentrations or deterioration\nwithin an industry, product or portfolio, as well as other relevant internal and\nexternal factors affecting the credit quality of the portfolio. In certain\ninstances, the interrelationships between these factors create further\nuncertainties. The application of different inputs into the quantitative\ncalculation, and the assumptions used by management to adjust the quantitative\ncalculation, are subject to significant management judgment, and emphasizing one\ninput or assumption over another, or considering other inputs or assumptions,\ncould affect the estimate of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for\nlending-related commitments. Asset-specific component To determine the asset-\nspecific component of the allowance, collateral-dependent loans (including those\nloans for which foreclosure is probable) and larger, nonaccrual risk-rated loans\nin the wholesale portfolio segment are generally evaluated individually, while\nsmaller loans (both scored and risk-rated) are aggregated for evaluation using\nfactors relevant for the respective class of assets. The Firm generally measures\nthe asset-specific allowance as the difference between the amortized cost of the\nloan and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted\nat the loan\u2019s original effective interest rate. Subsequent changes in impairment\nare generally recognized as an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses. For\ncollateral-dependent loans, the fair value of collateral less estimated costs to\nsell is used to determine the charge-off amount for declines in value (to reduce\nthe amortized cost of the loan to the fair value of collateral) or the amount of\nnegative allowance that should be recognized (for recoveries of prior charge-offs\nassociated with improvements in the fair value of collateral). The asset-specific\ncomponent of the allowance for loans that have been or are expected to be modified\nin TDRs incorporates the effect of the modification on the loan\u2019s expected cash\nflows (including forgone interest, principal forgiveness, as well as other\nconcessions), and also the potential for redefault. For residential real estate\nloans modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs, the Firm develops product-\nspecific probability of default estimates, which are applied at a loan level to\ncompute expected losses. In developing these probabilities of default, the Firm\nconsiders the relationship between the credit quality characteristics of the\nunderlying loans and certain assumptions about housing prices and unemployment,\nbased upon industry-wide data. The Firm also considers its own historical loss\nexperience to-date based on actual redefaulted modified loans. For credit card\nloans modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate\nprojected delinquencies and charge-offs based on the Firm\u2019s historical experience\nby type of modification program. For wholesale loans modified or expected to be\nmodified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate management\u2019s expectation of the\nborrower\u2019s ability to repay under the modified terms. Estimating the timing and\namounts of future cash flows is highly judgmental as these cash flow projections\nrely upon estimates such as loss severities, asset valuations, default rates\n(including redefault rates on modified loans), the amounts and timing of interest\nor principal payments (including any expected prepayments) or other factors that\nare reflective of current and expected market conditions. These estimates are, in\nturn, dependent on factors such as the duration of current overall economic\nconditions, industry, portfolio, or borrower-specific factors, the expected\noutcome of insolvency proceedings as well as, in certain circumstances, other\neconomic factors. All of these estimates and assumptions require significant\nmanagement judgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    249  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \nAllowance for credit losses and related information\nThe table below summarizes information about the allowances for credit losses, and\nincludes a breakdown of loans and lending-related commitments by impairment\nmethodology.

A write-off of a PCI loan was recognized when the underlying loan was\nremoved from a pool.\n(c) Includes collateral dependent loans, including those considered TDRs and those\nfor which foreclosure is deemed probable, modified PCD loans and non-collateral\ndependent loans that have been modified or are reasonably expected to be modified\nin a TDR.

The asset-\nspecific credit card allowance for loans modified, or reasonably expected to be\nmodified, in a TDR is calculated based on the loans\u2019 original contractual interest\nrates and does not consider any incremental penalty rates.\n\n(d) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable\nand other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n\n(e) At December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, lending-related commitments excluded $\n15.7billion, $ 19.5billion and $ 9.8billion, respectively, for the consumer,\nexcluding credit card portfolio segment; $ 730.5billion, $ 658.5billion and $\n650.7billion, respectively, for the credit card portfolio segment; and $\n32.1billion, $ 25.3billion and $ 24.1billion, respectively, for the wholesale\nportfolio segment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-related\ncommitments.

from $ 30.8billion at December 31, 2020. The decrease in the allowance\nfor credit losses was primarily driven by improvements in the macroeconomic\nenvironment, consisting of: \u2022 a $ 9.5billion reduction in consumer, predominantly\nin the credit card portfolio; and \u2022 a $ 2.6billion net reduction in wholesale,\nacross the LOBs. The Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses is estimated using a\nweighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, the Firm assigned more balanced weightings to both its adverse\nand upside scenarios compared to the significant weighting that the Firm placed on\nits adverse scenarios as of December 31, 2020, reflecting the sustained\nimprovement and resilience of the macroeconomic environment, despite the ongoing\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, because the impact of the COVID-19\npandemic and governmental actions taken in response to the pandemic caused a\ndislocation in certain historical relationships used for modeling credit loss\nestimates, the Firm continues to place reliance on management judgment and make\nadjustments specific to that dislocation, although to a lesser extent than in\n2020. The allowance for credit losses of $ 18.7billion reflects remaining\nuncertainties, including the potential impact that additional waves or variants of\nCOVID-19 may have on the pace of economic growth and near-term supply chain\ndisruptions.\nThe Firm\u2019s central case assumptions\nreflected U.S. unemployment rates and\nyear over year growth in U.S. real GDP\nas follows:\n                                                                                  \n                                Assumptions at December                           \n                                               31, 2021                           \n                                                   2Q22       4Q22       2Q23     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. unemployment                                 4.2  %     4.0  %     3.9  %  \n  rate(a)                                                                         \n  YoY growth in U.S. real                           3.1  %     2.8  %     2.1  %  \n  GDP(b)                                                                          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                Assumptions at December                           \n                                               31, 2020                           \n                                                   2Q21       4Q21       2Q22     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. unemployment                                 6.8  %     5.7  %     5.1  %  \n  rate(a)                                                                         \n  YoY growth in U.S. real                           9.2  %     3.5  %     3.9  %  \n  GDP(b)                                                                          \n                                                                                  \n(a) Reflects quarterly average of\nforecasted U.S. unemployment rate.\n(b) As of December 31, 2021, the year\nover year growth in U.S. real GDP in\nthe forecast horizon of the central\nscenario is calculated as the percent\nchange in U.S. real GDP levels from the\nprior year.

As asset manager of the funds, AWM earns a fee based on assets\nmanaged; the fee varies with each fund\u2019s investment objective and is competitively\npriced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AWM\u2019s interests are, in certain\ncases, considered to be significant variable interests that result in\nconsolidation of the financial results of these entities.\n\n\u2022 Commercial Banking: CB provides financing and lending-related services to a wide\nspectrum of clients, including certain third-party-sponsored entities that may\nmeet the definition of a VIE. CB does not control the activities of these entities\nand does not consolidate these entities. CB\u2019s maximum loss exposure, regardless of\nwhether the entity is a VIE, is generally limited to loans and lending-related\ncommitments which are reported and disclosed in the same manner as any other\nthird-party transaction.\n\n\u2022 Corporate : Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of\nVIEs; however these entities are generally subject to specialized investment\ncompany accounting, which does not require the consolidation of investments,\nincluding VIEs. In addition, Treasury and CIO invest in securities generally\nissued by third parties which may meet the definition of VIEs (e.g., issuers of\nasset-backed securities). In general, the Firm does not have the power to direct\nthe significant activities of these entities and therefore does not consolidate\nthese entities. Refer to Note 10 for further information on the Firm\u2019s investment\nsecurities portfolio.\n\nIn addition, CIB also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs\nsponsored by third parties. Refer to pages 257-258 of this Note for more\ninformation on consolidated VIE assets and liabilities as well as the VIEs\nsponsored by third parties.\nSignificant Firm-sponsored variable interest entities\nCredit card securitizations CCB\u2019s Card business may securitize originated credit\ncard loans, primarily through the Chase Issuance Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d). The Firm\u2019s\ncontinuing involvement in credit card securitizations includes servicing the\nreceivables, retaining an undivided seller\u2019s interest in the receivables,\nretaining certain senior and subordinated securities and maintaining escrow\naccounts. The Firm consolidates the assets and liabilities of its sponsored credit\ncard trusts as it is considered to be the primary beneficiary of these\nsecuritization trusts based on the Firm\u2019s ability to direct the activities of\nthese VIEs through its servicing responsibilities and other duties, including\nmaking decisions as to the receivables that are transferred into those trusts and\nas to any related modifications and workouts. Additionally, the nature and extent\nof the Firm\u2019s other continuing involvement with the trusts, as indicated above,\nobligates the Firm to absorb losses and gives the Firm the right to receive\ncertain benefits from these VIEs that could potentially be significant. The\nunderlying securitized credit card receivables and other assets of the\nsecuritization trusts are available only for payment of the beneficial interests\nissued by the securitization trusts; they are not available to pay the Firm\u2019s\nother obligations or the claims of the Firm\u2019s creditors. The agreements with the\ncredit card securitization trusts require the Firm to maintain a minimum undivided\ninterest in the credit card trusts (generally 5%). As of December 31, 2021 and\n2020, the Firm held undivided interests in Firm-sponsored credit card\nsecuritization trusts of $ 7.1billion and $ 5.4billion, respectively. The Firm\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    253  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \nmaintained an average undivided interest in principal receivables owned by those\ntrusts of approximately 57% and 39% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and\n2020, respectively. The Firm did not retain any senior securities and retained $\n1.5billion of subordinated securities in certain of its credit card securitization\ntrusts at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Firm\u2019s undivided interests in the\ncredit card trusts and securities retained are eliminated in consolidation. Firm-\nsponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts The Firm securitizes (or has\nsecuritized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages\nand other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the\nparticular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may\nact as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the\nsecuritization trusts.\nThe following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in\nFirm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in which the\nFirm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by the Firm.\nContinuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or\nsubordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit\nrisk retention rules), recourse or guarantee arrangements, and derivative\ncontracts. In certain instances, the Firm\u2019s only continuing involvement is\nservicing the loans. The Firm\u2019s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased\ninterests is the carrying value of these interests.\n

2020,\nwhich the Firm purchased in connection with CIB\u2019s secondary market-making\nactivities.\n(d) Includes interests held in re-securitization transactions.\n(e) As of December 31, 2021 and

retention rules,\nwere risk-rated \u201cA\u201d or better, on an S&P-equivalent basis. The retained interests\nin prime residential mortgages consisted of $ 1.6billion and $ 1.3billion of\ninvestment-grade retained interests, and $ 131million and $ 41million of\nnoninvestment-grade retained interests at December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively. The retained interests in commercial and other securitization trusts\nconsisted of $ 3.5billion and $ 2.0billion of investment-grade retained interests,\nand $ 929million and $ 753million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n                                              \n  254    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nResidential mortgage The Firm\nsecuritizes residential mortgage loans\noriginated by CCB, as well as\nresidential mortgage loans purchased\nfrom third parties by either CCB or\nCIB. CCB generally retains servicing\nfor all residential mortgage loans it\noriginated or purchased, and for\ncertain mortgage loans purchased by\nCIB. For securitizations of loans\nserviced by CCB, the Firm has the power\nto direct the significant activities of\nthe VIE because it is responsible for\ndecisions related to loan modifications\nand workouts. CCB may also retain an\ninterest upon securitization. In\naddition, CIB engages in underwriting\nand trading activities involving\nsecurities issued by Firm-sponsored\nsecuritization trusts. As a result, CIB\nat times retains senior and/or\nsubordinated interests (including\nresidual interests and amounts required\nto be held pursuant to credit risk\nretention rules) in residential\nmortgage securitizations at the time of\nsecuritization, and/or reacquires\npositions in the secondary market in\nthe normal course of business. In\ncertain instances, as a result of the\npositions retained or reacquired by CIB\nor held by Treasury and CIO or CCB,\nwhen considered together with the\nservicing arrangements entered into by\nCCB, the Firm is deemed to be the\nprimary beneficiary of certain\nsecuritization trusts. The Firm does\nnot consolidate residential mortgage\nsecuritizations (Firm-sponsored or\nthird-party-sponsored) when it is not\nthe servicer (and therefore does not\nhave the power to direct the most\nsignificant activities of the trust) or\ndoes not hold a beneficial interest in\nthe trust that could potentially be\nsignificant to the trust. Commercial\nmortgages and other consumer\nsecuritizations CIB originates and\nsecuritizes commercial mortgage loans,\nand engages in underwriting and trading\nactivities involving the securities\nissued by securitization trusts. CIB\nmay retain unsold senior and/or\nsubordinated interests (including\namounts required to be held pursuant to\ncredit risk retention rules) in\ncommercial mortgage securitizations at\nthe time of securitization but,\ngenerally, the Firm does not service\ncommercial loan securitizations.\nTreasury and CIO may choose to invest\nin these securitizations as well. For\ncommercial mortgage securitizations the\npower to direct the significant\nactivities of the VIE generally is held\nby the servicer or investors in a\nspecified class of securities\n(\u201ccontrolling class\u201d). The Firm\ngenerally does not retain an interest\nin the controlling class in its\nsponsored commercial mortgage\nsecuritization transactions. Re-\nsecuritizations The Firm engages in\ncertain re-securitization transactions\nin which debt securities are\ntransferred to a VIE in exchange for\nnew beneficial interests. These\ntransfers occur in connection with both\nU.S. GSEs and government agency\nsponsored VIEs, which are backed by\nresidential mortgages. The Firm\u2019s\nconsolidation analysis is largely\ndependent on the Firm\u2019s role and\ninterest in the re-securitization\ntrusts.\nThe following table presents the principal amount of securities transferred to re-\nsecuritization VIEs.\n                                                                            \n  Year ended December 31,                                                   \n  (in millions)                             2021         2020         2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Transfers of securities to VIEs                                           \n  U.S. GSEs and government agencies    $  53,923    $  46,123    $  25,852  \n                                                                            \nMost re-securitizations with which the\nFirm is involved are client-driven\ntransactions in which a specific client\nor group of clients is seeking a\nspecific return or risk profile. For\nthese transactions, the Firm has\nconcluded that the decision-making\npower of the entity is shared between\nthe Firm and its clients, considering\nthe joint effort and decisions in\nestablishing the re-securitization\ntrust and its assets, as well as the\nsignificant economic interest the\nclient holds in the re-securitization\ntrust; therefore the Firm does not\nconsolidate the re-securitization VIE.\nThe Firm did not transfer any private\nlabel securities to re-securitization\nVIEs during 2021, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively, and retained interests in\nany such Firm-sponsored VIEs as of\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020 were\nimmaterial. Additionally, the Firm may\ninvest in beneficial interests of\nthird-party-sponsored re-\nsecuritizations and generally purchases\nthese interests in the secondary\nmarket. In these circumstances, the\nFirm does not have the unilateral\nability to direct the most significant\nactivities of the re-securitization\ntrust, either because it was not\ninvolved in the initial design of the\ntrust, or the Firm was involved with an\nindependent third-party sponsor and\ndemonstrated shared power over the\ncreation of the trust; therefore, the\nFirm does not consolidate the re-\nsecuritization VIE.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    255  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \nThe following table presents information on the Firm's interests in\nnonconsolidated re-securitization VIEs.\n                                                                              \n  December 31,                                   Nonconsolidated              \n  (in millions)                           re-securitization VIEs              \n  U.S. GSEs and government agencies                         2021        2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Interest in VIEs                     $                   1,947    $  2,631  \n                                                                              \nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the\nFirm did not consolidate any U.S. GSE\nand government agency re-securitization\nVIEs or any Firm-sponsored private-\nlabel re-securitization VIEs. Multi-\nseller conduits Multi-seller conduit\nentities are separate bankruptcy remote\nentities that provide secured\nfinancing, collateralized by pools of\nreceivables and other financial assets,\nto customers of the Firm. The conduits\nfund their financing facilities through\nthe issuance of highly rated commercial\npaper. The primary source of repayment\nof the commercial paper is the cash\nflows from the pools of assets. In most\ninstances, the assets are structured\nwith deal-specific credit enhancements\nprovided to the conduits by the\ncustomers (i.e., sellers) or other\nthird parties. Deal-specific credit\nenhancements are generally structured\nto cover a multiple of historical\nlosses expected on the pool of assets,\nand are typically in the form of\novercollateralization provided by the\nseller. The deal-specific credit\nenhancements mitigate the Firm\u2019s\npotential losses on its agreements with\nthe conduits. To ensure timely\nrepayment of the commercial paper, and\nto provide the conduits with funding to\nprovide financing to customers in the\nevent that the conduits do not obtain\nfunding in the commercial paper market,\neach asset pool financed by the\nconduits has a minimum 100% deal-\nspecific liquidity facility associated\nwith it provided by JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nalso provides the multi-seller conduit\nvehicles with uncommitted program-wide\nliquidity facilities and program-wide\ncredit enhancement in the form of\nstandby letters of credit. The amount\nof program-wide credit enhancement\nrequired is based upon commercial paper\nissuance and approximates 10% of the\noutstanding balance of commercial\npaper. The Firm consolidates its Firm-\nadministered multi-seller conduits, as\nthe Firm has both the power to direct\nthe significant activities of the\nconduits and a potentially significant\neconomic interest in the conduits. As\nadministrative agent and in its role in\nstructuring transactions, the Firm\nmakes decisions regarding asset types\nand credit quality, and manages the\ncommercial paper funding needs of the\nconduits. The Firm\u2019s interests that\ncould potentially be significant to the\nVIEs include the fees received as\nadministrative agent and liquidity and\nprogram-wide credit enhancement\nprovider, as well as the potential\nexposure created by the liquidity and\ncredit enhancement facilities provided\nto the conduits.\n\nIn the normal course of business,\nJPMorgan Chase makes markets in and\ninvests in commercial paper issued by\nthe Firm-administered multi-seller\nconduits. The Firm held $ 13.7billion\nand $ 13.5billion of the commercial\npaper issued by the Firm-administered\nmulti-seller conduits at December 31,\n2021 and 2020, respectively, which have\nbeen eliminated in consolidation. The\nFirm\u2019s investments reflect the Firm\u2019s\nfunding needs and capacity and were not\ndriven by market illiquidity. Other\nthan the amounts required to be held\npursuant to credit risk retention\nrules, the Firm is not obligated under\nany agreement to purchase the\ncommercial paper issued by the Firm-\nadministered multi-seller conduits.\nDeal-specific liquidity facilities,\nprogram-wide liquidity and credit\nenhancement provided by the Firm have\nbeen eliminated in consolidation. The\nFirm or the Firm-administered multi-\nseller conduits provide lending-related\ncommitments to certain clients of the\nFirm-administered multi-seller\nconduits. The unfunded commitments were\n$ 13.4billion and $ 12.2billion at\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively, and are reported as off-\nbalance sheet lending-related\ncommitments in other unfunded\ncommitments to extend credit. Refer to\nNote 28 for more information on off-\nbalance sheet lending-related\ncommitments. Municipal bond vehicles\nMunicipal bond vehicles or tender\noption bond (\u201cTOB\u201d) trusts allow\ninstitutions to finance their municipal\nbond investments at short-term rates.\nIn a typical TOB transaction, the trust\npurchases highly rated municipal\nbond(s) of a single issuer and funds\nthe purchase by issuing two types of\nsecurities: (1) puttable floating-rate\ncertificates (\u201cfloaters\u201d) and (2)\ninverse floating-rate residual\ninterests (\u201cresiduals\u201d). The floaters\nare typically purchased by money market\nfunds or other short-term investors and\nmay be tendered, with requisite notice,\nto the TOB trust. The residuals are\nretained by the investor seeking to\nfinance its municipal bond investment.\nTOB transactions where the residual is\nheld by a third-party investor are\ntypically known as customer TOB trusts,\nand non-customer TOB trusts are\ntransactions where the Residual is\nretained by the Firm. Customer TOB\ntrusts are sponsored by a third party.\nThe Firm serves as sponsor for all non-\ncustomer TOB transactions. The Firm may\nprovide various services to a TOB\ntrust, including remarketing agent,\nliquidity or tender option provider,\nand/or sponsor. J.P. Morgan Securities\nLLC may serve as a remarketing agent on\nthe floaters for TOB trusts. The\nremarketing agent is responsible for\nestablishing the periodic variable rate\non the floaters, conducting the initial\nplacement and remarketing tendered\nfloaters. The remarketing agent may,\nbut is not obligated to, make markets\nin floaters. Floaters held by the Firm\nwere not material during 2021 and 2020.\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or J.P.\nMorgan Securities LLC often serves as\nthe sole liquidity or tender option\nprovider for the TOB trusts. The\nliquidity provider\u2019s obligation to\n                                              \n  256    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nperform is conditional and is limited by certain events (\u201cTermination Events\u201d),\nwhich include bankruptcy or failure to pay by the municipal bond issuer or credit\nenhancement provider, an event of taxability on the municipal bonds or the\nimmediate downgrade of the municipal bond to below investment grade. In addition,\nthe liquidity provider\u2019s exposure is typically further limited by the high credit\nquality of the underlying municipal bonds, the excess collateralization in the\nvehicle, or, in certain transactions, the reimbursement agreements with the\nResidual holders. Holders of the floaters may \u201cput,\u201d or tender, their floaters to\nthe TOB trust. If the remarketing agent cannot successfully remarket the floaters\nto another investor, the liquidity provider either provides a loan to the TOB\ntrust for the TOB trust\u2019s purchase of the floaters, or it directly purchases the\ntendered floaters. TOB trusts are considered to be variable interest entities. The\nFirm consolidates non-customer TOB trusts because as the Residual holder, the Firm\nhas the right to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance\nof the municipal bond

Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets\nare long-term beneficial interests of $ 2.6billion and $ 5.2billion at December\n31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    257  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \nVIEs sponsored by third parties The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs\nstructured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a derivative\ncounterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent,\nremarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at\narm\u2019s-length, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the\nspecific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets.\nWhere the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that\nmost significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance, or a variable interest\nthat could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the\nVIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets\nin the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other\nthird-party transaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds investments in\nunconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar\nentities that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other projects.\nThese entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the\ngeneral partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities\nof the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax\ncredit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited\npartner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated\nto the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and\nfunding commitments, was $ 26.8billion and $ 23.6billion, of which $ 9.4billion\nand $ 8.7billion was unfunded at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The\nprior-period maximum loss exposure amount has been revised to conform with the\ncurrent presentation. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk of\nloss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the project\nqualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 for further information on affordable\nhousing tax credits. Refer to Note 28 for more information on off-balance sheet\nlending-related commitments. Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The\nFirm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts, including remarketing\nagent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions,\nthe Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with\nthe Residual holder. In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle,\nthe Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The\nFirm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on\nany of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB\ntrusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that\nsignificantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The\nFirm\u2019s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at December\n31, 2021 and 2020, was $ 6.8billion and $ 6.7billion, respectively. The fair value\nof assets held by such VIEs at both December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $ 10.5billion.\nLoan securitizations The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans,\nincluding residential mortgages, credit card receivables, and commercial\nmortgages. The purposes of these securitization transactions were to satisfy\ninvestor demand and to generate liquidity for the Firm. For loan securitizations\nin which the Firm is not required to consolidate the trust, the Firm records the\ntransfer of the loan receivable to the trust as a sale when all of the following\naccounting criteria for a sale are met: (1) the transferred financial assets are\nlegally isolated from the Firm\u2019s creditors; (2) the transferee or beneficial\ninterest holder can pledge or exchange the transferred financial assets; and (3)\nthe Firm does not maintain effective control over the transferred financial assets\n(e.g., the Firm cannot repurchase the transferred assets before their maturity and\nit does not have the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return the\ntransferred assets). For loan securitizations accounted for as a sale, the Firm\nrecognizes a gain or loss based on the difference between the value of proceeds\nreceived (including cash, beneficial interests, or servicing assets received) and\nthe carrying value of the assets sold. Gains and losses on securitizations are\nreported in noninterest revenue.\n                                              \n  258    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nSecuritization activity\nThe following table provides information related to the Firm\u2019s securitization\nactivities for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, related to assets\nheld in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the\nFirm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization.\n                                                                                  \n  Year                                                                            \n  end\u2026                                                                            \n  Dec\u2026                                                                            \n  31,         2021       Comm\u2026        2020       Comme\u2026        2019       Comme\u2026  \n  (in        Resi\u2026         and       Resi\u2026          and       Resi\u2026          and  \n  mil\u2026       mort\u2026       othe\u2026       mort\u2026       other\u2026       mort\u2026       other\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Pri\u2026    $  23,8\u2026    $  14,9\u2026    $  7,103    $   6,624    $  9,957    $   9,390  \n  sec\u2026                                                                            \n  All                                                                             \n  cash                                                                            \n  flo\u2026                                                                            \n  dur\u2026                                                                            \n  the                                                                             \n  per\u2026                                                                            \n  Pro\u2026                                                                            \n  rec\u2026                                                                            \n  from                                                                            \n  loan    $  24,4\u2026    $  15,0\u2026    $  7,321    $   6,865    $  10,2\u2026    $   9,544  \n  sal\u2026                                                                            \n  as                                                                              \n  fin\u2026                                                                            \n  ins\u2026                                                                            \n  Ser\u2026                                                                            \n  fees         153           1         211            1         287            2  \n  col\u2026                                                                            \n  Cash                                                                            \n  flo\u2026                                                                            \n  rec\u2026         578         273         801          239         507          237  \n  on                                                                              \n  int\u2026                                                                            \n                                                                                  \n(a) Excludes re-securitization transactions.\n(b) Predominantly includes Level 2 assets.\n(c) The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the\nproceeds received upon loan sale.\n(d) Represents prime mortgages.

Effective\nJanuary 1, 2020, the Firm adopted new\naccounting guidance related to goodwill\nimpairment testing. The adoption of the\nguidance requires recognition of an\nimpairment loss when the estimated fair\nvalue of a reporting unit falls below\nits carrying value. It eliminated the\nrequirement that an impairment loss be\nrecognized only\n\nif the estimated implied fair value of\nthe goodwill is below its carrying\nvalue. The goodwill impairment test is\ngenerally performed by comparing the\ncurrent fair value of each reporting\nunit with its carrying value. If the\nfair value is in excess of the carrying\nvalue, then the reporting unit\u2019s\ngoodwill is considered not to be\nimpaired. If the fair value is less\nthan the carrying value, then an\nimpairment charge is recognized for the\namount by which the reporting unit\u2019s\ncarrying value exceeds its fair value,\nup to the amount of goodwill allocated\nto that reporting unit. The Firm uses\nthe reporting units\u2019 allocated capital\nplus goodwill and other intangible\nassets as a proxy for the carrying\nvalues of equity for the reporting\nunits in the goodwill impairment\ntesting. Reporting unit equity is\ndetermined on a similar basis as the\nallocation of capital to the LOBs which\ntakes into consideration a variety of\nfactors including capital levels of\nsimilarly rated peers and applicable\nregulatory capital requirements.\nProposed LOB capital levels are\nincorporated into the Firm\u2019s annual\nbudget process, which is reviewed by\nthe Firm\u2019s Board of Directors.\nAllocated capital is further reviewed\nperiodically and updated as needed. The\nprimary method the Firm uses to\nestimate the fair value of its\nreporting units is the income approach.\nThis approach projects cash flows for\nthe forecast period and uses the\nperpetuity growth method to calculate\nterminal values. These cash flows and\nterminal values are then discounted\nusing an appropriate discount rate.\nProjections of cash flows are based on\nthe reporting units\u2019 earnings forecasts\nwhich are reviewed with senior\nmanagement of the Firm. The discount\nrate used for each reporting unit\nrepresents an estimate of the cost of\nequity for that reporting unit and is\ndetermined considering the Firm\u2019s\noverall estimated cost of equity\n(estimated using the Capital Asset\nPricing Model), as adjusted for the\nrisk characteristics specific to each\nreporting unit (for example, for higher\nlevels of risk or uncertainty\nassociated with the business or\nmanagement\u2019s forecasts and\nassumptions). To assess the\nreasonableness of the discount rates\nused for each reporting unit,\nmanagement compares the discount rate\nto the estimated cost of equity for\npublicly traded institutions with\nsimilar businesses and risk\ncharacteristics. In addition, the\nweighted average cost of equity\n(aggregating the various reporting\nunits) is compared with the Firm\u2019s\noverall estimated cost of equity to\nensure reasonableness. The valuations\nderived from the discounted cash flow\nanalysis are then compared with market-\nbased trading and transaction multiples\nfor relevant competitors. Trading and\ntransaction comparables are used as\ngeneral indicators to assess the\noverall reasonableness of the estimated\nfair values, although precise\nconclusions generally cannot be drawn\ndue to the differences that naturally\nexist between the Firm\u2019s businesses and\ncompetitor institutions. Management\nalso takes into consideration a\ncomparison between the aggregate fair\nvalues of the Firm\u2019s reporting\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    261  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \nunits and JPMorgan Chase\u2019s market capitalization. In evaluating this comparison,\nmanagement considers several factors, including (i) a control premium that would\nexist in a market transaction, (ii) factors related to the level of execution risk\nthat would exist at the Firmwide level that do not exist at the reporting unit\nlevel and (iii) short-term market volatility and other factors that do not\ndirectly affect the value of individual reporting units. Unanticipated declines in\nbusiness performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital\nrequirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse\nregulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of\nequity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm\u2019s reporting units to\ndecline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to\nearnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.\nMortgage servicing rights MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash\nflows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers\nestimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs\nto service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows\nare received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing\nand ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or\nrecognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained.\nAs permitted by U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to account for its MSRs at fair\nvalue. The Firm treats its MSRs as a single class of servicing assets based on the\navailability of market inputs used to measure the fair value of its MSR asset and\nits treatment of MSRs as one aggregate pool for risk management purposes. The Firm\nestimates the fair value of MSRs using an option-adjusted spread (\u201cOAS\u201d) model,\nwhich projects MSR cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios in conjunction\nwith the Firm\u2019s prepayment model, and then discounts these cash flows at risk-\nadjusted rates. The model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually\nspecified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, costs to\nservice, late charges and other ancillary revenue, and other economic factors. The\nFirm compares fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where\navailable, and also considers recent market activity and actual portfolio\nexperience.\n                                              \n  262    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nThe fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest rates, including their\neffect on prepayment speeds. MSRs typically decrease in value when interest rates\ndecline because declining interest rates tend to increase prepayments and\ntherefore reduce the expected life of the net servicing cash flows that comprise\nthe MSR asset. Conversely, securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities), and\ncertain derivatives (e.g., those for which the Firm receives fixed-rate interest\npayments) increase in value when interest rates decline. JPMorgan Chase uses\ncombinations of derivatives and securities to manage the risk of changes in the\nfair value of MSRs. The intent is to offset any interest-rate related changes in\nthe fair value of MSRs with changes in the fair value of the related risk\nmanagement instruments.\nThe following table summarizes MSR

The Firm\u2019s credit risk associated with these servicer\nadvances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to\nall cash payments to investors.

predominantly\noperating leases for premises and equipment used primarily for business purposes.\nThese leases generally have terms of 20years or less, determined based on the\ncontractual maturity of the lease, and include periods covered by options to\nextend or terminate the lease when the Firm is reasonably certain that it will\nexercise those options. All leases with lease terms greater than twelve months are\nreported as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) asset.\nNone of these lease agreements impose restrictions on the Firm\u2019s ability to pay\ndividends, engage in debt or equity financing transactions or enter into further\nlease agreements. Certain of these leases contain escalation clauses that will\nincrease rental payments based on maintenance, utility and tax increases, which\nare non-lease components. The Firm elected not to separate lease and non-lease\ncomponents of a contract for its real estate leases. As such, real estate lease\npayments represent payments on both lease and non-lease components. Operating\nlease liabilities and ROU assets are recognized at the lease commencement date\nbased on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease\nterm. The future lease payments are discounted at a rate that represents the\nFirm\u2019s collateralized borrowing rate for financing instruments of a similar term\nand are included in accounts payable and other liabilities. The operating lease\nROU asset, included in premises and equipment, also includes any lease prepayments\nmade, plus initial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received.\nRental expense associated with operating leases is recognized on a straight-line\nbasis over the lease term, and generally included in occupancy expense in the\nConsolidated statements of income.\nThe following tables provide\ninformation related to the Firm\u2019s\noperating leases:\n                                                                                 \n  December 31,                                                                   \n  (in millions, except where otherwise noted)                                    \n  2021                                              2020                         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Right-of-use assets                            $        7,888  $        8,006  \n  Lease liabilities                                       8,328           8,508  \n  Weighted average remaining lease term                     8.5             8.7  \n  (in years)                                                                     \n  Weighted average discount rate                    3.40      %     3.48      %  \n  Supplemental cash flow information                                             \n  Cash paid for amounts included in the                                          \n  measurement of lease liabilities -             $        1,656  $        1,626  \n  operating cash flows                                                           \n  Supplemental non-cash information                                              \n  Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange       $        1,167  $        1,350  \n  for operating lease obligations                                                \n                                                                                 \n                                                   \n  Year ended December 31,                          \n  (in millions)                  2021        2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Rental expense                                   \n  Gross rental expense       $  2,086    $  2,094  \n  Sublease rental income         -129        -166  \n  Net rental expense         $  1,957    $  1,928  \n                                                   \nThe following table presents future\npayments under operating leases as of\nDecember 31, 2021:\n                                                      \n  Year ended December 31, (in millions)               \n  2022                                         1,572  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  2023                                         1,435  \n  2024                                         1,285  \n  2025                                         1,115  \n  2026                                           862  \n  After 2026                                   3,453  \n  Total future minimum lease payments          9,722  \n  Less: Imputed interest                      -1,394  \n  Total                                    $   8,328  \n                                                      \nIn addition to the table above, as of\nDecember 31, 2021, the Firm had\nadditional future operating lease\ncommitments of $ 0.9billion that were\nsigned but had not yet commenced.

The use of these instruments\nmodifies the Firm\u2019s interest expense on\nthe associated debt. The modified\nweighted-average interest rates for\ntotal long-term debt, including the\neffects of related derivative\ninstruments, were 1.43% and 1.59% as of\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Firm reclassified a net\npre-tax gain of $ 6million to other income related to the liquidation of legal\nentities, $ 3million related to net investment hedge gains and $ 3million related\nto cumulative translation adjustments.

JPMorgan\nChase uses the asset and liability\nmethod to provide income taxes on all\ntransactions recorded in the\nConsolidated Financial Statements. This\nmethod requires that income taxes\nreflect the expected future tax\nconsequences of temporary differences\nbetween the carrying amounts of assets\nor liabilities for book and tax\npurposes. Accordingly, a deferred tax\nasset or liability for each temporary\ndifference is determined based on the\ntax rates that the Firm expects to be\nin effect when the underlying items of\nincome and expense are realized.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s expense for income\ntaxes includes the current and deferred\nportions of that expense. A valuation\nallowance is established to reduce\ndeferred tax assets to the amount the\nFirm expects to realize. Due to the\ninherent complexities arising from the\nnature of the Firm\u2019s businesses, and\nfrom conducting business and being\ntaxed in a substantial number of\njurisdictions, significant judgments\nand estimates are required to be made.\nAgreement of tax liabilities between\nJPMorgan Chase and the many tax\njurisdictions in which the Firm files\ntax returns may not be finalized for\nseveral years. Thus, the Firm\u2019s final\ntax-related assets and liabilities may\nultimately be different from those\ncurrently reported. In the first\nquarter of 2021, the Firm reclassified\ncertain deferred investment tax credits\nfrom accounts payable and other\nliabilities to other assets to be a\nreduction to the carrying value of the\nassociated tax-oriented investments.\nThe reclassification also resulted in\nan increase in income tax expense and a\ncorresponding increase in other income,\nwith no effect on net income. Prior-\nperiod amounts have been revised to\nconform with the current presentation,\nincluding the Firm\u2019s effective income\ntax rate.\n\nEffective tax rate and expense\nThe following table

(\u201cParent Company\u201d) and certain of its affiliates unless the loans are secured\nin specified amounts. Such secured loans provided by any banking subsidiary to the\nParent Company or to any particular affiliate, together with certain other\ntransactions with such affiliate (collectively referred to as \u201ccovered\ntransactions\u201d), must be made on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe\nand sound banking practices. In addition, unless collateralized with cash or US\nGovernment debt obligations, covered transactions are generally limited to 10% of\nthe banking subsidiary\u2019s total capital, as determined by the risk-based capital\nguidelines; the aggregate amount of covered transactions between any banking\nsubsidiary and all of its affiliates is limited to 20% of the banking subsidiary\u2019s\ntotal capital. The Parent Company\u2019s two principal subsidiaries are JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC, an intermediate holding company (the\n\u201cIHC\u201d). The IHC generally holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s subsidiaries other\nthan JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns other\nassets and provides intercompany loans to the Parent Company. The Parent Company\nis obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received\nfrom securities issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated debt\nsecurities and of preferred and common stock). The principal sources of income and\nfunding for the Parent Company are dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and\ndividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. In addition to dividend\nrestrictions set forth in statutes and regulations, the Federal Reserve, the OCC\nand the FDIC have authority under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act to\nprohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they\nsupervise, including the Parent Company and its subsidiaries that are banks or\nbank holding companies, if, in the banking regulator\u2019s opinion, payment of a\ndividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial\ncondition of the banking organization. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends\nor extending credit to the Parent Company if certain capital or liquidity\n\u201cthresholds\u201d are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by the Parent\nCompany\u2019s management or Board of Directors. At January 1, 2022, the Parent\nCompany\u2019s banking subsidiaries could pay, in the aggregate, approximately $\n20billion in dividends to their respective bank holding companies without the\nprior approval of their relevant banking regulators. The capacity to pay dividends\nin 2022 will be supplemented by the banking subsidiaries\u2019 earnings during the\nyear.\n                                              \n  280    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n  Note 27 \u2013 Regulatory capital                                                    \n                                                                                  \nThe Federal Reserve establishes capital\nrequirements, including well-\ncapitalized requirements, for the\nconsolidated financial holding company.\nThe OCC establishes similar minimum\ncapital requirements and standards for\nthe Firm\u2019s principal IDI subsidiary,\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The capital\nrules under Basel III establish minimum\ncapital ratios and overall capital\nadequacy standards for large and\ninternationally active U.S. bank\nholding companies and banks, including\nthe Firm and its IDI subsidiaries,\nincluding JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Two\ncomprehensive approaches are prescribed\nfor calculating RWA: a standardized\napproach (\u201cBasel III Standardized\u201d),\nand an advanced approach (\u201cBasel III\nAdvanced\u201d). For each of the risk-based\ncapital ratios, the capital adequacy of\nthe Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nis evaluated against the lower of the\nStandardized or Advanced approaches\ncompared to their respective regulatory\ncapital ratio requirements. The three\ncomponents of regulatory capital under\nthe Basel III rules are as illustrated\nbelow: Under the risk-based capital and\nleverage-based guidelines of the\nFederal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is\nrequired to maintain minimum ratios for\nCET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total\ncapital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR.\nFailure to meet these minimum\nrequirements could cause the Federal\nReserve to take action.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. did\nnot elect to apply this exclusion.\n                                              \n  282    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n  Note 28 \u2013 Off\u2013balance sheet lending-related                                     \n                                                                                  \nfinancial instruments, guarantees, and\n\nother commitments\n\nJPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments\nand guarantees) to address the financing needs of its customers and clients. The\ncontractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible\ncredit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or\nthe Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the\ncustomer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the\ncontract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been\nrefinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default\noccurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not,\nin the Firm\u2019s view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or\nfunding requirements. To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and\ncertain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on\nlending-related commitments is maintained.Refer to Note 13 for further information\nregarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The\nfollowing table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-\nbalance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other\ncommitments at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The amounts in the table below for\ncredit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total\navailable credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not\nanticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized\nat the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by\nproviding the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without\nnotice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower\nis 60days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are\nsignificant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has\nbeen a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    283  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n         \u2026                                                                        \n         \u2026                                                                        \n         \u2026        \u2026        \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026        \u2026        \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026        1        3                                                      \n         1        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026                                             \n         \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026                                   \u2026         \n         \u2026        3        5        5                   \u2026               \u2026         \n         \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026          \u2026               \u2026         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026     $  \u2026     $  \u2026     $  \u2026       $  \u2026               \u2026         \n         \u2026        \u2014        \u2014        \u2026        \u2026          \u2026               2         \n         \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026          \u2026               \u2026         \n         \u2026        \u2014        \u2014        \u2014        \u2026          \u2026               \u2014         \n         \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026          \u2026               \u2026         \n                                                                                  \n         \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026          \u2026               \u2026         \n         \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026          \u2026               \u2026         \n         \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2014        \u2026          \u2026               9         \n         \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026          \u2026               \u2026         \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2026     $  \u2026     $  \u2026     $  \u2026       $  \u2026            $  \u2026    $    \n                                                                                  \n      $  \u2026     $  \u2014     $  \u2014     $  \u2014     $  \u2026       $  \u2026            $  \u2014    $    \n         \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026          \u2026               \u2026         \n         \u2026        \u2026        \u2014        \u2014        \u2026          \u2026       \u2026       1         \n         \u2026        \u2026        \u2014        \u2014        \u2026          \u2026               \u2014         \n                                                                                  \n            \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026          \u2026            \u2026         \n            \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026     \u2026          \u2026               \u2026         \n         \u2026        \u2014        \u2014        \u2014        \u2026          \u2026               \u2014         \n         \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026        \u2026          \u2026       \u2026       \u2026         \n                                                                                  \n(a) Includes certain commitments to purchase loans from correspondents.\n(b) Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CB and\nCIB.\n(c) Predominantly all consumer and wholesale lending-related commitments are in\nthe U.S.\n(d) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, reflected the contractual amount net of risk\nparticipations totaling $ 44million and $ 72million, respectively, for other\nunfunded commitments to extend credit;

U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a contract\nthat contingently requires the guarantor to pay a guaranteed party based upon: (a)\nchanges in an underlying asset, liability or equity security of the guaranteed\nparty; or (b) a third party\u2019s failure to perform under a specified agreement. The\nFirm considers the following off\u2013balance sheet arrangements to be guarantees under\nU.S. GAAP: standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees, securities\nlending indemnifications, certain indemnification agreements included within\nthird-party contractual arrangements, certain derivative contracts and the\nguarantees under the sponsored member repo program. As required by U.S. GAAP, the\nFirm initially records guarantees at the inception date fair value of the non-\ncontingent obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of consideration received or the\nnet present value of the premium receivable). For these obligations, the Firm\nrecords this fair value amount in other liabilities with an offsetting entry\nrecorded in cash (for premiums received), or other assets (for premiums\nreceivable). Any premium receivable recorded in other assets is reduced as cash is\nreceived under the contract, and the fair value of the liability recorded at\ninception is amortized into income as lending and deposit-related fees over the\nlife of the guarantee contract. The lending-related contingent obligation is\nrecognized based on expected credit losses in addition to, and separate from, any\nnon-contingent obligation. Non-lending-related contingent obligations are\nrecognized when the liability becomes probable and reasonably estimable. These\nobligations are not recognized if the estimated amount is less than the carrying\namount of any non-contingent liability recognized at inception (adjusted for any\namortization). Examples of non-lending-related contingent obligations include\nindemnifications provided in sales agreements, where a portion of the sale\nproceeds is allocated to the guarantee, which adjusts the gain or loss that would\notherwise result from the transaction. For these indemnifications, the initial\nliability is amortized to income as the Firm\u2019s risk is reduced (i.e., over time or\nwhen the indemnification expires). The contractual amount and carrying value of\nguarantees and indemnifications are included in the table on page 284. For\nadditional information on the guarantees, see below. Standby letters of credit and\nother financial guarantees Standby letters of credit and other financial\nguarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the\nperformance of a client or customer to a third party under certain arrangements,\nsuch as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings,\ntrade financings and similar transactions.\nThe following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of\nstandby letters of credit and other financial guarantees and other letters of\ncredit arrangements as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nStandby letters of credit, other financial guarantees and other letters of credit\n                                                                                  \n           2021                                2020                               \n           Stand\u2026                              Standby                            \n           lette\u2026                              letters                            \n           of                                  of                                 \n           credit                              credit                             \n  Dece\u2026    and                        Other    and                         Other  \n  31,      other                     lette\u2026    other                      lette\u2026  \n  (in      finan\u2026                        of    financ\u2026                        of  \n  mill\u2026    guara\u2026                    credit    guaran\u2026                    credit  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Inve\u2026              $  19,998    $   3,087               $  22,850    $   2,263  \n  Noni\u2026                  8,532        1,361                   8,132          790  \n  Total                                                                           \n  cont\u2026              $  28,530    $   4,448               $  30,982    $   3,053  \n  amou\u2026                                                                           \n  Allo\u2026                                                                           \n  for                $     123    $       9               $      80    $      14  \n  lend\u2026                                                                           \n  comm\u2026                                                                           \n  Guar\u2026                    353            \u2014                     363            \u2014  \n  liab\u2026                                                                           \n  Total                                                                           \n  carr\u2026              $     476    $       9               $     443    $      14  \n  value                                                                           \n  Comm\u2026                                                                           \n  with               $  14,511    $     999               $  17,238    $     498  \n  coll\u2026                                                                           \n                                                                                  \n(a) The ratings scale is based on the Firm\u2019s internal risk ratings.

As part of this program, the\nFirm provides an indemnification in the\nlending agreements which protects the\nlender against the failure of the\nborrower to return the lent securities.\nTo minimize its liability under these\nindemnification agreements, the Firm\nobtains cash or other highly liquid\ncollateral with a market value\nexceeding 100% of the value of the\nsecurities on loan from the borrower.\nCollateral is marked to market daily to\nhelp assure that collateralization is\nadequate. Additional collateral is\ncalled from the borrower if a shortfall\nexists, or collateral may be released\nto the borrower in the event of\novercollateralization. If a borrower\ndefaults, the Firm would use the\ncollateral held to purchase replacement\nsecurities in the market or to credit\nthe lending client or counterparty with\nthe cash equivalent thereof. The cash\ncollateral held by the Firm may be\ninvested on behalf of the client in\nindemnified resale agreements, whereby\nthe Firm indemnifies the client against\nthe loss of principal invested. To\nminimize its liability under these\nagreements, the Firm obtains collateral\nwith a market value exceeding 100% of\nthe principal invested. Derivatives\nqualifying as guarantees The Firm\ntransacts in certain derivative\ncontracts that have the characteristics\nof a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. These\ncontracts include written put options\nthat require the Firm to purchase\nassets upon exercise by the option\nholder at a specified price by a\nspecified date in the future. The Firm\nmay enter into written put option\ncontracts in order to meet client\nneeds, or for other trading purposes.\nThe terms of written put options are\ntypically five yearsor less.\nDerivatives deemed to be guarantees\nalso includes stable value contracts,\ncommonly referred to as \u201cstable value\nproducts\u201d, that require the Firm to\nmake a payment of the difference\nbetween the market value and the book\nvalue of a counterparty\u2019s reference\nportfolio of assets in the event that\nmarket value is less than book value\nand certain other conditions have been\nmet. Stable value products are\ntransacted in order to allow investors\nto realize investment returns with less\nvolatility than an unprotected\nportfolio. These contracts are\ntypically longer-term or may have no\nstated maturity, but allow the Firm to\nelect to terminate the contract under\ncertain conditions. The notional value\nof derivative guarantees generally\nrepresents the Firm\u2019s maximum exposure.\nHowever, exposure to certain stable\nvalue products is contractually limited\nto a substantially lower percentage of\nthe notional amount. The fair value of\nderivative guarantees reflects the\nprobability, in the Firm\u2019s view, of\nwhether the Firm will be required to\nperform under the contract. The Firm\nreduces exposures to these contracts by\nentering into offsetting transactions,\nor by entering into contracts that\nhedge the market risk related to the\nderivative guarantees.\nThe following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying as guarantees as of\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                December 31,      \n  (in millions)                 December 31, 2021               2020              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Notional                                                                        \n  amounts                                                                         \n  Derivative         $  55,730                       $  54,415                    \n  guarantees                                                                      \n  Stable value                                                                    \n  contracts with                                                                  \n  contractually         29,778                          27,752                    \n  limited                                                                         \n  exposure                                                                        \n  Maximum                                                                         \n  exposure of                                                                     \n  stable value                                                                    \n  contracts with         2,882                           2,803                    \n  contractually                                                                   \n  limited                                                                         \n  exposure                                                                        \n  Fair value                                                                      \n  Derivative               475                             322                    \n  payables                                                                        \n                                                                                  \nIn addition to derivative contracts\nthat meet the characteristics of a\nguarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser\nand seller of credit protection in the\ncredit derivatives market. Refer to\nNote 5 for a further discussion of\ncredit derivatives. Unsettled\nsecurities financing agreements In the\nnormal course of business, the Firm\nenters into resale and securities\nborrowed agreements. At settlement,\nthese commitments result in the Firm\nadvancing cash to and receiving\nsecurities collateral from the\ncounterparty. The Firm also enters into\nrepurchase and securities loaned\nagreements. At settlement, these\ncommitments result in the Firm\nreceiving cash from and providing\nsecurities collateral to the\ncounterparty. Such agreements settle at\na future date. These agreements\ngenerally do not meet the definition of\na derivative, and therefore, are not\nrecorded on the Consolidated balance\nsheets until settlement date. These\nagreements predominantly have regular-\nway settlement terms. Refer to Note 11\nfor a further discussion of securities\nfinancing agreements. Loan sales- and\nsecuritization-related indemnifications\nMortgage repurchase liability In\nconnection with the Firm\u2019s mortgage\nloan sale and securitization activities\nwith U.S. GSEs the Firm has made\nrepresentations and warranties that the\nloans sold meet certain requirements,\nand that may require the Firm to\nrepurchase mortgage loans and/or\nindemnify the loan purchaser if such\nrepresentations and warranties are\nbreached by the Firm. Private label\nsecuritizations The liability related\nto repurchase demands associated with\nprivate label securitizations is\nseparately evaluated by the Firm in\nestablishing its litigation reserves.\nRefer to Note 30 for additional\ninformation regarding litigation. Loans\nsold with recourse The Firm provides\nservicing for mortgages and certain\ncommercial lending products on both a\nrecourse and nonrecourse basis. In\nnonrecourse servicing, the principal\ncredit risk to the Firm is the cost of\ntemporary servicing advances of funds\n(i.e., normal servicing advances). In\nrecourse servicing, the servicer agrees\nto share credit risk\n                                              \n  286    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nwith the owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or a\nprivate investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing predominantly\noccur when foreclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan\nare less than the sum of the outstanding principal balance, plus accrued interest\non the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property. The\nFirm\u2019s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, thereby effectively\ntransferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-\nbacked securities issued by the trust. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the unpaid\nprincipal balance of loans sold with recourse totaled $ 827million and $\n889million, respectively. The carrying value of the related liability that the\nFirm has recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets, which is representative of the Firm\u2019s view of the likelihood it\nwill have to perform under its recourse obligations, was $ 19million and $\n23million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Other off-balance sheet\narrangements Indemnification agreements \u2013 general In connection with issuing\nsecurities to investors outside the U.S., the Firm may agree to pay additional\namounts to the holders of the securities in the event that, due to a change in tax\nlaw, certain types of withholding taxes are imposed on payments on the securities.\nThe terms of the securities may also give the Firm the right to redeem the\nsecurities if such additional amounts are payable. The Firm may also enter into\nindemnification clauses in connection with the licensing of software to clients\n(\u201csoftware licensees\u201d) or when it sells a business or assets to a third party\n(\u201cthird-party purchasers\u201d), pursuant to which it indemnifies software licensees\nfor claims of liability or damages that may occur subsequent to the licensing of\nthe software, or third-party purchasers for losses they may incur due to actions\ntaken by the Firm prior to the sale of the business or assets. It is difficult to\nestimate the Firm\u2019s maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements,\nsince this would require an assessment of future changes in tax law and future\nclaims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However,\nbased on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to be remote.\nMerchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment networks, the Firm, in its role\nas a merchant acquirer, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed\ncredit and debit card transactions that result in a charge-back to the merchant.\nIf a dispute is resolved in the cardholder\u2019s favor, Merchant Services will\n(through the cardholder\u2019s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the\ncardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If Merchant\nServices is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, Merchant Services will\nbear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. Merchant\nServices mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash\nreserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, Merchant Services\nrecognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk to\nthe Firm related to charge-backs. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and\n2019, Merchant Services processed an aggregate volume of $ 1,886.7billion, $\n1,597.3billion, and $ 1,511.5billion, respectively. Clearing Services \u2013 Client\nCredit Risk The Firm provides clearing services for clients by entering into\nsecurities purchases and sales and derivative contracts with CCPs, including ETDs\nsuch as futures and options, as well as OTC-cleared derivative contracts. As a\nclearing member, the Firm stands behind the performance of its clients, collects\ncash and securities collateral (margin) as well as any settlement amounts due from\nor to clients, and remits them to the relevant CCP or client in whole or part.\nThere are two types of margin: variation margin is posted on a daily basis based\non the value of clients\u2019 derivative contracts and initial margin is posted at\ninception of a derivative contract, generally on the basis of the potential\nchanges in the variation margin requirement for the contract. As a clearing\nmember, the Firm is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, but is\nnot liable to clients for the performance of the CCPs. Where possible, the Firm\nseeks to mitigate its risk to the client through the collection of appropriate\namounts of margin at inception and throughout the life of the transactions. The\nFirm can also cease providing clearing services if clients do not adhere to their\nobligations under the clearing agreement. In the event of nonperformance by a\nclient, the Firm would close out the client\u2019s positions and access available\nmargin. The CCP would utilize any margin it holds to make itself whole, with any\nremaining shortfalls required to be paid by the Firm as a clearing member. The\nFirm reflects its exposure to nonperformance risk of the client through the\nrecognition of margin receivables from clients and margin payables to CCPs; the\nclients\u2019 underlying securities or derivative contracts are not reflected in the\nFirm\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements. It is difficult to estimate the Firm\u2019s\nmaximum possible exposure through its role as a clearing member, as this would\nrequire an assessment of transactions that clients may execute in the future.\nHowever, based upon historical experience, and the credit risk mitigants available\nto the Firm, management believes it is unlikely that the Firm will have to make\nany material payments under these arrangements and the risk of loss is expected to\nbe remote. Refer to Note 5 for information on the derivatives that the Firm\nexecutes for its own account and records in its Consolidated Financial Statements.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    287  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \nExchange & Clearing House Memberships The Firm is a member of several securities\nand derivative exchanges and clearing houses, both in the U.S. and other\ncountries, and it provides clearing services to its clients. Membership in some of\nthese organizations requires the Firm to pay a pro rata share of the losses\nincurred by the organization as a result of the default of another member. Such\nobligations vary with different organizations. These obligations may be limited to\nthe amount (or a multiple of the amount) of the Firm\u2019s contribution to the\nguarantee fund maintained by a clearing house or exchange as part of the resources\navailable to cover any losses in the event of a member default. Alternatively,\nthese obligations may also include a pro rata share of the residual losses after\napplying the guarantee fund. Additionally, certain clearing houses require the\nFirm as a member to pay a pro rata share of losses that may result from the\nclearing house\u2019s investment of guarantee fund contributions and initial margin,\nunrelated to and independent of the default of another member. Generally a payment\nwould only be required should such losses exceed the resources of the clearing\nhouse or exchange that are contractually required to absorb the losses in the\nfirst instance. In certain cases, it is difficult to estimate the Firm\u2019s maximum\npossible exposure under these membership agreements, since this would require an\nassessment of future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet\noccurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the risk of\nloss to the Firm to be remote. Where the Firm\u2019s maximum possible exposure can be\nestimated, the amount is disclosed in the table on page 284, in the Exchange &\nclearing house guarantees and commitments line. Sponsored member repo program The\nFirm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight and term resale and\nrepurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed\nIncome Clearing Corporation (\u201cFICC\u201d) on behalf of clients that become sponsored\nmembers under the FICC\u2019s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt\nand full payment and performance of its sponsored member clients\u2019 respective\nobligations under the FICC\u2019s rules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these\nguarantees by obtaining a security interest in the cash or high-quality securities\ncollateral that the clients place with the clearing house; therefore, the Firm\nexpects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm\u2019s maximum possible exposure,\nwithout taking into consideration the associated collateral, is included in the\nExchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line on page 284. Refer to\nNote 11 for additional information on credit risk mitigation practices on resale\nagreements and the types of collateral pledged under repurchase agreements.\nGuarantees of subsidiaries In the normal course of business, the Parent Company\nmay provide counterparties with guarantees of certain of the trading and other\nobligations of its subsidiaries on a contract-by-contract basis, as negotiated\nwith the Firm\u2019s counterparties. The obligations of the subsidiaries are included\non the Firm\u2019s Consolidated balance sheets or are reflected as off-balance sheet\ncommitments; therefore, the Parent Company has not recognized a separate liability\nfor these guarantees. The Firm believes that the occurrence of any event that\nwould trigger payments by the Parent Company under these guarantees is remote. The\nParent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes of its\nsubsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (\u201cJPMFC\u201d), a\n100%-owned finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully and\nunconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and no other subsidiary of the\nparent company guarantees these securities. These guarantees, which rank on a\nparity with the Firm\u2019s unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included\nin the table on page 284 of this Note.

The\nlitigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class\naction lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations and\nregulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by\nboth governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal\nproceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation,\nand involve each of the Firm\u2019s lines of business and several geographies and a\nwide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and\nstatutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which\npresent novel legal theories. The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate\nrange of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its\nlegal proceedings is from $ 0to approximately $ 1.5billion at December 31, 2021.\nThis estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon\ninformation available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm\nbelieves that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain\nmatters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that\ndate. The Firm\u2019s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses\ninvolves significant judgment, given: \u2022 the number, variety and varying stages of\nthe proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages, \u2022 the\nexistence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm,\nwhose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, \u2022 the numerous yet-\nunresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class\ncertification and the scope of many of the claims, and \u2022 the attendant uncertainty\nof the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm\nhas made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator,\nor about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities,\nand those assumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition, the outcome of a\nparticular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in\nits estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be\nremote. Accordingly, the Firm\u2019s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably\npossible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary\nsignificantly. Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm\u2019s material legal\nproceedings. Amrapali . India\u2019s Enforcement Directorate (\u201cED\u201d) is investigating\nJ.P.Morgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and\n2012 by twooffshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into\nresidential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (\u201cAmrapali\u201d). In\n2017, numerous creditors filed civil claims against Amrapali, including petitions\nbrought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver\nresidential units. The home buyers\u2019 petitions have been overseen by the Supreme\nCourt of India and are ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P.\nMorgan India Private Limited approximately $ 31.5million. The Firm is appealing\nthe order and the fine. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued\nan order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including\nunspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in\nthe projects, violated certain currency control and money laundering provisions,\nand ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry under India\u2019s Prevention of Money\nLaundering Act (\u201cPMLA\u201d) and Foreign Exchange Management Act (\u201cFEMA\u201d). In May 2020,\nthe ED attached approximately $ 25million from J.P. Morgan India Private Limited\nin connection with the criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and\ncooperating with the PMLA investigation. Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation.\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the\nFederal Government of Nigeria (\u201cFGN\u201d) and two major international oil companies.\nThe account held approximately $ 1.1billion in connection with a dispute among the\nclients over rights to an oil field. Following the settlement of the dispute,\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in\naccordance with directions received from its clients. In November 2017, the\nFederal Republic of Nigeria (\u201cFRN\u201d) commenced a claim in the English High Court\nfor approximately $ 875million in payments made out of the accounts. The FRN,\nclaiming to be the same entity as the FGN, alleges that the payments were\ninstructed as part of a complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but\nthat JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or should have been on notice that the payments\nmay be fraudulent. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. applied for summary judgment and was\nunsuccessful. The claim is ongoing and a trial commenced in February 2022. Foreign\nExchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements\nwith certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (\u201cFX\u201d) sales\nand trading activities and controls related to those activities. Among those\nresolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal\nantitrust law. The Department of Labor granted the Firm a five-year\n                                              \n  290    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nexemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and its affiliates to continue\nto rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee\nRetirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d) until January 2023. The Firm will need\nthe Department of Labor to approve a further exemption to cover the remainder of\nthe ten-yeardisqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only\nremaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission\nmatter which is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal.\nWith respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval to the\nFirm\u2019s settlement of a consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs,\nwhich principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged\nconspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf\nof persons who transacted in FX futures and options on futures. Certain members of\nthe settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class,\nand certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm and other foreign exchange\ndealers in November 2018. A number of these actions remain pending. Further, a\nputative class action has been filed against the Firm and other foreign exchange\ndealers on behalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at\nallegedly inflated rates. Another putative class action was brought against the\nFirm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of purported indirect purchasers\nof FX instruments. In 2020, the Court approved a settlement by the Firm and\n11other defendants of that class action for a total of $ 10million. In addition,\nsome FX-related individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged\nunderlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K.,\nIsrael, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. Inquiries Concerning Preservation\nRequirements . In December 2021 certain of the Firm\u2019s subsidiaries entered into\nresolutions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and the U.S.\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) to resolve their respective civil\ninvestigations of compliance with records preservation requirements applicable to\nbroker-dealer firms, swap dealers and futures commission merchants. The SEC and\nCFTC found that J.P. Morgan Securities LLC did not maintain copies of certain\ncommunications required to be maintained under their respective record keeping\nrules, where such communications were sent or received by employees over\nelectronic messaging channels that had not been approved for employee use by the\nFirm. The CFTC resolution also included JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan\nSecurities plc as swap dealers. The SEC and CFTC also found related supervision\nfailures. Under these resolutions, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC paid a $ 125million\ncivil monetary penalty to the SEC, and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities plc paid a total $ 75million civil monetary\npenalty to the CFTC. The Firm continues to respond to requests for information and\nother material from certain authorities concerning its compliance with records\npreservation requirements in connection with business communications sent over\nelectronic messaging channels that have not been approved by the Firm. The Firm is\ncooperating with these inquiries. Interchange Litigation . Groups of merchants and\nretail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa\nand Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and\ndebit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust\nlaws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases for a cash payment, a\ntemporary reduction of credit card interchange, and modifications to certain\ncredit card network rules. In 2017, after the approval of that settlement was\nreversed on appeal, the case was remanded to the United States District Court for\nthe Eastern District of New York for further proceedings consistent with the\nappellate decision. The original class action was divided into twoseparate\nactions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily\ninjunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties to the monetary class action\nfinalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement.\nPursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an additional\n$ 900million to the approximately $ 5.3billion previously held in escrow from the\noriginal settlement. In December 2019, the amended settlement agreement was\napproved by the District Court. Certain merchants appealed the District Court\u2019s\napproval order, and those appeals are pending. Based on the percentage of\nmerchants that opted out of the amended class settlement, $ 700million has been\nreturned to the defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with the\nsettlement agreement. The injunctive class action continues separately, and in\nSeptember 2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class\ncertification in part, and denied the motion in part. In addition, certain\nmerchants have filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa\nand Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks, and some of those\nactions remain pending. LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and\nLitigation . JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various governmental\nagencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers\nAssociation\u2019s (\"BBA\") London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) for various\ncurrencies and the European Banking Federation\u2019s Euro Interbank Offered Rate\n(\u201cEURIBOR\u201d). The Swiss Competition Commission\u2019s investigation relating to EURIBOR,\nto which the Firm and other banks are subject, continues. In December 2016, the\nEuropean Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an\ninfringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed\nan appeal of that decision with the European General Court, and that appeal is\npending.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    291  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \nIn addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in\nvarious individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates,\nincluding U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the\nperiod that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of\ncertain actions and resolved certain other actions, and others are in various\nstages of litigation. The United States District Court for the Southern District\nof New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds\nand interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. A\nconsolidated putative class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR\nwas administered by ICE Benchmark Administration has been dismissed. In addition,\na group of individual plaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims,\nalleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement\nto set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based\nconsumer loans and credit cards. Defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019\ncomplaint. In December 2021, the court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motions for a\npreliminary injunction seeking to enjoin defendants from setting U.S. dollar LIBOR\nand enforcing any financial instruments that rely on U.S. dollar LIBOR. The Firm\u2019s\nsettlements of putative class actions related to Swiss franc LIBOR, the Singapore\nInterbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank\nBill Swap Reference Rate remain subject to court approval. Metals and U.S.\nTreasuries Investigations and Litigation and Related Inquiries. The Firm\npreviously reported that it and/or certain of its subsidiaries had entered into\nresolutions with the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d), the U.S. Commodity\nFutures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (\u201cSEC\u201d), which, collectively, resolved those agencies\u2019 respective\ninvestigations relating to historical trading practices by former employees in the\nprecious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct from 2008 to 2016.\nThe Firm entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (\u201cDPA\u201d) with the DOJ in\nwhich it agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging JPMorgan Chase &\nCo. with twocounts of wire fraud and agreed, along with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nand J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to certain terms and obligations as set forth\ntherein. Under the terms of the DPA, the criminal information will be dismissed\nafter three years, provided that JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nand J.P. Morgan Securities LLC fully comply with all of their obligations. Across\nthe threeresolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC, JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC agreed to pay a total monetary\namount of approximately $ 920million. A portion of the total monetary amount\nincludes victim compensation payments. Several putative class action complaints\nhave been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of\nNew York against the Firm and certain former employees, alleging a precious metals\nfutures and options price manipulation scheme in violation of the Commodity\nExchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust enrichment and deceptive\nacts or practices under the General Business Law of the State of New York. The\nCourt consolidated these putative class actions, and, in December 2021, the Court\npreliminarily approved a settlement among the parties. In addition, several\nputative class actions were filed in the United States District Courts for the\nNorthern District of Illinois and Southern District of New York against the Firm,\nalleging manipulation of U.S. Treasury futures and options, and bringing claims\nunder the Commodity Exchange Act. The actions in the Northern District of Illinois\nwere transferred to the Southern District of New York. The Court consolidated\nthese putative class actions, and, in December 2021, the Court preliminarily\napproved a settlement among the parties. In Canada, plaintiffs have moved to\ncommence putative class action proceedings based on similar alleged underlying\nconduct related to precious metals. In October 2020, twoputative class action\ncomplaints were filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the United\nStates District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the Firm and\ncertain individual defendants on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares during\nthe putative class period alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were\nmaterially false or misleading in that they did not disclose certain information\nrelating to the above-referenced investigations. The Court consolidated these\nputative class actions in January 2021. Plaintiffs filed their second amended\ncomplaint in May 2021, which additionally alleged that certain orders in precious\nmetals futures contracts placed by precious metals futures traders during the\nputative class period were materially false and misleading. Defendants have moved\nto dismiss. Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation . JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic\nSecurities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class action filed\nin the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The\ncomplaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law and New York State common\nlaw in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous\nexchange trading for securities lending transactions. Defendants\u2019 motion to\ndismiss the complaint was denied. Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this\naction, which defendants are opposing. * * * In addition to the various legal\nproceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as\ndefendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal\nproceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted\nagainst it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to\n                                              \n  292    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                              \ndefend itself vigorously. Additional\nlegal proceedings may be initiated from\ntime to time in the future. The Firm\nhas established reserves for several\nhundred of its currently outstanding\nlegal proceedings. In accordance with\nthe provisions of U.S. GAAP for\ncontingencies, the Firm accrues for a\nlitigation-related liability when it is\nprobable that such a liability has been\nincurred and the amount of the loss can\nbe reasonably estimated. The Firm\nevaluates its outstanding legal\nproceedings each quarter to assess its\nlitigation reserves, and makes\nadjustments in such reserves, upward or\ndownward, as appropriate, based on\nmanagement\u2019s best judgment after\nconsultation with counsel. The Firm\u2019s\nlegal expense was $ 426million, $\n1.1billion and $ 239million for the\nyears ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and\n2019, respectively. There is no\nassurance that the Firm\u2019s litigation\nreserves will not need to be adjusted\nin the future. In view of the inherent\ndifficulty of predicting the outcome of\nlegal proceedings, particularly where\nthe claimants seek very large or\nindeterminate damages, or where the\nmatters present novel legal theories,\ninvolve a large number of parties or\nare in early stages of discovery, the\nFirm cannot state with confidence what\nwill be the eventual outcomes of the\ncurrently pending matters, the timing\nof their ultimate resolution or the\neventual losses, fines, penalties or\nconsequences related to those matters.\nJPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its\ncurrent knowledge and after\nconsultation with counsel,\nconsideration of the material legal\nproceedings described above and after\ntaking into account its current\nlitigation reserves and its estimated\naggregate range of possible losses,\nthat the other legal proceedings\ncurrently pending against it should not\nhave a material adverse effect on the\nFirm\u2019s consolidated financial\ncondition. The Firm notes, however,\nthat in light of the uncertainties\ninvolved in such proceedings, there is\nno assurance that the ultimate\nresolution of these matters will not\nsignificantly exceed the reserves it\nhas currently accrued or that a matter\nwill not have material reputational\nconsequences. As a result, the outcome\nof a particular matter may be material\nto JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operating results\nfor a particular period, depending on,\namong other factors, the size of the\nloss or liability imposed and the level\nof JPMorgan Chase\u2019s income for that\nperiod.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K    293  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Note 31 \u2013 International operations                                              \n                                                                                  \nThe following table presents income statement and balance sheet-related\ninformation for JPMorgan Chase by major international geographic area. The Firm\ndefines international activities for purposes of this footnote presentation as\nbusiness transactions that involve clients residing outside of the U.S., and the\ninformation presented below is based predominantly on the domicile of the client,\nthe location from which the client relationship is managed, booking location or\nthe location of the trading desk. However, many of the Firm\u2019s U.S. operations\nserve international businesses. As the Firm\u2019s operations are highly integrated,\nestimates and subjective assumptions have been made to apportion revenue and\nexpense between U.S. and international operations. These estimates and assumptions\nare consistent with the allocations used for the Firm\u2019s segment reporting as set\nforth in Note 32.

The Firm\u2019s\ndefinition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and\nincludes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and\neach of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue\nfrom investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented\nin the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and\nsecurities. This allows management to assess the comparability of revenue from\nyear-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding\nincome tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax\nexpense/(benefit). These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by\nthe Firm as a whole or by the LOBs. Capital allocation Each business segment is\nallocated capital by taking into consideration a variety of factors including\ncapital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital\nrequirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for expected returns are\nestablished as key measures of a business segment\u2019s performance. The Firm\u2019s\nallocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized RWA, Basel III Advanced\nRWA, the GSIB surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe stress\nenvironment. The assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are\nperiodically reassessed and as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may\nchange from time to time.\nSegment results and reconciliation (a)\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                              \n  296    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n(a) Segment results on a managed basis reflect revenue on a FTE basis with the\ncorresponding income tax impact recorded within income tax expense/(benefit).\nThese adjustments are eliminated in reconciling items to arrive at the Firm\u2019s\nreported U.S. GAAP results.\n\n(b) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current\npresentation.

and\nrate. The attribution between volume and rate is calculated using annual average\nbalances for each category of assets and liabilities shown in the table and the\ncorresponding annual rates (refer to pages 300-304 for more information on average\nbalances and rates). In this analysis, when the change cannot be isolated to\neither volume or rate, it has been allocated to volume. The annual rates include\nthe impact of changes in market rates, as well as the impact of any change in\ncomposition of the various products within each category of asset or liability.\nThis analysis is calculated separately for each category without consideration of\nthe relationship between categories (for example, the net spread between the rates\nearned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities that fund those assets). As a\nresult, changes in the granularity or groupings considered in this analysis would\nproduce a different attribution result, and due to the complexities involved,\nprecise allocation of changes in interest rates between volume and rates is\ninherently complex and judgmental.\n                                                                                  \n  (Un\u2026

The minimum payment on an\noption ARM loan is based on the\ninterest rate charged during the\nintroductory period. This introductory\nrate is usually significantly below the\nfully indexed rate. The fully indexed\nrate is calculated using an index rate\nplus a margin. Once the introductory\nperiod ends, the contractual interest\nrate charged on the loan increases to\nthe fully indexed rate and adjusts\nmonthly to reflect movements in the\nindex. The minimum payment is typically\ninsufficient to cover interest accrued\nin the prior month, and any unpaid\ninterest is deferred and added to the\nprincipal balance of the loan. Option\nARM loans are subject to payment\nrecast, which converts the loan to a\nvariable-rate fully amortizing loan\nupon meeting specified loan balance and\nanniversary date triggers.\n\nPrime\n\nPrime mortgage loans are made to\nborrowers with good credit records who\nmeet specific underwriting\nrequirements, including prescriptive\nrequirements related to income and\noverall debt levels.
