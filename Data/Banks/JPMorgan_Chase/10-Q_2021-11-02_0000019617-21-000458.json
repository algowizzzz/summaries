The\nscheduled cessation date for U.K.\nsterling, Japanese yen, Swiss franc and\nEuro LIBOR, and the one-week and two-\nmonth tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR,\nremains December 31, 2021. The Firm\ncontinues to prioritize those\ncurrencies and tenors of LIBOR for\ncontract remediation and is finalizing\nits operational readiness to support\nrate fallback mechanisms across all\nproducts that reference IBORs for which\npublication will cease on December 31,\n2021.\n\nThe Firm continues to engage with\nclients to arrange for the remediation\nof in-scope IBOR-linked contracts, and\nto amend contracts with clients that\nare prepared to do so. For example,\nsubstantially all of the notional\namounts of the Firm\u2019s derivatives\nexposures that are documented under\nbilateral agreements now contain IBOR\nfallback provisions by virtue of\ncounterparty adherence to the 2020\nInternational Swaps and Derivatives\nAssociation, Inc.\u2019s (\"ISDA\") IBOR\nFallbacks Protocol. The Firm is also\nprepared for the conversion to\nalternative reference rates at various\ncentral counterparties (\"CCPs\")\nscheduled for the fourth quarter of\n2021.\n\nThe Federal Reserve, the OCC and the\nFDIC have encouraged banks to cease\nentering into new contracts that use\nU.S. dollar LIBOR as a reference rate\nby December 31, 2021, and in connection\nwith this, the Firm now offers various\nfloating rate products, and provides\nand arranges various types of floating\nrate debt financings, that reference\nthe Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n(\u201cSOFR\u201d) across its businesses.\n\nThe Firm continues to monitor the\ntransition relief being considered by\nthe U.S. Treasury Department regarding\nthe tax implications of reference rate\nreform and the legislative progress\nassociated with contracts or\ninstruments that do not have\nsatisfactory rate fallback mechanisms\nand that cannot easily be amended\n(e.g., certain floating rate debt\nsecurities, securitizations and\nadjustable rate mortgages).

Refer to Note 10 for\nadditional information on securities\nfinancing transactions.\n\nBeneficial interests issued by\nconsolidated VIEs decreased driven by\nmaturities of credit card\nsecuritizations in Treasury and CIO, as\nwell as lower issuances of commercial\npaper as a result of lower loan\nbalances in the Firm-administered\nmulti-seller conduits in CIB. Refer to\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements on page\n19 and Notes 13 and 22 for additional\ninformation on Firm-sponsored VIEs and\nloan securitization trusts.\n\nLong-term debt increased driven by net\nissuances, partially offset by fair\nvalue hedge accounting adjustments\nrelated to higher rates.

In addition,\nthere is a Corporate segment.\n\nThe business segments are determined\nbased on the products and services\nprovided, or the type of customer\nserved, and they reflect the manner in\nwhich financial information is\ncurrently evaluated by the Firm\u2019s\nOperating Committee. Segment results\nare presented on a managed basis. Refer\nto Explanation and Reconciliation of\nthe Firm\u2019s use of Non-GAAP Financial\nMeasures on pages 20-21 for a\ndefinition of managed basis.\n\nDescription of business segment\nreporting methodology\n\nResults of the business segments are\nintended to present each segment as if\nit were a stand-alone business. The\nmanagement reporting process that\nderives business segment results\nincludes the allocation of certain\nincome and expense items. The Firm\nperiodically assesses the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting\nclassifications used for segment\nreporting, and further refinements may\nbe implemented in future periods. The\nFirm also assesses the level of capital\nrequired for each LOB on at least an\nannual basis. The Firm\u2019s LOBs also\nprovide various business metrics which\nare utilized by the Firm and its\ninvestors and analysts in assessing\nperformance.\n\nRevenue sharing\n\nWhen business segments join efforts to\nsell products and services to the\nFirm\u2019s clients, the participating\nbusiness segments may agree to share\nrevenue from those transactions.\nRevenue is generally recognized in the\nsegment responsible for the related\nproduct or service, with allocations to\nthe other segment(s) involved in the\ntransaction. The segment results\nreflect these revenue-sharing\nagreements.\n\nFunds transfer pricing\n\nFunds transfer pricing is the process\nby which the Firm allocates interest\nincome and expense to each business\nsegment and transfers the primary\ninterest rate risk and liquidity risk\nexposures to Treasury and CIO within\nCorporate. The funds transfer pricing\nprocess considers the interest rate\nrisk, liquidity risk and regulatory\nrequirements on a product-by-product\nbasis within each business segment.\n\nCapital allocation\n\nThe amount of capital assigned to each\nsegment is referred to as equity.\nPeriodically, the assumptions and\nmethodologies used to allocate capital\nare reassessed and as a result, the\ncapital allocated to the LOBs may\nchange. Refer to Line of business\nequity on page 51, and page 98 of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for\nadditional information on capital\nallocation.\n\nRefer to Business Segment Results \u2013\nDescription of business segment\nreporting methodology on pages 65\u201366 of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for a\nfurther discussion of those\nmethodologies.\n

AWM evaluates fund          \n  performance utilizing this peer group ranking and   \n  believes that it provides investors with            \n  comparability across the industry. This change      \n  resulted in positive impacts on the quartile        \n  rankings shown in the following table, and both     \n  positive and negative impacts on the quartile       \n  rankings for prior periods, as compared to how      \n  they would have been ranked by Lipper. In           \n  addition, AWM has changed its selection of the      \n  \u201cprimary share class\u201d for certain non-U.S. funds,   \n  as set forth below, in order to establish a more    \n  consistent approach across these products. Prior    \n  periods in the following table have been revised    \n  to conform to the current presentation.             \n  \u2022Percentage of mutual fund assets under management  \n  in funds rated 4- or 5-star:                        \n  Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on     \n  their risk-adjusted performance over various        \n  periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and     \n  represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked      \n  funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5%    \n  of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating      \n  represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked     \n  funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5%    \n  of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is   \n  the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of   \n  industry-wide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar  \n  rating is derived from a weighted average of the    \n  performance associated with a fund\u2019s three-, five-  \n  and ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating    \n  metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds, separate star    \n  ratings are provided at the individual share class  \n  level. The Nomura \u201cstar rating\u201d is based on         \n  three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds    \n  with fewer than three years of history are not      \n  rated and hence excluded from these rankings. All   \n  ratings, the assigned peer categories and the       \n  asset values used to derive these rankings are      \n  sourced from the applicable fund rating provider.   \n  Where applicable, the fund rating providers         \n  redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The    \n  percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the   \n  share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at  \n  a \u201cprimary share class\u201d level to represent the      \n  star rating of all other funds, except for Japan,   \n  for which Nomura provides ratings at the fund       \n  level. The performance data may have been           \n  different if all share classes had been included.   \n  Past performance is not indicative of future        \n  results.                                            \n  \u2022Percentage of mutual fund assets under management  \n  in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one,    \n  three and five years):                              \n  All quartile rankings, the assigned peer            \n  categories and the asset values used to derive      \n  these rankings are sourced from the fund rating     \n  providers. Quartile rankings are based on the       \n  net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where      \n  applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate  \n  asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of   \n  AUM is based on fund performance and associated     \n  peer rankings at the share class level for          \n  U.S.-domiciled funds, at a \u201cprimary share class\u201d    \n  level to represent the quartile ranking for U.K.,   \n  Luxembourg and Hong Kong funds and at the fund      \n  level for all other funds. The performance data     \n  may have been different if all share classes had    \n  been included.

The minimum amount of\nregulatory capital that must be held by\nBHCs and banks is determined by\ncalculating risk-weighted assets\n(\u201cRWA\u201d), which are on-balance sheet\nassets and off-balance sheet exposures,\nweighted according to risk. Two\ncomprehensive approaches are prescribed\nfor calculating RWA: a standardized\napproach (\u201cBasel III Standardized\u201d),\nand an advanced approach (\u201cBasel III\nAdvanced\u201d). For each of the risk-based\ncapital ratios, the capital adequacy of\nthe Firm is evaluated against the lower\nof the Standardized or Advanced\napproaches compared to their respective\nminimum capital ratios.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s Basel III Standardized-risk-\nbased ratios are currently more binding\nthan the Basel III Advanced-risk-based\nratios.\n\nBasel III also includes a requirement\nfor Advanced Approach banking\norganizations, including the Firm, to\ncalculate the SLR. The Firm\u2019s SLR is\ncurrently more binding than the Basel\nIII Standardized-risk-based ratios.\nRefer to SLR on page 51 for additional\ninformation.\n\nKey Regulatory Developments\n\nCECL regulatory capital transition\ndelay. As part of their response to the\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the\nfederal banking agencies issued a final\nrule that provided the option beginning\nJanuary 1, 2020 to delay the effects of\nCECL on regulatory capital for two\nyears, followed by a\n\nthree-year transition period beginning\nJanuary 1, 2022 (\u201cCECL capital\ntransition provisions\u201d).\n\nThe Firm has elected to apply the CECL\ncapital transition provisions, and\naccordingly, for the period ended\nSeptember 30, 2021, the capital metrics\nof the Firm exclude $3.3 billion, which\nis the $2.7 billion day 1 impact to\nretained earnings and 25% of the $1.9\nbillion increase in the allowance for\ncredit losses from January 1, 2020\n(excluding allowances on PCD loans).\n\nThe impacts of the CECL capital\ntransition provisions have also been\nincorporated into Tier 2 capital,\nadjusted average assets, and total\nleverage exposure. Refer to Capital\nRisk Management on pages 91-101 and\nNote 1 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form\n10-K for further information on CECL\ncapital transition provisions and the\nCECL accounting guidance.\n\nPPP. On April 13, 2020, the federal\nbanking agencies issued an interim\nfinal rule (issued as final on\nSeptember 29, 2020) to neutralize the\nregulatory capital effects of\nparticipating in the PPP on risk-based\ncapital ratios by applying a zero\npercent risk weight to loans originated\nunder the program. The Firm does not\nexpect to realize material credit\nlosses on PPP loans because the loans\nare guaranteed by the SBA. As of\nSeptember 30, 2021, the Firm had\napproximately $13 billion of loans\nremaining under the program.\n\nTotal leverage exposure for purposes of\ncalculating the SLR includes PPP loans\nas the Firm did not participate in the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s Paycheck Protection\nProgram Lending Facility, which would\nhave allowed the Firm to exclude them\nunder the final rule.\n\nTLAC Holdings rule . On October 20,\n2020, the federal banking agencies\nissued a final rule prescribing the\nregulatory capital treatment for\nholdings of Total Loss-Absorbing\nCapacity (\"TLAC\") debt instruments by\ncertain large banking organizations,\nsuch as the Firm and JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. This rule expands the scope\nof the existing capital deductions rule\naround the holdings of capital\ninstruments of financial institutions\nto also include TLAC debt instruments\nissued by systemically important\nbanking organizations. The final rule\nbecame effective April 1, 2021 and did\nnot have a material impact on the\nFirm\u2019s risk-based capital metrics.\n                                        48

(b) Predominantly U.S. Treasuries, U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, and\nsovereign bonds net of applicable haircuts under the LCR rule.

(d) Excludes average excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The Firm\u2019s average LCR\nincreased during the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared with the\nthree-month period ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to an\n\nincrease in cash from long-term debt issuances during the second quarter 2021. The\nFirm's average LCR decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2021,\ncompared with the prior year period primarily due to the relative impact on net\ncash outflows from the significant increase in deposits. JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A.\u2019s average LCR increased during the three months ended September 30, 2021,\ncompared with both the three month periods ended June 30, 2021 and September 30,\n2020 primarily due to growth in deposits. Deposits continued to increase in the\nthird quarter primarily driven by the effect of certain government actions in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in excess liquidity in JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. is excluded from the Firm\u2019s reported LCR under the LCR rule. The\nFirm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR fluctuates from period to period,\ndue to changes in its eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of\nongoing business activity. Other liquidity sources In addition to the assets\nreported in the Firm\u2019s eligible HQLA above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable\nsecurities, such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm believes would be\navailable to raise liquidity. This includes excess eligible HQLA securities at\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The\nfair value of these securities was approximately $878 billion and $740 billion as\nof September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, although the amount of\nliquidity that could be raised would be dependent on prevailing market conditions.\nThe fair value increased compared to December 31, 2020, due to an increase in\nexcess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. which was primarily a result of\nhigher deposit s as well as an increase in CIB trading assets . The Firm also had\navailable borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Banks (\"FHLBs\") and the\ndiscount window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral pledged by\nthe Firm to such banks of approximately $303 billion and $307 billion as of\nSeptember 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. This borrowing capacity\nexcludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm\u2019s eligible HQLA\nor other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve\nBank discount window and other central banks. Although available, the Firm does\nnot view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and\nthe other central banks as a primary source of liquidity. NSFR The net stable\nfunding ratio (\u201cNSFR\u201d) is a liquidity requirement for large banking organizations\nthat is intended to measure the adequacy of \u201cavailable\u201d and \u201crequired\u201d amounts of\nstable funding over a one-year horizon. On October 20, 2020, the federal banking\nagencies\n                                        54                                        \nissued a final NSFR rule under which\nlarge banking organizations such as the\nFirm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. will\nbe required to maintain an NSFR of at\nleast 100% on an ongoing basis. The\nfinal NSFR rule became effective on\nJuly 1, 2021, and the Firm will be\nrequired to publicly disclose its\nquarterly average NSFR semi-annually\nbeginning in 2023.\n\nAs of September 30, 2021, the Firm and\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. are compliant\nwith the 100% minimum NSFR, based on\nthe Firm's current understanding of the\nfinal rule.\n                                                                                  \n  Funding                                                                         \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Sources of funds                                                                \n                                                                                  \nManagement believes that the Firm\u2019s\nunsecured and secured funding capacity\nis sufficient to meet its on- and off-\nbalance sheet obligations.\n\nThe Firm funds its global balance sheet\nthrough diverse sources of funding\nincluding stable deposits, secured and\nunsecured funding in the capital\nmarkets and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nDeposits are the primary funding source\nfor JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nAdditionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nmay also access funding through short-\nor long-term secured borrowings,\nthrough the issuance of\n\nunsecured long-term debt, or from\nborrowings from the Parent Company or\nthe Intermediate Holding Company\n(\u201cIHC\u201d). The Firm\u2019s non-bank\nsubsidiaries are primarily funded from\nlong-term unsecured borrowings and\nshort-term secured borrowings,\nprimarily securities loaned or sold\nunder repurchase agreements.

However, during periods of\nmarket disruption those trends could be affected. Average deposits increased for\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2020, reflecting significant inflows across the LOBs\nprimarily driven by the effect of certain government actions in response to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. In CCB, the increase was also driven by growth from existing\nand new accounts across both consumer and small business customers.

These\ninstruments are secured predominantly\nby high-quality securities collateral,\nincluding government-issued debt and\nU.S. GSE and government agency MBS.\nSecurities sold under agreements to\nrepurchase increased at September 30,\n2021, compared with December 31, 2020,\nreflecting the impact of client\nactivities and secured financing of\ntrading assets in CIB Markets,\npartially offset by lower secured\nfinancing of AFS investment securities\nin Treasury and CIO.\n\nThe balances associated with securities\nloaned or sold under agreements to\nrepurchase fluctuate over time due to\ninvestment and financing activities of\nclients, the Firm\u2019s demand for\nfinancing, the ongoing management of\nthe mix of the Firm\u2019s liabilities,\nincluding its secured and unsecured\nfinancing (for both the investment\nsecurities and market-making\nportfolios), and other market and\nportfolio factors.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s sources of short-term\nunsecured funding consist of other\nborrowed funds and issuance of\nwholesale commercial paper. The\ndecrease in commercial paper at\nSeptember 30, 2021, from December 31,\n2020 was due to lower net issuance\nprimarily for short-term liquidity\nmanagement.\n\nThe increase in unsecured other\nborrowed funds at September 30, 2021,\nfrom December 31, 2020, and for the\naverage three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2021 compared to the\nprior year period, was primarily due to\nnet issuances of structured notes and\nhigher overdrafts in CIB Markets.\n                                        56                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Long-term funding and issuance                                                  \n                                                                                  \nLong-term funding provides an\nadditional source of stable funding and\nliquidity for the Firm. The Firm\u2019s\nlong-term funding plan is driven\nprimarily by expected client activity,\nliquidity considerations, and\nregulatory requirements, including\nTLAC. Long-term funding objectives\ninclude maintaining diversification,\nmaximizing market access and optimizing\nfunding costs. The Firm evaluates\nvarious funding markets, tenors and\ncurrencies in creating its optimal\nlong-term funding plan.\n\nThe significant majority of the Firm\u2019s\nlong-term unsecured funding is issued\nby the Parent Company to provide\nflexibility in support of both bank and\nnon-bank subsidiary funding needs. The\nParent Company advances substantially\nall net funding proceeds to its\nsubsidiary, the IHC.

The Firm has provided\nvarious forms of assistance to customers and clients impacted by the COVID-19\npandemic, including payment deferrals and covenant modifications. The majority of\nthe Firm\u2019s COVID-19 related loan modifications have not been considered troubled\ndebt restructurings ( \u201c TDRs \u201d ). Assistance provided in response to the COVID-19\npandemic could delay the recognition of delinquencies, nonaccrual status, and net\ncharge-offs for those customers and clients who would have otherwise moved into\npast due or nonaccrual status.

Paycheck Protection\nProgram At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Firm had approximately\n$13 billion and $27 billion, respectively, of PPP loans remaining, including $11\nbillion and $19 billion, respectively, in the consumer portfolio, and $2 billion\nand $8 billion, respectively, in the wholesale portfolio. Since inception of the\nProgram, the Firm funded approximately $40 billion of loans. The PPP ended on May\n31, 2021 for new applications. The Firm continues to process forgiveness\napplications, and through September 30, 2021, approximately $27 billion of loans\nwere forgiven by the SBA. This resulted in accelerated recognition in interest\nincome of the associated deferred processing fees, primarily in CCB.

During\nthe third quarter of 2021, there were\napproximately $390 million of new\nenrollments in consumer payment\ndeferral programs.\n\nAs of September 30, 2021, the Firm had\napproximately $3.7 billion of retained\nconsumer loans under payment deferral\nprograms, a decrease of approximately\n$24.6 billion from June 30, 2020. The\nloans under deferral were predominantly\nin residential real estate.\nPredominantly all borrowers that exited\npayment deferral programs are current.\nThe Firm continues to monitor the\ncredit risk associated with loans\nsubject to payment deferrals throughout\nthe deferral period and on an ongoing\nbasis after the borrowers are required\nto resume making regularly scheduled\npayments and considers expected losses\nof principal and accrued interest on\nthese loans in its allowance for credit\nlosses.\n\nOf the $3.7 billion of retained loans\nstill under payment deferral programs\nas of September 30, 2021, approximately\n$1.6 billion were accounted for as TDRs\nprior to payment deferral and\napproximately $100 million were\naccounted for as TDRs because they did\nnot qualify for or the Firm did not\nelect the option to suspend TDR\naccounting guidance provided by the\nCARES Act and extended by the\nConsolidated Appropriations Act.\nBorrowers that are unable to resume or\ncontinue making payments in accordance\nwith the original or modified\ncontractual terms of their agreements\nupon exit from deferral programs will\nbe placed on nonaccrual status in line\nwith the Firm\u2019s nonaccrual policy,\nexcept for credit cards as permitted by\nregulatory guidance, and the loans\ncharged off or down in accordance with\nthe Firm\u2019s charge-off policies.

Retained loans\ndeclined from December 31, 2020 due to\npaydowns outpacing originations of\nprime mortgage loans in Home Lending,\nlargely offset by growth in AWM.\nRetained nonaccrual loans decreased\nfrom December 31, 2020 reflecting\nimproved credit performance . T he\nthree and nine month periods ending\nSeptember 30, 2021 reflected net\nrecoveries benefiting from further\nimprovement in HPI and higher reversals\nof prior write-downs due to loan\nprepayments as a result of the low rate\nenvironment compared to net charge-offs\nfor the three months ended September\n30, 2020, and lower net recoveries for\nthe nine months ended September 30,\n2020. In addition, the nine months\nended September 30, 2020 included a\nrecovery on a loan sale. Loans at fair\nvalue increased from December 31, 2020,\nreflecting loan purchase activity in\nCIB driven by higher client demand, as\nwell as increased originations in Home\nLending due to the continued low rate\nenvironment. Nonaccrual loans at fair\nvalue decreased from December 31, 2020\ndue to sales in CIB. The carrying value\nof home equity lines of credit\noutstanding was $19.8 billion at\nSeptember 30, 2021. This amount\nincluded $6.6 billion of HELOCs that\nhave recast from interest-only to fully\namortizing payments or have been\nmodified and $6.4 billion of interest-\nonly balloon HELOCs, which primarily\nmature after 2030. The Firm manages the\nrisk of HELOCs during their revolving\nperiod by closing or reducing the\nundrawn line to the extent permitted by\nlaw when borrowers are exhibiting a\nmaterial deterioration in their credit\nrisk profile. At September 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, the carrying value\nof interest-only residential mortgage\nloans were $27.8 billion and $25.6\nbillion, respectively. These loans have\nan interest-only payment period\ngenerally followed by an adjustable-\nrate or fixed-rate fully amortizing\npayment period to maturity and are\ntypically originated as higher-balance\nloans to higher-income borrowers,\npredominantly in AWM. Net recoveries\nand charge-offs for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2021,\nrespectively, were not material, as the\ncredit performance of this portfolio is\ngenerally in line with the performance\nof the broader prime mortgage\nportfolio.\n\nThe following table provides a summary\nof the Firm\u2019s residential mortgage\nportfolio insured and/or guaranteed by\nU.S. government agencies, predominantly\nloans held-for-sale and loans at fair\nvalue.

The increase in\nthe scored auto portfolio was\npredominantly driven by loan\noriginations largely offset by\npaydowns. Business Banking loans\ndeclined due to PPP loan forgiveness\nand paydowns largely offset by loan\noriginations. Net charge offs for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2021\nincreased when compared to the same\nperiod in the prior year primarily due\nto overdrafts. Net charge offs for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2021\ndecreased when compared to the same\nperiod in the prior year primarily due\nto lower auto charge-offs as the\ncurrent year had a greater benefit from\ngovernment stimulus, payment assistance\nprograms, and higher vehicle collateral\nvalues. The scored auto portfolio net\ncharge-off rates were 0.03% and 0.04%\nfor the three months ended September\n30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and\n0.01% and 0.28% for the nine months\nended September 30, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.

The September 30, 2021 30+ and\n90+ day delinquency rates of 1.00% and\n0.49%, respectively, decreased compared\nto the December 31, 2020 30+ and 90+\nday delinquency rates of 1.68% and\n0.92%, respectively. The delinquency\nrates continue to be positively\nimpacted by government stimulus and\nsupport provided to borrowers who\nparticipated in payment assistance\nprograms. Net charge-offs decreased for\nthe three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2021 compared with the\nprior year periods reflecting lower\ncharge-offs and higher recoveries as\nconsumer cash balances remained\nelevated benefiting from the impact of\ngovernment stimulus and payment\nassistance programs.\n\nConsistent with the Firm\u2019s policy, all\ncredit card loans typically remain on\naccrual status until charged off.\nHowever, the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan\nlosses includes the estimated\nuncollectible portion of accrued and\nbilled interest and fee income.

A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm\u2019s\nwholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm\ndistributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the\nmarket as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio\nconcentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in\npart by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and\ntransaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry,\nproduct and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 68-71\nfor further information. The Firm\u2019s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure\nheld in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated exposures held in CCB,\nincluding business banking and auto dealer exposure for which the wholesale\nmethodology is applied when determining the allowance for credit losses. In the\nnine months ended September 30, 2021, the credit environment continued to improve\nfollowing the broad-based deterioration in 2020 that resulted from the impacts of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. As of September 30, 2021, retained loans increased $17.8\nbillion driven by CIB and AWM partially offset by decreases in CB and CCB. In CB,\nthe decrease was largely driven by a net decrease in PPP loans. Lending-related\ncommitments increased $49.4 billion, predominantly driven by net portfolio\nactivity in CIB and CB, including an increase in held for sale commitments\nintended to be syndicated. In the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the\ninvestment-grade percentage of the credit portfolio decreased from 71% to 70%\ndriven by net portfolio activity, including new commitments. Criticized exposure\nwas $41.6 billion at both September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Nonperforming\nexposure decreased $814 million driven by lower nonperforming loans, largely in\nOil & Gas and Individuals and Individual Entities, with net portfolio activity and\nselect upgrades being partially offset by select downgrades. The decrease in\nnonperforming loans was partially offset by an increase in nonperforming\nderivatives. Net charge-offs were $100 million.\n                                                                                  \n  Who\u2026

The Firm continues to monitor the credit risk associated with loans subject\nto deferrals throughout the deferral period and on an ongoing basis after the\nborrowers are required to resume making regularly scheduled payments and considers\nexpected losses of principal and accrued interest on these loans in its allowance\nfor credit losses.\n\nIn addition, the Firm granted assistance in the form of covenant modifications.\nThese types of assistance, both payment deferrals and covenant modifications, are\ngenerally not reported as TDRs, either because the modifications were\ninsignificant or they qualified for the option to suspend the application of\naccounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the\nConsolidated Appropriations Act. Loans under assistance continue to be risk-rated\nin accordance with the Firm\u2019s overall credit risk management framework. As of\nSeptember 30, 2021, substantially all of these loans were considered performing.\n\nWholesale credit exposure \u2013 maturity and ratings profile\n\nThe following tables present the maturity and internal risk ratings profiles of\nthe wholesale credit portfolio as of September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020.\nThe Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics\nequivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and takes into\nconsideration collateral and structural support when determining the internal risk\nrating for each credit facility.

Total criticized exposure excluding loans held-for-sale and\nloans at fair value, was $41.6 billion at both September 30, 2021 and December 31,\n2020, representing approximately 3.8% and 4.0% of total wholesale credit exposure,\nrespectively, as select downgrades were offset by select upgrades and net\nportfolio activity. The total criticized exposure at September 30, 2021 was\nlargely undrawn and $38.5 billion was performing.\n\nThe table below summarizes by industry the Firm\u2019s exposures as of September 30,\n2021, and December 31, 2020.

The\ncontractual amounts of these financial\ninstruments represent the maximum\npossible credit risk should the clients\ndraw down on these commitments or when\nthe Firm fulfills its obligations under\nthese guarantees, and the clients\nsubsequently fail to perform according\nto the terms of these contracts. Most\nof these commitments and guarantees\nhave historically been refinanced,\nextended, cancelled, or expired without\nbeing drawn upon or a default\noccurring. As a result, the Firm does\nnot believe that the total contractual\namount of these wholesale lending-\nrelated commitments is representative\nof the Firm\u2019s expected future credit\nexposure or funding requirements. Refer\nto Note 22 for further information on\nwholesale lending-related commitments.\n                                                                                  \n  Receivables from customers                                                      \n                                                                                  \nReceivables from customers reflect\nheld-for-investment margin loans to\nbrokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM\nthat are collateralized by assets\nmaintained in the clients\u2019 brokerage\naccounts (e.g., cash on deposit, and\nliquid and readily marketable debt or\nequity securities). Because of this\ncollateralization, no allowance for\ncredit losses is generally held against\nthese receivables. To manage its credit\nrisk the Firm establishes margin\nrequirements and monitors the required\nmargin levels on an ongoing basis, and\nrequires clients to deposit additional\ncash or other collateral, or to reduce\npositions, when appropriate. These\nreceivables are reported within accrued\ninterest and accounts receivable on the\nFirm\u2019s Consolidated balance sheets.\n                                                                                  \n  Derivative contracts                                                            \n                                                                                  \nDerivatives enable clients and\ncounterparties to manage risk including\ncredit risk and risks arising from\nfluctuations in interest rates, foreign\nexchange, equities, and commodities.\nThe Firm makes markets in derivatives\nin order to meet these needs and uses\nderivatives to manage certain risks\nassociated with net open risk positions\nfrom its market-making activities,\nincluding the counterparty credit risk\narising from derivative receivables.\nThe Firm also uses derivative\ninstruments to manage its own credit\nrisk and other market risk exposure.\nThe nature of the counterparty and the\nsettlement mechanism of the derivative\naffect the credit risk to which the\nFirm is exposed. For OTC derivatives\nthe Firm is exposed to the credit risk\nof the derivative counterparty. For\nexchange-traded derivatives (\u201cETD\u201d),\nsuch as futures and options, and\ncleared over-the-counter (\u201cOTC-\ncleared\u201d) derivatives, the Firm can\nalso be exposed to the credit risk of\nthe relevant CCP. Where possible, the\nFirm seeks to mitigate its credit risk\nexposures arising from derivative\ncontracts through the use of legally\nenforceable master netting arrangements\nand collateral agreements.\n\nThe percentage of the Firm\u2019s over-the-\ncounter derivative transactions subject\nto collateral agreements \u2014 excluding\nforeign exchange spot trades, which are\nnot typically covered by collateral\nagreements due to their short maturity\nand centrally cleared trades that are\nsettled daily \u2014 was approximately 88%\nat both September 30, 2021, and\nDecember 31, 2020. Refer to Note 4 for\nadditional information on the Firm\u2019s\nuse of collateral agreements. Refer to\nNote 4 for a further discussion of\nderivative contracts, counterparties\nand settlement types.\n\nThe fair value of derivative\nreceivables reported on the\nConsolidated balance sheets were $67.9\nbillion and $75.4 billion at September\n30, 2021, and December 31, 2020,\nrespectively, with decreases primarily\ndriven by maturities of certain trades\nin CIB. Derivative receivables\nrepresent the fair value of the\nderivative contracts after giving\neffect to legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements and the related cash\ncollateral held by the Firm.\n\nIn addition, the Firm held liquid\nsecurities and other cash collateral\nthat the Firm believes is legally\nenforceable and may be used as security\nwhen the fair value of the client\u2019s\nexposure is in the Firm\u2019s favor. For\nthese purposes, the definition of\nliquid securities is consistent with\nthe definition of high quality liquid\nassets as defined in the LCR rule.\n\nIn management\u2019s view, the appropriate\nmeasure of current credit risk should\nalso take into consideration other\ncollateral, which generally represents\nsecurities that do not qualify as high\nquality liquid assets under the LCR\nrule, but that the Firm believes is\nlegally enforceable.

The\nallowance for credit losses comprises:\n\u2022 the allowance for loan losses, which\ncovers the Firm\u2019s retained loan\nportfolios (scored and risk-rated) and\nis presented separately on the\nConsolidated balance sheets, \u2022 the\nallowance for lending-related\ncommitments, which is presented on the\nConsolidated balance sheets in accounts\npayable and other liabilities, and \u2022\nthe allowance for credit losses on\ninvestment securities, which covers the\nFirm\u2019s HTM and AFS securities and is\nreflected within Investment Securities\non the Consolidated balance sheets.\nDiscussion of changes in the allowance\nThe allowance for credit losses as of\nSeptember 30, 2021 was $20.5 billion, a\ndecrease from $30.8 billion at December\n31, 2020. The decrease in the allowance\nfor credit losses reflected: \u2022 an $8.0\nbillion reduction in consumer,\npredominantly in the credit card\nportfolio, reflecting improvements in\nthe Firm's macroeconomic outlook; and \u2022\na $2.3 billion net reduction in\nwholesale, across the LOBs, reflecting\nimprovements in the Firm's\nmacroeconomic outlook. The COVID-19\npandemic has stressed many\nmacroeconomic variables (\u201cMEVs\u201d) used\nin the Firm's allowance estimate which\nhas created challenges in the use of\nmodeled credit loss estimates,\nincreased the reliance on management\njudgment, and resulted in adjustments\nto appropriately address the economic\ncircumstances. These adjustments\ncontinued through the third quarter of\n2021, although to a lesser extent than\nexperienced during 2020. The U.S.\neconomy has continued to improve\ndespite the ongoing impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, with the benefits of\nvaccination resulting in improvements\nin the Firm's macroeconomic outlook,\nparticularly in the adverse scenarios.\nHowever, uncertainties remain,\nincluding the impact that additional\nwaves and variants of COVID-19 may have\non the pace of economic growth, the\nstrength of underlying labor markets\nwith the expiration of government\nassistance programs, and the potential\nfor changes in consumer behavior that\ncould have longer term impacts on\ncertain sectors. As a result of these\nuncertainties, the Firm retained\nmeaningful weighting on its adverse\nscenarios in the third quarter of 2021,\nin line with the second quarter of\n2021, but to a lesser extent than the\nfourth quarter of 2020. These adverse\nscenarios incorporate more punitive\nmacroeconomic factors than the central\ncase assumptions outlined below,\nresulting in a weighted average U.S.\nunemployment rate near 7% into the\nfirst quarter of 2022\n\nand falling below 6% in the third\nquarter of 2022, and a weighted average\ncumulative change in U.S. gross\ndomestic product (\"GDP\") of 3.8% in the\nfourth quarter of 2022.

The investment securities\nportfolio is predominantly held by\nTreasury and CIO in connection with the\nFirm\u2019s balance sheet or asset-liability\nmanagement objectives. Principal\ninvestments are predominantly\nprivately-held non-traded financial\ninstruments and are managed in the LOBs\nand Corporate. Investments are\ntypically intended to be held over\nextended periods and, accordingly, the\nFirm has no expectation for short-term\nrealized gains with respect to these\ninvestments. Investment securities risk\nInvestment securities risk includes the\nexposure associated with a default in\nthe payment of principal and interest.\nThis risk is mitigated given that the\ninvestment securities portfolio held by\nTreasury and CIO is predominantly\ninvested in high-quality securities. At\nSeptember 30, 2021, the Treasury and\nCIO investment securities portfolio,\nnet of allowance for credit losses, was\n$593.0 billion, and the average credit\nrating of the securities comprising the\nportfolio was AA+ (based upon external\nratings where available and where not\navailable, based primarily upon\ninternal risk ratings). Refer to\nCorporate segment results on pages\n44-46 and Note 9 for further\ninformation on the investment\nsecurities portfolio and internal risk\nratings. Refer to Market Risk\nManagement on pages 78-82 for further\ninformation on the market risk inherent\nin the portfolio. Refer to Liquidity\nRisk Management on pages 54-58 for\nfurther information on related\nliquidity risk.\n\nPrincipal investment risk Principal\ninvestments are typically privately\nheld non-traded financial instruments\nrepresenting ownership interests or\nother forms of junior capital and span\nmultiple asset classes. These\ninvestments are made by dedicated\ninvesting businesses or as part of a\nbroader business strategy. In general,\nprincipal investments include tax-\noriented investments and investments\nmade to enhance or accelerate the\nFirm\u2019s business strategies and exclude\nthose that are consolidated on the\nFirm's balance sheets. The Firm\u2019s\ninvestments will continue to evolve in\nline with its strategies, including the\nFirm\u2019s commitment to support\nunderserved communities and minority-\nowned businesses.

The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in\naggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals. A backtesting exception occurs\nwhen the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the\nprior day. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are\ngreater than one hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the\nresults of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm\u2019s Basel\nIII Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory\nVaR applied to the Firm\u2019s covered positions.\n                Distribution of Daily Backtesting Gains and Losses                \n                                                                                  \n                                        80                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Earnings-at-risk                                                                \n                                                                                  \nThe effect of interest rate exposure on\nthe Firm\u2019s reported net income is\nimportant as interest rate risk\nrepresents one of the Firm\u2019s\nsignificant market risks. Interest rate\nrisk arises not only from trading\nactivities but also from the Firm\u2019s\ntraditional banking activities, which\ninclude extension of loans and credit\nfacilities, taking deposits and issuing\ndebt as well as from the investment\nsecurities portfolio. Refer to the\ntable on page 136 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n2020 Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and\nCorporate, identifying positions\nincluded in earnings-at-risk. One way\nthe Firm evaluates its structural\ninterest rate risk is through earnings-\nat-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the\nFirm\u2019s interest rate exposure for a\ngiven interest rate scenario. It is\npresented as a sensitivity to a\nbaseline, which includes net interest\nincome and certain interest rate\nsensitive fees. The baseline uses\nmarket interest rates and in the case\nof deposits, pricing assumptions. The\nFirm conducts simulations of changes to\nthis baseline for interest rate-\nsensitive assets and liabilities\ndenominated in U.S. dollars and other\ncurrencies (\u201cnon-U.S. dollar\u201d\ncurrencies). These simulations\nprimarily include retained loans,\ndeposits, deposits with banks,\ninvestment securities, long-term debt\nand any related interest rate hedges,\nand funds transfer pricing of other\npositions in risk management VaR and\nother sensitivity-based measures as\ndescribed on page 136 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K. Earnings-at-\nrisk scenarios estimate the potential\nchange to a net interest income\nbaseline, over the following 12 months\nutilizing multiple assumptions. These\nscenarios include a parallel shift\ninvolving changes to both short-term\nand long-term rates by an equal amount;\na steeper yield curve involving holding\nshort-term rates constant and\nincreasing long-term rates; and a\nflatter yield curve involving\nincreasing short-term rates and holding\nlong-term rates constant. These\nscenarios consider many different\nfactors, including: \u2022 The impact on\nexposures as a result of instantaneous\nchanges in interest rates from baseline\nrates. \u2022 Forecasted balance sheet, as\nwell as modeled prepayment and\nreinvestment behavior, but do not\ninclude assumptions about actions that\ncould be taken by the Firm or its\nclients and customers in response to\nany such instantaneous rate changes.\nMortgage prepayment assumptions are\nbased on the interest rates used in the\nscenarios compared with underlying\ncontractual rates, the time since\norigination, and other factors which\nare updated periodically based on\nhistorical experience. Deposit\nforecasts do not currently include\nassumptions to account for the reversal\nof Quantitative Easing in the 12-month\nhorizon for earnings-at-risk. \u2022 The\npricing sensitivity of deposits, known\nas deposit betas, represent the amount\nby which deposit rates paid could\nchange upon a given change in market\ninterest rates. The deposit rates paid\nin these scenarios may differ from\nactual deposit rates paid, due to\nrepricing lags and other factors.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s earnings-at-risk scenarios\nare periodically evaluated and enhanced\nin response to changes in the\ncomposition of the Firm\u2019s balance\nsheet, changes in market conditions,\nimprovements in the Firm\u2019s simulation\nand other factors.

The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the\nvarious portfolios which may be impacted by these developments and measures the\nextent to which the Firm\u2019s exposures are diversified given the Firm\u2019s strategy and\nrisk tolerance relative to a country. Country Risk Management continues to monitor\nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individual countries. Refer to pages\n143-144 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm\u2019s\ncountry risk management. Risk Reporting The following table presents the Firm\u2019s\ntop 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of September 30, 2021 and\ntheir comparative exposures as of December 31, 2020. The selection of countries\nrepresents the Firm\u2019s largest total exposures by individual country, based on the\nFirm\u2019s internal country risk management approach, and does not represent the\nFirm\u2019s view of any existing or potentially adverse credit conditions. Country\nexposures may fluctuate from period to period due to client activity and market\nflows. The increase in exposure to Australia was due to increased cash placements\nwith the central bank of Australia in the first quarter of 2021, predominantly\ndriven by client activity following policy decisions in the country and growth in\nclient deposits.\n                                                                                  \n  Top                                                                             \n  20                                                                              \n  co\u2026                                                                             \n  ex\u2026                                                                             \n  (e\u2026                                                                             \n  the                                                                             \n  U.\u2026    Sept\u2026                                                  Dec\u2026              \n  (in    30,                                                    31,               \n  bi\u2026    2021                                                   202\u2026              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                     Len\u2026       Trad\u2026                  Total               Total  \n                      and         and       Oth\u2026       expo\u2026               expo\u2026  \n                     dep\u2026       inve\u2026                                             \n  Ge\u2026             $  110\u2026    $    4.0    $   0.3    $  115.0            $  127.2  \n  Un\u2026                52.2        13.0        2.3        67.5                68.4  \n  Ki\u2026                                                                             \n  Ja\u2026                25.6         9.3        0.3        35.2                45.6  \n  Au\u2026                24.0         7.5        0.2        31.7                15.9  \n  Fr\u2026                13.5         4.8        1.7        20.0                18.8  \n  Ch\u2026                11.0         7.0        1.7        19.7                21.2  \n  Sw\u2026                11.1         0.8        2.8        14.7                18.7  \n  Ca\u2026                12.5         1.5        0.2        14.2                14.5  \n  Br\u2026                 4.6         8.3          \u2014        12.9                10.8  \n  Lu\u2026                10.7         1.4          \u2014        12.1                12.4  \n  In\u2026                 4.9         5.4        1.4        11.7                10.5  \n  So\u2026                 4.1         7.2        0.3        11.6                10.1  \n  Ko\u2026                                                                             \n  Si\u2026                 6.8         4.1        0.3        11.2                 8.7  \n  Sp\u2026                 9.1         1.5          \u2014        10.6                 5.8  \n  Ne\u2026                 7.0         1.4        1.3         9.7                 7.7  \n  It\u2026                 5.9         3.5        0.2         9.6                 9.7  \n  Sw\u2026                 7.8         0.2        0.1         8.1                 4.3  \n  Sa\u2026                 5.6         2.2          \u2014         7.8                 5.8  \n  Ar\u2026                                                                             \n  Be\u2026                 5.5         1.4          \u2014         6.9                 4.0  \n  Ho\u2026                                                                             \n  Ko\u2026                 4.7         1.9        0.2         6.8                 6.2  \n  SAR                                                                             \n                                                                                  \n(a) Country exposures presented in the\ntable reflect 89% and 90% of total\nFirmwide non-U.S. exposure, where\nexposure is attributed to an individual\ncountry, at September 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, respectively.

Refer to Compliance Risk\nManagement on page 148, Conduct Risk\nManagement on page 149, Legal Risk\nManagement on page 150 and Estimations\nand Model Risk Management on page 151\nof JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for\nmore information. Details on other\nselect examples of operational risks\nare provided below.\n\nBusiness and technology resiliency risk\n\nBusiness disruptions can occur due to\nforces beyond the Firm\u2019s control such\nas the spread of infectious diseases or\npandemics, severe weather, power or\ntelecommunications loss, accidents,\nfailure of a third party to provide\nexpected services, cyberattack,\nflooding, transit strikes, terrorism\nand health emergencies. The safety of\nthe Firm\u2019s employees and customers is\nof the highest priority. The Firmwide\nresiliency program is intended to\nenable the Firm to recover its critical\nbusiness functions and supporting\nassets (e.g., people, technology, data\nand facilities) in the event of a\nbusiness interruption. The program\nincludes governance, awareness\ntraining, and testing of recovery\nstrategies, as well as strategic and\ntactical initiatives to identify,\nassess, and manage business\ninterruption and public safety risks.\nThe strength and proficiency of the\nFirmwide resiliency program has played\nan integral role in maintaining the\nFirm\u2019s business operations during and\nafter various events.\n\nCybersecurity Risk\n\nDue to the ongoing impact of COVID-19,\nthe Firm continues to leverage use of\nremote access and video conferencing\nsolutions provided by third parties to\nfacilitate remote work. As a result,\nthe Firm has deployed additional\nprecautionary measures to mitigate\ncybersecurity risks.\n\nPayment Fraud Risk\n\nThe risk of payment fraud has\nnormalized since the heightened levels\nexperienced during earlier stages of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. The Firm\ncontinues to employ various controls\nfor managing payment fraud risk as well\nas providing employee and client\neducation and awareness trainings.\n                                        84                                        \n                                         \n  ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT  \n                                         \nEstimations and Model risk, a\nsubcategory of operational risk, is the\npotential for adverse consequences from\ndecisions based on incorrect or misused\nestimation outputs.\n\nThe Firm uses models and other\nanalytical and judgment- based\nestimations across various businesses\nand functions. The estimation methods\nare of varying levels of sophistication\nand are used for many purposes, such as\nthe valuation of positions and\nmeasurement of risk, assessing\nregulatory capital requirements,\nconducting stress testing, and making\nbusiness decisions.\n\nWhile models are inherently imprecise,\nthe degree of imprecision or\nuncertainty can be heightened by the\nmarket or economic environment. This is\nparticularly true when the current and\nforecasted environment is significantly\ndifferent from the historical\nmacroeconomic environments upon which\nthe models were trained, as the Firm\nhas experienced during the COVID-19\npandemic. This uncertainty may\nnecessitate a greater degree of\njudgment and analytics to inform\nadjustments to model outputs than in\ntypical periods.\n\nRefer to Critical Accounting Estimates\nUsed by the Firm on pages 86-88 and\nNote 2 of this Form 10-Q, and\nEstimations and Model Risk Management\nsection on page 151 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n2020 Form 10-K for a summary of model-\nbased valuations and other valuation\ntechniques.\n                                        85                                        \n                                                  \n  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM  \n                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s accounting policies\nand use of estimates are integral to\nunderstanding its reported results. The\nFirm\u2019s most complex accounting\nestimates require management\u2019s judgment\nto ascertain the appropriate carrying\nvalue of assets and liabilities. The\nFirm has established policies and\ncontrol procedures intended to ensure\nthat estimation methods, including any\njudgments made as part of such methods,\nare well-controlled, independently\nreviewed and applied consistently from\nperiod to period. The methods used and\njudgments made reflect, among other\nfactors, the nature of the assets or\nliabilities and the related business\nand risk management strategies, which\nmay vary across the Firm\u2019s businesses\nand portfolios. In addition, the\npolicies and procedures are intended to\nensure that the process for changing\nmethodologies occurs in an appropriate\nmanner. The Firm believes its estimates\nfor determining the carrying value of\nits assets and liabilities are\nappropriate. The following is a brief\ndescription of the Firm\u2019s critical\naccounting estimates involving\nsignificant judgments.\n                                                                                  \n  Allowance for credit losses                                                     \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses\nrepresents management\u2019s estimate of\nexpected credit losses over the\nremaining expected life of the Firm\u2019s\nfinancial assets measured at amortized\ncost and certain off-balance sheet\nlending-related commitments. The\nallowance for credit losses comprises:\n\n\u2022 The allowance for loan losses, which\ncovers the Firm\u2019s retained loan\nportfolios (scored and risk-rated),\n\n\u2022 The allowance for lending-related\ncommitments, and\n\n\u2022 The allowance for credit losses on\ninvestment securities, which covers the\nFirm\u2019s HTM and AFS securities.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses\ninvolves significant judgment on a\nnumber of matters including development\nand weighting of macroeconomic\nforecasts, incorporation of historical\nloss experience, assessment of risk\ncharacteristics, assignment of risk\nratings, valuation of collateral, and\nthe determination of remaining expected\nlife. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 of\nJPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for\nfurther information on these judgments\nas well as the Firm\u2019s policies and\nmethodologies used to determine the\nFirm\u2019s allowance for credit losses; and\nrefer to Allowance for credit losses on\npages 75-76 and Note 12 of this Form\n10-Q for further information.\n\nOne of the most significant judgments\ninvolved in estimating the Firm\u2019s\nallowance for credit losses relates to\nthe macroeconomic forecasts used to\nestimate credit losses over the eight-\nquarter forecast period within the\nFirm\u2019s methodology. The eight-quarter\nforecast incorporates hundreds of MEVs\nthat are relevant for exposures across\nthe Firm, with modeled credit losses\nbeing driven primarily by a subset of\nless than twenty variables. The\nspecific variables that have the\ngreatest effect on the modeled losses\nof each portfolio vary by portfolio and\ngeography.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio\ninclude U.S. unemployment, HPI and U.S.\nreal GDP.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio\ninclude U.S. real GDP, U.S.\nunemployment, U.S. equity prices,\ncorporate credit spreads, oil prices,\ncommercial real estate prices and HPI.\n\nChanges in the Firm\u2019s assumptions and\nforecasts of economic conditions could\nsignificantly affect its estimate of\nexpected credit losses in the portfolio\nat the balance sheet date or lead to\nsignificant changes in the estimate\nfrom one reporting period to the next.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a\nweak labor market and weak overall\neconomic conditions that affected\nborrowers across the Firm\u2019s consumer\nand wholesale lending portfolios.\n\nThe U.S. economy has continued to\nimprove despite the ongoing impact of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, with the\nbenefits of vaccination resulting in\nimprovements in the Firm's\nmacroeconomic outlook, particularly in\nthe adverse scenarios. However,\nuncertainties remain, including the\nimpact that additional waves and\nvariants of COVID-19 may have on the\npace of economic growth, the strength\nof underlying labor markets with the\nexpiration of government assistance\nprograms, and the potential for changes\nin consumer behavior that could have\nlonger term impacts on certain sectors.\nJudgment is still required to estimate\nthe speed and trajectory of the\neconomic recovery.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate how\npotential changes in any one factor or\ninput might affect the overall\nallowance for credit losses because\nmanagement considers a wide variety of\nfactors and inputs in estimating the\nallowance for credit losses. Changes in\nthe factors and inputs considered may\nnot occur at the same rate and may not\nbe consistent across all geographies or\nproduct types, and changes in factors\nand inputs may be directionally\ninconsistent, such that improvement in\none factor or input may offset\ndeterioration in others.\n\nTo consider the impact of a\nhypothetical alternate macroeconomic\nforecast, the Firm compared the modeled\ncredit losses determined using its\ncentral and relative adverse\nmacroeconomic scenarios, which are two\nof the five scenarios considered in\nestimating the allowances for loan\nlosses and lending-related commitments.\nThe central and relative adverse\nscenarios each included a full suite of\nMEVs, but differed in the levels, paths\nand peaks/troughs of those variables\nover the eight-quarter forecast period.\n\nFor example, compared to the Firm\u2019s\ncentral scenario shown on page 75 and\nin Note 12, the Firm\u2019s relative adverse\nscenario assumes a significantly\nelevated U.S. unemployment rate through\n2021, averaging approximately 2.3%\nhigher over the eight-quarter forecast,\nwith a peak difference of approximately\n3.7% in the first quarter of 2022;\nlower U.S. real GDP with a slower\nrecovery, remaining nearly 2.7% lower\nat the end of the\n                                        86                                        \neight-quarter forecast, with a peak\ndifference of approximately 5.9% in the\nfirst quarter of 2022; and lower\nnational HPI with a peak difference of\nnearly 14.4% and forecasted trough,\nboth in the first quarter of 2023. This\nanalysis is not intended to estimate\nexpected future changes in the\nallowance for credit losses, for a\nnumber of reasons, including: \u2022 the\nFirm continues to place meaningful\nweighting on its adverse scenarios in\nestimating its allowance for credit\nlosses as of September 30, 2021, and\naccordingly, the existing allowance\nalready reflects credit losses beyond\nthose estimated under the central\nscenario \u2022 the impacts of changes in\nmany MEVs are both interrelated and\nnonlinear, so the results of this\nanalysis cannot be simply extrapolated\nfor more severe changes in\nmacroeconomic variables \u2022 the COVID-19\npandemic has stressed many MEVs used in\nthe Firm's allowance estimate, which\nhas created challenges in the use of\nmodeled credit loss estimations \u2022\nsignificant changes in the expected\nseverity and duration of the economic\ndownturn caused by the COVID-19\npandemic, effects of government support\nand customer assistance, and speed and\ntrajectory of the subsequent recovery\ncould significantly affect the Firm\u2019s\nestimate of expected credit losses\nirrespective of the estimated\nsensitivities described below. To\ndemonstrate the sensitivity of credit\nloss estimates to macroeconomic\nforecasts as of September 30, 2021, the\nFirm compared the modeled estimates\nunder its relative adverse scenario to\nits central scenario. Without\nconsidering the additional weight the\nFirm has placed on its adverse\nscenarios or any other offsetting or\ncorrelated effects in other qualitative\ncomponents of the Firm\u2019s allowance for\ncredit losses for these lending\nexposures, the comparison between these\ntwo scenarios reflects the following\ndifferences: \u2022 An increase of\napproximately $350 million for\nresidential real estate loans and\nlending-related commitments \u2022 An\nincrease of approximately $2.6 billion\nfor credit card loans \u2022 An increase of\napproximately $2.1 billion for\nwholesale loans and lending-related\ncommitments This analysis relates only\nto the modeled credit loss estimates\nand is not intended to estimate changes\nin the overall allowance for credit\nlosses as it does not reflect any\npotential changes in other adjustments\nto the quantitative calculation, which\nwould also be influenced by the\njudgment management applies to the\nmodeled lifetime loss estimates to\nreflect the uncertainty and imprecision\nof these modeled lifetime loss\nestimates based on then-current\ncircumstances and conditions.\nRecognizing that forecasts of\nmacroeconomic conditions are inherently\nuncertain, particularly in light of the\nrecent economic conditions, the Firm\nbelieves that its process to\n\nconsider the available information and\nassociated risks and uncertainties is\nappropriately governed and that its\nestimates of expected credit losses\nwere reasonable and appropriate for the\nperiod ended September 30, 2021.

The level 3 balances would\nbe reduced if netting were applied,\nincluding the netting benefit\nassociated with cash collateral.\n                                        87                                        \nValuation\nEstimating fair value requires the\napplication of judgment. The type and\nlevel of judgment required is largely\ndependent on the amount of observable\nmarket information available to the\nFirm. For instruments valued using\ninternally developed valuation models\nand other valuation techniques that use\nsignificant unobservable inputs and are\ntherefore classified within level 3 of\nthe valuation hierarchy, judgments used\nto estimate fair value are more\nsignificant than those required when\nestimating the fair value of\ninstruments classified within levels 1\nand 2.\n\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair\nvalue for an instrument within level 3,\nmanagement must first determine the\nappropriate valuation model or other\nvaluation technique to use. Second, the\nlack of observability of certain\nsignificant inputs requires management\nto assess all relevant empirical data\nin deriving valuation inputs including,\nfor example, transaction details, yield\ncurves, interest rates, prepayment\nspeed, default rates, volatilities,\ncorrelations, prices (such as\ncommodity, equity or debt prices),\nvaluations of comparable instruments,\nforeign exchange rates and credit\ncurves. Refer to Note 2 for a further\ndiscussion of the valuation of level 3\ninstruments, including unobservable\ninputs used.\n\nFor instruments classified in levels 2\nand 3, management judgment must be\napplied to assess the appropriate level\nof valuation adjustments to reflect\ncounterparty credit quality, the Firm\u2019s\ncreditworthiness, market funding rates,\nliquidity considerations, unobservable\nparameters, and for portfolios that\nmeet specified criteria, the size of\nthe net open risk position. The\njudgments made are typically affected\nby the type of product and its specific\ncontractual terms, and the level of\nliquidity for the product or within the\nmarket as a whole. In periods of\nheightened market volatility and\nuncertainty judgments are further\naffected by the wider variation of\nreasonable valuation estimates,\nparticularly for positions that are\nless liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a\nfurther discussion of valuation\nadjustments applied by the Firm.\n\nImprecision in estimating unobservable\nmarket inputs or other factors can\naffect the amount of gain or loss\nrecorded for a particular position.\nFurthermore, while the Firm believes\nits valuation methods are appropriate\nand consistent with those of other\nmarket participants, the methods and\nassumptions used reflect management\njudgment and may vary across the Firm\u2019s\nbusinesses and portfolios.\n\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and\nassumptions in the determination of\nfair value. The use of methodologies or\nassumptions different than those used\nby the Firm could result in a different\nestimate of fair value at the reporting\ndate.

(\u201cJPMorgan Chase\u201d or the \u201cFirm\u201d), a financial holding company\nincorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading financial services firm\nbased in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment\nbanking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial\nbanking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 25\nfor a further discussion of the Firm\u2019s business segments. The accounting and\nfinancial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to\nU.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting\nand reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. The unaudited\nConsolidated Financial Statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets\nand liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the\nopinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included such\nthat this interim financial information is fairly stated. These unaudited\nConsolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited\nConsolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K. Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been\nreclassified to conform with the current presentation, including certain deferred\ninvestment tax credits. In the first quarter of 2021 the Firm reclassified certain\ndeferred investment tax credits from accounts payable and other liabilities to\nother assets to be a reduction to the carrying value of the associated tax-\noriented investments. The reclassification also resulted in an increase in income\ntax expense and a corresponding increase in other income, with no effect on net\nincome. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current\npresentation, including the Firm\u2019s effective income tax rate. The reclassification\ndid not change the Firm\u2019s results of operations on a managed basis. Consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and\nother entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All\nmaterial intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Assets held\nfor clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of\nJPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm\ndetermines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first\nevaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest\nentity. Refer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for a further\ndescription of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s accounting policies regarding consolidation.\nOffsetting assets and liabilities U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative\nreceivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related\ncash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S.\nGAAP also permits securities financing activities to be presented on a net basis\nwhen specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally\nenforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances\nwhen the specified conditions are met. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020\nForm 10-K for further information on offsetting assets and liabilities. Income tax\nexpense The Firm\u2019s effective tax rate was 17.2% and 19.1% for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2021, respectively, and 19.8% and 17.7% for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively. The effective tax rate for\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 reflects the recognition of an\nincome tax benefit of $ 566million related to finalizing the Firm\u2019s 2020 U.S.\nfederal tax return, which reduced the Firm\u2019s effective tax rate by 4.0% and 1.2%\nrespectively.

           \n(a) At September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, included total U.S. GSE\nobligations of $ 68.6billion and $ 117.6billion, respectively, which were\nmortgage-related.\n\n(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of\ncost or net realizable value. \u201cNet realizable value\u201d is a term defined in U.S.\nGAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (\u201ctransaction costs\u201d).\nTransaction costs for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories are either not\napplicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable\nvalue approximates fair value for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories.\nWhen fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below\ncost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because\nunder fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair\nvalue. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of the Firm\u2019s hedge accounting\nrelationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all\nphysical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.\n                                        99                                        \n(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the\namount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).\n\n(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value\nper share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be\nclassified in the fair value hierarchy. At September 30, 2021, and December 31,\n2020, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds,\nprivate equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $ 813million and $\n670million, respectively. Included in these balances at September 30, 2021, and\nDecember 31, 2020, were trading assets of $ 56million and $ 52million,\nrespectively, and other assets of $ 757million and $ 618million, respectively.\n\n(e) At September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, included $ 27.2billion and $\n15.1billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $ 8.1billion\nand $ 6.3billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential\nmortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to\nsell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $ 13.1billion and $ 8.4billion,\nrespectively.\n\n(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative\nreceivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and\npaid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3\nbalances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit\nassociated with cash collateral.\n\n(g) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current\npresentation.\n\nLevel 3 valuations\n\nRefer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for further information on the\nFirm\u2019s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair\nvalue for individual financial instruments. The following table presents the\nFirm\u2019s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to\nmeasure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant\nunobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or\narithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an\ninstrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs\nto the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically\ninclude observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and\ncan be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components.\nThe level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the\nFirm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial\ninstruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within\nlevels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of values presented in the\ntable is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the\nsignificant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification.\nWhere provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table\nare calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being\nused to value. In the Firm\u2019s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic\naverage values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of\nthe reasonableness of the Firm\u2019s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect\nthe characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative\ndistribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two\noption contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation\nuncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels\nbecause the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices.\nThe input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-\nperiod and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments\nheld by the Firm at each balance sheet date.\n                                       100                                        \n

The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the\nderivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable\ninputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.\n(f) Includes equity securities of $ 1.0billion including $ 379million in Other\nAssets, for which quoted prices are not readily available and the fair value is\ngenerally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA multiples and\ncomparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant\nboth individually and in aggregate.\n(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted\nmarket prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price-\nbased internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par\nvalue of $ 100.\n(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.\n(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where\narithmetic averages are used.\n                                       101                                        \nChanges in and ranges of unobservable\ninputs Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion\nof the impact on fair value of changes\nin unobservable inputs and the\nrelationships between unobservable\ninputs as well as a description of\nattributes of the underlying\ninstruments and external market factors\nthat affect the range of inputs used in\nthe valuation of the Firm\u2019s positions.\nChanges in level 3 recurring fair value\nmeasurements The following tables\ninclude a rollforward of the\nConsolidated balance sheets amounts\n(including changes in fair value) for\nfinancial instruments classified by the\nFirm within level 3 of the fair value\nhierarchy for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2021 and 2020. When\na determination is made to classify a\nfinancial instrument within level 3,\nthe determination is based on the\nsignificance of the unobservable inputs\nto the overall fair value measurement.\nHowever, level 3 financial instruments\ntypically include, in addition to the\nunobservable or level 3 components,\nobservable components (that is,\ncomponents that are actively quoted and\ncan be validated to external sources);\naccordingly, the gains and losses in\nthe table below include changes in fair\nvalue due in part to observable factors\nthat are part of the valuation\nmethodology. Also, the Firm risk-\nmanages the observable components of\nlevel 3 financial instruments using\nsecurities and derivative positions\nthat are classified within level 1 or 2\nof the fair value

For certain loans, the fair value is\nmeasured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the\nloan takes into account the loan\u2019s allowance for loan losses, which represents the\nloan\u2019s expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference\nbetween the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally\nattributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market\nliquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do\nnot affect its carrying value.\nThe majority of the Firm\u2019s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis on the Consolidated balance sheets.

amortized cost of each security. The\neffective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and\naccretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-\nequivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes\nunscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of\nsecurities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain\nsecurities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the\naverage yield is calculated to the earliest call date.\n(b) Substantially all of the Firm\u2019s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized\nmortgage obligations are due in 10years or more, based on contractual maturity.\nThe estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future\nprepayments, is approximately 6years for agency residential MBS, 4years for agency\nresidential collateralized mortgage obligations and 3years for nonagency\nresidential collateralized mortgage obligations.\n                                       134                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Note 10 \u2013 Securities financing activities                                       \n                                                                                  \nRefer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting\npolicies relating to securities financing activities. Refer to Note 3 for further\ninformation regarding securities borrowed and securities lending agreements for\nwhich the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 23 for further\ninformation regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities\nfinancing agreements. The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the\nFirm\u2019s securities financing agreements as of September 30, 2021 and December 31,\n2020. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a\nmaster netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting\ncriteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance\nsheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with\nthe same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash\ncollateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the\ncounterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance\nsheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with\nrespect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with\nsecurities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria\nunder U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table below as \u201cAmounts not nettable on the\nConsolidated balance sheets,\u201d and reduces the \u201cNet amounts\u201d presented. Where a\nlegal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing\nbalances are presented gross in the \u201cNet amounts\u201d below. In transactions where the\nFirm is acting as the lender in a securities-for-securities lending agreement and\nreceives securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, the Firm recognizes\nthe securities received at fair value within other assets and the obligation to\nreturn those securities within accounts payable and other liabilities on the\nConsolidated balance sheets.\n

The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and\nloans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in short-term\nborrowings on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n                                       136                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Note 11 \u2013 Loans                                                                 \n                                                                                  \nLoan accounting framework\n\nThe accounting for a loan depends on management\u2019s strategy for the loan. The Firm\naccounts for loans based on the following categories:\n\n\u2022 Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., \u201cretained\u201d)\n\n\u2022 Loans held-for-sale\n\n\u2022 Loans at fair value\n\nRefer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of\nloans, including accounting policies.

In addition, the sale of loans may also\nresult in write downs, recoveries or changes in the allowance recognized in the\nprovision for credit losses. Loan modifications The Firm has granted various forms\nof assistance to customers and clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic,\nincluding payment deferrals and covenant modifications. The majority of the Firm\u2019s\nCOVID-19 related loan modifications have not been considered TDRs because: \u2022 they\nrepresent short-term or other insignificant modifications, whether under the\nFirm\u2019s regular loan modification assessments or as permitted by regulatory\nguidance, or \u2022 the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application\nof accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the\nConsolidated Appropriations Act. To the extent that certain modifications do not\nmeet any of the above criteria, the Firm accounts for them as TDRs. As permitted\nby regulatory guidance, the Firm does not place loans with deferrals granted due\nto COVID-19 on nonaccrual status where such loans are not otherwise reportable as\nnonaccrual.

residential real estate loans that are charged\ndown to the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm\nreports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans\nthat have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the\nborrower (\u201cChapter 7 loans\u201d) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless\nof their delinquency status. At September 30, 2021, approximately 7% of Chapter 7\nresidential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.\n\n(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with\nregulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-\ndependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value\nof their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying\ncollateral has subsequently improved, the related allowance may be negative.\n\n(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $ 41million\nand $ 39million and $ 127million and $ 119million for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n(d) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response\nto the COVID-19 pandemic. Includes loans to customers that have exited COVID-19\npayment related deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly\nall of which were considered collateral-dependent at time of exit.\n\n(e) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed\nby U.S government agencies. Typically the principal balance of the loans is\ninsured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to\nmeeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At September 30, 2021 and December 31,\n2020, these balances were no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon\nservicing guidelines. There were noloans that were not guaranteed by U.S.\ngovernment agencies that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest\nat September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\n\n(f) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the\nestimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a\nminimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized\nhome price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent\navailable and forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current\nestimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available\nlien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.\n\n(g) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower\u2019s most recent credit score,\nwhich is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.\n\n(h) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current\npresentation.\n\n(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.\n\n(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the\nmagnitude of the corresponding loan balances at September 30, 2021.\n\n(k) At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, included mortgage loans insured\nby U.S. government agencies of $ 72million and $ 76million, respectively. These\namounts have been excluded from the geographic regions presented based upon the\ngovernment guarantee.\n                                       141                                        \nLoan modifications Modifications of residential real estate loans where the Firm\ngrants concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty are\ngenerally accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term or other\ninsignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs nor\nare loans for which the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the\napplication of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and\nextended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The carrying value of new TDRs\nwas $ 116million and $ 199million for the three months ended September 30, 2021\nand 2020, respectively, and $ 674million and $ 537million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There were no additional\ncommitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans have been\nmodified in TDRs. Nature and extent of modifications The Firm\u2019s proprietary\nmodification programs as well as government programs, including U.S. GSE programs,\ngenerally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including,\nbut not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and\ndelays of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise have been\nrequired under the terms of the original agreement.

default occurred\nwithin one yearof the modification. The dollar amounts presented represent the\nbalance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such loans\ndefaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is\ndeemed to occur when the loan becomes twocontractual payments past due. In the\nevent that a modified loan redefaults, it will generally be liquidated through\nforeclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of\nloans modified within the last twelve monthsmay not be representative of ultimate\nredefault levels.\nAt September 30, 2021, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of\nresidential real estate loans permanently modified in TDRs were four years. The\nestimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both\nvoluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).\n\nActive and suspended foreclosure\n\nAt September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Firm had residential real estate\nloans, excluding those insured by U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value\nof $ 693million and $ 846million, respectively, that were not included in REO, but\nwere in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm has temporarily suspended certain\nforeclosure activities. This could delay recognition of foreclosed properties\nuntil the foreclosure moratoriums are lifted.\n                                       143                                        \nAuto and other\n\nThe following tables provide information on delinquency, which is the primary\ncredit quality indicator for retained auto and other consumer loans.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                              \u2026                   \n                                                              \u2026                   \n                                                       \u2026      \u2026                   \n                                                       \u2026      \u2026                   \n                                                       \u2026      \u2026                   \n                                                       \u2026      \u2026                   \n                                                                                  \n                                                                   $    \u2026         \n                                                                        8         \n                                                                        8         \n                                                                   $    \u2026         \n                                                              \u2026         %    \u2026    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                              \u2026                   \n                                                              \u2026                   \n                                                       \u2026      \u2026                   \n                                                       \u2026      \u2026                   \n                                                       \u2026      \u2026                   \n                                                       \u2026      \u2026                   \n                                                                                  \n                                                                   $    \u2026         \n                                                                        \u2026         \n                                                                        8         \n                                                                   $    \u2026         \n                                                              \u2026         %    \u2026    \n                                                                                  \n(a) At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, loans under payment deferral\nprograms offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which are still within their\ndeferral period and performing according to their modified terms are generally not\nconsidered delinquent.\n\n(b) At September 30, 2021, auto and other loans excluded $ 126million of PPP loans\nguaranteed by the SBA that are 30 or more days past due.

who are experiencing\nfinancial difficulty. The Firm grants\nconcessions for most of the credit card\nloans under long-term programs. These\nmodifications involve placing the\ncustomer on a fixed payment plan,\ngenerally for 60months, and typically\ninclude reducing the interest rate on\nthe credit card. Substantially all\nmodifications under the Firm\u2019s long-\nterm programs are considered to be\nTDRs. Loans with short-term or other\ninsignificant modifications that are\nnot considered concessions are not\nTDRs. If the cardholder does not comply\nwith the modified payment terms, then\nthe credit card loan continues to age\nand will ultimately be charged-off in\naccordance with the Firm\u2019s standard\ncharge-off policy. In most cases, the\nFirm does not reinstate the borrower\u2019s\nline of credit.\n\nFinancial effects of modifications and\nredefaults\n\nThe following table provides\ninformation about the financial effects\nof the concessions granted on credit\ncard loans modified in TDRs and\nredefaults for the periods presented.\nFor all periods disclosed, new\nenrollments were less than 1% of total\nretained credit card loans.\n                                                                                  \n  (in                Three                             Nine                       \n  milli\u2026            months                           months                       \n  except             ended                            ended                       \n  weigh\u2026           Septem\u2026                           Septe\u2026                       \n  data)   2021         30,  2020            2021        30,  2020                 \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Balan\u2026                                                                          \n  of new        $             82  $          220  $           315  $         648  \n  TDRs(\u2026                                                                          \n  Weigh\u2026                                                                          \n  inter\u2026                                                                          \n  rate                                                                            \n  of                 17.75     %     17.65     %      17.79     %     18.21    %  \n  loans                                                                           \n  \u2013                                                                               \n  before                                                                          \n  TDR                                                                             \n  Weigh\u2026                                                                          \n  inter\u2026                                                                          \n  rate                                                                            \n  of                  5.15            4.80             5.19            4.55       \n  loans                                                                           \n  \u2013                                                                               \n  after                                                                           \n  TDR                                                                             \n  Balan\u2026                                                                          \n  of                                                                              \n  loans                                                                           \n  that                                                                            \n  redef\u2026        $             13  $           22  $            45  $          83  \n  within                                                                          \n  one                                                                             \n  year                                                                            \n  of                                                                              \n  modif\u2026                                                                          \n                                                                                  \n(a) Represents the outstanding balance\nprior to modification.\n\n(b) Represents loans modified in TDRs\nthat experienced a payment default in\nthe periods presented, and for which\nthe payment default occurred within one\nyearof the modification.

to be\nrisk-rated in accordance with the Firm\u2019s overall credit risk management framework.\nAs of September 30, 2021, substantially all of these loans were considered\nperforming.\n(b) When the discounted cash flows or collateral value equals or exceeds the\namortized cost of the loan, the loan does not require an allowance. This typically\noccurs when the loans have been partially charged off and/or there have been\ninterest payments received and applied to the loan balance.\n(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not\nmaterial for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020.\n                                       150                                        \nLoan modifications\n\nCertain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various\nconcessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with\nshort-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered\nconcessions are not TDRs nor are loans for which the Firm has elected to apply the\noption to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by\nthe CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act.\n\nThe carrying value of TDRs was $ 928million and $ 954million as of September 30,\n2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. The carrying value of new TDRs was $\n180million and $ 188million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and\n2020, respectively, and $ 832million and $ 352million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. New TDRs for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2021 reflected deferral of principal and interest payments,\nextending maturity dates and the receipt of assets in partial satisfaction of the\nloan predominantly in Other and Commercial and Industrial loan classes. The impact\nof these modifications resulting in new TDRs was not material to the Firm for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020.\n                                       151                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Note 12 \u2013 Allowance for credit losses                                           \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses\nrepresents management's estimate of\nexpected credit losses over the\nremaining expected life of the Firm's\nfinancial assets measured at amortized\ncost and certain off-balance sheet\nlending-related commitments.

$\n73million and $ 120million as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n(b) Includes collateral dependent loans, including those considered TDRs and those\nfor which foreclosure is deemed probable, modified PCD loans and non-collateral\ndependent loans that have been modified or are reasonably expected to be modified\nin a TDR. Also includes risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual\nstatus for the wholesale portfolio segment. The asset-specific credit card\nallowance for loans modified, or reasonably expected to be modified, in a TDR is\ncalculated based on the loans\u2019 original contractual interest rates and does not\nconsider any incremental penalty rates.\n(c) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable\nand other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n(d) At September 30, 2021 and 2020, lending-related commitments excluded $\n19.9billion and $ 10.8billion, respectively, for the consumer, excluding credit\ncard portfolio segment; $ 710.6billion and $ 662.9billion, respectively, for the\ncredit card portfolio segment; and $ 41.0billion and $ 24.4billion, respectively,\nfor the wholesale portfolio segment, which were not subject to the allowance for\nlending-related commitments. Prior-period amount for wholesale lending-related\ncommitments, including the amount not subject to allowance, has been revised to\nconform with the current presentation.\n                                       153                                        \nDiscussion of changes in the allowance The allowance for credit losses as of\nSeptember 30, 2021 was $ 20.5billion, a decrease from $ 30.8billion at December\n31, 2020. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses reflected: \u2022 an $\n8.0billion reduction in consumer, predominantly in the credit card portfolio,\nreflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook; and \u2022 a $ 2.3billion\nnet reduction in wholesale, across the LOBs, reflecting improvements in the Firm's\nmacroeconomic outlook. The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs used in the\nFirm's allowance estimate which has created challenges in the use of modeled\ncredit loss estimates, increased the reliance on management judgment, and resulted\nin adjustments to appropriately address the economic circumstances. These\nadjustments continued through the third quarter of 2021, although to a lesser\nextent than experienced during 2020. The U.S. economy has continued to improve\ndespite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the benefits of\nvaccination resulting in improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook,\nparticularly in the adverse scenarios. However, uncertainties remain, including\nthe impact that additional waves and variants of COVID-19 may have on the pace of\neconomic growth, the strength of underlying labor markets with the expiration of\ngovernment assistance programs, and the potential for changes in consumer behavior\nthat could have longer term impacts on certain sectors. As a result of these\nuncertainties, the Firm retained meaningful weighting on its adverse scenarios in\nthe third quarter of 2021, in line with the second quarter of 2021, but to a\nlesser extent than the fourth quarter of 2020.

The assets and liabilities\ninclude third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and exclude\nintercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.\n(e) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated\nVIEs are classified in the line item on the Consolidated balance sheets titled,\n\u201cBeneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs\u201d. The holders of these\nbeneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of\nJPMorgan Chase. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term\nbeneficial interests of $ 2.7billion and $ 5.2billion at September 30, 2021, and\nDecember 31, 2020, respectively.\n(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets.\nVIEs sponsored by third parties\n\nThe Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These\ninclude, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider,\ninvestor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian.\nThese transactions are conducted at arm\u2019s-length, and individual credit decisions\nare based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the\nquality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct\nthe activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic\nperformance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the\nFirm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these\npositions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record\nand report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. Tax credit\nvehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which\nare limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable\nhousing, energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs.\nA third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control\nover the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the\nFirm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these\npartnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt\nof tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented\nby equity investments and funding commitments, was $ 24.7billion and $\n23.6billion, of which $ 8.6billion and $ 8.7billion was unfunded at September 30,\n2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The prior-period maximum loss exposure\namount has been revised to conform with the current presentation. The Firm\nassesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts\nof its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to\nNote 25 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for further information on affordable\nhousing tax credits and Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for more information on off-\nbalance sheet lending-related commitments.\n                                       158                                        \nCustomer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm may provide various\nservices to customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender\noption provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity\nprovider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In\nthose transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to\nthe third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any\nintent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying\nmunicipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm\ndoes not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the municipal bond vehicle.

The Firm has concluded\nthat goodwill was not impaired as of\nSeptember 30, 2021, or December 31,\n2020, nor was goodwill written off due\nto impairment during the nine months\nended September 30, 2021 or 2020.\n                                       161                                        \nMortgage servicing rights\n\nMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing\nservicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future\nservicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the\nloans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received,\neffectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary\nfee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale\nor securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and\n15 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for a further description of the MSR asset,\ninterest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs.\nThe following table summarizes MSR activity for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2021 and 2020.\n                                                                                  \n                As of

In each transaction, a portion of\nthe SMBS was acquired by third parties at the transaction date; the Firm acquired\nthe remaining balance of those SMBS as trading securities.\n(b) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to\nchanges in market interest rates, and the difference between actual and expected\nprepayments.\n(c) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in\nmarket interest rates.\n(d) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal\nand interest, taxes and insurance), which will generally be reimbursed within a\nshort period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the trust or\nthe underlying loans. The Firm\u2019s credit risk associated with these servicer\nadvances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to\nall cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop\npayment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance.\nHowever, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were\nnot made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.\n                                       162                                        \nThe following table presents the components

The\ncontractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible\ncredit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or\nthe Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the\ncustomer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the\ncontract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been\nrefinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default\noccurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not,\nin the Firm\u2019s view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or\nfunding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for a\nfurther discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm\u2019s\nrelated accounting policies. To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale\nand certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses\non lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further\ninformation regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related\ncommitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying\nvalues of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and\nother commitments at September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020. The amounts in the\ntable below for credit card, home equity and certain scored business banking\nlending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these\nproducts. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all\navailable lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time.\nThe Firm can reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business banking\nlines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by\nlaw, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when\nthe borrower is 60days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when\nthere are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when\nthere has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.\n                                       172                                        \n                                                                                  \n         \u2026

If Merchant\nServices is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, Merchant Services will\nbear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. Merchant\nServices mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash\nreserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, Merchant Services\nrecognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk to\nthe Firm related to charge-backs.\n                                       174                                        \nLoan sales- and securitization-related\nindemnifications In connection with the\nFirm\u2019s mortgage loan sale and\nsecuritization activities with GSEs the\nFirm has made representations and\nwarranties that the loans sold meet\ncertain requirements, and that may\nrequire the Firm to repurchase mortgage\nloans and/or indemnify the loan\npurchaser if such representations and\nwarranties are breached by the Firm.\nThe liability related to repurchase\ndemands associated with private label\nsecuritizations is separately evaluated\nby the Firm in establishing its\nlitigation reserves. Refer to Note 24\nof this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for\nadditional information regarding\nlitigation. Sponsored member repo\nprogram The Firm acts as a sponsoring\nmember to clear eligible overnight\nresale and repurchase agreements\nthrough the Government Securities\nDivision of the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation (\u201cFICC\u201d) on behalf of\nclients that become sponsored members\nunder the FICC\u2019s rules. The Firm also\nguarantees to the FICC the prompt and\nfull payment and performance of its\nsponsored member clients\u2019 respective\nobligations under the FICC\u2019s rules. The\nFirm minimizes its liability under\nthese overnight guarantees by obtaining\na security interest in the cash or\nhigh-quality securities collateral that\nthe clients place with the clearing\nhouse therefore the Firm expects the\nrisk of loss to be remote. The Firm\u2019s\nmaximum possible exposure, without\ntaking into consideration the\nassociated collateral, is included in\nthe Exchange & clearing house\nguarantees and commitments line on page\n173. Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for additional\ninformation on credit risk mitigation\npractices on resale agreements and the\ntypes of collateral pledged under\nrepurchase agreements.

The\nlitigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class\naction lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations and\nregulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by\nboth governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal\nproceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation,\nand involve each of the Firm\u2019s lines of business and several geographies and a\nwide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and\nstatutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which\npresent novel legal theories. The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate\nrange of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its\nlegal proceedings is from $ 0to approximately $ 1.5billion at September 30, 2021.\nThis estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon\ninformation available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm\nbelieves that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain\nmatters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that\ndate. The Firm\u2019s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses\ninvolves significant judgment, given: \u2022 the number, variety and varying stages of\nthe proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages, \u2022 the\nexistence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm,\nwhose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, \u2022 the numerous yet-\nunresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class\ncertification and the scope of many of the claims, and \u2022 the attendant uncertainty\nof the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm\nhas made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator,\nor about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities,\nand those assumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition, the outcome of a\nparticular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in\nits estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be\nremote. Accordingly, the Firm\u2019s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably\npossible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary\nsignificantly. Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm\u2019s material legal\nproceedings. Amrapali . India\u2019s Enforcement Directorate (\u201cED\u201d) is investigating\nJ.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and\n2012 by twooffshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into\nresidential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (\u201cAmrapali\u201d). In\n2017, numerous creditors filed civil claims against Amrapali including petitions\nbrought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver\nresidential units. The home buyers\u2019 petitions have been overseen by the Supreme\nCourt of India and is ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P.\nMorgan India Private Limited approximately $ 31.5million. The Firm is appealing\nthe order and the fine. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued\nan order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including\nunspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in\nthe projects, violated certain currency control and money laundering provisions,\nand ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry under India\u2019s Prevention of Money\nLaundering Act (\u201cPMLA\u201d) and Foreign Exchange Management Act (\u201cFEMA\u201d). In May 2020,\nthe ED attached approximately $ 25million from J.P. Morgan India Private Limited\nin connection with the criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and\ncooperating with the PMLA investigation. Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation.\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the\nFederal Government of Nigeria (\u201cFGN\u201d) and two major international oil companies.\nThe account held approximately $ 1.1billion in connection with a dispute among the\nclients over rights to an oil field. Following the settlement of the dispute,\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in\naccordance with directions received from its clients. In November 2017, the\nFederal Republic of Nigeria (\u201cFRN\u201d) commenced a claim in the English High Court\nfor approximately $ 875million in payments made out of the accounts. The FRN,\nclaiming to be the same entity as the FGN, alleges that the payments were\ninstructed as part of a complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but\nthat JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or should have been on notice that the payments\nmay be fraudulent. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. applied for summary judgment and was\nunsuccessful. The claim is ongoing and a trial has been scheduled to commence in\nFebruary 2022. Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously\nreported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign\nexchange (\u201cFX\u201d) sales and trading activities and controls related to those\nactivities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a\nsingle violation of federal antitrust law. In January 2017, the Firm was\nsentenced, with judgment\n                                       176                                        \nentered thereafter and a term of probation which ended in January 2020, with the\nFirm remaining in good standing throughout the probation period. The Department of\nLabor granted the Firm a five-yearexemption of disqualification that allows the\nFirm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset\nManager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d)\nuntil January 2023. The Firm will need the Department of Labor to approve a\nfurther exemption to cover the remainder of the ten-yeardisqualification period. A\nSouth Africa Competition Commission matter is the remaining FX-related\ngovernmental inquiry, and is currently pending before the South Africa Competition\nTribunal. In August 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York granted final approval to the Firm\u2019s settlement of a\nconsolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally\nalleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to\nmanipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of persons who\ntransacted in FX futures and options on futures. Certain members of the settlement\nclass filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, and certain of\nthem filed a complaint against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers in\nNovember 2018. A number of these actions remain pending. Further, a putative class\naction has been filed against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on\nbehalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated\nrates. Another putative class action was brought against the Firm and other\nforeign exchange dealers on behalf of purported indirect purchasers of FX\ninstruments. In 2020, the Court approved a settlement by the Firm and 11other\ndefendants of that class action for a total of $ 10million. In addition, some FX-\nrelated individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying\nconduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, Brazil\nand Australia. Inquiries Concerning Preservation Requirements . The Firm has been\nresponding to requests for information and other material from certain of its\nregulators concerning its compliance with records preservation requirements in\nconnection with business communications sent over electronic messaging channels\nthat have not been approved by the Firm. The Firm is cooperating with these\ninquiries and is currently engaged in certain advanced resolution discussions.\nThere is no assurance that the discussions will result in a resolution.\nInterchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series\nof class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain\nbanks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and\nenacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties\ninitially settled the cases for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit\ncard interchange, and modifications to certain credit card network rules. In 2017,\nafter the approval of that settlement was reversed on appeal, the case was\nremanded to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York\nfor further proceedings consistent with the appellate decision. The original class\naction was divided into twoseparate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief\nand the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties\nto the class action seeking monetary relief finalized an agreement which amends\nand supersedes the prior settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the\ndefendants collectively contributed an additional $ 900million to the\napproximately $ 5.3billion previously held in escrow from the original settlement.\nIn December 2019, the amended agreement was approved by the District Court.\nCertain merchants appealed the District Court\u2019s approval order, and those appeals\nare pending. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended\nclass settlement, $ 700million has been returned to the defendants from the\nsettlement escrow in accordance with the settlement agreement. The class action\nseeking primarily injunctive relief continues separately, and in September 2021,\nthe District Court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification in part, and\ndenied the motion in part. In addition, certain merchants have filed individual\nactions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as\nagainst the Firm and other banks, and some of those actions remain pending. LIBOR\nand Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has\nresponded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around the\nworld relating primarily to the British Bankers Association\u2019s (\"BBA\") London\nInterbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) for various currencies and the European Banking\nFederation\u2019s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cEURIBOR\u201d). The Swiss Competition\nCommission\u2019s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and other banks\nare subject, continues. In December 2016, the European Commission issued a\ndecision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European\nantitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision\nwith the European General Court, and that appeal is pending. In addition, the Firm\nhas been named as a defendant along with other banks in various individual and\nputative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In\nactions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by\nthe BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain\nother actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York has granted class\ncertification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold\ndirectly by the defendants, including the Firm. In a consolidated putative class\naction related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was administered by ICE\nBenchmark Administration, the District Court granted the motion by defendants,\nincluding the Firm, to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, and the plaintiffs have\n                                       177                                        \nappealed. In addition, in August 2020, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a\nlawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants\nwere engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to\nmonopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards. In November\n2020 and May 2021, plaintiffs filed motions for a preliminary injunction each\nseeking to enjoin defendants from setting U.S. dollar LIBOR and to prohibit\ndefendants from enforcing any financial instruments that rely on U.S. dollar\nLIBOR. The court held a hearing to address these motions in September 2021. The\nFirm\u2019s settlements of putative class actions related to Swiss franc LIBOR, the\nSingapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the\nAustralian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate remain subject to court approval. Metals\nand U.S. Treasuries Investigations and Litigation and Related Inquiries. The Firm\npreviously reported that it and/or certain of its subsidiaries had entered into\nresolutions with the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d), the U.S. Commodity\nFutures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (\u201cSEC\u201d), which, collectively, resolved those agencies\u2019 respective\ninvestigations relating to historical trading practices by former employees in the\nprecious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct from 2008 to 2016.\nThe Firm entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (\u201cDPA\u201d) with the DOJ in\nwhich it agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging JPMorgan Chase &\nCo. with twocounts of wire fraud and agreed, along with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nand J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to certain terms and obligations as set forth\ntherein. Under the terms of the DPA, the criminal information will be dismissed\nafter three years, provided that JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nand J.P.

Several putative class action complaints\nhave been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of\nNew York against the Firm and certain former employees, alleging a precious metals\nfutures and options price manipulation scheme in violation of the Commodity\nExchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust enrichment and deceptive\nacts or practices under the General Business Law of the State of New York. The\nCourt consolidated these putative class actions in February 2019, and the\nconsolidated action is stayed through December 2021. In July 2021, the parties\ninformed the Court that they have entered into a settlement to resolve the action.\nIn Canada, plaintiffs have moved to commence putative class action proceedings\nbased on similar alleged underlying conduct for precious metals. In addition,\nseveral putative class actions were filed in the United States District Courts for\nthe Northern District of Illinois and Southern District of New York against the\nFirm, alleging manipulation of U.S. Treasury futures and options, and bringing\nclaims under the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust\nenrichment. The actions in the Northern District of Illinois have been transferred\nto the Southern District of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class\nactions in October 2020 and plaintiffs filed their consolidated amended complaint\nin April 2021.

The Court consolidated these\nputative class actions in January 2021. Plaintiffs filed their second amended\ncomplaint in May 2021, which additionally alleged that certain orders in precious\nmetals futures contracts placed by precious metals futures traders during the\nputative class period were materially false and misleading.

Since 2012, the French criminal\nauthorities have been investigating a series of transactions entered into by\nsenior managers of Wendel Investissement (\u201cWendel\u201d) during the period from 2004\nthrough 2007 to restructure their shareholdings in Wendel. JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A., Paris branch provided financing for the transactions to a number of managers\nof Wendel in 2007. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. cooperated with the investigation.\nThe investigating judges issued an ordonnance de renvoi in November 2016,\nreferring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel for\nalleged complicity in tax fraud. In January 2018, the Paris Court of Appeal issued\na decision cancelling the mise en examen of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Court of\nCassation, France\u2019s highest court, ruled in September 2018 that a mise en examen\nis a prerequisite for an ordonnance de renvoi and in January\n                                       178                                        \n2020 ordered the annulment of the ordonnance de renvoi referring JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel . The Court of Appeal found in\nJanuary 2021 that it had no power to take further action against JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. following the Court of Cassation\u2019s ruling. At the opening of a trial of\nthe managers of Wendel in January 2021, the tribunal correctionnel directed the\ncriminal authorities to clarify whether a further investigation should be opened\nagainst JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., pending which the trial was postponed. In April\n2021, the Court of Cassation declined to hear JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s appeal\nof the January 2021 decision of the tribunal correctionnel at this stage of the\nproceedings. In August 2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. entered into a Convention\nJudicaire d\u2019Int\u00e9r\u00eat Public with the French criminal authorities, under which it\nagreed to pay a fine of \u20ac 25million to resolve the potential legal proceedings.\nThe resolution, which did not contain any admissions, was approved by the\nPresiding Judge of the tribunal judiciaire , and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid\nthe fine in September 2021. In addition, a number of the managers have commenced\ncivil proceedings against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The claims are separate,\ninvolve different allegations and are at various stages of proceedings. * * * In\naddition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its\nsubsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial\nnumber of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses\nto the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings\nand it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be\ninitiated from time to time in the future. The Firm has established reserves for\nseveral hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with\nthe provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-\nrelated liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and\nthe amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its\noutstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and\nmakes adjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on\nmanagement\u2019s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm\u2019s legal\nexpense was $ 76million and $ 524million for the three months ended September 30,\n2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 289million and $ 839million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2021 and 2020. There is no assurance that the Firm\u2019s\nlitigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future. In view of the\ninherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly\nwhere the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters\npresent novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early\nstages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the\neventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate\nresolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to\nthose matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after\nconsultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings\ndescribed above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and\nits estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings\ncurrently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the\nFirm\u2019s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of\nthe uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the\nultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it\nhas currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational\nconsequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among\nother factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s income for that period.\n                                       179                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Note 25 \u2013 Business segments                                                     \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are fourmajor reportable business\nsegments - Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial\nBanking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment.\nThe business segments are determined based on the products and services provided,\nor the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial\ninformation is currently evaluated by the Firm\u2019s Operating Committee. Segment\nresults are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results below, and Note\n32 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbusiness segments. Segment results The following table provides a summary of the\nFirm\u2019s segment results as of or for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2021 and 2020, on a managed basis. The Firm\u2019s definition of managed basis starts\nwith the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to\npresent total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business\nsegments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax\ncredits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis\ncomparable to taxable investments and securities.

The current estimated LTV ratios\nare calculated using estimated\ncollateral values derived from a\nnationally recognized home price index\nmeasured at the metropolitan\nstatistical area (\u201cMSA\u201d) level. These\nMSA-level home price indices consist of\nactual data to the extent available and\nforecasted data where actual data is\nnot available. As a result, the\nestimated collateral values used to\ncalculate these ratios do not represent\nactual appraised loan-level collateral\nvalues; as such, the resulting LTV\nratios are necessarily imprecise and\nshould therefore be viewed as\nestimates.\n                                                                                  \n  Combined LTV ratio                                                              \n                                                                                  \nThe LTV ratio considering all available\nlien positions, as well as unused\nlines, related to the property.\nCombined LTV ratios are used for junior\nlien home equity products.\n\nManaged basis: A non-GAAP presentation\nof Firmwide financial results that\nincludes reclassifications to present\nrevenue on a fully taxable-equivalent\nbasis.

A\nsubstantial proportion of the Firm\u2019s\nAlt-A loans are those where a borrower\ndoes not provide complete documentation\nof his or her assets or the amount or\nsource of his or her income.\n\nOption ARMs\n\nThe option ARM real estate loan product\nis an adjustable-rate mortgage loan\nthat provides the borrower with the\noption each month to make a fully\namortizing, interest-only or minimum\npayment. The minimum payment on an\noption ARM loan is based on the\ninterest rate charged during the\nintroductory period. This introductory\nrate is usually significantly below the\nfully indexed rate. The fully indexed\nrate is calculated using an index rate\nplus a margin. Once the introductory\nperiod ends, the contractual interest\nrate charged on the loan increases to\nthe fully indexed rate and adjusts\nmonthly to reflect movements in the\nindex. The minimum payment is typically\ninsufficient to cover interest accrued\nin the prior month, and any unpaid\ninterest is deferred and added to the\nprincipal balance of the loan. Option\nARM loans are subject to payment\nrecast, which converts the loan to a\nvariable-rate fully amortizing loan\nupon meeting specified loan balance and\nanniversary date triggers.\n                                       187                                        \nPrime\n\nPrime mortgage loans are made to\nborrowers with good credit records who\nmeet specific underwriting\nrequirements, including prescriptive\nrequirements related to income and\noverall debt levels.

Risk           \u2502\n\u2502  Factors.The following discussion supplements the discussion of riskfactors    \u2502\n\u2502  affecting the Firm as set forth in Part I, Item 1A:Risk Factors on pages      \u2502\n\u2502  8-32 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K. The discussion of risk factors, as   \u2502\n\u2502  so supplemented, sets forth the material risk factors that could affect       \u2502\n\u2502  JPMorgan Chase\u2019s financial condition and operations. Readers should not       \u2502\n\u2502  consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all         \u2502\n\u2502  potential risks that could affect the Firm.Ongoing effects of the COVID-19    \u2502\n\u2502  pandemic could harm the global economy and negatively affect JPMorgan         \u2502\n\u2502  Chase\u2019s businesses.On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared  \u2502\n\u2502  the outbreak of a strain of novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, to be a      \u2502\n\u2502  global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and governmental responses to the      \u2502\n\u2502  pandemic, which included the institution of social distancing and             \u2502\n\u2502  shelter-in-place requirements in certain areas of the U.S. and other          \u2502\n\u2502  countries, have resulted in adverse impacts on global economic conditions,    \u2502\n\u2502  including:\u2022significant disruption and volatility in the financial             \u2502\n\u2502  markets\u2022significant disruption of global supply chains, and\u2022closures of many  \u2502\n\u2502  businesses, leading to loss of revenues and increased unemployment.The        \u2502\n\u2502  adverse economic conditions caused by the pandemic have had a negative        \u2502\n\u2502  impact on certain of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses and results of operations,   \u2502\n\u2502  including:\u2022reduction in demand for certain products and services from         \u2502\n\u2502  JPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients and customers, resulting in lower revenue,           \u2502\n\u2502  and\u2022increases in the allowance for credit losses.Certain models used by       \u2502\n\u2502  JPMorgan Chase in connection with the determination of the allowance for      \u2502\n\u2502  credit losses have experienced heightened performance risk in the economic    \u2502\n\u2502  environment precipitated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and          \u2502\n\u2502  government stimulus. There can be no assurance that, even after adjustments   \u2502\n\u2502  have been made to model outputs, JPMorgan Chase will not recognize            \u2502\n\u2502  unexpected losses arising from the model uncertainty that has resulted from   \u2502\n\u2502  these developments.Although global economic conditions have been improving    \u2502\n\u2502  despite the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic, any ongoing negative       \u2502\n\u2502  economic impacts arising from the pandemic or any prolongation or worsening   \u2502\n\u2502  of the pandemic, including as a result of additional waves or                 \u2502\n\u2502                                                                                \u2502\n\u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256f\n                                       194                                        \nvariants of the COVID-19 disease or the\nemergence of other diseases that have\nsimilar outcomes, could have\nsignificant adverse effects on JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s businesses, results of\noperations and financial condition,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 recognition of charge-offs and\nincreases in the allowance for credit\nlosses, including any delayed\nrecognition of charge-offs due to the\nimpact of government stimulus actions\nor payment assistance provided to\nclients and customers\n\n\u2022 material impacts on the value of\nsecurities, derivatives and other\nfinancial instruments which JPMorgan\nChase owns or in which it makes markets\n\n\u2022 downgrades in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit\nratings\n\n\u2022 constraints on liquidity or capital\ndue to elevated levels of deposits,\nincreases in risk-weighted assets\n(\u201cRWA\u201d) related to supporting client\nactivities, downgrades in client credit\nratings, regulatory actions or other\nfactors, any or all of which could\nrequire JPMorgan Chase to take or\nrefrain from taking actions that it\notherwise would under its liquidity and\ncapital management strategies, and\n\n\u2022 the possibility that significant\nportions of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s workforce\nare unable to work effectively,\nincluding because of illness,\nquarantines, shelter-in-place\narrangements, government actions or\nother restrictions in connection with\nthe pandemic.\n\nThe extent to which the COVID-19\npandemic negatively affects JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s businesses, results of\noperations and financial condition, as\nwell as its regulatory capital and\nliquidity ratios, will depend on future\ndevelopments that are uncertain and\ncannot be fully predicted, including:\n\n\u2022 the ultimate scope and duration of\nthe pandemic\n\n\u2022 the availability, effectiveness and\nacceptance of vaccines\n\n\u2022 actions taken by governmental\nauthorities and other third parties in\nresponse to the pandemic, and\n\n\u2022 the effect that the pandemic or any\nprolongation or worsening of the\npandemic may have on the pace of\n\neconomic growth, the strength of labor\nmarkets, particularly in light of the\nexpiration of government assistance\nprograms, and the potential for changes\nin consumer behavior that could have\nlonger-term impacts on certain sectors.\n\nIn addition, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nparticipation directly or indirectly,\nincluding on behalf of customers and\nclients or by affiliated entities, in\nU.S. government programs designed to\nsupport individuals, households and\nbusinesses impacted by the economic\ndisruptions caused by the COVID-19\npandemic could be criticized and\nsubject JPMorgan Chase to:\n\n\u2022 increased governmental and regulatory\nscrutiny\n\n\u2022 negative publicity, and\n\n\u2022 increased exposure to litigation,\n\nany or all of which could increase\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational, legal and\ncompliance costs and damage its\nreputation. To the extent that the\nCOVID-19 pandemic adversely affects\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business, results of\noperations and financial condition, it\nmay also have the effect of heightening\nmany of the other risks described in\nRisk Factors in the 2020 Form 10-K.\n                                                                                  \n  Supervision and regulation                                                      \n                                                                                  \nRefer to the Supervision and regulation\nsection on pages 3\u20137 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for information\non Supervision and Regulation.\n\nItem 2.
