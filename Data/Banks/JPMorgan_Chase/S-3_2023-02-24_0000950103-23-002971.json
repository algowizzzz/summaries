The specific terms of any\ndebt securities\nwill be described in one or more prospectus supplements relating to those debt securities.\n\nThe debt securities will be issued under an Indenture\ndated May 25, 2001, between us and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (formerly Bankers Trust Company), as\ntrustee (as has been and\nas may be further supplemented from time to time, for purposes of this section entitled \u201cDescription of Debt\nSecurities of JPMorgan\nChase & Co.,\u201d the \u201cIndenture\u201d).\n\nWe have summarized below the material provisions\nof the Indenture and the debt securities issued under the Indenture or indicated which material provisions\nwill be described in the related\nprospectus supplement. These descriptions are only summaries, and each investor should refer to the\nIndenture, which describes\ncompletely the terms and definitions summarized below and contains additional information regarding the debt\nsecurities issued under it. Where\nappropriate, we use parentheses to refer you to the particular sections of the Indenture. Any reference to\nparticular sections\nor defined terms of the Indenture in any statement under this heading qualifies the entire statement and\nincorporates by reference the\napplicable section or definition into that statement.\n\nThe debt securities will be our direct, unsecured\ngeneral obligations and will have the same rank in liquidation as all of our other unsecured and\nunsubordinated debt.\n\nThe Indenture does not limit the aggregate principal\namount of debt securities that may be issued under it. The Indenture provides that debt securities may be\nissued up to the\nprincipal amount authorized by us from time to time. (Section 2.03) We have previously established the\nSeries E medium-term\nnotes under the Indenture. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $5.0 billion aggregate principal\namount of Series\nE medium-term notes outstanding under the Indenture. Our board of directors has authorized the issuance of\nsecurities under\nthe registration statement to which this prospectus relates, including Series E medium-term notes, with an\naggregate initial public offering\nprice not to exceed $150 billion, to be issued on or after February 17, 2023.\n\nThe Indenture allows us to reopen a previous issue\nof a series of debt securities and issue additional debt securities of that issue. We have no obligation to\ntake your interests\ninto account when deciding whether to issue additional debt securities. In addition, we are under no\nobligation to reopen any\nseries of debt securities or to issue any additional debt securities.\n\nWe are a holding company that holds the stock of\nthe Bank and IHC. We conduct substantially all of our operations through subsidiaries, including the Bank\nand the IHC. As\na result, claims of the holders of the debt securities will generally have a junior position to claims of\ncreditors of our subsidiaries. Claims\nof our subsidiaries\u2019 creditors other than JPMorgan Chase & Co. include substantial amounts of deposit\nliabilities, long-term\ndebt and other liabilities. In addition, we are obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net\nproceeds that\nwe receive from the issuance of securities (including any securities offered by use of this prospectus), and\nthe ability of the Bank and\nthe IHC to make payments to us is limited. As a result of these arrangements, our ability to make various\npayments is dependent\non our receiving dividends from the Bank and dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. These\nlimitations could affect\nour ability to pay interest on our debt securities, redeem or repurchase outstanding securities and fulfill\nour other payment obligations.\n\nWe may issue debt securities from time to time\nin one or more series. (Section 2.03) The debt securities may be denominated and payable in U.S. dollars or\nforeign currencies.\n(Section 2.03) We may also issue debt securities, from time to time, with the principal amount, interest or\nother amounts payable\non any relevant payment date to be determined by reference to one or more currency exchange rates, interest\nrates, swap rates, securities\nor baskets of securities, commodity prices, indices, basket of indices,\n                                                     5                                                      \nor any other financial, economic or other measure\nor instrument, including the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event or circumstance. The debt securities\nmay also be issued\nas original issue discount debt securities, which will bear no interest or bear interest at below market\nrates and will be sold at a discount\nto their stated principal amount. In addition, we may issue debt securities as part of units issued by us,\nas described in\n\u201c\u2014 Description of Units\u201d below. All references in this prospectus, or any prospectus supplement to other\namounts will include premium, if any, other cash amounts payable under the Indenture, if any, and the\ndelivery of securities or baskets\nof securities under the terms of the debt securities.\n\nThe debt securities may bear interest at a fixed\nrate, which may be zero, or a floating rate.\n\nThe prospectus supplement relating to a particular\nseries of debt securities being offered will specify the particular terms of, and other information relating\nto, those debt securities.\n\nHolders may present debt securities for exchange\nor transfer, in the manner, at the places and subject to the restrictions stated in the debt securities and\ndescribed in the applicable\nprospectus supplement.

In\naddition, holders of the\ndebt securities will not have the benefit of the additional events of default described above that are\napplicable to the Pre-2017 Senior\nDebt Securities.\n\nIf a default in the payment of principal, interest\nor other amounts payable on the debt securities, or any other Event of Default provided in the applicable\nsupplemental indentures to the\nIndenture or form of security, with respect to one or more (but in the case of a default in a manner\nprovided in a supplemental indenture\nor form of security, less than all) series of debt securities occurs and is continuing, either the trustee\nor the holders of not less\nthan 25% in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of such series then outstanding, treated as\none class, by written notice,\nmay declare the principal of all outstanding debt securities of such series and any interest accrued\nthereon, to be due and payable immediately. For\nthis purpose, the debt securities will be deemed not to be in the same series as debt securities issued\nunder the Indenture prior to January\n13, 2017. If a default in a manner provided in a supplemental indenture or form of security with respect to\nall series of debt\nsecurities, or due to specified events of our bankruptcy, insolvency, winding up or liquidation, occurs and\nis continuing, either the\ntrustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of all debt securities then\noutstanding, treated as one class,\nby written notice, may declare the principal of all outstanding debt securities and any interest accrued\nthereon, to be due and payable\nimmediately. Subject to certain conditions such declarations may be annulled and past defaults may be waived\nby the holders\nof a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of the series affected.\n(Sections 5.01 and 5.10)\n\nAn Event of Default with respect to one series\nof debt securities does not necessarily constitute an Event of Default with respect to any other series of\ndebt securities. The\nIndenture requires the trustee to provide notice of default with respect to the debt securities within 90\ndays, unless the default is\ncured, but provides that the trustee may withhold notice to the holders of the debt securities of any\ndefault if the board of directors,\nthe executive committee, or a trust committee of directors or trustees and/or responsible officers of the\ntrustee determines in good faith\nthat it is in the interest of the holders of the debt securities of the applicable series to do so. The\ntrustee may not withhold\nnotice of a default in the payment of principal of, interest on or any other amounts due under, such debt\nsecurities. (Section 5.11)\n\nThe Indenture provides that the holders of a majority\nin aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities of each series affected, with all such series\nvoting as a single class, may\ndirect the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee, or\nexercising any trust or power\nconferred on the trustee. The trustee may decline to act if the direction is contrary to law and in certain\nother circumstances\nset forth in the Indenture. (Section 5.09) The trustee is not obligated to exercise any of its rights or\npowers under the Indenture\nat the request or direction of the holders of debt securities unless the holders offer the trustee security\nor indemnity satisfactory\nto it against the costs, expenses and liabilities incurred therein or thereby. (Section 6.02(d))\n\nNo holder of any debt security of any affected\nseries has the right to institute any action for remedy unless such holder has previously given to the\ntrustee written notice of default,\nthe trustee has failed to take action for 60 days after the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate\nprincipal amount of the debt securities\nof each affected series make written request upon the trustee to institute such action and have offered\nreasonable indemnity in connection\nwith the same and the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of each\naffected series (voting as a\nsingle class) have not given direction to the trustee that is inconsistent with the written request referred\nto above. (Section 5.06)\n\nHowever, the right of any holder of a debt security\nor coupon to receive payment of the principal of and interest on that debt security or coupon on or after\nits due date, or to institute\nsuit for the enforcement of any such payment, may not be impaired or affected without the consent of that\nholder. (Section 5.07)\n\nThe Indenture requires us to file annually with\nthe trustee a written statement as to whether or not we have knowledge of a default. (Section 3.05)\n                                                     7                                                      \nCovenant Breach\n\nUnder the Indenture, a \u201cCovenant Breach\u201d\nwould occur with respect to a series of debt securities if we fail to perform or breach any of the covenants\ncontained in the Indenture\n(other than a failure to pay principal or interest on the debt securities) and that failure or breach\ncontinues for 90 days after the\ntrustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities give\nwritten notice of that failure\nor breach. Neither the trustee nor the holders of the debt securities will be entitled to accelerate the\nmaturity of the debt\nsecurities as a result of any Covenant Breach.\n\nIf a Covenant Breach or Event of Default with respect\nto the debt securities occurs and is continuing, the trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and\nenforce its rights and the rights\nof the holders of the debt securities by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the trustee deems most\neffectual to protect and enforce\nany such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in the Indenture or in\naid of the exercise of any power\ngranted in the Indenture, or to enforce any other proper remedy.\n\nDischarge, Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance\n\nDischarge of Indenture. The Indenture\nwill cease to be of further effect with respect to debt securities of any series, except as to rights of\nregistration of transfer and\nexchange, substitution of mutilated, defaced, lost or stolen debt securities, rights of holders to receive\nprincipal, interest or other\namounts payable under the debt securities on the due date thereof (but not upon acceleration), rights and\nimmunities of the trustee and\nrights of holders with respect to property deposited pursuant to the following provisions, and our\nobligation to maintain an office for\npayments, if at any time:\n                                                                                   \n  \u00b7  we have paid the principal, interest and any other amounts payable under the  \n     debt securities of such series as and when due;                               \n                                                                                   \n                                                                                       \n  \u00b7  we have delivered to the trustee or the applicable paying agent for cancellation  \n     all debt securities of such series; or                                            \n                                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \n     the debt securities of such series not delivered to the trustee or the applicable                      \n     paying agent for cancellation have become due and payable, or will become due and payable within one   \n     year, or are to be called for redemption                                                               \n     within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the trustee or the applicable paying agent for the  \n     giving of notice of redemption,                                                                        \n     and we have irrevocably deposited with the trustee or the applicable paying agent as trust funds the   \n  \u00b7  entire amount in cash or, in the                                                                       \n     case of securities payable in dollars, U.S. government obligations sufficient to pay all amounts due   \n     with respect to such debt securities                                                                   \n     on or after the date of such deposit, including at maturity or upon redemption of all such debt        \n     securities, including principal, interest                                                              \n     and other amounts, and any mandatory sinking fund payments, on the dates on which such payments are    \n     due and payable.

The merger covenant described above\nwould apply only\nif the recapitalization transaction, change of control or highly leveraged transaction were structured to\ninclude a merger or consolidation\nof JPMorgan Chase & Co. or a sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of our assets. However, we may\nprovide specific\nprotections, such as a put right or increased interest, for particular debt securities, which we would\ndescribe in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement.\n\nConcerning the Trustee, Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent\n\nOur subsidiaries and we have a wide range of banking\nrelationships with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, The Bank of New York Mellon and The Bank of New\nYork Mellon, London Branch. The\nBank of New York Mellon and, for debt securities settled through Euroclear Bank SA/NV or Clearstream\nBanking, S.A., Luxembourg, The Bank\nof New York Mellon, London Branch, will be the paying agents, registrars, authenticating agents and transfer\nagents for debt securities\nissued under the Indenture.\n\nDeutsche Bank Trust Company Americas is initially\nserving as the trustee for other securities issued by us or JPMorgan Financial, including the debt\nsecurities issued under our Indenture,\nthe debt securities issued under JPMorgan Financial\u2019s indenture for debt securities, to which we are a\nguarantor, and the warrants\nissued under JPMorgan Financial\u2019s warrant indenture, to which we are a guarantor. Consequently, if an actual\nor potential\nevent of default occurs with respect to any of these securities, the trustee may be considered to have a\nconflicting interest for purposes\nof the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. In that case, the trustee may be required to resign under\nthe Indenture, and\nwe would be required to appoint a successor trustee. For this purpose, a \u201cpotential\u201d event of default means\nan\nevent that would be an event of default if the requirements for giving us default notice or for the default\nhaving to exist for a specific\nperiod of time were disregarded.\n\nDebt Securities in Foreign Currencies\n\nWhenever the Indenture provides for an action by,\nor the determination of, any of the rights of, or any distribution to, holders of debt securities, in the\nabsence of any provision to\nthe contrary, any amount in respect of any debt security denominated in a currency or currency unit other\nthan U.S. dollars may be treated\nfor purposes of taking any such action or distribution as the amount of U.S. dollars that could reasonably\nbe exchanged for such non-U.S.\ndollar amount. This amount will be calculated as of a date\n                                                     10                                                     \nthat we specify to the paying agent or, if we fail\nto specify a date, on a date that the paying agent may determine. (Section 11.11)\n\nReplacement of Debt Securities\n\nAt the expense of the holder, we may, in our discretion,\nreplace any debt security that has been mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen or that is apparently\ndestroyed, lost or stolen. The\nmutilated debt security must be delivered to the paying agent and the registrar or satisfactory evidence of\nthe destruction, loss or theft\nof the debt security must be delivered to us, the paying agent, the registrar and the trustee. At the\nexpense of the holder,\nan indemnity that is satisfactory to us, the paying agent, the registrar and the trustee may be required\nbefore a replacement debt security\nwill be issued. (Section 2.09)\n\nGoverning Law and Judgments\n\nThe debt securities and the Indenture will be governed\nby, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. (Section 11.08) A judgment for\nmoney in\nan action based on debt securities payable in foreign currencies in a federal or state court in the United\nStates ordinarily would be\nenforced in the United States only in U.S. dollars. The date used to determine the rate of conversion of the\nforeign currency\nin which a particular debt security is payable into U.S. dollars will depend upon various factors, including\nwhich court renders the judgment. However,\nif a judgment for money in an action based on the debt securities and the Indenture were entered by a New\nYork court applying New York\nlaw, the court would render a judgment in that foreign currency, and the judgment would be converted into\nU.S. dollars at the rate of\nexchange prevailing on the date of entry of the judgment.\n\nInsolvency and Resolution Considerations\n\nCertain of the debt securities may constitute \u201closs-absorbing\ncapacity\u201d within the meaning of the rules issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n(the \u201cFederal Reserve\u201d). Federal\nReserve rules require that certain U.S. bank holding companies, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. (the \u201cParent\nCompany\u201d),\nmaintain minimum levels of unsecured external long-term debt and other loss-absorbing capacity. Such debt\nmust satisfy certain\neligibility criteria under the Federal Reserve\u2019s rules. Holders of the debt securities offered by use of\nthis prospectus\nand other debt and equity securities of the Parent Company will absorb the losses of the Parent Company and\nits subsidiaries if the Parent\nCompany were to enter into a resolution either:\n                                                                                  \n  \u00b7  in a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  \u00b7  in a receivership administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  \n     (\u201cFDIC\u201d) under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act (\u201cTitle II\u201d).                  \n                                                                                  \nThe preferred \u201csingle point of entry\u201d\nstrategy under JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s resolution plan contemplates that only the Parent Company would enter\nbankruptcy proceedings. JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s subsidiaries would be recapitalized, as needed, so that they could continue normal operations or\nsubsequently be divested\nor wound down in an orderly manner. As a result, the Parent Company\u2019s losses and any losses incurred by its\nsubsidiaries\nwould be imposed first on holders of the Parent Company\u2019s equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured\ncreditors, including\nholders of the debt securities and other debt securities of the Parent Company. Claims of holders of those\nsecurities would\nhave a junior position to the claims of creditors of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s subsidiaries and to the claims of\npriority (as determined\nby statute) and secured creditors of the Parent Company.\n\nAccordingly, in a resolution of the Parent Company\nin bankruptcy, holders of the debt securities offered by use of this prospectus and other debt securities of\nthe Parent Company would\nrealize value only to the extent available to the Parent Company as a shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. and its other subsidiaries,\nand only after any claims of priority and secured creditors of the Parent Company have been fully repaid.\n\nThe FDIC has similarly indicated that a single-point-of-entry\nrecapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a systemically important financial\ninstitution, such as the Parent Company,\n                                                     11                                                     \nunder Title II. However, the FDIC has not\nformally adopted any specific resolution strategy in connection with its Title II authority.\n\nIf the Parent Company were to approach, or enter\ninto, a resolution, none of the Parent Company, the Federal Reserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s preferred\nresolution strategy, and losses to holders of the debt securities offered by use of this prospectus and\nother debt and equity securities\nof the Parent Company, under whatever strategy is ultimately followed, could be greater than they might have\nbeen under JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\npreferred strategy.\n                                                     12                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                          Description of Warrants                                           \n                                          of JPMorgan Chase & Co.                                           \nOffered Warrants\n\nIn this \u201cDescription of Warrants of JPMorgan\nChase & Co.\u201d section, all references to \u201cwarrants\u201d refer only to warrants issued by JPMorgan Chase & Co. and\nnot to any warrants issued by JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC.\n\nThe warrants are options that are securities within\nthe meaning of Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\n\nWe may issue warrants that are debt warrants, index\nwarrants or universal warrants. We may offer any of these warrants separately or together with one or more\nother types of these\nwarrants or purchase contracts, debt securities issued by us, debt obligations or other securities of an\nentity affiliated or not affiliated\nwith us, other property or any combination of those securities in the form of units, as described in the\napplicable prospectus supplement. If\nwe issue warrants as part of a unit, the accompanying prospectus supplement will specify whether those\nwarrants may be separated from\nthe other securities in the unit prior to the warrants\u2019 expiration date. Universal warrants issued in the\nUnited States\nmay not be so separated prior to the 91st day after the issuance of the unit, unless otherwise specified in\nthe applicable prospectus\nsupplement.\n\nDebt Warrants. We may issue,\ntogether with debt securities or separately, warrants for the purchase of debt securities on terms to be\ndetermined at the time of sale. We\nrefer to this type of warrant as a \u201cdebt warrant.\u201d\n\nIndex Warrants. We may issue\nwarrants entitling the holders thereof to receive from us, upon exercise, an amount in cash determined by\nreference to decreases or increases\nin the level of a specific index or in the levels (or relative levels) of two or more indices or\ncombinations of indices, which index\nor indices may be based on one or more stocks, bonds or other securities, one or more currencies or currency\nunits, or any combination\nof the foregoing, provided that any warrants that are based, in whole or in part, on one or more currency\nindices will be listed\non a national securities exchange. We refer to this type of warrant as an \u201cindex warrant.\u201d\n\nUniversal Warrants. We may also\nissue warrants to purchase or sell securities issued by us or another entity (other than our common stock),\nsecurities based on the performance\nof such entity, securities based on the performance of such entity but excluding the performance of a\nparticular subsidiary or subsidiaries\nof such entity, a basket of securities, or any combination of the above.\n\nWe refer to the property in the above clauses as\n\u201cwarrant property.\u201d We refer to this type of warrant as a \u201cuniversal warrant.\u201d We may satisfy\nour obligations, if any, with respect to any universal warrants by delivering the warrant property or the\ncash value of the securities,\nas described in the applicable prospectus supplement.\n\nThe prospectus supplement relating to the warrants\nbeing offered will specify the particular terms of, and other information relating to, those warrants.\n\nSignificant Provisions of the Warrant Agreements\n\nWe will issue the warrants under one or more warrant\nagreements to be entered into between us and a bank or trust company, as warrant agent, in one or more\nseries, which will be described\nin the prospectus supplement for the warrants. The forms of warrant agreements are filed as exhibits to the\nregistration statement. The\nfollowing summarizes the significant provisions of the warrant agreements and the warrants and is not\nintended to be comprehensive. Holders\nof the warrants should review the detailed provisions of the relevant warrant agreement for a full\ndescription and for other information\nregarding the warrants. In addition, we will describe the specific terms that will apply to the warrants in\nan accompanying\nprospectus supplement, which will supplement and, if applicable, may modify or replace the general terms of\nthe warrants described in\nthe following section.

If\na holder fails to settle its obligations under a purchase contract that is part of a unit and fails to\npresent and surrender its unit\ncertificate to the unit agent when required, that holder will not receive the purchase contract property.\nInstead, the unit\nagent will hold that holder\u2019s purchase contract property, together with any distributions, as the registered\nowner in trust for\nthe benefit of the holder until the holder presents and surrenders the certificate or provides satisfactory\nevidence that the certificate\nhas been destroyed, lost or stolen. The unit agent or JPMorgan Chase & Co. may require an indemnity from the\nholder for\nliabilities related to any destroyed, lost or stolen certificate. If the holder does not present the unit\ncertificate, or provide\nthe necessary evidence of destruction or loss and indemnity, on or before the second anniversary of the\nsettlement date of the related\npurchase contract, the unit agent will pay to us the amounts it received in trust for that holder.\nThereafter, the holder may\nrecover those amounts only from us and not the unit agent. The unit agent will have no obligation to invest\nor to pay interest\non any amount it holds in trust pending distribution.\n                                                     19                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                            Description of Debt                                             \n                             Securities of JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC                             \nGeneral\n\nIn this \u201cDescription of Debt Securities of\nJPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC\u201d section, \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d and \u201cour\u201d refer only to JPMorgan Chase\nFinancial Company LLC and not to any of its affiliates, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., references to the\n\u201cGuarantor\u201d\nrefer only to JPMorgan Chase & Co. and not to any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, and all references to\n\u201cdebt securities\u201d\nrefer only to debt securities issued by JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC and not to any debt securities\nissued by JPMorgan Chase &\nCo.\n\nThe following description of the terms of the debt\nsecurities contains certain general terms that may apply to the debt securities. The specific terms of any\ndebt securities\nwill be described in one or more prospectus supplements relating to those debt securities.\n\nThe debt securities will be issued under an Indenture\namong JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC, as issuer, JPMorgan Chase & Co., as guarantor, and Deutsche Bank\nTrust Company Americas,\nas trustee (as has been and as may be further supplemented from time to time, for purposes of this section\nentitled \u201cDescription\nof Debt Securities of JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC,\u201d the \u201cIndenture\u201d).\n\nWe have summarized below the material provisions\nof the Indenture and the debt securities and guarantees issued under the Indenture or indicated which\nmaterial provisions will be described\nin the related prospectus supplement.\n\nThese descriptions are only summaries, and each\ninvestor should refer to the Indenture, which describes completely the terms and definitions summarized\nbelow and contains additional\ninformation regarding the debt securities issued under it. Where appropriate, we use parentheses to refer\nyou to the particular\nsections of the Indenture. Any reference to particular sections or defined terms of the Indenture in any\nstatement under this\nheading qualifies the entire statement and incorporates by reference the applicable section or definition\ninto that statement.\n\nThe debt securities will be our direct, unsecured\ngeneral obligations, the payment on which is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Guarantor, and will\nhave the same rank in liquidation\nas all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt.\n\nThe Indenture does not limit the aggregate principal\namount of debt securities that may be issued under it. The Indenture provides that debt securities may be\nissued up to the\nprincipal amount authorized by us from time to time. (Section 2.03) We have previously established the\nSeries A medium-term\nnotes under the Indenture. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $25.9 billion aggregate principal\namount of Series\nA medium-term notes outstanding under the Indenture. Our board of managers has authorized the issuance of\nsecurities under\nthe registration statement to which this prospectus relates, including Series A medium-term notes, with an\naggregate initial public offering\nprice not to exceed $130 billion, to be issued on or after February 17, 2023.\n\nThe Indenture allows us to reopen a previous issue\nof a series of debt securities and issue additional debt securities of that issue. We have no obligation to\ntake your interests\ninto account when deciding whether to issue additional debt securities. In addition, we are under no\nobligation to reopen any\nseries of debt securities or to issue any additional debt securities.\n\nThe Guarantor is a holding company that holds the\nstock of the Bank and IHC. The Guarantor conducts substantially all of its operations through subsidiaries,\nincluding the Bank\nand the IHC. As a result, claims of the holders of the debt securities against the Guarantor under the\nguarantee will generally\nhave a junior position to claims of creditors of the Guarantor\u2019s subsidiaries. Claims of the Guarantor\u2019s\nsubsidiaries\u2019\ncreditors other than the Guarantor include substantial amounts of deposit liabilities, long-term debt and\nother liabilities. In\naddition, the Guarantor is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds that the\nGuarantor receives from the\nissuance of securities (including any securities offered by use of this prospectus), and the ability of the\nBank and the IHC to make payments\nto the Guarantor is limited. As a result of these arrangements, the Guarantor\u2019s ability to make various\npayments is dependent\non its receiving dividends from the Bank and dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. These\nlimitations could affect\nthe Guarantor\u2019s ability to pay interest on\n                                                     20                                                     \nits debt securities, redeem or repurchase outstanding\nsecurities and fulfill its other payment obligations, including payment obligations under the guarantees of\nour debt securities.\n\nWe may issue debt securities from time to time\nin one or more series. (Section 2.03) The debt securities may be denominated and payable in U.S. dollars or\nforeign currencies.\n(Section 2.03) We may also issue debt securities, from time to time, with the principal amount, interest or\nother amounts payable\non any relevant payment date to be determined by reference to one or more currency exchange rates, interest\nrates, swap rates, securities\nor baskets of securities, commodity prices, indices, basket of indices, or any other financial, economic or\nother measure or instrument,\nincluding the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event or circumstance. The debt securities may also be\nissued as original\nissue discount debt securities, which will bear no interest or bear interest at below market rates and will\nbe sold at a discount to their\nstated principal amount. All references in this prospectus, or any prospectus supplement to other amounts\nwill include premium,\nif any, and other cash amounts payable under the Indenture, if any.\n\nThe debt securities may bear interest at a fixed\nrate, which may be zero, or a floating rate.\n\nThe prospectus supplement relating to a particular\nseries of debt securities being offered will specify the particular terms of, and other information relating\nto, those debt securities.\n\nHolders may present debt securities for exchange\nor transfer, in the manner, at the places and subject to the restrictions stated in the debt securities and\ndescribed in the applicable\nprospectus supplement. We will provide these services without charge except for any tax or other\ngovernmental charge payable\nin connection with these services and subject to any limitations provided in the Indenture. (Section 2.08)\n\nIf any of the securities are held in global form,\nthe procedures for transfer of interests in those securities will depend upon the procedures of the\ndepositary for those global securities. See\n\u201cForms of Securities.\u201d\n\nWe will generally have no obligation to repurchase,\nredeem, or change the terms of the debt securities upon any event (including a change in control of us or\nthe Guarantor) that might have\nan adverse effect on our or the Guarantor\u2019s credit quality.\n\nEvents of Default and Waivers\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement, an \u201cEvent of Default\u201d with respect to a series of debt securities issued under the Indenture is\ndefined in the\nIndenture as:\n                                                                                   \n  \u00b7  default in the payment of interest on any debt securities of that series and  \n     continuance of such default for 30 days;                                      \n                                                                                   \n                                                                                           \n  \u00b7  default in the payment of principal or other amounts payable on any debt securities   \n     of that series when due, at maturity, upon redemption, by declaration, or otherwise;  \n                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n     default in the performance, or breach, of any other covenants or warranties                            \n     applicable to us contained in the Indenture applicable to that series, and continuation of such        \n  \u00b7  default or breach for 90 days after written                                                            \n     notice has been given by the trustee to us and the Guarantor or given by holders of at least 25% in    \n     aggregate principal amount of the                                                                      \n     outstanding securities of all series affected thereby to us, the Guarantor and the trustee;            \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                \n  \u00b7  certain events of our bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, winding up or  \n     liquidation, whether voluntary or involuntary;                             \n                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n     the guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect, other than in accordance                          \n     with the Indenture, or the Guarantor denies or disaffirms its obligations under the guarantee,         \n     provided that no Event of Default                                                                      \n     with respect to the guarantee will occur as a result of, or because it is related directly or          \n  \u00b7  indirectly to, the insolvency of the Guarantor                                                         \n     or the commencement of proceedings under Title 11 of the United States Code, or the appointment of a   \n     receiver for the Guarantor under                                                                       \n     Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Federal      \n     Deposit                                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n                                                     21                                                     \nInsurance Corporation having separately repudiated the Guarantee\nin receivership, or the commencement of or certain other events of the Guarantor\u2019s bankruptcy, insolvency,\nresolution, receivership,\nwinding up or liquidation; or\n                                                                                    \n  \u00b7  any other event of default provided in the applicable supplemental indentures  \n     to the Indenture or form of security. (Section 5.01)                           \n                                                                                    \nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing because of a default in the payment of\nprincipal, interest or other amounts\npayable on the debt securities, a failure in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or agreement\napplicable to us, the guarantee\nceasing to be in full force and effect, or any other event of default provided in the applicable\nsupplemental indentures to the Indenture\nor form of security, either the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of\nthe debt securities of such\nseries then outstanding, treated as one class, by written notice to us and the Guarantor, may declare the\nprincipal of all outstanding\ndebt securities of such series and any interest accrued thereon, to be due and payable immediately. Unless\notherwise specified\nin the applicable prospectus supplement, if a default due to specified events of our bankruptcy, insolvency,\nreceivership, winding up\nor liquidation, occurs and is continuing, the principal of all outstanding debt securities and any interest\naccrued thereon will automatically,\nand without any declaration or other action on the part of the trustee or any holder, become immediately due\nand payable. Subject\nto certain conditions such declarations may be annulled and past defaults may be waived by the holders of a\nmajority in aggregate principal\namount of the outstanding debt securities of the series affected. (Sections 5.01 and 5.10)\n\nEvents of bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution, receivership,\nwinding up or liquidation relating to the Guarantor will not constitute an Event of Default with respect to\nany series of debt securities. In\naddition, failure by the Guarantor to perform any of its covenants or warranties (other than a payment\ndefault) will not constitute an\nEvent of Default with respect to any series of debt securities. Therefore, events of bankruptcy, resolution,\nreceivership,\ninsolvency, winding up or liquidation relating to the Guarantor (in the absence of any such event occurring\nwith respect to us) will not\npermit any of the debt securities to be declared due and payable and the trustee is not authorized to\nexercise any remedy against us or\nthe Guarantor upon the occurrence or continuation of these events with respect to the Guarantor. Instead,\neven if an event\nof bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution, receivership, winding up or liquidation relating to the Guarantor has\noccurred, the trustee and\nthe holders of debt securities of a series will not be able to declare the relevant debt securities to be\nimmediately due and payable\nunless there is an Event of Default with respect to that series as described above, such as our bankruptcy,\ninsolvency, receivership,\nwinding up or liquidation or a payment default by us or the Guarantor on the relevant debt securities. The\nvalue you receive on any series of debt securities may be significantly less than what you would have\notherwise received had our debt securities been declared due and payable immediately or the trustee been\nauthorized to exercise any remedy against us or the Guarantor upon the occurrence or continuation of these\nevents with respect to the Guarantor.\n\nAn Event of Default with respect to one series\nof debt securities does not necessarily constitute an Event of Default with respect to any other series of\ndebt securities. The\nIndenture requires the trustee to provide notice of default with respect to the debt securities within 90\ndays, unless the default is\ncured, but provides that the trustee may withhold notice to the holders of the debt securities of any\ndefault if the board of directors,\nthe executive committee, or a trust committee of directors or trustees and/or responsible officers of the\ntrustee determines in good faith\nthat it is in the interest of the holders of the debt securities of the applicable series to do so. The\ntrustee may not withhold\nnotice of a default in the payment of principal of, interest on or any other amounts due under, such debt\nsecurities. (Section 5.11)\n\nThe Indenture provides that the holders of a majority\nin aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities of each series affected, with all such series\nvoting as a single class, may\ndirect the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee, or\nexercising any trust or power\nconferred on the trustee. The trustee may decline to act if the direction is contrary to law and in certain\nother circumstances\nset forth in the Indenture. (Section 5.09) The trustee is not obligated to exercise any of its rights or\npowers under the Indenture\nat the request or direction of the holders of debt securities unless the holders offer the trustee security\nor indemnity satisfactory\nto it against the costs, expenses and liabilities incurred therein or thereby. (Section 6.02(d))\n                                                     22                                                     \nNo holder of any debt security of any affected\nseries has the right to institute any action for remedy unless such holder has previously given to the\ntrustee written notice of default,\nthe trustee has failed to take action for 60 days after the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate\nprincipal amount of the debt securities\nof each affected series make written request upon the trustee to institute such action and have offered\nreasonable indemnity in connection\nwith the same and the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of each\naffected series (voting as a\nsingle class) have not given direction to the trustee that is inconsistent with the written request referred\nto above.

The\nmerger covenant described above would apply only if the recapitalization transaction, change of control or\nhighly leveraged transaction\nwere structured to include a merger or consolidation of us or the Guarantor or a sale or conveyance of all\nor substantially all of our\nor the Guarantor\u2019s assets. However,\n                                                     25                                                     \nwe may provide specific protections, such as a put\nright or increased interest, for particular debt securities, which we would describe in the applicable\nprospectus supplement.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. Guarantee\n\nThe Guarantor will fully and unconditionally guarantee\nthe full and punctual payment of the principal of, interest on, and all other amounts payable under the debt\nsecurities when the same\nbecomes due and payable, whether at maturity, upon redemption, repurchase at the option of the holders of\nthe applicable debt securities\nor upon acceleration. If for any reason we do not make any required payment in respect of our debt\nsecurities when due, the\nGuarantor will on demand pay the unpaid amount at the same place and in the same manner that applies to\npayments made by us under the\nIndenture. The guarantee is of payment and not of collection. (Section 14.01)\n\nThe Guarantor\u2019s obligations under the guarantee\nare unconditional and absolute. However, (1) the Guarantor will not be liable for any amount of payment that\nwe are excused\nfrom making or any amount in excess of the amount actually due and owing by us, and (2) any defense or\ncounterclaims available to us (except\nthose resulting solely from, or on account of, our insolvency or our status as debtor or subject of a\nbankruptcy or insolvency proceeding)\nwill also be available to the Guarantor to the same extent as these defense or counterclaims are available\nto us, whether or not asserted\nby us. (Section 14.02)\n\nConcerning the Trustee, Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent\n\nWe, the Guarantor and certain of their affiliates\nhave a wide range of banking relationships with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, The Bank of New York\nMellon and The Bank of New\nYork Mellon, London Branch. The Bank of New York Mellon and, for debt securities settled through Euroclear\nBank SA/NV or Clearstream\nBanking, S.A., Luxembourg, The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch, will be the paying agents,\nauthenticating agents, registrars and\ntransfer agents for debt securities issued under the Indenture.\n\nDeutsche Bank Trust Company Americas is initially\nserving as the trustee for the debt securities issued under our Indenture, to which JPMorgan Chase & Co.\nacts as a guarantor, the\nwarrants issued under our warrant indenture, to which JPMorgan Chase & Co. acts as a guarantor, and the debt\nsecurities issued under\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s indenture. Consequently, if an actual or potential event of default occurs with\nrespect to\nany of these securities, the trustee may be considered to have a conflicting interest for purposes of the\nTrust Indenture Act of 1939,\nas amended. In that case, the trustee may be required to resign under the Indenture, and we would be\nrequired to appoint a\nsuccessor trustee. For this purpose, a \u201cpotential\u201d event of default means an event that would be an event of\ndefault\nif the requirements for giving us default notice or for the default having to exist for a specific period of\ntime were disregarded.\n\nDebt Securities in Foreign Currencies\n\nWhenever the Indenture provides for an action by,\nor the determination of, any of the rights of, or any distribution to, holders of debt securities, in the\nabsence of any provision to\nthe contrary, any amount in respect of any debt security denominated in a currency or currency unit other\nthan U.S. dollars may be treated\nfor purposes of taking any such action or distribution as the amount of U.S. dollars that could reasonably\nbe exchanged for such non-U.S.\ndollar amount. This amount will be calculated as of a date that we specify to the trustee or, if we fail to\nspecify a date,\non a date that the trustee may determine. (Section 11.11)\n\nReplacement of Debt Securities\n\nAt the expense of the holder, we may, in our discretion,\nreplace any debt security that has been mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen or that is apparently\ndestroyed, lost or stolen. The\nmutilated debt security must be delivered to the paying agent and the registrar or satisfactory evidence of\nthe destruction, loss or theft\nof the debt security must be delivered to us, the paying agent, the registrar and the trustee. At the\nexpense of the holder,\nan indemnity that is satisfactory to us, the Guarantor, the paying agent, the registrar and the trustee may\nbe required before a replacement\ndebt security will be issued. (Section 2.09)\n                                                     26                                                     \nGoverning Law and Judgments\n\nThe debt securities and the Indenture, including\nthe guarantee, will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.\n(Section 11.08) A\njudgment for money in an action based on debt securities payable in foreign currencies in a federal or state\ncourt in the United States\nordinarily would be enforced in the United States only in U.S. dollars. The date used to determine the rate\nof conversion of\nthe foreign currency in which a particular debt security is payable into U.S. dollars will depend upon\nvarious factors, including which\ncourt renders the judgment. However, if a judgment for money in an action based on the debt securities and\nthe Indenture were\nentered by a New York court applying New York law, the court would render a judgment in that foreign\ncurrency, and the judgment would\nbe converted into U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of entry of the judgment.\n                                                     27                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                          Description of Warrants                                           \n                                  of JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC                                   \nGeneral\n\nIn this \u201cDescription of Warrants of JPMorgan\nChase Financial Company LLC\u201d section, \u201cwe,\u201d us\u201d and \u201cour\u201d refer only to JPMorgan Chase Financial Company\nLLC and not to any of its affiliates, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., references to the \u201cGuarantor\u201d refer\nonly to JPMorgan\nChase & Co. and not to any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, and all references to \u201cwarrants\u201d refer only to\nwarrants\nissued by JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC and not to any warrants issued by JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThe warrants are options that are securities within\nthe meaning of Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\n\nThe following description of the terms of the warrants\ncontains certain general terms that may apply to the warrants.

In addition, we are under no obligation to reopen any\nseries of warrants\nor to issue any additional warrants.\n                                                     28                                                     \nThe Guarantor is a holding company that holds the\nstock of the Bank and IHC. The Guarantor conducts substantially all of its operations through subsidiaries,\nincluding the Bank\nand the IHC. As a result, claims of the holders of the warrants against the Guarantor under the guarantee\nwill generally have\na junior position to claims of creditors of the Guarantor\u2019s subsidiaries. Claims of the Guarantor\u2019s\nsubsidiaries\u2019\ncreditors other than the Guarantor include substantial amounts of deposit liabilities, long-term debt and\nother liabilities. In\naddition, the Guarantor is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds that the\nGuarantor receives from the\nissuance of securities (including any securities offered by use of this prospectus), and the ability of the\nBank and the IHC to make payments\nto the Guarantor is limited. As a result of these arrangements, the Guarantor\u2019s ability to make various\npayments is dependent\non its receiving dividends from the Bank and dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. These\nlimitations could affect\nthe Guarantor\u2019s ability to pay interest on its debt securities, redeem or repurchase outstanding securities\nand fulfill its other\npayment obligations, including payment obligations under the guarantees of our warrants.\n\nWe may issue warrants from time to time in one\nor more series. (Section 2.03) The warrants may be denominated and payable in U.S. dollars or foreign\ncurrencies. (Section\n2.03) We may also issue warrants, from time to time, with the amounts payable on any relevant payment date\nto be determined\nby reference to one or more currency exchange rates, securities or baskets of securities, indices or basket\nof indices, provided\nthat any warrants that are based, in whole or in part, on one or more currency exchange rates will be listed\non a national securities\nexchange.\n\nThe prospectus supplement relating to a particular\nseries of warrants being offered will specify the particular terms of, and other information relating to,\nthose warrants.\n\nHolders may present warrants for exchange or transfer,\nin the manner, at the places and subject to the restrictions stated in the warrants and described in the\napplicable prospectus supplement. We\nwill provide these services without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge payable in\nconnection with these services and\nsubject to any limitations provided in the Indenture. (Section 2.08)\n\nIf any of the securities are held in global form,\nthe procedures for transfer of interests in those securities will depend upon the procedures of the\ndepositary for those global securities. See\n\u201cForms of Securities.\u201d\n\nWe will generally have no obligation to repurchase,\nredeem, or change the terms of the warrants upon any event (including a change in control of us or the\nGuarantor) that might have an adverse\neffect on our or the Guarantor\u2019s credit quality.\n\nEvents of Default and Waivers\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement, an \u201cEvent of Default\u201d with respect to any warrant of any series issued under the Indenture is\ndefined in the Indenture\nas:\n                                                                                                            \n     default in the payment of any amount payable on that warrant when due (but                             \n  \u00b7  not such a default in respect of any other warrant of the same series or any other series), either     \n     upon exercise, upon redemption or otherwise;                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n     failure by us for 90 days to perform any other covenants or warranties applicable                      \n     to us contained in the Indenture applicable to that series after written notice has been given by the  \n  \u00b7  trustee to us and the Guarantor                                                                        \n     or given by holders of at least 25% in aggregate number of the outstanding warrants of all series      \n     affected thereby to us, the Guarantor                                                                  \n     and the trustee;                                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                \n  \u00b7  certain events of our bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, winding up or  \n     liquidation, whether voluntary or involuntary;                             \n                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n     the guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect, other than in accordance                          \n     with the Indenture, or the Guarantor denies or disaffirms its obligations under the guarantee,         \n     provided that no Event of Default                                                                      \n     with respect to the guarantee will occur as a result of, or because it is related directly or          \n  \u00b7  indirectly to, the insolvency of the Guarantor                                                         \n     or the commencement of proceedings under Title 11 of the United States Code, or the appointment of a   \n     receiver for the Guarantor under                                                                       \n     Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Federal      \n     Deposit                                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n                                                     29                                                     \nInsurance Corporation having separately repudiated the Guarantee\nin receivership, or the commencement of or certain other events of the Guarantor\u2019s bankruptcy, insolvency,\nresolution, receivership,\nwinding up or liquidation;\n                                                                                    \n  \u00b7  any other event of default provided in the applicable supplemental indentures  \n     to the Indenture or form of security. (Section 5.01)                           \n                                                                                    \nHowever, a failure by the Issuer to perform any\nobligation or otherwise observe any covenant in any warrant or in the Indenture insofar as it applies to any\nwarrant will not constitute\na default unless all conditions precedent to the obligations of the Issuer to be satisfied by the holder of\nthat warrant have been satisfied.\n(Section 5.01)\n\nNeither the trustee nor any holder is entitled,\nwhether by reason of a default or otherwise, to demand or accelerate any payment on a warrant before the\npayment is otherwise due in accordance\nwith the terms of that warrant. (Section 5.02)\n\nSubject to certain conditions, past defaults may\nbe waived by the holders of a majority in number of the outstanding warrants of the series affected.\n(Section 5.10)\n\nEvents of bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution, receivership,\nwinding up or liquidation relating to the Guarantor will not constitute an Event of Default with respect to\nany series of warrants. In\naddition, failure by the Guarantor to perform any of its covenants or warranties (other than a payment\ndefault) will not constitute an\nEvent of Default with respect to any series of warrants. Therefore, the trustee is not authorized to\nexercise any remedy against\nus or the Guarantor upon the occurrence or continuation of events of bankruptcy, resolution, receivership,\ninsolvency, winding up or liquidation\nrelating to the Guarantor (in the absence of any such event occurring with respect to us). Instead, even if\nan event of bankruptcy,\ninsolvency, resolution, receivership, winding up or liquidation relating to the Guarantor has occurred, the\ntrustee and the holders of\nwarrants of a series will not be entitled to institute any action or proceeding against us or the Guarantor\nunless there is an Event of\nDefault with respect to that series as described above, such as our bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership,\nwinding up or liquidation or\na payment default by us or the Guarantor on the relevant warrants. The value you receive on any series of\nwarrants may be significantly less than what you would have otherwise received had our warrants authorized\nthe trustee to exercise any remedy against us or the Guarantor upon the occurrence or continuation of these\nevents with respect to the Guarantor.\n\nAn Event of Default with respect to one series\nof warrants does not necessarily constitute an Event of Default with respect to any other series of\nwarrants. The Indenture\nrequires the trustee to provide notice of default with respect to the warrants within 90 days, unless the\ndefault is cured, but provides\nthat the trustee may withhold notice to the holders of the warrants of any default if the board of\ndirectors, the executive committee,\nor a trust committee of directors or trustees and/or responsible officers of the trustee determines in good\nfaith that it is in the interest\nof the holders of the warrants of the applicable series to do so. The trustee may not withhold notice of a\ndefault in the payment\nof any money due, under such warrants. (Section 5.11)\n\nThe Indenture provides that the holders of a majority\nin number of outstanding warrants of each series affected, with all such series voting as a single class,\nmay direct the time, method,\nand place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee, or exercising any trust or\npower conferred on the trustee. The\ntrustee may decline to act if the direction is contrary to law and in certain other circumstances set forth\nin the Indenture. (Section\n5.09) The trustee is not obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the\nrequest or direction\nof the holders of warrants unless the holders offer the trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it\nagainst the costs, expenses and\nliabilities incurred therein or thereby. (Section 6.02(d))\n\nNo holder of any warrant of any affected series\nhas the right to institute any action for remedy unless such holder has previously given to the trustee\nwritten notice of default, the\ntrustee has failed to take action for 60 days after the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate number of\nthe warrants of each affected\nseries make written request upon the trustee to institute such action and have offered reasonable indemnity\nin connection with the same\nand the holders of a majority in aggregate number of the warrants\n                                                     30                                                     \nof each affected series (voting as a single class)\nhave not given direction to the trustee that is inconsistent with the written request referred to above.\n(Section 5.06)\n\nHowever, the right of any holder of a warrant to\nreceive payment of the money due on that warrant on or after its payment date, to exercise that warrant in\naccordance with its terms,\nor to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment and such right to exercise, may not be impaired\nor affected without the consent\nof that holder.

The\nmerger covenant described above would apply only if the recapitalization transaction, change of control or\nhighly leveraged transaction\nwere structured to include a merger or consolidation of us or the Guarantor or a sale or conveyance of all\nor substantially all of our\nor the Guarantor\u2019s assets. However, we may provide specific protections, such as a put right for particular\nwarrants,\nwhich we would describe in the applicable prospectus supplement.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. Guarantee\n\nThe Guarantor will fully and unconditionally guarantee\nthe full and punctual payment of amounts payable under the warrants when the same becomes due and payable,\nwhether at expiration, upon\nexercise, redemption or repurchase at the option of the holders of the applicable warrants. If for any\nreason we do not make\nany required payment in respect of our warrants when due, the Guarantor will on demand pay the unpaid amount\nat the same place and in\nthe same manner that applies to payments made by us under the Indenture. The guarantee is of payment and not\nof collection.\n(Section 14.01)\n\nThe Guarantor\u2019s obligations under the guarantee\nare unconditional and absolute. However, (1) the Guarantor will not be liable for any amount of payment that\nwe are excused\nfrom making or any amount in excess of the amount actually due and owing by us, and (2) any defense or\ncounterclaims available to us (except\nthose resulting solely from, or on account of, our insolvency or our status as debtor or subject of a\nbankruptcy or insolvency proceeding)\nwill also be available to the Guarantor to the same extent as these defense or counterclaims are available\nto us, whether or not asserted\nby us. (Section 14.02)\n\nConcerning the Trustee, Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent\n\nWe, the Guarantor and certain of their affiliates\nhave a wide range of banking relationships with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, The Bank of New York\nMellon and The Bank of New\nYork Mellon, London Branch. The Bank of New York Mellon and, for warrants settled through Euroclear Bank\nSA/NV or Clearstream\nBanking, S.A., Luxembourg, The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch, will be the paying agents,\nauthenticating agents, registrars and\ntransfer agents for warrants issued under the Indenture.\n\nDeutsche Bank Trust Company Americas is initially\nserving as the trustee for the warrants issued under our Indenture, to which JPMorgan Chase & Co. acts as a\nguarantor, the debt securities\nissued under our indenture for debt securities, to which JPMorgan Chase & Co. acts as a guarantor, and the\ndebt securities issued\nunder JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s indenture. Consequently, if an actual or potential event of default occurs with\nrespect\nto any of these securities, the trustee may be considered to have a conflicting interest for purposes of the\nTrust Indenture Act of 1939,\nas amended. In that case, the trustee may be required to resign under the Indenture, and we would be\nrequired to appoint a\nsuccessor trustee. For this purpose, a \u201cpotential\u201d event of default means an event that would be an event of\ndefault\nif the requirements for giving us default notice or for the default having to exist for a specific period of\ntime were disregarded.\n\nReplacement of Warrants\n\nAt the expense of the holder, we may, in our discretion,\nreplace any warrant that has been mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen or that is apparently destroyed, lost\nor stolen. The\nmutilated warrant must be delivered to the paying agent and the registrar or satisfactory evidence of the\ndestruction, loss or theft of\nthe warrant must be delivered to us, the paying agent, the registrar and the trustee. At the expense of the\nholder, an indemnity\nthat is satisfactory to us, the Guarantor, the paying agent, the registrar and the trustee may be required\nbefore a replacement warrant\nwill be issued. (Section 2.09)\n\nGoverning Law and Judgments\n\nThe warrants and the Indenture, including the guarantee,\nwill be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. (Section 11.08) A\njudgment for money\nin an action based on warrants payable in foreign currencies in a federal or state court in the United\nStates ordinarily would be enforced\nin the United States only in U.S. dollars. The date used to determine the rate of\n                                                     33                                                     \nconversion of the foreign currency in which a particular\nwarrant is payable into U.S. dollars will depend upon various factors, including which court renders the\njudgment. However,\nif a judgment for money in an action based on the warrants and the Indenture were entered by a New York\ncourt applying New York law, the\ncourt would render a judgment in that foreign currency, and the judgment would be converted into U.S.\ndollars at the rate of exchange\nprevailing on the date of entry of the judgment.\n                                                     34                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                            Forms of Securities                                             \nEach debt security, warrant, unit and purchase\ncontract will be represented either by a certificate issued in definitive form to a particular investor or\nby one or more global securities\nrepresenting the entire issuance of securities. Both definitive securities and global securities will be\nissued only in registered\nform, where our or JPMorgan Financial\u2019s obligation runs to the holder of the security named on the face of\nthe security or, if a\nregistry is kept, the registered owner of the note in the registry, and not in bearer form, where our or\nJPMorgan Financial\u2019s obligation\nwould run to the bearer of the security. Definitive securities name you or your nominee as the owner of the\nsecurity, and in\norder to transfer or exchange these securities or to receive payments other than interest or other interim\npayments, you or your nominee\nmust physically deliver the securities to the trustee, registrar, paying agent or other agent, as\napplicable. Registered global\nsecurities name a depositary or its common depositary or nominee as the owner of the debt securities,\nwarrants, units or purchase contracts\nrepresented by these global securities. The depositary maintains a computerized system that will reflect\neach investor\u2019s\nbeneficial ownership of the securities through an account maintained by the investor with its broker/dealer,\nbank, trust company or other\nrepresentative, as we explain more fully below.\n\nBook-Entry System\n\nGeneral. Unless otherwise specified\nin the relevant prospectus supplement, the securities will be initially issued in the form of one or more\nfully registered global securities\nthat will be deposited with or on behalf of one or more depositaries, including, without limitation, The\nDepository Trust Company (\u201cDTC\u201d),\nEuroclear Bank SA/NV (\u201cEuroclear\u201d) and/or Clearstream Banking, S.A., Luxembourg (\u201cClearstream\u201d) and will be\nregistered\nin the name of such depositary or its common depositary or nominee. Under these circumstances, one or more\nregistered global\nsecurities will be issued in a denomination or aggregate denominations equal to the portion of the aggregate\nprincipal or face amount\nof the securities to be represented by registered global securities. Unless and until it is exchanged in\nwhole for securities\nin definitive registered form, a registered global security may not be transferred except as a whole by and\namong the depositary for the\nregistered global security, the common depositaries or the nominees of the depositary or any successors of\nthe depositary or those common\ndepositaries or nominees.\n\nThe securities may be accepted for clearance by\nDTC, Euroclear and Clearstream. Unless otherwise specified in the relevant prospectus supplement, the\ninitial distribution\nof the securities will be cleared through DTC only. Under these circumstances, beneficial interests in the\nregistered global\nsecurities will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, the book-entry records\nmaintained by DTC and its direct\nand indirect participants, including, as applicable, Euroclear and Clearstream.\n\nThe laws of some states may require that some purchasers\nof securities take physical delivery of these securities in definitive form. These laws may impair your\nability to own, transfer\nor pledge beneficial interests in registered global securities.\n\nOwnership of beneficial interests in a registered\nglobal security will be limited to persons, called participants, that have accounts with the depositary or\npersons that may hold interests\nthrough participants. Upon the issuance of a registered global security, the depositary will credit, on its\nbook entry registration\nand transfer system, the participants\u2019 accounts with the respective principal or face amounts of the\nsecurities beneficially owned\nby the participants. Any dealers, underwriters or agents participating in the distribution of the securities\nwill designate\nthe accounts to be credited. Ownership of beneficial interests in a registered global security will be shown\non, and the transfer\nof ownership interests will be effected only through, records maintained by the depositary, with respect to\ninterests of participants,\nand on the records of participants, with respect to interests of persons holding through participants.\n\nSo long as the depositary, or its common depositary\nor nominee, is the registered owner of a registered global security, that depositary or its common\ndepositary or nominee, as the case\nmay be, will be considered the sole owner and holder of the securities represented by the registered global\nsecurity for all purposes\nunder the Indenture, warrant agreement, unit agreement or purchase contract, as applicable. Except as\ndescribed below, owners\nof beneficial interests in a registered global security will not be entitled to have the securities\nrepresented by the registered global\nsecurity registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of the\nsecurities in definitive form\nand will not be considered the owners or holders of the securities under the Indenture, warrant agreement,\nunit\n                                                     35                                                     \nagreement or purchase contract, as applicable. Accordingly,\neach person owning a beneficial interest in a registered global security must rely on the procedures of the\ndepositary for that registered\nglobal security and, if that person is not a participant, on the procedures of the participant through which\nthe person owns its interest,\nto exercise any rights of a holder under the Indenture, warrant agreement, unit agreement or purchase\ncontract, as applicable. We\nand JPMorgan Financial understand that under existing industry practices, if we or JPMorgan Financial\nrequest any action of holders or\nif an owner of a beneficial interest in a registered global security desires to give or take any action that\na holder is entitled to give\nor take under the Indenture, warrant agreement, unit agreement or purchase contract, as applicable, the\ndepositary for the registered\nglobal security would authorize the participants holding the relevant beneficial interests to give or take\nthat action, and the participants\nwould authorize beneficial owners owning through them to give or take that action or would otherwise act\nupon the instructions of beneficial\nowners holding through them.\n\nThe Clearing Systems.DTC, Euroclear\nand Clearstream, as applicable, have advised us and JPMorgan Financial as follows:\n\nDTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized\nunder the New York Banking Law, a \u201cbanking organization\u201d within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a\nmember of the Federal\nReserve System, a \u201cclearing corporation\u201d within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a\n\u201cclearing\nagency\u201d registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended. DTC\nholds and provides asset servicing for securities deposited with it by its participants. DTC also\nfacilitates the post-trade\nsettlement among direct participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities,\nthrough electronic computerized\nbook-entry transfers and pledges between direct participants\u2019 accounts. This eliminates the need for\nphysical movement\nof securities certificates. Direct participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and\ndealers, banks, trust\ncompanies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The\nDepository Trust\n& Clearing Corporation (\u201cDTCC\u201d). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing\nCorporation\nand Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the\nusers of its regulated\nsubsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities\nbrokers and dealers,\nbanks, trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship\nwith a direct participant, either\ndirectly or indirectly. The DTC rules applicable to its participants are on file with the SEC. More\ninformation\nabout DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com. We and JPMorgan Chase & Co. make no representation or warranty as to\nthe accuracy\nor completeness of the information displayed on such website, and such information is not incorporated by\nreference herein and should\nnot be considered a part of this prospectus.\n\nEuroclear holds securities for its participants\nand clears and settles transactions between its participants through simultaneous electronic book-entry\ndelivery against payment, thus\neliminating the need for physical movement of certificates. Euroclear provides various other services,\nincluding safekeeping,\nadministration, clearance and settlement and securities lending and borrowing, and interfaces with domestic\nmarkets in several countries. Euroclear\nis operated by Euroclear Bank, under contract with Euroclear plc, a U.K. corporation. Euroclear Bank\nconducts all operations,\nand all Euroclear securities clearance accounts and Euroclear cash accounts are accounts with Euroclear\nBank, not Euroclear plc. Euroclear\nplc establishes policy for Euroclear on behalf of Euroclear participants. Euroclear participants include\nbanks (including central\nbanks), securities brokers and dealers and other professional financial intermediaries and may include any\nunderwriters for the securities. Indirect\naccess to Euroclear is also available to other firms that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship\nwith a Euroclear participant,\neither directly or indirectly. Euroclear is an indirect participant in DTC. Securities clearance accounts\nand cash\naccounts with Euroclear are governed by the Terms and Conditions Governing Use of Euroclear and the related\nOperating Procedures of the\nEuroclear System (collectively, the \u201cEuroclear Terms and Conditions\u201d) and applicable law. The Euroclear\nTerms and\nConditions govern transfers of securities and cash within Euroclear, withdrawals of securities and cash from\nEuroclear and receipts of\npayments with respect to securities in Euroclear.\n\nClearstream is incorporated under the laws of The\nGrand Duchy of Luxembourg as a soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme and is subject to regulation by the Luxembourg Commission for\nthe Supervision\nof the Financial Sector (Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier). Clearstream is owned by Deutsche\nB\u00f6rse AG,\na publicly traded company. Clearstream holds securities for its participants and facilitates the\n                                                     36                                                     \nclearance and settlement of securities transactions\namong its participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its participants, thereby\neliminating the need for physical\nmovement of certificates. Clearstream provides other services to its participants, including safekeeping,\nadministration, clearance\nand settlement of internationally traded securities and securities lending and borrowing. Clearstream\ninterfaces with domestic\nmarkets in several countries. Clearstream\u2019s customers include worldwide securities brokers and dealers,\nbanks, trust\ncompanies and clearing corporations and may include professional financial intermediaries. Its U.S.\ncustomers are limited to\nsecurities brokers, dealers and banks. Indirect access to the Clearstream system is also available to others\nthat clear through\nClearstream customers or that have custodial relationships with its customers, such as banks, brokers,\ndealers and trust companies. Clearstream\nis an indirect participant in DTC. Clearstream has established an electronic bridge with Euroclear to\nfacilitate settlement\nof trades between Clearstream and Euroclear. Distributions with respect to securities held beneficially\nthrough Clearstream\nare credited to cash accounts of Clearstream customers in accordance with its rules and procedures, to the\nextent received by Clearstream.\n\nPayments on Registered Global Securities. Principal,\ninterest payments on debt securities, other amounts due under debt securities and any payments to holders\nwith respect to warrants, units\nor purchase contracts, represented by a registered global security registered in the name of a depositary or\nits common depositary or\nnominee will be made to the depositary or its common depositary or nominee, as the case may be, as the\nregistered owner of the registered\nglobal security. None of us, JPMorgan Financial, the trustees, the warrant agents, the unit agents or any of\nour or JPMorgan\nFinancial\u2019s other agents, agent of the trustees or agent of the warrant agents or unit agents will have any\nresponsibility or liability\nfor any aspect of the records relating to payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the\nregistered global security\nor for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to those beneficial ownership interests.\n\nWe and JPMorgan Financial expect that the depositary\nfor any of the securities represented by a registered global security, upon receipt of any payment of\nprincipal, interest, other amounts\nor other distribution of underlying securities or other property to holders on that registered global\nsecurity, will immediately credit\nparticipants\u2019 accounts in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in that registered\nglobal security as shown\non the records of the depositary. We and JPMorgan Financial also expect that payments by participants to\nowners of beneficial\ninterests in a registered global security held through participants will be governed by standing customer\ninstructions and customary practices,\nas is now the case with the securities held for the accounts of customers registered in \u201cstreet name,\u201d and\nwill be the responsibility\nof those participants.\n\nGlobal Clearance and Settlement Procedures.You\nwill be required to make your initial payment for the securities in immediately available funds. Secondary\nmarket trading between\nDTC participants will occur in the ordinary way in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in\nimmediately available funds using\nDTC's Same-Day Funds Settlement System, or any successor thereto. Secondary market trading between\nClearstream customers and/or\nEuroclear participants will occur in the ordinary way in accordance with the applicable rules and operating\nprocedures of Clearstream\nand Euroclear and will be settled using the procedures applicable to conventional eurobonds in immediately\navailable funds.\n\nCross-market transfers between persons holding\ndirectly or indirectly through DTC, on the one hand, and directly or indirectly through Clearstream\ncustomers or Euroclear participants,\non the other, will be effected in DTC in accordance with DTC rules on behalf of the relevant European\ninternational clearing system by\na U.S. depositary; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to the\nrelevant European international\nclearing system by the counterparty in such system in accordance with its rules and procedures and within\nits established deadlines (based\non European time). The relevant European international clearing system will, if the transaction meets its\nsettlement requirements,\ndeliver instructions to the U.S. depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by\ndelivering or receiving securities\nin DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement\napplicable to DTC. Clearstream\ncustomers and Euroclear participants may not deliver instructions directly to their respective U.S.\ndepositaries.\n\nInvestors should be aware that they will be able\nto make and receive deliveries, payments and other communications involving the securities through\nClearstream and Euroclear only on days\nwhen those systems are open for business. Those systems may not be open for business on days when banks,\n                                                     37                                                     \nbrokers and other institutions are open for business\nin the United States. In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be problems with completing\ntransactions involving\nClearstream and Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States. U.S. investors who wish to\ntransfer their interests\nin the securities, or to receive or make a payment or delivery of the securities, on a particular day, may\nfind that the transactions\nwill not be performed until the next business day in Luxembourg or Brussels, depending on whether\nClearstream or Euroclear is used.\n\nAlthough DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear have agreed\nto the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of securities among participants of DTC,\nClearstream and Euroclear, they\nare under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures and such procedures may be\ndiscontinued at any time.\n\nIssuance of Definitive Securities. If\nthe depositary for any of these securities represented by a registered global security is at any time\nunwilling or unable to continue\nas depositary or ceases to be either a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\nand any other applicable statute\nor regulation or a foreign clearing agency regulated by a foreign financial authority as defined in Section\n3(a)(52) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, including, without limitation, Clearstream and Euroclear, and a successor depositary\nregistered as a clearing agency\nunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is not appointed by us or JPMorgan Financial, as the case may be,\nwithin 90 days, we or JPMorgan\nFinancial, as applicable, will issue securities in definitive form in exchange for the registered global\nsecurity that had been held by\nthe depositary. In addition, the Indenture permits us and JPMorgan Financial, as the case may be, at any\ntime and in our or\nJPMorgan Financial\u2019s sole discretion to decide not to have any of the securities issued under it represented\nby one or more registered\nglobal securities. However, The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York has advised us and JPMorgan\nFinancial that, under\nits current practices, it would notify its participants of our or JPMorgan Financial\u2019s request, but will\nonly withdraw beneficial\ninterests from the global securities at the request of each DTC participant. We or JPMorgan Financial, as\nthe case may be,\nwill issue securities in definitive form in exchange for the registered global security or all the\nsecurities representing those securities. Any\nsecurities issued in definitive form in exchange for a registered global security will be registered in the\nname or names that the depositary\ngives to the trustee, warrant agent, unit agent or other relevant agent of ours, JPMorgan Financial\u2019s or\ntheirs. It is\nexpected that the depositary\u2019s instructions will be based upon directions received by the depositary from\nparticipants with respect\nto ownership of beneficial interests in the registered global security that had been held by the depositary.\n\nForm of Securities Included in Units\n\nThe form of any warrant included in a unit will\ncorrespond to the form of the unit and of any other security included in that unit.\n                                                     38                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                            Plan of Distribution                                            \n                                          (Conflicts of Interest)                                           \nWe may sell our debt securities, warrants, units\nor purchase contracts and JPMorgan Financial may sell its debt securities or warrants fully and\nunconditionally guaranteed by us:\n                      \n  \u00b7  through agents;  \n                      \n                            \n  \u00b7  through underwriters;  \n                            \n                           \n  \u00b7  through dealers; and  \n                           \n                                                                                      \n  \u00b7  directly to purchasers, any of whom may be customers of, engage in transactions  \n     with, or perform services for, us in the ordinary course of business.            \n                                                                                      \nIf we or JPMorgan Financial offer and sell securities\nthrough an agent, that agent will be named, and any commissions payable to that agent by us or JPMorgan\nFinancial, as applicable, will\nbe set forth in the prospectus supplement. Any agent will be acting on a best efforts basis. An agent may be\ndeemed\nto be an underwriter under the federal securities laws.\n\nIf underwriters are used in the sale of the securities,\nwe or JPMorgan Financial, as applicable, will sign an underwriting agreement with them. The underwriting\nagreement will provide\nthat the obligations of the underwriters are subject to certain conditions and that the underwriters will be\nobligated to purchase all\nof the securities if any are purchased. Underwriters will buy the securities for their own account and may\nresell them from\ntime to time in one or more transactions, including negotiated transactions, at fixed public offering prices\nor at varying prices determined\nat the time of sale. Securities may be offered to the public either through underwriting syndicates\nrepresented by managing\nunderwriters or directly by the managing underwriters. The name of the managing underwriter or underwriters,\nas well as any\nother underwriters, and the terms of the transaction, including compensation of the underwriters and\ndealers, if any, will be set forth\nin the prospectus supplement. The underwriters named in the prospectus supplement will be the only\nunderwriters for the securities\noffered by that prospectus supplement.\n\nIf a dealer is utilized in the sale of securities,\nwe or JPMorgan Financial, as applicable, will sell those securities to the dealer, as principal or as agent\nfor its customers. The\ndealer may resell those securities to the public at varying prices to be determined by the dealer at the\ntime of resale. A\ndealer may be deemed to be an underwriter of those securities under the federal securities laws. The name of\nthe dealer and\nthe terms of the transaction will be set forth in the prospectus supplement.\n\nOur and JPMorgan Financial\u2019s net proceeds\nwill be the purchase price in the case of sales to a dealer, the public offering price less discount in the\ncase of sales to an underwriter\nor the purchase price less commission in the case of sales through an agent \u2014 in each case, less other\nexpenses attributable to\nissuance and distribution.\n\nIn order to facilitate the offering of these securities,\nthe underwriters may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of these\nsecurities or any other securities\nthe prices of which may be used to determine payments on these securities. Specifically, the underwriters\nmay sell more securities\nthan they are obligated to purchase in connection with the offering, creating a short position for their own\naccounts. A short\nsale is covered if the short position is no greater than the number or amount of securities available for\npurchase by the underwriters\nunder any overallotment option. The underwriters can close out a covered short sale by exercising the\noverallotment option\nor purchasing these securities in the open market. In determining the source of securities to close out a\ncovered short sale,\nthe underwriters will consider, among other things, the open market price of these securities compared to\nthe price available under the\noverallotment option. The underwriters may also sell these securities or any other securities in excess of\nthe overallotment\noption, creating a naked short position. The underwriters must close out any naked short position by\npurchasing securities\nin the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned\nthat there may be\ndownward pressure on the price of these securities in the open market after pricing that could adversely\naffect investors who purchase\nin the offering.\n                                                     39                                                     \nAs an additional means of facilitating the offering,\nthe underwriters may bid for, and purchase, these securities or any other securities in the open market to\nstabilize the price of these\nsecurities or of any other securities. Finally, in any offering of the securities through a syndicate of\nunderwriters, the\nunderwriting syndicate may also reclaim selling concessions allowed to an underwriter or a dealer for\ndistributing these securities in\nthe offering, if the syndicate repurchases previously distributed securities to cover syndicate short\npositions or to stabilize the price\nof these securities. Any of these activities may raise or maintain the market price of these securities\nabove independent market\nlevels or prevent or retard a decline in the market price of these securities. The underwriters are not\nrequired to engage\nin these activities, and may end any of these activities at any time.\n\nWe and JPMorgan Financial may agree to indemnify\nagents, underwriters or dealers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the securities\nlaws, or to contribute to payments\nthat agents, underwriters or dealers may be required to make. Agents, underwriters and dealers may be\ncustomers of, engage\nin transactions with or perform services for, us or JPMorgan Financial in the ordinary course of business.\n\nWe and JPMorgan Financial may directly solicit\noffers to purchase securities, and we or JPMorgan Financial may sell securities directly to institutional\ninvestors or others who may\nbe deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the securities laws. The terms of any such sales will be\ndescribed in the\nprospectus supplement.\n\nWe or JPMorgan Financial may enter into derivative\nor other hedging transactions with financial institutions. These financial institutions may in turn engage\nin sales of securities\nto hedge their position, deliver this prospectus in connection with some or all of those sales and use the\nsecurities covered by this\nprospectus to close out any loan of securities or short position created in connection with those sales. We\nor JPMorgan Financial\nmay also sell securities short using this prospectus and deliver securities covered by this prospectus to\nclose out any loan of securities\nor such short positions, or loan or pledge securities to financial institutions that in turn may sell the\nsecurities using this prospectus. We\nor JPMorgan Financial may pledge or grant a security interest in some or all of the securities covered by\nthis prospectus to support a\nderivative or hedging position or other obligation and, if we or JPMorgan Financial default in the\nperformance of our or JPMorgan Financial\u2019s\nobligations, the pledgees or secured parties may offer and sell the securities from time to time pursuant to\nthis prospectus.\n\nWe or JPMorgan Financial may loan or pledge securities\nto a financial institution or other third party that in turn may sell the securities using this prospectus.\nSuch financial\ninstitution or third party may transfer its short position to investors in our or JPMorgan Financial\u2019s\nsecurities or in connection\nwith a simultaneous offering of other securities offered by this prospectus.\n\nIf so indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement,\none or more firms, including J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, which we refer to as \u201cremarketing firms,\u201d may also\noffer or sell\nthe securities in connection with a remarketing arrangement upon their purchase. Remarketing firms may act\nas principals for\ntheir own accounts or as agents for us. These remarketing firms will offer or sell the securities in\naccordance with a redemption\nor repurchase pursuant to the terms of the securities. The prospectus supplement will identify any\nremarketing firm and the\nterms of its agreement, if any, with us or JPMorgan Financial and will describe the remarketing firm\u2019s\ncompensation. Remarketing\nfirms may be deemed to be underwriters in connection with the securities they remarket.

Among other factors, the fiduciary should\nconsider whether\nthe investment would satisfy the prudence and diversification requirements of ERISA and would be consistent\nwith the documents and instruments\ngoverning the ERISA Plan.\n\nSection 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), prohibit ERISA Plans, as well as plans (including individual\nretirement accounts\nand Keogh plans) subject to Section 4975 of the Code (together with ERISA Plans, \u201cPlans\u201d), from engaging in\ncertain transactions\ninvolving the \u201cplan assets\u201d with persons who are \u201cparties in interest\u201d under ERISA or \u201cdisqualified persons\u201d\nunder Section 4975 of the Code (in either case, referred to herein as \u201cParties in Interest\u201d) with respect to\nsuch Plans. As\na result of our business, we, and our current and future affiliates (including JPMorgan Financial), may be\nParties in Interest with respect\nto many Plans. Where we (or one of our affiliates, including JPMorgan Financial) are a Party in Interest\nwith respect to a\nPlan (either directly or by reason of our ownership interests in our directly or indirectly owned\nsubsidiaries), the purchase and holding\nof the securities by or on behalf of the Plan could be a prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA\nand/or Section 4975 of the\nCode, unless statutory or administrative exemptive relief were available.\n\nIn this regard, certain prohibited transaction\nclass exemptions (\u201cPTCEs\u201d) issued by the U.S. Department of Labor may provide exemptive relief for direct or\nindirect prohibited\ntransactions resulting from the purchase or holding of the securities. Those class exemptions are PTCE 96-23\n(for certain transactions\ndetermined by in-house asset managers), PTCE 95-60 (for certain transactions involving insurance company\ngeneral accounts), PTCE 91-38\n(for certain transactions involving bank collective investment funds), PTCE 90-1 (for certain transactions\ninvolving insurance company\nseparate accounts) and PTCE 84-14 (for certain transactions determined by independent qualified asset\nmanagers). In addition,\nERISA Section 408(b)(17) and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code may provide a limited exemption for the\npurchase and sale of the securities\nand related lending transactions, provided that neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its\naffiliates have or exercise\nany discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of the\nPlan involved in the transaction\nand provided further that the Plan pays no more, and receives no less, than adequate consideration in\nconnection with the transaction\n(the so-called \u201cservice provider exemption\u201d). There can be no assurance\n                                                     42                                                     \nthat any of these statutory or class exemptions will\nbe available with respect to transactions involving the securities.\n\nAccordingly, the securities may not be purchased\nor held by any Plan, any entity whose underlying assets include \u201cplan assets\u201d by reason of any Plan\u2019s\ninvestment in\nthe entity (a \u201cPlan Asset Entity\u201d) or any person investing \u201cplan assets\u201d of any Plan, unless such purchaser\nor\nholder is eligible for the exemptive relief available under PTCE 96-23, 95-60, 91-38, 90-1 or 84-14 or the\nservice-provider exemption\nor there is some other basis on which the purchase and holding of the securities will not constitute or\nresult in a non-exempt prohibited\ntransaction under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. Each purchaser or holder of the securities or any\ninterest therein will\nbe deemed to have represented by its purchase or holding of the securities that (a) it is not a Plan or a\nPlan Asset Entity and its purchase\nand holding of the securities is not made on behalf of or with \u201cplan assets\u201d of any Plan or a Plan Asset\nEntity or (b) its\npurchase, holding and subsequent disposition of the securities will not constitute or result in a non-exempt\nprohibited transaction under\nSection 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.\n\nIn this regard, certain governmental plans (as\ndefined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans\n(as described in Section 4(b)(4)\nof ERISA) (collectively, \u201cNon-ERISA Arrangements\u201d) are not subject to the fiduciary responsibility or\nprohibited transaction\nrules of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, but may be subject to similar rules under other applicable laws\nor regulations (\u201cSimilar\nLaws\u201d). Accordingly, each such purchaser or holder of the securities shall be required to represent and be\ndeemed to\nhave represented by its purchase or holding of the securities that its purchase, holding and subsequent\ndisposition of the securities\nwill not constitute or result in a violation of any applicable Similar Laws.\n\nDue to the complexity of these rules, it is particularly\nimportant that fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing the securities on behalf of or with \u201cplan\nassets\u201d of any\nPlan, Plan Asset Entity or Non-ERISA Arrangement consult with their counsel regarding the relevant\nprovisions of ERISA, the Code or applicable\nSimilar Laws and the availability of exemptive relief under PTCE 96-23, 95-60, 91-38, 90-1, 84-14, the\nservice provider exemption or some\nother basis on which the acquisition and holding of the securities will not constitute or result in a non-\nexempt prohibited transaction\nunder ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation of any applicable Similar Laws.\n\nThe securities are contractual financial instruments. The\nfinancial exposure provided by the securities is not a substitute or proxy for, and is not intended as a\nsubstitute or proxy for, individualized\ninvestment management or advice for the benefit of any purchaser or holder of the securities. The securities\nhave not been\ndesigned and will not be administered in a manner intended to reflect the individualized needs and\nobjectives of any purchaser or holder\nof the securities.\n\nEach purchaser or holder of any securities acknowledges\nand agrees that:\n                                                                                                            \n       the purchaser or holder or its fiduciary has made and shall make all investment decisions for the    \n       purchaser or holder and the purchaser                                                                \n       or holder has not relied and shall not rely in any way upon us or our affiliates (including          \n       JPMorgan Financial) to act as a fiduciary                                                            \n  (i)  or adviser of the purchaser or holder with respect to (A) the design and terms of the securities,    \n       (B) the purchaser or holder\u2019s                                                                        \n       investment in the securities, or (C) the exercise of or failure to exercise any rights the           \n       purchaser or holder or we or any of our affiliates                                                   \n       (including JPMorgan Financial) has under or with respect to the securities;                          \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        we and our affiliates (including JPMorgan Financial) have acted and will act solely for our own     \n        accounts in connection with (A) all                                                                 \n  (ii)  transactions relating to the securities and (B) all hedging transactions in connection with our or  \n        our affiliates\u2019 (including JPMorgan                                                                 \n        Financial\u2019s) obligations under the securities;                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n         any and all assets and positions relating to hedging transactions by us or our affiliates          \n  (iii)  (including JPMorgan Financial) are assets                                                          \n         and positions of those entities and are not assets and positions held for the benefit of the       \n         purchaser or holder;                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  (iv)  our and JPMorgan Financial\u2019s interests are adverse to the interests of the purchaser or holder;     \n        and                                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \n                                                     43                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n       neither we nor any of our affiliates (including JPMorgan Financial) is a fiduciary or adviser of     \n       the purchaser or holder in connection                                                                \n  (v)  with any such assets, positions or transactions, and any information that we or any of our           \n       affiliates (including JPMorgan Financial) may                                                        \n       provide is not intended to be impartial investment advice.                                           \n                                                                                                            \nEach purchaser and holder of the securities has\nexclusive responsibility for ensuring that its purchase, holding and subsequent disposition of the\nsecurities does not violate the fiduciary\nor prohibited transaction rules of ERISA, the Code or any applicable Similar Laws.

The by-laws\nspecify that the right to indemnification so provided is a contract right, set forth certain procedural and\nevidentiary standards applicable\nto the enforcement of a claim under the by-laws and entitle the persons to be indemnified to receive payment\nin advance of any expenses\nincurred in connection with such Proceeding, consistent with the provisions of applicable law, as from time\nto time in effect. Such\nprovisions, however, are intended to be in furtherance and not in limitation of the general right to\nindemnification provided in the by-laws,\nwhich right of indemnification and of advancement of expenses is not exclusive of any other rights to which\na person seeking indemnification\nmay otherwise be entitled, under any statute, by-law, agreement, vote or otherwise.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s by-laws also provide that\nJPMorgan Chase may enter into contracts with any director, officer or employee of JPMorgan Chase in\nfurtherance of the indemnification\nprovisions in the by-laws, as well as create a trust fund, grant a security interest or use other means\n(including, without limitation,\na letter of credit) to ensure payment of amounts indemnified.\n\nLastly, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s by-laws also provide\nthat any repeal or modification of the indemnification rights provided in the by-laws shall not adversely\naffect any right or protection\nthereunder of any person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or\nmodification.\n\nThe foregoing statements are subject to the detailed\nprovisions of Section 145 of the DGCL and the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of JPMorgan Chase.\n                                                    II-2                                                    \nJPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC\n\nPursuant to Section 18-108 of the Delaware Limited\nLiability Company Act, a Delaware limited liability company is empowered to indemnify and hold harmless any\nmember or manager or other\npersons from and against all claims and demands whatsoever.\n\nThe limited liability company agreement of JPMorgan\nChase Financial Company LLC (\u201cJPMorgan Financial\u201d) provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by the\nlaws of the State\nof Delaware, no member, manager or officer shall be liable to JPMorgan Financial or any other member for any\nloss, damage or claim incurred\nby reason of any act or omission performed or omitted by such member, manager or officer in good faith on\nbehalf of JPMorgan Financial\nand in a manner reasonably believed to be within the scope of the authority conferred on such member,\nmanager or officer by the limited\nliability company agreement.\n\nJPMorgan Financial\u2019s limited liability company\nagreement provides that each person (and the heirs, executors or administrators of such person) who was or\nis a party or is threatened\nto be made a party to, or is involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding,\nwhether civil, criminal, administrative\nor investigative (hereinafter a \u201cproceeding\u201d), by reason of the fact that such person is or was a member,\nmanager or officer,\nor is or was serving at the request of JPMorgan Financial as a manager, director, officer, or trustee of\nanother company, corporation\nor of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee\nbenefit plan (hereinafter\nan \u201cindemnitee\u201d), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a\nmember, manager, director,\nofficer or trustee, or in any other capacity while serving as a member, manager, director, officer, or\ntrustee, shall be indemnified and\nheld harmless by JPMorgan Financial to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Delaware for\nmembers, managers and officers\nof limited liability companies formed under the laws of the State of Delaware, as then in effect, against\nall expense, liability and loss\n(including attorneys\u2019 fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in\nsettlement) reasonably incurred\nor suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith;
