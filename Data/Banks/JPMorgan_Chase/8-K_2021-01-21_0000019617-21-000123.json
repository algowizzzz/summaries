(the \u201cFirm\u201d) announced that the independent members of the\nBoard of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) approved the total compensation for 2020 for Mr.\nJames Dimon, CEO, in the amount of $31,500,000, which is unchanged from last year.\nMr. Dimon\u2019s total compensation includes an annual base salary of $1,500,000 and\nperformance-based variable incentive compensation of $30,000,000. $5,000,000 of\nthe variable incentive compensation will be delivered in cash and the remaining\n$25,000,000 will be delivered in the form of Performance Share Units (\"PSUs\"). The\namounts of base salary, cash incentive, and PSUs remain unchanged from last year.\nThe key features of the PSU program are also consistent with last year, including\nthe financial metric (return on tangible common equity 1 - \"ROTCE\") with absolute\nand relative performance goals, payout levels, vesting and hold requirements, as\nwell as clawback and recovery provisions 2 .\n\nIn determining Mr. Dimon's compensation, the independent members of the Board took\ninto account the Firm's strong performance in 2020 and over the long term, across\nfour broad dimensions: Business Results; Risk, Controls & Conduct;\nClient/Customer/Stakeholder; and Teamwork & Leadership.\n\nAmid the unprecedented health and economic consequences of COVID-19, under Mr.\nDimon's stewardship, the Firm continued to provide uninterrupted service to its\nclients and customers, while supporting and providing a safe work environment for\nits employees and helping those communities hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. In\n2020 the Firm reported record revenue of $122.9 billion 1 and net income of $29.1\nbillion, or $8.88 per share, with ROTCE of 14%, while adding $12.2 billion of\ncredit reserves during the year to absorb potential future losses and returning\n$16.3 billion of capital to shareholders. The Firm maintained its $0.90 per share\nquarterly dividend and suspended net share repurchases from March 15, 2020 through\nthe end of the year to retain capital and reinforce its fortress balance sheet.\n\nThe Firm ended the year with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 13.1% (vs. 12.4% at\nthe beginning of the year), capital above $200 billion and $1.4 trillion of cash\nand marketable securities, providing it with meaningful capacity to support\nclients and further invest in its business and communities. During 2020 the Firm\nraised over $2 trillion 3 of credit and capital for its consumer and institutional\nclients around the world, which includes nonprofits and U.S. government entities,\nincluding states, municipalities, hospitals and universities.
