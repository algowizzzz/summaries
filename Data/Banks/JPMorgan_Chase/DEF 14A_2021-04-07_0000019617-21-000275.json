Burke, Our Lead\nIndependent Director\n                                                                     April 7, 2021\nDear fellow shareholders:\n\nAs we reflect and consider future\nplans, we are keenly focused on the\nlessons from 2020. A year into the\npandemic, COVID-19 has affected many\nof us personally, the world is still\nfighting to combat the spread, and we\nare only beginning to address its\neconomic fallout. Events brought into\nsharp focus societal gaps, including\nwith respect to racial equity and\naccess to health care. Yet, throughout\n2020, as unprecedented events\nunfolded, we were there to support our\nclients and customers, employees, and\ncommunities. We did this by staying\ntrue to our fundamental business\nprinciples and commitment to building\nlong-term value for our shareholders.\n\nWhile substantial work lies ahead, we\nare pleased with how we have responded\nthus far. The Firm\u2019s performance\ndemonstrated the strength of our\ncomplete, global, and diversified\nbusiness model. Despite the\nchallenging environment, we generated\nrecord revenue, while adding to our\ncredit reserves to be prepared for\nfuture challenges. We gained market\nshare in our businesses, demonstrated\nstrong expense discipline, continued\nto achieve high customer satisfaction\nscores, maintained a fortress balance\nsheet, and paid dividends and returned\nexcess capital to shareholders through\nshare repurchases.\n\nThe Board recognizes that continued\nstrong performance requires vigilant\nfocus on our core business principles\n\u2013 exceptional client service;\noperational excellence; integrity,\nfairness and responsibility; and a\ngreat team and culture. Through our\noversight of the Firm\u2019s strategic\nplanning process, we hold management\naccountable for abiding by these\nprinciples, while navigating change\nand driving innovation. This includes\nthoughtful investments in technology\nand acquisitions that will enhance our\nproduct offerings, and deepen\nengagement with clients, customers,\nand communities in which we live and\nwork. In 2020, we particularly\nemphasized innovations to expand\ndigital banking capabilities for\npeople navigating the new remote\nenvironment. We also emphasized the\nneed to support our clients and\ncustomers, protect employees, and\nassist our communities while managing\nrisks associated with the pandemic. To\nprovide close oversight, the Board met\nmore often, received more frequent\nupdates, and paid particular attention\nto how circumstances informed the\nFirm\u2019s overall strategy.\n\nWith respect to our team, success is\nnot possible without a first-rate\nmanagement team. Identifying,\ndeveloping, and nurturing senior\nleaders is one of the Board\u2019s highest\npriorities. To set ourselves up for\nsuccess, your Board\n\nregularly reviews succession planning\nfor the CEO and the Operating\nCommittee. We also meet with members\nof the Operating Committee and other\nsenior leaders. This year, the Firm\nexpanded the Operating Committee to\ninclude the heads of several of our\nlargest businesses, to give them\ngreater responsibility and broader\nexposure to firmwide issues. This\nexpansion has also given the Board\nmore opportunities to get to know a\nbroad range of leaders who currently,\nand in the future will, execute the\nfirm\u2019s strategy and enhance our strong\nculture.\n\nThe Board also knows that our success\nis driven by the success of all our\npeople and our reputation as a firm.\nOur culture is built on our core\nvalues of respect, integrity and\ninclusion, and we are focused on being\nan employer of choice for all talent.\nWe are committed to hiring and\nretaining employees from all races,\nethnicities, genders, sexual\norientations, abilities, backgrounds,\nexperiences and locations. In\naddition, this year, the Firm\nannounced that we would invest $30\nbillion over the next five years to\nadvance racial equity and help combat\nsystemic racism within the communities\nin which we work. Management has\ndetailed plans on how the firm will\nleverage its expertise in business,\npolicy, and philanthropy to meet these\ngoals. We have also developed a\nframework to hold management\naccountable for meeting these goals.\n\nWe also continued to take important\nsteps to promote sustainability and\nreduce our environmental impact. Our\n2020 initiatives included a commitment\nto align certain financing activities\nwith the goals of the Paris Agreement,\nfinancing of more than $220 billion\nfor transactions that advance the\nUnited Nations Sustainable Development\ngoals and completion of the Firm\u2019s\ninaugural green bond issuance of $1\nbillion.\n\nYour dedicated directors are committed\nto these objectives and to maintaining\na vital Board in the future. This\nyear, we remained focused on our\nBoard\u2019s future. In December, we were\nfortunate to add Phebe Novakovic,\nChairman and CEO of General Dynamics,\nto our Board and are pleased to\nnominate her for election by\nshareholders at the annual meeting.\nShe brings to the Board an impressive\ncombination of skills, experience and\npersonal qualities that will serve our\nshareholders, the Firm, and the Board\nwell.\n\nWe would also like to take this\nopportunity to again thank Lee\nRaymond, who retired from the Board in\nDecember 2020. We benefited greatly\nfrom his insights and contributions as\na director and a trusted advisor. We\nall\n\nTable of Contents\n\nshare his optimism about JPMorgan\u2019s\nfuture and Steve Burke is honored to\nsucceed Lee as Lead Independent\nDirector in working with our Board and\nmanagement to deliver on that.\n\nWe look forward to continuing to\ndeliver value to our customers,\nshareholders, and stakeholders.

How we think about pay decisions\n\nThe Firm\u2019s How We Do Business Principles (\"Business Principles\") and strategic\nframework form the basis of our Operating Committee (\"OC\") members\u2019 strategic\npriorities. The Compensation & Management Development Committee (\"CMDC\")\nreferences those strategic priorities and the Firm\u2019s compensation philosophy to\nassess OC members\u2019 performance and to determine their respective total\ncompensation levels and pay mix.\n\n2. How we performed against our business strategy\n\nWe continued to deliver strong multi-year financial performance, invest in our\nfuture, strengthen our risk and control environment, and reinforce our culture and\nvalues, including our long-standing commitment to serve our customers, employees\nand communities, and conduct business in a responsible way to drive inclusive\ngrowth.\n\n3. How performance determined pay in 2020\n\nIn determining OC member pay, the CMDC took into account performance across four\nbroad performance dimensions: Business Results; Risk, Controls & Conduct;\nClient/Customer/Stakeholder; and Teamwork & Leadership. CEO pay is strongly\naligned to the Firm\u2019s short-, medium- and long-term performance, with\napproximately 83% of the CEO\u2019s variable pay deferred into equity, of which 100% is\nin at-risk performance share units (\"PSUs\"). Other NEO pay is also strongly\naligned to Firm and line of business (\"LOB\") performance, with a majority of\nvariable pay deferred into equity, of which 50% is in at-risk PSUs.\n                                                 \n  Disciplined performance assessment process to  \n  determine pay                                  \n                                                 \nThe CMDC uses a balanced discretionary approach to determine annual compensation,\nwhich includes a disciplined assessment of performance against the aforementioned\nfour broad dimensions over a sustained period of time. For 2020, compensation\nawarded to the OC members also represents a balance between the outstanding\nefforts and performance of the Firm during COVID-19 with the impact of the\npandemic on the Firm's other stakeholders.\n\nThe table below summarizes the salary and incentive compensation awarded to our\nNEOs for 2020 performance.\n

Given the nature and\nbroad scope of the products and\nservices provided by the Firm, there\nare from time to time ordinary course\nof business transactions between the\nFirm and a director, his or her\nimmediate family members, or principal\nbusiness affiliations. These may\ninclude, among other relationships:\nextensions of credit; provision of\nother financial and financial advisory\nproducts and services; business\ntransactions for property or services;\nand charitable contributions made by\nthe JPMorgan Chase Foundation or the\nFirm to a nonprofit organization of\nwhich a director is an officer. The\nBoard reviews these relationships to\nassess their materiality and determine\nif any such relationship would impair\nthe independence and judgment of the\nrelevant director. The Board\nconsidered:\n\n\u2022 Consumer credit: credit cards issued\nto directors Bammann, Crown, Flynn,\nHobson, Neal, Novakovic and their\nimmediate family members\n\n\u2022 Wholesale credit: extensions of\ncredit and other financial and\nfinancial advisory products and\nservices provided to: Berkshire\nHathaway Inc., for which Mr. Combs is\nan Investment Officer, and its\nsubsidiaries; Henry Crown and Company,\nfor which Mr. Crown is Chairman and\nChief Executive Officer, and other\nCrown family-owned entities; Ariel\nInvestments, LLC, for which Ms. Hobson\nis Co-Chief Executive Officer and\nPresident, and its subsidiaries and\nfunds; certain entities wholly-owned by\nMs. Hobson\u2019s spouse; and General\nDynamics Corporation, for which Ms.\nNovakovic is Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer, and its subsidiaries\n\n\u2022 Goods and services: commercial office\nspace leased by the Firm from\nsubsidiaries of companies in which Mr.\nCrown and members of his immediate\nfamily have indirect ownership\ninterests; purchases from Berkshire\nHathaway subsidiaries of private\naviation services, professional\nservices related to the Firm\u2019s\ncorporate-owned aircraft, and\nmerchandising fixtures for retail\nbranches; and purchases from General\nDynamics subsidiaries of corporate\naircraft and associated maintenance\nservices and parts\n\nThe Board, having reviewed the relevant\nrelationships between the Firm and each\ndirector and nominee, determined, in\naccordance with the NYSE\u2019s listing\nstandards and the Firm\u2019s independence\nstandards, that each non-management\ndirector (Linda B. Bammann, Stephen B.\nBurke, Todd A. Combs, James S. Crown,\nTimothy P. Flynn, Mellody Hobson,\nMichael A. Neal, Phebe N. Novakovic and\nVirginia M. Rometty) had only\nimmaterial relationships with JPMorgan\nChase and accordingly is independent.\nJames A. Bell and Laban P. Jackson,\nJr., who retired in May 2020, and Lee\nR. Raymond who retired in December\n2020, had only immaterial relationships\nwith JPMorgan Chase and accordingly\nwere independent directors.\n\nAll directors who served on the Audit\nand Compensation & Management\nDevelopment Committees of the Board\nwere also determined to meet the\nadditional independence and qualitative\ncriteria of the NYSE listing standards\napplicable to directors serving on\nthose committees.

For further information, see page 112. All candidates recommended to\nthe Governance Committee are evaluated based on the same standards.\n\nRecent Board Refreshment\n\nSince our last annual shareholders meeting, the Board, using the process described\nabove and taking into account, among other factors, shareholders\u2019 interest in\nboard refreshment and adding directors with experience in technology and\nleadership of large, complex organizations, elected Phebe N. Novakovic to the\nBoard effective December 2020. Ms. Novakovic has been among a select group of\nindividuals considered as part of the Governance Committee\u2019s evaluation of\nprospective Board members in recent years and has been an active participant at\nFirm events, including as a featured speaker. Based on her background and the\nsupport of several directors familiar with Ms. Novakovic's diligence, efforts and\neffectiveness, Mr. Dimon suggested that the Governance Committee consider Ms.\nNovakovic as a prospective candidate. After members of the Board met with Ms.\nNovakovic and the Governance Committee reviewed her qualifications, as well as her\nconstructive personal attributes and her independence, Ms. Novakovic was\nrecommended for election to the Board. For information on Ms. Novakovic\u2019s\nqualifications, see page 18.\n                                                      \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.    20    2021 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                               \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE |ELECTION OF DIRECTORS  \n                                               \n                                                                                \n  Director nominees    Board governance    Board oversight    Board engagement  \n                                                                                \nDirector re-nomination\n\nThe Governance Committee also oversees the re-nomination process. In determining\nwhether to re-nominate a director for election at our annual meeting, the\nGovernance Committee reviews each director, considering:\n\nRetirement Policy\n\nOur Governance Principles require a non-management director to offer not to stand\nfor re-election in each calendar year following a year in which the director will\nbe 72 or older. The Board (other than the affected director) then determines\nwhether to accept the offer. The Board believes that the appropriate mix of\nexperience and fresh perspectives is an important consideration in assessing Board\ncomposition, and the best interests of the Firm are served by taking advantage of\nall available talent, and evaluations as to director candidacy should not be\ndetermined solely on age.\n\nNone of our director nominees will be 72 or older this year.\n\nFor a description of the annual Board and committee self-assessment process, see\npage 27.\n                                                      \n  2021 PROXY STATEMENT    21    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                               \n  ELECTION OF DIRECTORS| CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                                               \n                                                                                \n  Director nominees    Board governance    Board oversight    Board engagement  \n                                                                                \n2.

The Board has\nseparated the Chairman and CEO\npositions in the past and may do so\nagain in the future if it believes that\ndoing so would be in the best interest\nof the Firm and its shareholders.\n\nBased on consideration of the factors\ndescribed on the following page, our\nBoard has determined that combining the\nroles of Chairman and CEO is the most\neffective leadership structure for the\nBoard at this time. The Board believes\nthe present structure provides the Firm\nand the Board with strong leadership,\nappropriate independent oversight of\nmanagement, continuity of experience\nthat complements ongoing Board\nrefreshment, and the ability to\ncommunicate their business and strategy\nto shareholders, clients, employees,\nregulators and the public in a single\nvoice.\n\nAs required by the Firm\u2019s Governance\nPrinciples when the role of the\nChairman is combined with that of the\nCEO, the independent directors\nappointed a Lead Independent Director.\nOur Lead Independent Director focuses\non the Board\u2019s priorities and\nprocesses, facilitates independent\noversight of management and promotes\nopen dialogue among the independent\ndirectors during Board meetings, at\n\nexecutive sessions without the presence\nof the CEO and between Board meetings.\n\nIn September 2020, the independent\ndirectors of the Board unanimously\nelected Stephen B. Burke as Lead\nIndependent Director, succeeding Lee R.\nRaymond, effective January 1, 2021. In\nelecting Mr. Burke as Lead Independent\nDirector, the Board confirmed its March\n2020 determination that its leadership\nstructure, with a combined CEO and\nChairman and Lead Independent Director,\nremains in the best interests of the\nFirm and its shareholders. The\ndirectors also considered the Board\u2019s\nongoing succession planning for the\nLead Independent Director, the skills\nand attributes required of the role,\nand Mr. Burke\u2019s background and\nexperience, including his in-depth\nknowledge of the Firm and its\nbusinesses, strong interpersonal\nskills, demonstrated independent\njudgment and financial and operational\ntrack record as CEO of NBCUniversal.\nMr. Raymond announced his resignation\nfrom the Board in December 2020,\neffective at the end of the year.\n                                                      \n  JPMORGAN CHASE &

Each director attended 75% or\nmore of the total meetings of the Board\nand the committees on which he or she\nserved in 2020.\n\nCommittees of the Board\n\nA significant portion of our Board\u2019s\noversight responsibilities is carried\nout through its five independent,\nprincipal standing committees: Audit\nCommittee, CMDC, Governance Committee,\nPublic Responsibility Committee (\"PRC\")\nand Risk Committee. Allocating\nresponsibilities among committees\nallows more in-depth attention devoted\nto the Board\u2019s oversight of the\nbusiness and affairs of the Firm.\n\nCommittees meet regularly in\nconjunction with scheduled Board\nmeetings and hold additional meetings\nas needed. Each committee reviews\nreports from senior management and\nreports its actions to, and discusses\nits recommendations with, the full\nBoard.\n\nEach principal standing committee\noperates pursuant to a written charter.\nThese charters are available on our\nwebsite at jpmorganchase.com/about/gove\nrnance/board-committees. Each charter\nis reviewed at least annually as part\nof the Board\u2019s and each respective\ncommittee\u2019s self-assessment.\n\nThe Governance Committee annually\nreviews the allocation of\nresponsibility among the committees as\npart of the Board and committee self-\nassessment. For more information about\nthe self-assessment process, see page\n27.\n\nEach committee has oversight of\nspecific areas of business activities\nand risk, and engages with the Firm\u2019s\nsenior management responsible for those\nareas.\n\nAll committee chairs are appointed at\nleast annually by our Board. Committee\nchairs are responsible for:\n\n\u2022 Calling meetings of their committees\n\n\u2022 Approving agendas for their committee\nmeetings\n\n\u2022 Presiding at meetings of their\ncommittees\n\n\u2022 Serving as a liaison between\ncommittee members and the Board, and\nbetween committee members and senior\nmanagement, including the CEO\n\n\u2022 Working directly with the senior\nmanagement responsible for committee\nmandates\n\nThe Board determined each member of the\nAudit Committee in 2020 (Timothy P.\nFlynn, Todd A. Combs, Michael A. Neal\nand Phebe N. Novakovic) to be an audit\ncommittee financial expert in\naccordance with the definition\nestablished by the SEC, and that Ms.\nBammann, the chair of the Risk\nCommittee, has experience

When the\nFirm extends a consumer or wholesale\nloan, advises customers and clients on\ntheir investment decisions, makes\nmarkets in securities or offers other\nproducts or services, the Firm takes on\nsome degree of risk. The Firm\u2019s overall\nobjective is to manage its businesses,\nand the associated risks, in a manner\nthat balances serving the interests of\nits clients, customers and investors\nand protects the safety and soundness\nof the Firm.\n\nThe key risk areas of the Firm are\nmanaged on a Firmwide basis. Certain\nrisks, such as strategic risk, are\noverseen by the full Board. Board\ncommittees support the Board\u2019s\noversight responsibility by overseeing\nthe risk categories related to such\ncommittee\u2019s specific area of focus.\n\nCommittee chairs report significant\nmatters discussed at committee meetings\nto the full Board. Issues escalated to\nthe full Board may be dealt with in\nseveral ways, as appropriate: oversight\nof risk may remain with the particular\nprincipal standing committee of the\nBoard, the Board may establish or\ndirect a Specific Purpose Committee to\noversee management\u2019s addressing of such\nrisk matters, or the Board may ask\nmanagement to present more frequently\nto the full Board on the issue.\n\nConduct risk is the risk that any\naction or inaction by an employee or\nemployees could lead to unfair client\nor customer outcomes, impact the\nintegrity of the markets in which the\nFirm operates or compromise the Firm\u2019s\nreputation. Conduct risk is overseen by\neach of the five principal standing\ncommittees of the Board, with each\ncommittee overseeing conduct risks\nwithin that committee's scope of\nresponsibility. Each LOB and Corporate\nFunction is accountable for identifying\nand managing its conduct risk to\npromote a culture consistent with the\nBusiness Principles. The full set of\nBusiness Principles is included in \u201cHow\nWe Do\n                                                      \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.    28    2021 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                               \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE |ELECTION OF DIRECTORS  \n                                               \n                                                                                \n  Director nominees    Board governance    Board oversight    Board engagement  \n                                                                                \nBusiness \u2014 The Report,\u201d which is posted\non our website at\njpmorganchase.com/about/governance.

More specifically, the\nBoard oversees a range of matters\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 the Firm\u2019s governance-related\npolicies and practices;\n\n\u2022 our systems of risk management and\ncontrols;\n\n\u2022 our investment in our employees;\n\n\u2022 the manner in which we serve our\ncustomers and support our communities;\nand\n\n\u2022 how we advance sustainability in our\nbusiness and operations.\n\nIn particular, the Board\u2019s PRC provides\noversight of the Firm\u2019s positions and\npractices on public responsibility\nmatters such as community investment,\nfair lending, consumer practices,\nsustainability and other public policy\nissues that reflect the Firm\u2019s values\nand impact its reputation among all of\nits stakeholders. In the past year, in\naddition to the work of the PRC, the\nBoard members contributed to\ndiscussions regarding the Firm\u2019s\napproach to COVID-19, racial equity and\nclimate change, as discussed on page 6.\n\nThe Firm is committed to being\ntransparent about our approach to and\nperformance on ESG topics. One way we\ndo this is by publishing an annual ESG\nReport, which provides information on\nhow we are addressing the ESG matters\nthat we and our stakeholders view as\namong the most important to our\nbusiness. We continually monitor the\nevolving disclosure landscape and\nevaluate which frameworks best address\nour stakeholders' interest. As of 2020,\nour ESG disclosures are informed by the\nGlobal Reporting Initiative,\nSustainability Accounting Standards\nBoard and the Task Force on Climate-\nRelated Financial Disclosures (\"TCFD\").\nThe ESG information page on our website\nprovides links to numerous JPMorgan\nChase publications, documents, policies\nand other sources of information about\nvarious ESG topics, which are available\nat\njpmorganchase.com/about/governance/esg.\n                                                      \n  2021 PROXY STATEMENT    29    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                               \n  ELECTION OF DIRECTORS| CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                                               \n                                                                                \n  Director nominees    Board governance    Board oversight    Board engagement  \n                                                                                \n4.

a\nsense of personal accountability on the\npart of all of the Firm\u2019s employees.\n\nIn addition to discussions at Board\nmeetings with senior management about\nthese efforts, our directors\nparticipate in meetings with employees\nto emphasize this commitment. These\nmeetings include employee town halls,\nlines of business and leadership team\nevents, annual senior leaders\u2019 meetings\nand informal sessions with members of\nthe OC and other senior leaders.\n\nRegulators\n\nOur Board and senior leaders commit\nsignificant time to meeting with\nregulators. These interactions help us\nlearn first-hand from regulators about\nmatters of importance to them and their\nexpectations of us. It also gives the\nBoard and management a forum for\nkeeping our regulators well-informed\nabout the Firm\u2019s performance and\nbusiness practices.\n\nStakeholders\n\nWe share a fundamental commitment to\nall of our stakeholders, including our\ncustomers, suppliers and communities in\nwhich we work. As we strive to deliver\nvalue, management engages with our\nstakeholders on a range of issues in a\nvariety of ways. These may include\nparticipation in consumer advisory\npanels, town halls and meetings with\npolicy advocacy groups and nonprofit\norganizations. We actively seek\nfeedback on key topics to help us\nbetter understand what is important to\nour stakeholders and find ways to\ndeliver value while also navigating\nfinancial, legal and regulatory\nconsiderations. In recent years, we\nhave engaged in extensive stakeholder\noutreach pertaining to, among other\ntopics, human capital management\nincluding diversity, equity and\ninclusion, climate change risk and ESG-\nrelated disclosures.\n\nManagement shares insights and feedback\nfrom these relationships and\nengagements with the Board, providing\nthe Board with valuable insights. Board\nmembers are also provided opportunities\nto engage with stakeholders through\nclient events, town halls, business\nresource groups (\"BRG\"), and\nshareholder discussions.\n                                                      \n  2021 PROXY STATEMENT    31    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                               \n  DIRECTOR COMPENSATION| CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                                               \nDirector compensation\n\nThe Governance Committee is responsible\nfor reviewing director compensation and\nmaking recommendations to the Board. In\nmaking its recommendations, the\nGovernance Committee annually reviews\nthe Board\u2019s responsibilities and the\ncompensation practices of peer firms,\nwhich include the same group of peer\nfirms referenced with respect to the\ncompensation of our NEOs. For more\ninformation see \u201cEvaluating market\npractices\u201d on page 45. The Board\nbelieves a best practice is to link\ndirector compensation to the Firm\u2019s\nperformance; therefore, a significant\nportion of director compensation is\npaid in common stock. This year we are\nalso seeking shareholder approval of a\nproposed new Amended and Restated Long-\nTerm Incentive Plan (\u201cLTIP\u201d), which\nincludes our non-employee director\ncompensation plan. The Firm's current\nLTIP, which was approved by the\nshareholders in 2018, also included\nnon-employee director compensation.\nThere has been no increase in non-\nemployee director compensation since\n2017. For additional information on the\nproposed new LTIP, see page 84. Annual\ncompensation For each calendar year of\nservice on the Board, each non-employee\ndirector receives an annual cash\nretainer of $100,000 and if the non-\nemployee director is on the board at\nthe time when annual performance year\nequity awards are granted, an annual\ngrant of deferred stock units valued at\n$250,000. Compensation paid during\n2020, including additional cash\ncompensation paid for certain committee\nand other service, is described in the\nfollowing tables. Each deferred stock\nunit included in the annual grant to\ndirectors represents the right to\nreceive one share of the Firm\u2019s common\nstock and dividend equivalents payable\nin deferred stock units for any\ndividends paid. Deferred stock units\nhave no voting rights. In January of\nthe year immediately following a\ndirector\u2019s termination of service,\ndeferred stock units are distributed in\nshares of the Firm\u2019s common stock in\neither a lump sum or in annual\ninstallments for up to 15 years as\nelected by the director.\n\nThe following table summarizes the 2020\nannual compensation for non-employee\ndirectors for service on the Boards of\nthe Firm, the Bank and J.P. Morgan\nSecurities plc. There is no additional\ncompensation paid for service on the\nBoard of IHC.\n                                                               \n  Compensation                                     Amount ($)  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Board retainer                              $       100,000  \n  Lead Independent Director retainer                   30,000  \n  Audit and Risk Committee chair retainer              25,000  \n  Audit and Risk Committee member retainer             15,000  \n  All other committees chair retainer                  15,000  \n  Deferred stock unit grant                           250,000  \n  Bank Board retainer                                  15,000  \n  Bank Board\u2019s chair retainer                          25,000  \n  J.P.

Retainers for Board and\ncommittee service were pro-rated. Other\nfees paid to Mr. Bell include an amount\nfor a commemorative item for his\nservice on the Board and an amount to\ncover taxes for the item.\n\n5 Mr. Jackson retired from the Board in\nMay 2020 on the eve of the 2020 annual\nmeeting.

Other\nfees paid to Mr. Jackson include an\namount for a commemorative item for his\nservice on the Board and an amount to\ncover taxes for the item.\n\nStock ownership: no sales, no hedging,\nno pledging\n\nAs stated in the Governance Principles\nand further described in \u201cAnti-\nhedging/anti-pledging provisions\u201d on\npage 33, each director agrees to retain\nall shares of the Firm\u2019s common stock\nhe or she purchased on the open market\nor received pursuant to his or her\nservice as a Board member for as long\nas he or she serves on our Board.\n\nShares held personally by a director\nmay not be held in margin accounts or\notherwise pledged as collateral, nor\nmay the economic risk of such shares be\nhedged.\n\nAs detailed on page 82 under \u201cSecurity\nownership of directors and executive\nofficers,\u201d Mr. Crown has ownership of\ncertain shares attributed to him that\narise from the business of Henry Crown\nand Company, an investment company\nwhere Mr. Crown serves as Chairman and\nCEO, and trusts of which Mr. Crown\nserves as trustee (the \u201cAttributed\nShares\u201d). Mr. Crown disclaims\nbeneficial ownership of such Attributed\nShares, except to the extent of his\npecuniary interest. The Attributed\nShares are distinct from shares Mr.\nCrown or his spouse own individually,\nor shares held in trusts for the\nbenefit of his children (the \u201cCrown\nPersonally Held Shares\u201d). The Firm has\nreviewed the potential pledging of the\nAttributed Shares with Mr. Crown,\nrecognizes Mr. Crown\u2019s distinct\nobligations with respect to Henry Crown\nand Company and the trusts, and\nbelieves such Attributed Shares\n\nmay be prudently pledged or held in\nmargin loan accounts. Crown Personally\nHeld Shares are not and may not be held\nin margin accounts or otherwise pledged\nas collateral, nor may the economic\nrisk of such shares be hedged.\n\nDeferred compensation\n\nEach year, non-employee directors may\nelect to defer all or part of their\ncash compensation. A director\u2019s right\nto receive future payments under any\ndeferred compensation arrangement is an\nunsecured claim against JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s general assets. Cash amounts\nmay be deferred into various investment\nequivalents, including deferred stock\nunits. Upon retirement from the Board,\ncompensation deferred into stock units\nwill be distributed in stock; all other\ndeferred cash compensation will be\ndistributed in cash. Deferred\ncompensation will be distributed in\neither a lump sum or in annual\ninstallments for up to 15 years as\nelected by the director commencing in\nJanuary of the year following the\ndirector\u2019s retirement from the Board.\n\nReimbursements and insurance\n\nThe Firm reimburses directors for their\nexpenses in connection with their Board\nservice or pays such expenses directly.\nThe Firm also pays the premiums on\ndirectors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability\ninsurance policies and on travel\naccident insurance policies covering\ndirectors as well as employees of the\nFirm.\n                                                      \n  2021 PROXY STATEMENT    33    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                                      \n  OTHER CORPORATE GOVERNANCE POLICIES AND PRACTICES|  \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE                                \n                                                      \nOther corporate governance policies and\npractices\n\nShareholder rights\n\nThe Firm\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation\nand By-laws provide shareholders with\nimportant rights, including:\n\n\u2022 Proxy access, which enables eligible\nshareholders to include their nominees\nfor election as directors in the Firm\u2019s\nproxy statement.

The RBL was\nentered into in the ordinary course of\nbusiness, on terms prevailing in the\nmarket and, at the time, did not\ninvolve more than normal risk of\ncollectability or present other\nunfavorable features. The Firm's\nmaximum exposure during the period was\n$470 million of the aggregate $700\nmillion RBL commitments. Prior to the\nbankruptcy noted below, EMG owned\napproximately 47% of Sable, and\nDirector Raymond and his son together\nowned, directly or indirectly, less\nthan 2% of Sable.

The CMDC considers the\nsize, presence, brand and reputation of\nthe companies, and the nature and mix\nof their businesses in using this data.\nThese companies include some or all of\nthe following: 3M, Alphabet, Amazon,\nApple, AT&T, Barclays, BlackRock, BNY\nMellon, Boeing, Capital One Financial,\nChevron, Coca-Cola, Comcast, Credit\nSuisse, CVS Health, Deutsche Bank,\nExxonMobil, Facebook, General Electric,\nHSBC, IBM, Johnson & Johnson, Merck,\nMicrosoft, Oracle, PayPal, PepsiCo,\nPfizer, Procter & Gamble, UBS, United\nTechnologies, Verizon, Wal-Mart and\nWalt Disney. Although these reference\ncompanies are not part of our primary\nfinancial services peer group, we\nbelieve that their practices can\nprovide a relevant point of reference\nfor maintaining a competitive talent\nand compensation program.\n\nDISCIPLINED PROCESS TO DETERMINE PAY\n\nPay level\n\nIn determining total compensation\nlevels for individual OC members, the\nCMDC evaluates various pay scenarios in\nlight of the following considerations\nto inform their judgment:\n\n\u2022 Performance, based on the four broad\nassessment dimensions as discussed on\npages 53-64, including risk and control\n\n\u2022 Value of the position to the\norganization and shareholders over time\n(i.e., \u201cvalue of seat\u201d)\n\n\u2022 Leadership and the example they set\nfor others by acting with integrity and\nstrengthening the Firm\u2019s culture,\nincluding diversity, inclusion and\nrespect\n\n\u2022 External talent market (i.e., market\ndata)\n\nWhile market data provides the CMDC\nwith useful information regarding our\ncompetitors, the CMDC does not target\nspecific positioning (e.g., 50 th\npercentile), nor does it use a\nformulaic approach in determining\ncompetitive pay levels. Instead, the\nCMDC uses a range of data as a\nreference, which is considered in the\ncontext of each executive\u2019s performance\nover a multi-year period, and the\nCMDC\u2019s assessment of the value the\nindividual delivers to the Firm.\n\nFor 2020, compensation awarded to the\nOC members also represents a balance\nbetween the outstanding efforts and\nperformance of the Firm during COVID-19\nwith the impact of the pandemic on the\nFirm's other stakeholders.\n\nPay mix\n\nOnce the CMDC determines OC members\u2019\ntotal incentive compensation, it then\nestablishes the appropriate pay mix\nbetween an annual cash incentive and\nlong-term equity, including PSUs and\nRSUs.\n\nFor OC members other than the CEO and\nMr. Pinto, consistent with prior years,\nthe CMDC continued to apply the Firm\u2019s\nstandard cash/equity incentive mix\nformula to each of their 2020 incentive\ncompensation awards. For the CEO, also\nconsistent with prior years, the Board\ncontinued to override the standard\ncash/equity formula to maintain a lower\ncash allocation of $5 million, so that\na larger majority of his incentive\ncompensation would be comprised of\nshareholder-aligned equity, with 100%\nof it in the form of performance-\nconditioned PSUs. PSUs are 100% at-risk\nand will result in no payout unless a\nthreshold performance level is\nachieved.\n                                                      \n  2021 PROXY STATEMENT    45    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                                   \n  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS| EXECUTIVE  \n  COMPENSATION                                     \n                                                   \n                                                                                  \n  How we think about pay     How we performed           How performance           \n  decisions                  against our business       determined pay in 2020    \n                             strategy                                             \n                                                                                  \nFor OC members other than the CEO, the CMDC determined that a 50%/50% mix of time-\nbased RSUs and at-risk PSUs would continue to provide an appropriate balance to\ntheir equity exposure. Per the Firm\u2019s standard cash/equity incentive mix formula,\nthe OC members were awarded 60% of their incentive compensation in long-term\nequity (30% in PSUs and 30% in RSUs), with the remaining 40% paid in cash.\n\nThe CMDC believes that this significant weighting of pay mix to equity encourages\nOC members to focus on the long-term success of the Firm while mitigating\nexcessive risk-taking, and provides a competitive annual cash incentive\nopportunity. The CMDC has established a different pay mix for Mr. Pinto (including\na fixed allowance) due to local E.U. and U.K. regulations for Identified Staff\nunder the Capital Requirements Directive IV. For further details on Mr. Pinto\u2019s\npay mix, see Note 1 below.\n\nSummary of pay elements\n\nOur compensation program provides for an appropriate mix between base salary, cash\nand equity incentives that vest over time.

period (commencing ratably on the third anniversary of grant);\n(ii) additional U.K. clawback/ recovery provisions; and (iii) a minimum twelve-\nmonth hold after each vesting, and are not eligible for payment/accrual of\ndividend equivalents. In addition, as it relates to Mr. Pinto\u2019s PSUs, the CMDC may\nuse its discretion, as appropriate, to downward adjust payout based on his\nperformance against qualitative criteria and priorities during the performance\nperiod, including performance against his local regulatory responsibilities as a\nU.K. \u201cSenior Manager\u201d under the Senior Managers & Certification Regime. Local\nregulators review compensation structures for Identified Staff periodically and\nmay require future adjustments.

Similar to RSUs, the value upon vesting of\nPSUs is also directly tied to the Firm\u2019s performance through its stock price. The\nCMDC believes that the PSU design continues to appropriately incentivize strong\nperformance by our OC members, does not encourage excessive risk-taking and is\naligned with long-term shareholder interests. Since PSUs were first introduced in\n2015, we have received positive shareholder support for this aspect of our\nexecutive compensation program.\n\nFor the 2020 PSU awards granted in January 2021, the CMDC maintained the key\nfeatures of our PSU design, including the enhancements it made to the 2019 PSU\nawards in response to feedback from shareholders. These enhancements included:\n\n\u2022 Changing the payout calculation methodology to be based on the Firm\u2019s three-year\naverage ROTCE performance on both an absolute and relative basis. Previously,\npayout was calculated annually for one-third of the awarded units.\n\n\u2022 Increasing the rigor of the relative payout scale to further differentiate\npayout for outperformance, median performance and underperformance, as summarized\nbelow:\n\n\u25e6 Top quartile relative performance no longer pays out at 150% for all three\nranks;\n\n\u25e6 Target (100%) payout requires above median performance;\n\n\u25e6 Below median performance pays out at a maximum of 80%; and\n\n\u25e6 Bottom relative performance pays out at 0%.\n\nThe chart below provides a detailed comparison of the relative performance payout\nlevels for PSU awards that were outstanding as of February 28, 2021:\n                                                                                  \n             \u2026     1    2     3    4     5    6     7    8     9    \u2026    11    \u2026  \n             \u2026                                                                    \n  \u2026                                                                               \n       2\u2026    \u2026    1\u2026    \u2026    1\u2026    \u2026    9\u2026    \u2026    7\u2026    \u2026    5\u2026    \u2026    0%       \n       A\u2026                                                                         \n       2\u2026    \u2026    1\u2026    \u2026    1\u2026    \u2026    1\u2026    \u2026    8\u2026    \u2026    5\u2026    \u2026    2\u2026       \n       A\u2026                                                                         \n                             7\u2026               \u2026               2\u2026                  \n                                                                                  \nAdditionally, for the 2020 PSU awards, the Committee calibrated the upper and\nlower absolute ROTCE thresholds to 18% and 6% respectively, based on the current\nforecast of the Firm\u2019s future performance.\n                                                      \n  2021 PROXY STATEMENT    47    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                                   \n  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS| EXECUTIVE  \n  COMPENSATION                                     \n                                                   \n                                                                                  \n  How we think about pay     How we performed           How performance           \n  decisions                  against our business       determined pay in 2020    \n                             strategy                                             \n                                                                                  \nKEY FEATURES OF OUR 2020 PSU PROGRAM\n\nThe key features of our 2020 PSUs are substantially unchanged and are summarized\nbelow:\n                                                                                  \n  Plan Feature                   Performance Year 2020 PSU Award Description      \n                                 \u2022Value of units moves with stock price during    \n  Vehicle                        performance period; units are settled in shares  \n                                 at vesting.                                      \n                                 \u2022Three-year cliff-vesting, plus an additional    \n                                 two-year holding period (for a combined          \n  Time Horizon                   five-year holding period). Due to local U.K.     \n                                 regulations, Mr. Pinto's PSUs are subject to an  \n                                 extended seven-year vesting period commencing    \n                                 ratably on the third anniversary of the grant.   \n                                 \u2022The CMDC selected ROTCE, a comprehensive        \n                                 performance metric that measures the Firm\u2019s net  \n                                 income applicable to common equity as a          \n                                 percentage of average tangible common equity.    \n  Performance Measure            ROTCE is used by the Firm, as well as investors  \n                                 and analysts, in assessing the earnings power    \n                                 of common shareholders\u2019 equity capital and is a  \n                                 useful metric for comparing the profitability    \n                                 of the Firm with that of competitors.            \n                                 \u2022Payout under the PSU plan is calculated at the  \n                                 end of the three-year performance period based   \n                                 on absolute and relative average ROTCE1, per     \n                                 the payout scale below. The use of both          \n                                 absolute and relative ROTCE helps promote a      \n  Payout Scale                   reasonable outcome for both shareholders and     \n                                 participants. For the 2020 PSU award, the CMDC   \n                                 set the absolute ROTCE thresholds as follows:    \n                                 (1) maximum payout at 18% or greater, (vs. 17%   \n                                 in 2017, and 18% in 2018 and 2019); and (2)      \n                                 zero payout at less than 6%, no change from      \n                                 prior years.                                     \n                                 \u2022In determining companies to include in the      \n                                 relative ROTCE scale, the CMDC selected          \n                                 competitors with business activities that        \n                                 overlap with at least 30% of the Firm\u2019s revenue  \n  PSU Performance Companies      mix.

For\nthe 2020 PSU awards granted in January 2021, these outcomes were considered in the\ncontext of (among other things) the expected impacts of: regulatory capital\nrequirements; annual stress tests; interest rates; COVID-19; and the U.S. and\nglobal economic environment, all of which affect the range of ROTCE outcomes in\nthe medium-term.\n\n\u2022 Consistent with the Firm\u2019s pay-for-performance philosophy, in setting the\nrelative ROTCE performance goals for the 2020 PSU awards, the CMDC determined that\npayout above target should be limited to instances in which the Firm outperforms\nthe majority of its competitors on a relative basis, with below target payout\noccurring in instances of underperformance. Achievement of median relative\nperformance results in below-target payout. Outstanding relative performance,\nwhich results in a payout of 150%, is limited to achieving a top ranking.\n\nPSUS AWARDED FOR PERFORMANCE YEARS 2017, 2018 AND 2019\n\n\u2022 The Firm reported ROTCE of 17%, 19% and 14% in 2018, 2019 and 2020 respectively,\nresulting in first quartile relative performance and an expected payout of 150%\nfor each tranche of the 2017 and 2018 PSU awards referencing those years. For the\n2019 PSU awards, the payout will be calculated once the performance period ends on\nDecember 31, 2022 based on the Firm's absolute and relative three-year average\nROTCE performance. On March 25, 2021, the 2017 PSU awards vested at 150%.\n                                                      \n  2021 PROXY STATEMENT    49    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                                   \n  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS| EXECUTIVE  \n  COMPENSATION                                     \n                                                   \n                                                                                  \n  How we think about pay     How we performed           How performance           \n  decisions                  against our business       determined pay in 2020    \n                             strategy                                             \n                                                                                  \nStrong ownership & accountability\nprovisions support our compensation\nphilosophy\n\nSTOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINE AND RETENTION\nREQUIREMENTS The CMDC believes it is\nimportant to align the interests of the\nOC members with those of our\nshareholders. To meet this objective,\nOC members are subject to a stock\nownership guideline and retention\npolicy. While on the Operating\nCommittee, each member is required to\naccumulate either: \u2022 A minimum of\nbetween 200,000 and 400,000 shares (1\nmillion shares for the CEO); or \u2022 A\nminimum fixed dollar value of shares of\nbetween $10 million and $30 million\n($75 million for the CEO). Shares\ncredited for purposes of satisfying the\nabove ownership levels include shares\nowned outright, as well as 50% of\nunvested RSUs and PSUs, but do not\ninclude stock appreciation rights\n(\"SARs\") or stock options. The stock\nownership guideline must be met within\nsix years of the later of the effective\ndate of the policy or appointment to\nthe Operating Committee. If the stock\nownership guidelines are subsequently\nincreased, the higher ownership\nguideline must be satisfied within six\nyears of such revision, unless\notherwise determined by the CEO and\nCMDC. Prior to reaching their\ndesignated share ownership guideline,\nOC members are required to retain 75%\nof all net shares received from equity\nawards granted after they join the\nOperating Committee. Once they have met\ntheir ownership guideline, the policy\nrequires OC members to continue\nretaining 50% of all net shares\nreceived from awards (75% for the CEO)\nas summarized below:\n                                                                                  \n  Retention Requirement                                                           \n  Before Guideline Met                After Guideline Met                         \n  75% of net shares until             50% of net shares for theduration of their  \n  stock ownership guideline is met    service\u00a0on\u00a0theOperating Committee(75% for   \n                                      the CEO)                                    \n                                                                                  \nBecause OC members are required to continue accumulating shares even after having\nmet their share ownership guideline, the resulting increase of share ownership\nover time further strengthens their interests with those of our shareholders.\nANTI-HEDGING/ANTI-PLEDGING PROVISIONS All employees are prohibited from hedging or\npledging unvested RSUs and PSUs, and unexercised stock appreciation rights or\nstock options. In addition: \u2022 Hedging any shares owned outright or through\ndeferred compensation by an OC member is prohibited\n\n\u2022 Shares held directly by an OC or Board member may not be held in margin accounts\nor otherwise pledged For information on the hedging/pledging restrictions\napplicable to our directors, please see \u201cDirector compensation\u201d on page 33.\nINTEGRATING RISK WITH COMPENSATION The CMDC holds an annual joint session with the\nRisk Committee to review Firmwide Human Resources and compensation practices,\nincluding: \u2022 How we integrate risk, controls and conduct considerations into key\nHR practices including performance development, compensation, promotion and\nsuccession planning \u2022 Compensation features and elements designed to discourage\nimprudent risk-taking (e.g., multi-year vesting, clawbacks, prohibition on\nhedging, etc.) \u2022 Annual incentive pool processes for LOBs and functions \u2022\nRegulatory updates which have impacted or may impact HR practices in the future\nThe committees are also provided with information on our performance development\nprocess, a summary of risk, controls and conduct feedback, and updates regarding\nHR Control Forum issues. STRONG ACCOUNTABILITY AND RECOVERY PROVISIONS Our\nexecutive compensation program is designed to hold executives accountable, when\nappropriate, for meaningful actions or issues that negatively impact business\nperformance or the Firm\u2019s reputation in current or future years. Issues that may\nwarrant recovery determinations can be raised at any time, including in HR Control\nForums, annual assessments of employee performance and when Designated Employees\nresign or their employment is terminated by the Firm. Under the Firm\u2019s process to\ngovern these determinations: \u2022 We have established a process for reviewing\ncompensation or other employee actions following a determination that the cause\nand materiality of a risk-related loss, issue or other set of facts and\ncircumstances warrants such a review of accountability \u2022 The CMDC is responsible\nfor determinations involving OC members (determinations involving the CEO are\nsubject to ratification by independent members of the Board). The CMDC has\ndelegated authority for determinations involving other employees to the Head of\nHuman Resources or his or her designee, usually through the HR Control Forum\nprocess described on page 51.\n                                                      \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.    50    2021 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                                   \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION |COMPENSATION DISCUSSION  \n  AND ANALYSIS                                     \n                                                   \n                                                                                  \n  How we think about pay     How we performed           How performance           \n  decisions                  against our business       determined pay in 2020    \n                             strategy                                             \n                                                                                  \nHOLDING INDIVIDUALS ACCOUNTABLE\n\nTo hold individuals responsible for\ntaking risks inconsistent with the\nFirm\u2019s risk appetite and to discourage\nfuture imprudent behavior, the Firm has\npolicies and procedures that enable it\nto take prompt and proportionate\nactions with respect to accountable\nindividuals, including:\n\nI.

Over this period we increased average common equity by over 35% to\n$237 billion and average TCE 1 by over 50% to $191 billion to support growth in\nthe businesses and maintain a fortress balance sheet. We have maintained strong\nROE and ROTCE 1 over time.\n\nWe have also delivered sustained growth in EPS, BVPS, and TBVPS 1 over the past 10\nyears, reflecting compound annual growth rates of 8%, 6% and 8%, respectively over\nthe period.\n\n1 Average TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures; refer to\nNote 1 on page 113 for a further discussion of these measures.\n\n2 Excluding the impact of the enactment of the TCJA of $(2.4) billion and a legal\nbenefit of $406 million (after-tax) in 2017, adjusted net income would have been\n$26.5 billion, adjusted ROTCE would have been 13% and adjusted EPS would have been\n$6.87.

The graph below shows our TSR expressed as the\ncumulative return to shareholders over the past decade. As illustrated, a $100\ninvestment in JPMorgan Chase common stock on December 31, 2010 would be valued at\n$393 as of December 31, 2020, which significantly outperformed the financial\nservices industry over the period, as measured by the S&P Financials Index and the\nKBW Bank Index.\n\n1 TSR shows the actual return of the stock price, with dividends reinvested.\n                                                                                  \n   Risk, controls & conduct                                                       \n                                                                                  \nWe believe a strong control environment\nis fundamental to the success of our\nFirm.

To\nthat end, the Firm has in place\nemployee training and protocols for\npreventing, reporting and addressing\nsexual, discriminatory or other\nmisconduct and prohibits retaliation\nagainst an individual because the\nperson reported a concern or assisted\nwith any inquiry or investigation. In\n2020, we simplified channels for\nemployees to raise conduct concerns,\nimplemented a new intake process to\nfacilitate appropriate and timely\nrouting, and enhanced our\ninvestigations protocols .\n\nThe Firm reinforced its culture through\nvarious efforts throughout the year in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic. The\nFirm supported employees by providing\nadditional paid time off; offering\nexpanded healthcare, well-being and\nchildcare resources; and awarding\nspecial payments to\n\nrecognize employees whose job requires\nthem to continue working onsite to\nfacilitate essential banking services\nfor our customers, clients and\ncommunities.\n\nWe also introduced new culture\ninitiatives including the launch of\nadditional training for all employees\ncalled You Belong Here: Building a More\nInclusive JPMC, and enhancements were\nmade to current listening strategies\nthat enable the Firm to more\neffectively measure how employees are\nexperiencing the company. In addition,\nas part of our Path Forward\ncommitments, we enhanced our\naccountability framework for senior\nmanagers to further strengthen our\napproach to incorporate diversity,\nequity and inclusion priorities and\nprogress into the way we do business.\n\nWe remain focused on our anti-\nharassment, anti-racism and culture of\nrespect efforts across the company and\ncontinue to take a holistic approach to\nreinforce our culture by increasing\nawareness and education through\nengagement, communication and training\nwhile adhering to policy and regulatory\nrequirements.

Over the past several years, we have\nimplemented a disciplined executive talent management and succession planning\nprocess that includes LOBs and Functions holding talent review discussions with\ntheir management teams and identifying successors for key leadership roles.\n\nThe CMDC reviews the succession plan for the CEO followed by discussion with the\nnon-executive directors of the Board led by the Lead Independent Director. The\nCMDC also reviews the succession plan for members of the Operating Committee other\nthan the CEO, which is discussed by the full Board of Directors. These processes\nenable the Board to address both long-term planned occurrences, such as retirement\nor change in roles, as well as short-term unexpected events. For example, in March\n2020, the Board's short-term plan was initiated when it asked the Firm's Co-\nPresidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers, Mr. Pinto and Mr. Smith, to jointly\nlead the company while Mr. Dimon recuperated from an emergency surgery.\n\nWe continue to focus on our leadership pipeline through enhanced data and\nreporting capabilities to drive manager engagement and accountability in\nprocesses, including our mobility and promotion pipeline from Executive Director\nto Managing Director.\n\nDIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion are of strategic importance to the Firm.

It differs from how compensation is reported in the\n\u201cSummary Compensation Table\u201d (\u201cSCT\u201d) on page 73, which is required by the SEC, and\nis not intended as a substitute for the SCT. There are two principal differences\nbetween the SCT and the table above:\n\n1. The Firm grants both cash and equity incentive compensation after a performance\nyear is completed. In both the table above and the SCT, cash incentive\ncompensation paid in 2021 for 2020 performance is shown as 2020 compensation. In\nthe table above, the equity awards (RSUs and PSUs) granted in 2021 for 2020\nperformance are shown as 2020 compensation. In contrast, the SCT reports the value\nof equity awards in the year in which they are granted.

The \u201cNEO Compensation\u201d table on\npage 65 shows how the CMDC viewed compensation actions for 2020 performance.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n1 Salary reflects the actual amount paid in each year.\n\n2 Includes amounts awarded, whether paid or deferred. Cash incentive compensation\nreflects compensation earned in connection with the performance year shown, which\nwas awarded in January of the following year.\n\n3 Includes amounts awarded during the year shown. Amounts are the fair value on\nthe grant date in accordance with applicable accounting guidance (i.e., at target\nfor PSUs awarded in 2020). At the maximum level of performance, the value of PSUs\nawarded in 2020 would be: $37,500,000 for Mr. Dimon; $10,695,584 for Mr. Pinto;\n$9,787,500 for Mr. Smith; $9,112,500 for Ms. Erdoes; and $4,200,000 for Ms.\nPiepszak. The Firm\u2019s accounting for employee stock-based incentives is described\nin Note 9 to the Firm\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2020 Annual\nReport on pages 221-222, which may be accessed on our website at\njpmorganchase.com, under Investor Relations. No SARs or stock options were granted\nto NEOs in 2020.\n\n4 Amounts for years 2020, 2019 and 2018 are the aggregate change in the actuarial\npresent value of the accumulated benefits under all defined benefit pension plans\n(including supplemental plans). No NEOs had earnings in excess of 120% of the\napplicable federal rate on deferred compensation balances where the rate of return\nis not calculated in the same or in a similar manner as earnings on hypothetical\ninvestments under the Firm's qualified plans. The amount of earnings in excess of\n120% of the applicable federal rate included in this column is $0 for each of\n2020, 2019 and 2018.\n\n5 \u201cAll other compensation\u201d includes the cost, if any, for a named executive\nofficer\u2019s spouse to attend business-related events where spousal attendance is\nexpected or customary. This did not exceed the greater of $25,000 or 10% of the\nnamed executive officer\u2019s total perquisites and personal benefits except as\nspecifically noted in the footnotes that follow.\n\n6 The \u201cAll other compensation\u201d column for Mr. Dimon includes: $5,000 in employer\nnon-matching contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plan, which replaces\nthe employer benefit to the Firm's qualified noncontributory U.S. defined benefit\npension plan that was frozen effective January 1, 2020; $35,714 for personal use\nof corporate aircraft; $38,900 for personal use of corporate cars; and $62,317 for\nthe cost of residential, personal travel, and related security paid by the Firm.\nMr. Dimon\u2019s personal use of corporate aircraft and cars, and certain related\nsecurity, is required pursuant to security measures approved by the Board.\nIncremental costs are determined as follows:\n\n\u25e6 Aircraft: operating cost per flight hour for the aircraft type used, developed\nby an independent reference source, including fuel, fuel additives and lubricants;\nlanding and parking fees; crew expenses; small supplies and catering; maintenance,\nlabor and parts; engine restoration costs; and a maintenance service plan.\n\n\u25e6 Cars: annual lease valuation of the assigned cars; annual insurance premiums;\nfuel expense; estimated annual maintenance; other miscellaneous expense; and\nannual drivers\u2019 compensation, including salary, overtime, benefits and bonus. The\nresulting total is allocated between personal and business use based on mileage.\n\n7 The 2018 amount has been revised.\n\n8 Since Mr. Pinto is located in the U.K., the terms and composition of his\ncompensation reflect the requirements of local regulations, including changes that\ncame into effect in 2014 to comply with the Capital Requirements Directive IV.\nThese requirements include that at least 60% of his incentive compensation is\ndeferred, and that his incentive compensation is not more than twice his fixed\ncompensation in respect of any given performance year. Mr. Pinto\u2019s fixed\ncompensation is comprised of salary and an annual cash fixed allowance, which from\nJune 2017, has been payable in equal monthly installments. Mr. Pinto\u2019s salary of\n\u00a3475,000 is denominated and paid in British pound sterling (\u201cGBP\u201d) and his fixed\nallowance of $7,635,000 is denominated in USD and paid in GBP. Both are unchanged\nsince 2016. The CMDC elected to defer 100% of Mr. Pinto\u2019s variable compensation\ninto equity \u2013 50% into RSUs and 50% into PSUs \u2013 in order to maintain a comparable\ndeferred equity portion to similarly situated Firm employees. For the purposes of\nthis table, a blended applicable rate of 1.27429 U.S. dollars per GBP, which was\nbased on a 10-month average rate, has been used to convert Mr. Pinto\u2019s salary to\nU.S. dollars for 2020. The blended applicable rates used to convert Mr. Pinto\u2019s\nsalary for 2019 and 2018 were 1.27205 and 1.34953 U.S. dollars per GBP,\nrespectively.\n\n9 The \u201cAll other compensation\u201d column for Mr. Pinto includes $20,254 in employer\ncontributions to a non-U.S. defined contribution plan; $20,518 in tax compliance\nassistance for non-U.K. business travel; and $3,422 for personal use of cars.\n\n10 The \u201cAll other compensation\u201d column for Mr. Smith includes $4,000 in employer\nnon-matching contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plan.\n\n11 The \u201cAll other compensation\u201d column for Ms. Erdoes includes $5,000 in employer\nnon-matching contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plan.\n\n12 Ms. Piepszak was not a NEO in 2018.\n\n13 The \u201cAll other compensation\u201d column for Ms. Piepszak includes $5,000 in\nemployer non-matching contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plan.\n                                                      \n  2021 PROXY STATEMENT    73    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                            \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES| EXECUTIVE  \n  COMPENSATION                              \n                                            \nII. 2020 GRANTS OF PLAN-BASED AWARDS 1\n\nThe following table shows grants of plan-based awards made in 2020 for the 2019\nperformance year.\n                                                                                  \n                                                  St\u2026                             \n               Es\u2026                                aw\u2026                             \n               Fu\u2026                                (R\u2026                             \n               Pa\u2026                                Nu\u2026                             \n               Un\u2026                                of                              \n               Eq\u2026                                sh\u2026                             \n               In\u2026                                of                              \n               Pl\u2026                                re\u2026           Gra\u2026              \n               Aw\u2026                                st\u2026           date              \n               (P\u2026                                or            fair              \n        Gr\u2026    Th\u2026    Ta\u2026           Ma\u2026           un\u2026           val\u2026              \n  N\u2026    da\u2026    (#)    (#)           (#)           (#)           ($)4              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  J\u2026    1/\u2026    \u2014             18\u2026           27\u2026             \u2014            $    25\u2026  \n  D\u2026                                                                              \n  D\u2026    1/\u2026    \u2014               \u2014             \u2014           61\u2026                 7,\u2026  \n  P\u2026                                                                              \n        1/\u2026    \u2014             59\u2026           89\u2026             \u2014                 7,\u2026  \n  G\u2026    1/\u2026    \u2014               \u2014             \u2014           47\u2026                 6,\u2026  \n  S\u2026                                                                              \n        1/\u2026    \u2014             47\u2026           71\u2026             \u2014                 6,\u2026  \n  M\u2026                                                                              \n  C\u2026    1/\u2026    \u2014               \u2014             \u2014           44\u2026                 6,\u2026  \n  E\u2026                                                                              \n        1/\u2026    \u2014             44\u2026           66\u2026             \u2014                 6,\u2026  \n  J\u2026    1/\u2026    \u2014               \u2014             \u2014           20\u2026                 2,\u2026  \n  P\u2026                                                                              \n        1/\u2026    \u2014             20\u2026           30\u2026             \u2014                 2,\u2026  \n                                                                                  \n1 Equity grants are awarded as part of the annual compensation process and as part\nof employment offers for new hires. Grants made as part of the annual incentive\ncompensation process are generally awarded in January after fourth quarter\nearnings are released. RSUs and PSUs carry no voting rights. On January 19, 2021,\nthe Firm awarded RSU and PSU awards as part of the 2020 annual incentive\ncompensation. Because these awards were granted in 2021, they do not appear in\nthis table, which is required to include only equity awards actually granted\nduring 2020. These 2021 awards are however reflected in the \u201cNEO Compensation\u201d\ntable on page 65. No SARs have been awarded since 2013.\n\n2 For NEOs other than Mr. Pinto, PSUs vest on March 25, 2023, and are subject to a\ntwo-year holding period post-vesting. In accordance with U.K. regulations, for Mr.\nPinto, PSUs vest in five equal installments on March 25, 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026\nand 2027 and are subject to: (i) a twelve-month holding period for all\ninstallments post-vesting, (ii) a two-year holding period for the installment\nvesting on March 25, 2023, with the holding periods associated with (i) and (ii)\nabove running concurrently. Each PSU represents the right to receive one share of\ncommon stock on the vesting date. The ultimate number of PSUs that will vest will\nbe determined by the Firm\u2019s performance over the three-year performance period,\nand for NEOs other than Mr. Pinto, will include any accumulated reinvested\ndividend equivalent shares. The dividend equivalent shares, if any, will be based\non: (1) the number of PSUs earned at vesting; and (2) on dividends that would have\nbeen paid on the Firm\u2019s common stock during the vesting period as of each dividend\npayment date, if any. Under rules applicable in the U.K., for Mr. Pinto, the PSUs\nare not eligible for reinvested dividend equivalent shares and an assessment is\nalso made of his qualitative performance in determining the ultimate number of\nPSUs that will vest.\n\n3 For NEOs other than Mr. Pinto, RSUs vest in two equal installments on January\n13, 2022 and 2023. Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of common\nstock on the vesting date and non-preferential dividend equivalents, payable in\ncash, equal to any dividends paid on the Firm\u2019s common stock during the vesting\nperiod. Under rules applicable in the U.K., for Mr. Pinto, RSUs vest in five equal\ninstallments on January 13, 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026 and 2027 are subject to a\ntwelve-month holding period post-vesting. Mr. Pinto\u2019s RSUs are not eligible for\ndividend equivalents.\n\n4 Represents the aggregate grant date fair value for RSUs and PSUs. For NEOs other\nthan Mr. Pinto, the aggregate grant date fair value is based on the average of the\nhigh and the low prices of JPMorgan Chase common stock on the grant date\nmultiplied by the number of shares granted (for RSUs) or target number of PSUs.\nFor Mr. Pinto, the grant date fair value takes into account that these awards do\nnot carry the right to dividends or dividend equivalents prior to vesting, in\naccordance with local regulations.\n                                                      \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.    74    2021 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                                  \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION |EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n  TABLES                                          \n                                                  \nIII.

Employees became fully vested in the value of their Plan benefits as a\nresult of this change. The Plan employed a cash balance formula (in the form of\npay and interest credits) to determine amounts at retirement. Pay credits ceased\neffective with the plan freeze. Interest credits, which generally equal the yield\non one-year U.S. Treasury bills plus 1% (subject to a minimum of 4.5%), continue\nto accrue. Account balances include the value of benefits earned under prior\nheritage company plans, if any. Benefits are payable as an actuarially equivalent\nlifetime annuity with survivorship rights (if married) or optionally under a\nvariety of other payment forms, including a single-sum distribution.\n                                                                                  \n  Excess Retirement Plan \u2014                                                        \n                                                                                  \nBenefits were determined under the same terms and conditions as the Retirement\nPlan, but reflecting base salary in excess of IRS limits up to $1 million and\nbenefit amounts in excess of IRS limits. Benefits are generally payable in a lump\nsum in the year following termination. The plan is closed to new participants and\naccruals under the plan were discontinued as of May 1, 2009.\n                                                      \n  2021 PROXY STATEMENT    77    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                            \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES| EXECUTIVE  \n  COMPENSATION                              \n                                            \n                                                                                  \n  Present value of accumulated benefits \u2014                                         \n                                                                                  \nThe valuation method and all material assumptions used to calculate the amounts\nabove are consistent with those reflected in Note 8 to the Firm\u2019s Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in the 2020 Form 10-K on pages 216-220. Key assumptions\ninclude the discount rate (2.50%); interest rates (4.75% crediting to project cash\nbalances; 2.00% to convert annuities to lump sums and lump sums to annuities) and\nmortality rates (for the present value of annuities, the Pri-2012 (white-collar)\nprojected generational mortality table with projection scale MP2020; for lump\nsums, the UP94 mortality table projected to 2002, with 50%/50% male/female\nweighting). We assumed benefits would commence at normal retirement date or\nunreduced retirement date, if earlier. Benefits paid from the Retirement Plan were\nassumed to be paid either as single-sum distributions (with probability of 85%) or\nlife annuities (with probability of 15%). Benefits from the Excess Retirement Plan\nare paid as single-sum distributions. No death or other separation from service\nwas assumed prior to retirement date.\n\nVI. 2020 NON-QUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION\n\nThe Deferred Compensation Plan allows eligible participants to defer their annual\ncash incentive compensation awards on a before-tax basis up to a maximum of $1\nmillion. A lifetime $10 million cap applies to deferrals of cash made after 2005.\nNo deferral elections have been permitted relative to equity awards since 2006.\nDuring 2020, there were no contributions made by the Firm nor contributions made\nor withdrawals or distributions received by the Named Executive Officers.\n                                                                                  \n                  Aggregate                          Aggregate                    \n                  earnings                           balance at                   \n                  (loss) in last                     last                         \n                  fiscal year                        fiscal                       \n  Name            ($)1                               year\u2013end ($)                 \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  James Dimon                     $    1,344                        $    151,050  \n  Daniel Pinto                                759                         24,165  \n  Gordon Smith                                  \u2014                              \u2014  \n  Mary                                                                            \n  Callahan                                      \u2014                              \u2014  \n  Erdoes                                                                          \n  Jennifer                                     16                            495  \n  Piepszak                                                                        \n                                                                                  \n1 The Deferred Compensation Plan allows participants to direct their deferrals\namong several investment choices, including JPMorgan Chase common stock; an\ninterest income fund based 50% on a weighted average of returns by Hartford\nInvestment Management Company SVA Bond Index Division and 50% by Newport Group\ndesignated set of general account life insurance policies owned by JPMorgan Chase;\nHartford funds indexed to fixed income, bond, balanced, S&P 500, Russell 2000 and\ninternational portfolios; and Hartford investments in Vanguard Variable Insurance\nFund high-yield bond, mid-cap and REIT index. In addition, there are balances in\ndeemed investment choices from heritage company plans that are no longer open to\nnew deferrals.\n\nInvestment returns in 2020 for the following investment choices were: Short-Term\nFixed Income, 1.13%; Interest Income, 3.25%; Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond\nIndex, 7.46%; High-Yield, 5.67%; Balanced Portfolio, 11.46%; S&P 500 Index,\n18.40%; Mid-Cap Index, 18.07%; Russell 2000 Index, 19.92%; REIT Index, (4.85)%;\nInternational, 57.58%; and JPMorgan Chase common stock, including dividend\nequivalents, (5.52)%.\n\nBeginning with deferrals credited January 2005 under the Deferred Compensation\nPlan, participants were required to elect to receive distribution of the deferral\nbalance beginning either following retirement or termination or in a specific year\nbut no earlier than the second anniversary of the date the deferral would\notherwise have been paid. If retirement or termination were elected, payments will\ncommence during the calendar year following retirement or termination.\nParticipants may elect the distribution to be lump sum or annual installments for\na maximum of 15 years. With respect to deferrals made after December 31, 2004,\nunder the Deferred Compensation Plan, account balances are automatically paid as a\nlump sum in the year following termination if employment terminates prior to the\nparticipant attaining 15 years of service. With respect to deferrals made after\nDecember 31, 2017, account balances are automatically paid as a lump sum in the\nyear following termination if employment terminates prior to the participant\nattaining 5 years of service.\n\nThe Supplemental Savings and Investment Plan (\u201cSSIP\u201d) is a heritage plan\napplicable to former Bank One employees which is closed to new participants and\ndoes not permit new deferrals. It functions similarly to the Deferred Compensation\nPlan. The investment return in 2020 for the following investment choice was:\nShort-Term Fixed Income, 0.90%. With respect to the SSIP, account balances are\nautomatically paid as a lump sum in the year following termination unless an\ninstallment option is elected prior to termination of employment.\n                                                      \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.    78    2021 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                                  \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION |EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n  TABLES                                          \n                                                  \nVII. 2020 POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL\n\nWe believe our pay practices relating to termination events, summarized below,\nillustrate our commitment to sound corporate governance, are consistent with best\npractices and are aligned with the interests of shareholders.\n                                                                                  \n   TERMINATION POLICIES ALIGNED WITH SHAREHOLDER INTERESTS                        \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                    \u2022NEOs are not entitled to any accelerated     \n  No golden parachute agreements    cash/equity payments or special benefits      \n                                    upon a change in control                      \n                                    \u2022All of the U.S. based NEOs are \u201cat will\u201d     \n                                    employees and are not covered by employment   \n  No employment agreements          agreements                                    \n                                    \u2022Mr. Pinto has terms of employment that       \n                                    reflect applicable U.K. legal standards       \n                                    \u2022Severance amounts for NEOs are capped at     \n  No special cash severance         one-year salary, not to exceed $400,000 (or   \n                                    \u00a3275,000 in the case of Mr. Pinto)            \n  No special executive benefits     \u2022NEOs are not entitled to any special         \n                                    benefits upon termination                     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Standard, broad-based severance                                                 \n                                                                                  \nMr. Dimon, Mr. Smith, Ms. Erdoes and Ms. Piepszak are covered under the Firm\u2019s\nbroad-based U.S. Severance Pay Plan.

Employees remain eligible for coverage at active employee rates under\ncertain of the Firm\u2019s employee welfare plans (such as medical and dental) for up\nto six months after their employment terminates. Mr. Pinto is covered under the\nFirm\u2019s U.K. Discretionary Redundancy Policy, which provides for a lump sum payment\non termination based on base salary and length of service and subject to a cap of\n\u00a3275,000. In addition, in the event of termination by the Firm for reasons other\nthan cause, employees may be considered, at the discretion of the Firm, for a cash\npayment in lieu of an annual incentive compensation award, taking into\nconsideration all circumstances the Firm deems relevant, including the\ncircumstances of the employee\u2019s leaving and the employee\u2019s contributions to the\nFirm over his or her career. Severance benefits and any such discretionary payment\nare subject to execution of a release in favor of the Firm and certain post-\ntermination restrictions.\n\nThe table on the following page sets forth the benefits and compensation which the\nNamed Executive Officers would have received if their employment had terminated on\nDecember 31, 2020. The amounts shown in the table on the following page do not\ninclude other payments and benefits available generally to salaried employees upon\ntermination of employment, such as accrued vacation pay, distributions from the\n401(k) Savings Plan, pension and deferred compensation plans, or any death,\ndisability or post retirement welfare benefits available under broad-based\nemployee plans. For information on the pension and deferred compensation plans,\nsee \u201cTable V: 2020 Pension benefits\u201d on page 77 and \u201cTable VI: 2020 Non-qualified\ndeferred compensation\u201d on page 78. Such tables also do not show the value of\nvested SARs, which are listed In \u201cTable III: Outstanding equity awards at fiscal\nyear-end 2020\u201d on pages 75 and 76. There are no unvested SARs outstanding on\nDecember 31, 2020.\n\nNEOs are not entitled to any additional equity awards in connection with a\npotential termination. Rather, under certain termination scenarios including\ndisability, death, termination without cause, or resignation (if full-career\neligible), NEOs\u2019 outstanding equity awards continue to vest in accordance with\ntheir terms (or accelerate in the event of death). The table on the following page\nshows the value of these unvested RSUs and PSUs based on the closing price of our\ncommon stock on December 31, 2020.\n                                                                                  \n  Government Office provision                                                     \n                                                                                  \nEmployees with applicable awards, including NEOs, are covered under the Firm\u2019s\nGovernment Office provision which allows for continued vesting of equity awards if\nthe employee resigns to accept a covered government office. For such employees who\nare full-career eligible, outstanding performance year awards continue to vest in\naccordance with their terms whether they leave the Firm to enter government\nservice or otherwise, so the Government Office provision does not provide any\nbenefit to employees who are full-career eligible. All NEOs meet the full-career\neligibility provision of their applicable awards. 1\n\nFor employees who are not full-career eligible, the value of awards that would\ncontinue to vest as a result of the Government Office provision of our equity plan\nwould equal a percentage of the unvested stock awards ranging from 0% prior to\nthree years of employment by the Firm to 50% after three years of employment\nincreasing to 100% after five years.\n\n1 Refer to Notes 3 and 5 on page 80.\n                                                      \n  2021 PROXY STATEMENT    79    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

awards. NEOs are not entitled to any additional equity awards\nin connection with a potential termination.\n\n2 Involuntary terminations without cause include involuntary terminations due to\nredundancies and involuntary terminations without alternative employment. For\n\u201cSeverance and other\u201d, amounts shown represent severance under the Firm\u2019s broad-\nbased U.S. Severance Pay Plan, or the U.K. Discretionary Redundancy Policy in the\ncase of Mr. Pinto. Base salary greater than $400,000 per year, or \u00a3275,000 in the\ncase of Mr. Pinto, is disregarded for purposes of determining severance amounts.\nThe rate used to convert Mr. Pinto\u2019s eligible severance to U.S. dollars was the\nblended spot rate for the month of December 2020, which was $1.34432 U.S. dollars\nper British pound sterling.\n\n3 For employees in good standing who have resigned and have met full-career\neligibility or other acceptable criteria, awards continue to vest over time on\ntheir original schedule, provided that the employees, for the remainder of the\nvesting period, do not perform services for a financial services company or work\nin their profession (whether or not for a financial services company); provided\nthat employees may work for a government, education or not-for-profit\norganization. The awards shown represent RSUs and PSUs that would continue to vest\nbecause the Named Executive Officers have met the full-career eligibility\ncriteria. The awards are subject to continuing post-employment obligations to the\nFirm during this period. In the case of disability, stock awards continue to vest\npursuant to their original vesting schedule.\n\n4 Vesting restrictions on stock awards and PSU awards lapse immediately upon\ndeath.\n\n5 The Government Office provision of an award does not provide any benefit to\nemployees who have met the full-career eligibility provision of that same award.\nTherefore, under the terms of the Government Office provision, Named Executive\nOfficers would generally not receive any benefit upon termination since they meet\nthe full-career eligibility provision entitling them to continued vesting of their\nequity awards (see preceding Note 4).\n\n6 For death, represents the value of PSUs granted on January 16, 2018, January 15,\n2019 and January 21, 2020, assuming: (a) maximum payout related to 2018, 2019 and\n2020 performance years; (b) target payout related to 2021 and 2022 performance\nyears; and (c) accumulated reinvested dividend equivalent shares as of December\n31, 2020. For involuntary without cause, full career eligibility provision and\ndisability, target payout is assumed for the PSUs granted on January 21, 2020.\n                                                      \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.    80    2021 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                                    \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION |CEO PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE  \n                                                    \nCEO pay ratio disclosure\n\nWe are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual\ntotal compensation of our estimated median employee and the annual total\ncompensation of Mr. Dimon, our Chairman and CEO.\n\nCEO PAY RATIO\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020:\n\n\u2022 The annual total compensation of Mr. Dimon was $31,671,589 1 , including Firm-\npaid employee benefits\n\n\u2022 The annual total compensation of our estimated median employee was $80,102,\nincluding Firm-paid employee benefits 2 and change in pension value\n\n\u2022 This represents a ratio of 395 to 1\n\nIDENTIFYING OUR MEDIAN EMPLOYEE\n\nFor our disclosure in the 2020 proxy statement, we identified our estimated median\nemployee using gross taxable payroll compensation as reported to our employees\u2019\nrespective national governments for the year ended December 31, 2017, i.e., Form\nW-2 gross taxable wages Box 1 for U.S. employees. For this year\u2019s disclosure, we\nhave identified a new estimated median employee using annual total compensation\nfor performance year 2020 based on data from the Firm's global compensation system\nas of February 28, 2021. This revised approach aligns more closely with how\nperformance year compensation is referenced internally at the Firm. Annual total\ncompensation includes salary as of December 31, 2020, as well as overtime pay,\nfixed allowance and incentive compensation, if applicable. We annualized the\nsalary portion of the compensation for employees who were hired during 2020;\nhowever, we did not make any full-time equivalent adjustments to part-time,\ntemporary and seasonal employees. We did not apply any cost-of-living adjustments\nas part of the calculation.\n\nIn determining the scope of our employees (other than our CEO), we included our\nglobal workforce of full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal employees who\nwere employed as of December 31, 2020.\n\nCOMPARABILITY\n\nWe believe the ratio above is a reasonable estimate, based on the methodology we\nhave described. Given the different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and\nassumptions other companies may use to calculate their respective CEO pay ratios,\nas well as differences in employment and compensation practices between companies,\nthe estimated ratio reported above may not be comparable to that reported by other\ncompanies.\n\n1 For purposes of the CEO pay ratio disclosure, Mr. Dimon\u2019s annual total\ncompensation includes the amount reported in the \u201cTotal\u201d column of the 2020\nSummary Compensation Table on page 73, plus the value of Firm-paid healthcare\nbenefits applicable to Mr. Dimon.\n\n2 The median employee\u2019s Firm-paid employee benefits include healthcare benefits\nand 401(k) retirement plan contributions.\n                                                      \n  2021 PROXY STATEMENT    81    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                                 \n  SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE  \n  OFFICERS| EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION               \n                                                 \nSecurity ownership of directors and\nexecutive officers\n\nOur share retention policies require\nshare ownership for directors and\nexecutive officers, as described on\npages 33 and 50, respectively.\n\nThe following table shows the number of\nshares of common stock and common stock\nequivalents beneficially owned by each\ndirector, the current executive\nofficers named in the SCT, and all\ndirectors and executive officers as a\ngroup as of February 28, 2021.

On\nMarch 16, 2021, the Compensation &\nManagement Development Committee\n(\u201cCMDC\u201d) adopted, subject to\nshareholder approval, the Amended and\nRestated JPMorgan Chase Long-Term\nIncentive Plan (the \u201c2021 Plan\u201d). The\n2021 Plan would supersede the 2018 Plan\nand apply to awards granted on or after\nMay 18, 2021.\n\nWe are submitting this proposal to our\nshareholders in response to feedback we\nreceived about our equity compensation\npractices during our annual shareholder\noutreach program. Our shareholders\nindicated a preference for more\nfrequent requests for approval of a\nsmaller quantity of shares, as opposed\nto requesting larger quantities less\nfrequently. As a result, the CMDC and\nthe Board considered this feedback in\ndetermining the number of shares to\nrequest for authorization under the\n2021 Plan.\n\nThe primary purpose of the 2021 Plan is\nto:\n\n\u2022 Renew the term of the 2018 Plan by\nfour years, to a term date of May 31,\n2025;\n\n\u2022 Authorize an additional 29 million\nshares, bringing the total number of\nauthorized shares to 85 million, which\nis unchanged from those approved by\nshareholders under the 2018 Plan; and\n\n\u2022 Continue to incorporate our non-\nemployee director compensation program\n(unchanged from the 2018 Plan),\nincluding:\n\n\u2013 Annual cash retainer of $100,000 and,\nif the non-employee director is on the\nBoard at the time when annual\nperformance year equity awards are\ngranted, an annual grant of deferred\nstock units valued at $250,000. The\nBoard is authorized in its discretion\nto increase the cash retainer and/or\nthe equity award by a combined total of\nup to $25,000, to decrease them, or to\nchange their form; and\n\n\u2013 Designated role cash retainers of:\n(i) $30,000 for serving as the Lead\nIndependent Director; (ii) $25,000 for\nchairing the JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\n(\u201cBank\u201d) board, Audit Committee or Risk\nCommittee; and (iii) $15,000 for\nchairing any other principal standing\ncommittee or for serving on any of the\nBank board, Audit Committee or Risk\nCommittee. The Board is authorized in\nits discretion to increase any of these\nretainers by up to $5,000, to decrease\nthem, or to change their form.\n\nThe 2021 Plan maintains many of the\ngovernance practices and features of\nthe 2018 Plan, including:\n\n\u2022 The exclusion of our stock\noption/stock appreciation rights\n(\u201cSARs\u201d) recycling feature;\n\n\u2022 The inclusion of a one year minimum\nvesting requirement on the 5% of shares\nthat are exempt from the minimum three\nyear vesting;\n\n\u2022 The reduction of the maximum number\nof shares that can be granted as\nIncentive Stock Options from 20 million\nto 7 million; and\n\n\u2022 The standard of review for actions\nunder the 2021 Plan.\n\nWhy shareholders should approve the\n2021 Plan\n\nWe believe that voting in favor of the\n2021 Plan is important, as a well-\ndesigned equity program serves to\nstrengthen the alignment of employees\u2019\nlong-term economic interests with those\nof shareholders while not causing\nunreasonable dilution to shareholders.\nWithout shareholder approval, the Firm\nwill lose a critical shareholder\nalignment feature of our compensation\nframework. The Firm is seeking\nshareholder approval one year before\nthe 2022 expiration of the 2018 Plan to\nensure that our compensation program\ncontinues to be aligned with the\ninterests of our shareholders.\n\nSummary of the 2021 Plan\n\nThe following summary of the 2021 Plan\nsets forth its material terms. It is,\nhowever, a summary and is qualified in\nits entirety by reference to the\ncomplete text of the 2021 Plan, a copy\nof which is attached as an Appendix.\n                                                                                  \n  Purpose and Participation                                                       \n                                                                                  \nThe 2021 Plan is designed to encourage\nemployees and non-employee members of\nthe Board to acquire a proprietary and\nvested interest in the long-term growth\nand performance of JPMorgan Chase and\nits subsidiaries.

May be awarded in the\nform of an \u201cincentive\u201d stock option or\na nonqualified stock option. Stock\noptions may not be exercisable later\nthan 10 years after their date of\ngrant. The CMDC will establish the\noption exercise price at the time the\noption is granted, provided that the\nexercise price may not be less than\n100% of the fair market value of a\nshare of common stock on the date of\ngrant. The exercise price shall be paid\nin full at the time of such exercise,\nwith the method and form of such\npayment determined by the CMDC from\ntime to time.\n\n\u2022 SARs . The CMDC may award SARs. Upon\nexercise, a SAR generally entitles a\nparticipant to receive an amount equal\nto the positive difference between the\nfair market value of a share of common\nstock on the date the SAR is exercised\nand the per share exercise price of the\nSAR, multiplied by the number of shares\nof common stock with respect to which\nthe SAR is exercised. SARs may not be\nexercisable later than 10 years after\nthe date they are granted. The exercise\nprice per share of common stock covered\nby a SAR is determined by the CMDC at\nthe time each SAR is granted; provided,\nhowever, that the exercise price may\nnot be less than 100% of the fair\nmarket value of a share of common stock\non the date of grant. SARs may be\ngranted independently of any award of\nstock options or in conjunction with\nall or any part of a stock options\naward, either at the same time the\naward of stock options is granted or at\nany later time during the term of such\noptions. If a SAR is granted in tandem\nwith a stock option, the exercise price\nof the SAR will not be less than 100%\nof the fair market value of a share of\ncommon stock on the date of grant. A\nSAR or applicable portion thereof\nallocated to a stock option shall\nterminate and no longer be exercisable\nupon the termination or exercise of any\nrelated stock option. The CMDC will\ndetermine at the date of grant whether\nthe SAR shall be settled in cash,\ncommon stock or a combination of cash\nand common stock.\n\n\u2022 Other Stock-Based Awards. The CMDC\nmay grant awards of common stock and\nother awards that are valued in whole\nor in part by reference to, or\notherwise based on the fair market\nvalue of common stock (\u201cOther Stock-\nBased Awards\u201d).

The discussion is based\nupon interpretations of the Internal\nRevenue Code in effect as of March 2021\nand regulations promulgated thereunder\nas of such date.\n\nThis discussion is not intended to, and\ndoes not, provide or supplement tax\nadvice to recipients of awards, and\nparticipants are advised to consult\nwith their own personal independent tax\nadvisors with respect to the specific\ntax consequences that, in light of\ntheir particular circumstances, might\narise in connection with their receipt\nof awards under the 2021 Plan,\nincluding, but not limited to, any\nstate, local or foreign tax\nconsequences and the effect, if any, of\ngift, estate and inheritance taxes.\n\nNonqualified Stock Option/Stock\nAppreciation Rights. Upon the grant of\na nonqualified stock option or SAR, a\nparticipant will not be in receipt of\ntaxable income. Upon exercise of either\na nonqualified stock option or a SAR, a\nparticipant will be in receipt of\nordinary income in an amount equal to\nthe excess of the fair market value of\nthe acquired shares of common stock\n(and/or cash) over the exercise price,\nand will be subject to FICA (Social\nSecurity and Medicare) tax in respect\nof such amounts. Gain or loss upon a\nsubsequent sale of any common stock\nwould be taxed to the participant as\nlong- or short-term capital gain or\nloss depending on the holding period.\n\nIncentive Stock Options. A participant\nwill not be in receipt of taxable\nincome upon the grant or exercise of an\nincentive stock option (\u201cISO\u201d). Upon\nthe exercise of an ISO, the amount by\nwhich the fair market value of the\nstock received on exercise exceeds the\nexercise price is generally a tax\npreference adjustment for the purpose\nof the alternative minimum tax. If the\nparticipant holds the shares acquired\non the exercise of an ISO for the\nrequisite ISO holding period set forth\nin the Internal Revenue Code, the\nparticipant generally\n\nwill recognize a long-term capital gain\nor loss upon their subsequent sale or\nexchange measured by the difference\nbetween the sale price and the exercise\nprice of the ISO. If a participant does\nnot hold the shares acquired on the\nexercise of an ISO for the requisite\nholding period, the participant may be\nin receipt of ordinary income based\nupon a formula set forth in the\nInternal Revenue Code, generally the\nlesser of (i) the difference between\nthe fair market value of the common\nstock on the date of exercise of the\nISO over the exercise price of the ISO\nand (ii) the amount realized upon the\ndisposition of the common stock\nacquired by the ISO over the exercise\nprice of the ISO. To the extent that\nthe amount realized on such sale or\nexchange exceeds the fair market value\nof the common stock on the date of the\nISO exercise, the participant will\ngenerally recognize capital gains.\n\nOther Stock-Based Awards. The income\ntax consequences of the Other Stock-\nBased Awards will depend on how such\nawards are structured. In the case of\nthe grant of a restricted stock unit\n(whether time-vested or subject to\nachievement of performance goals), a\nparticipant will not be in receipt of\ntaxable income. On delivery, a\nparticipant will be in receipt of\nordinary income in an amount equal to\nthe fair market value of the acquired\nshares of common stock (and/or cash).\nThe participant will be subject to FICA\n(Social Security and Medicare) tax at\nthe time any portion of a restricted\nstock unit is deemed vested for tax\npurposes. The fair market value of any\nacquired shares (if any) on the\ndelivery date will be the participant\u2019s\ntax basis for purposes of determining\nany subsequent gain or loss from the\nsale of the shares, and the\nparticipant\u2019s holding period with\nrespect to the shares will begin at the\ndelivery date.\n\nDeduction . Generally, JPMorgan Chase\nwill be entitled to a tax deduction\nequal to the amount recognized as\nordinary income (including on the\nexercise of a stock option or SAR or on\ndelivery pursuant to a restricted stock\nunit). However, we will generally not\nbe entitled to a tax deduction with\nrespect to any amount that represents\ncompensation in excess of $1 million\npaid to covered employees (other than\nawards pursuant to contracts entered\ninto prior to the repeal of the\nexemption for qualified performance-\nbased compensation under Section 162(m)\nof the Code that may remain eligible\nfor such exemption). For this purpose,\na \u201ccovered employee\u201d means our chief\nexecutive officer, our chief financial\nofficer and our three highest\ncompensated employees other than the\nchief executive officer and the chief\nfinancial officer (based on\ncompensation reported to our\nshareholders), and any individual who\nwas previously a covered employee at\nany time on or after January 1, 2017.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, we will not\nbe entitled to any tax deduction with\nrespect to an ISO, if the participant\nholds the shares acquired on the\nexercise of an ISO for the requisite\nISO holding period.\n                                                      \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.    88    2021 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                                                                  \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION| APPROVAL OF AMENDED AND RESTATED LONG-TERM INCENTIVE    \n  PLAN EFFECTIVE MAY 18, 2021                                                     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                                  \nOur equity compensation program\npromotes shareholder interests We\nbelieve our long-term incentive\ncompensation program serves a\nfundamental role in motivating our\nemployees to deliver sustained\nshareholder value by driving\nindividual, line of business and\nFirmwide results.

These benefits\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 the high quality of their audit work\nand accounting advice, as a result of\ntheir institutional knowledge of our\nbusinesses, global operations, key\nrisks, accounting policies, financial\nsystems and internal control framework;\n\n\u2022 their audit efficiency and\neffectiveness, which results in a lower\nfee structure due to their history and\nfamiliarity with our businesses;\n\n\u2022 the time and expense that would be\navoided by management and staff in\norder to onboard a new auditor; and\n\n\u2022 their commitment to maintaining their\nindependence from the Firm.\n\nA member of PwC will be present at the\nannual meeting and will have the\nopportunity to make a statement and\nrespond to appropriate questions from\nshareholders.\n\nBoard oversight of PwC\n\nThe Audit Committee held six private\nsessions with PwC during 2020.\n\nThe Audit Committee assesses PwC\u2019s\nindependence throughout the year. This\nincludes reviewing with PwC its\npractices for maintaining its\nindependence. The Audit Committee has\nalso established policies and\nprocedures for approving services\nprovided by PwC. It is JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\npolicy to use PwC only for audit and\naudit-related services, and tax\nservices in certain circumstances. For\nmore information see Audit Committee\nApproval Policies and Procedures on\npage 95.\n\nNo member of PwC\u2019s audit team may be\nhired by the Firm for a period of one\nyear after such person transferred from\nthe Firm\u2019s audit engagement to another\nrole at PwC, or has terminated\nemployment with PwC.

All requests for audit, audit-\nrelated and tax services that are not on the pre-approved list of specified\nservices must be approved by the Audit Committee.

Pre-approved services to be performed by PwC with\nestimated costs in excess of $250,000 are approved by the Chair of the Audit\nCommittee; and pre-approved services with estimated costs less than or equal to\n$250,000 are delegated to the Firmwide Controller\u2019s office for approval.\n                                                      \n  2021 PROXY STATEMENT    95    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                         \n  AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT| AUDIT MATTERS  \n                                         \nAudit Committee report\n\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of\nDirectors of JPMorgan Chase is\ncomprised of three non-management\ndirectors.

The purpose\nof the Audit Committee is to assist the\nBoard in its oversight of:\n\n\u2022 the independent registered public\naccounting firm\u2019s qualifications and\nindependence,\n\n\u2022 the performance of the Firm's\ninternal audit function and the\nindependent registered public\naccounting firm, and\n\n\u2022 management\u2019s responsibilities to\nassure that there is in place an\neffective system of controls reasonably\ndesigned to safeguard the assets and\nincome of the Firm; assure the\nintegrity of the Firm\u2019s financial\nstatements; and maintain compliance\nwith the Firm\u2019s ethical standards,\npolicies, plans and procedures, and\nwith laws and regulations.\n\nAudit communications and fees\n\nWe discussed with PwC the matters\nrequired to be discussed by Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board\n(\u201cPCAOB\u201d) Auditing Standard No. 1301,\nCommunications with Audit Committees,\nincluding PwC\u2019s overall audit scope and\naudit approach as set forth in the\nterms of their engagement letter; PwC\u2019s\noverall audit strategy for significant\naudit risks identified by them; and the\nnature and extent of the specialized\nskills necessary to perform the planned\naudit. We have established procedures\nto receive and track the handling of\nissues regarding accounting and\nreporting, internal control and\nauditing matters. In addition, we\nmonitor the audit, audit-related and\ntax services provided by PwC. The Audit\nCommittee has also evaluated and\nconcluded that audit-related and tax\nservices provided by PwC do not impair\nPwC\u2019s independence.\n\nDetails of the fees paid to PwC for its\nservices, as well as the Audit\nCommittee\u2019s \u201cpre-approval policy\u201d for\nsuch services, can be found on page 95.\n\nAssessment of PwC\n\nThe Audit Committee annually reviews\nPwC\u2019s qualifications, performance and\nindependence in connection with its\ndetermination as to whether to retain\nPwC.

PwC\nis responsible for performing an\nindependent audit of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nConsolidated Financial Statements and\nof the effectiveness of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting in\naccordance with auditing standards\npromulgated by the PCAOB. The Firm\u2019s\nInternal Audit function, under the\ndirection of the General Auditor, is\nindependent of the Firm\u2019s businesses\nand the Independent Risk Management\nfunction. Internal Audit reports\ndirectly to the Audit Committee (and\nadministratively to the Firm\u2019s CEO) and\nis responsible for preparing an annual\naudit plan and conducting internal\naudits intended to independently test\nand evaluate the Firm\u2019s governance,\nrisk management and internal controls.\nThe members of the Audit Committee are\nnot professionally engaged in the\npractice of accounting or auditing; as\nnoted above, the Audit Committee\u2019s\nresponsibility is to monitor and\noversee these processes.\n\nThe Audit Committee regularly meets and\nholds discussions with the Firm\u2019s\nmanagement, internal auditors and with\nPwC, and also holds private sessions\nwith the General Auditor and with PwC\nwithout members of\n\nmanagement present. These discussions\ninclude issues encountered during the\naudit, the Firm\u2019s quarterly earnings\nmaterials, and Quarterly and Annual\nReports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K,\nrespectively, prior to filing with the\nSEC; as well as actions the Audit\nCommittee has taken during the prior\nyear.\n\nManagement represented to us that\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s Consolidated Financial\nStatements were prepared in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of\nAmerica (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). We reviewed and\ndiscussed JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Consolidated\nFinancial Statements with management,\nthe General Auditor and PwC. We also\nreviewed and discussed with PwC the\nquality of the Firm\u2019s significant\naccounting principles, the\nreasonableness of critical accounting\nestimates and judgments, critical audit\nmatters PwC identified during the\naudit, and the disclosures in JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s Consolidated Financial\nStatements, including disclosures\nrelating to significant accounting\npolicies. We relied, without\nindependent verification, on the\ninformation provided to us and on the\nrepresentations made by management,\ninternal auditors and the independent\nauditor. Based on our review of the\nreports given to us by PwC and our\ndiscussions with the Firm\u2019s management,\ninternal auditors and PwC, as well as\ntheir respective representations to us,\nwe recommended to the Board, and the\nBoard approved, inclusion of the\naudited Consolidated Financial\nStatements in the 2020 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K, as filed with the SEC.\n\nDated as of March 15, 2021\n                                                                                  \n  Audit Committee                                                                 \n                                                                                  \nTimothy P.

Currently it takes the\nformal backing 27% of all shares that\nnormally cast ballots at the annual\nmeeting to do so little ask for a\nrecord date for written consent.\nRequiring the formal backing 27% of\nshares to do so little ask for a record\ndate cuts shareholders off at the\nknees. Why would anyone use written\nconsent when the same 27% of shares can\ncall a special meeting? Plus at a\nspecial meeting one does not need a\n70%-vote. And any action taken by\nwritten consent would still need 70%\nsupermajority approval from the shares\nthat normally cast ballots at the\nannual meeting. This 70% vote\nrequirement gives overwhelming\nsupermajority protection to management\nstatus quo mentality in a rapidly\nchanging business environment that will\nremain unchanged. Enabling 10% of\nshares to apply for a record date for\nwritten consent makes sense because\nscores of companies do not even require\n01% of stock ownership to do so little\nas request a record date. Taking action\nby written consent is a means\nshareholders can use to raise important\nmatters outside the normal annual\nmeeting cycle like the election of a\nnew director. For instance shareholders\nmight determine that a poor performing\ndirector is in need of replacement. Mr.\nLee Raymond was rejected by 338 million\nvotes in 2020. These 338 million\nrejection votes were 40-times the\nrejection votes received by Ms. Linda\nBammann. Now more than ever\nshareholders need a more viable option\nto take action outside of a shareholder\nmeeting since online shareholder\nmeetings are a shareholder engagement\nwasteland. With the near universal use\nof online annual shareholder meetings,\nwhich can be only 10-minutes of stilted\nformalities, shareholders no longer\nhave the right for engagement with\nother shareholders, management and\ndirectors at a shareholder meeting.\nSpecial shareholder meetings can now be\nonline meetings which has an inferior\nformat to even a free Zoom meeting.\nShareholders are also severely\nrestricted in making their views known\nat online shareholder meetings because\nall challenging questions and comments\ncan be screened out by management. For\nexample the Goodyear online shareholder\nmeeting was spoiled by a trigger-happy\nmanagement mute button that was used to\nquash constructive shareholder\ncriticism. AT&T, with 3000\ninstitutional shareholders, would not\neven allow shareholders to speak at its\nonline shareholder meeting.\n\nAnd even if management pledges to\nfollow best practices in conducting an\nonline shareholder meeting management\ncan change abruptly when storm clouds\nappear due to subpar management\nperformance. Now more than ever\nshareholders need a more viable option\nto take action outside of a shareholder\nmeeting since online shareholder\nmeetings are a shareholder engagement\nwasteland. Proposal 5 - Improve\nShareholder Written Consent Board\nResponse to Proposal 5 The Board of\nDirectors recommends that shareholders\nvote AGAINST this proposal for the\nfollowing reasons:\n                                                                                  \n  \u2022JPMorgan Chase already provides shareholders the ability to take action by     \n  written consent.                                                                \n  \u2022Shareholders approved our existing written consent provisions with an          \n  overwhelming majority of 97% of votes cast in favor.                            \n  \u2022Only 31% of S&P 500 companies have any charter or bylaw provisions that        \n  provide shareholders the right to act by written consent.                       \n  \u2022The current written consent provisions strike the right balance between        \n  protecting the interests of the Firm and all our shareholders, and avoiding a   \n  waste of resources to address narrowly supported interests.                     \n  \u2022The Firm's approach to written consent is part of our overall strong           \n  governance practices.                                                           \n                                                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase already provides for\nshareholder initiated written consent\nin our Certificate of Incorporation\n(\"Written Consent Provisions\").\nShareholders approved our existing\nWritten Consent Provisions, including\nthe ownership threshold required to\nseek action by written consent, by an\noverwhelming majority of 97% of votes\ncast in favor. The Firm\u2019s Written\nConsent Provisions provide a\nshareholder a right only 31% of S&P 500\ncompanies provide. In addition, in the\ncontext of the Firm\u2019s strong corporate\ngovernance practices, the Board\nbelieves that the existing Written\nConsent Provisions strike the right\nbalance between enabling our\nshareholders to initiate corporate\naction and safeguarding against the\nsubstantial administrative and\nfinancial burden required to effect\nwritten consent solicitations that may\nonly be relevant to narrow\nconstituencies. Our strong corporate\ngovernance practices include the\nshareholder rights available under the\nFirm\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation and\nBy-Laws, and the Firm\u2019s commitment to\nshareholder engagement. Under the\nFirm\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation and\nBy-Laws, shareholders have the right to\n                                                      \n  2021 PROXY STATEMENT    99    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                         \n  SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                         \nproxy access, call a special meeting\nand annually elect directors by\nmajority vote. More information about\nshareholder rights can be found on page\n34 of this Proxy. The Firm\u2019s corporate\ngovernance practices also allow\nshareholders to engage directly with\nour Board, hold the Board accountable\nand, if necessary, take action to\nsupport their interests. The Firm also\nactively engages with shareholders on a\nwide variety of topics throughout the\nyear. Every year, the Firm conducts a\ncomprehensive formal shareholder\noutreach program. In 2020, through this\nprogram, the Firm reached out to over\n100 of the Firm's largest shareholders,\ntogether representing over 50% of the\nFirm's outstanding common stock. Also\nin 2020, senior management hosted\napproximately 40 investor meetings and\npresented at approximately 10 investor\nconferences as well as the Firm's 2020\nInvestor Day. More information about\nour shareholder engagement can be found\non page 30 of this Proxy. In addition,\nour virtual annual meeting format\nprovided shareholders with the\nopportunity to hear from and ask\nquestions of the Board. More than 400\nshareholders attended our virtual\nannual meeting in 2020, representing an\nincrease of more than 800% from the\nprevious annual meeting.\n\nContrary to the proposal's claim\nregarding a 27% threshold, the current\nWritten Consent Provisions allow\nshareholders who own at least 20% of\nour outstanding shares of common stock\nand who satisfy the other requirements\nset forth in the Certificate of\nIncorporation to seek corporate action\nby written consent. Also contrary to\nthe proposal's claim regarding a\nsupermajority approval requirement, any\naction taken by written consent is\ndecided by the vote of a simple\nmajority of votes cast by the\nshareholders present and entitled to\nvote. The Firm already has Written\nConsent Provisions that strike the\nright balance between shareholder\nrights and appropriate safeguards and\nis committed to strong corporate\ngovernance practices that promote long-\nterm shareholder value. The Board\nbelieves that this proposal is\nunnecessary and will not further\nshareholder interests.\n                                       \n  The Board of Directors recommends a  \n  voteAGAINSTthis proposal.            \n                                       \n                                                       \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.    100    2021 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                                       \nTable of Contents\n                         \n  SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                         \nProposal 6 \u2013 Racial equity audit and\nreport\n\nThe CtW Investment Group has advised us\nthat it intends to introduce the\nfollowing resolution: RESOLVED that\nshareholders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n(\u201cJPMorgan\u201d) urge the Board of\nDirectors to oversee a racial equity\naudit analyzing JPMorgan\u2019s adverse\nimpacts on nonwhite stakeholders and\ncommunities of color. Input from civil\nrights organizations, employees, and\ncustomers should be considered in\ndetermining the specific matters to be\nanalyzed. A report on the audit,\nprepared at reasonable cost and\nomitting confidential or proprietary\ninformation, should be publicly\ndisclosed on JPMorgan\u2019s website.\nSUPPORTING STATEMENT High-profile\npolice killings of Black people\u2014most\nrecently George Floyd\u2014have galvanized\nthe movement for racial justice. That\nmovement, together with the\ndisproportionate impacts of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic have focused the\nattention of the media, the public and\npolicy makers on systemic racism,\nracialized violence and inequities in\nemployment, health care, and the\ncriminal justice system. In October\n2020, JPMorgan committed $30 billion\nover five years to further racial\nequity. JPMorgan has a conflicted\nhistory when it comes to addressing\nracial injustice within the communities\nit serves. The company has faced\nseveral lawsuits related to\ndiscriminatory lending practices\nagainst communities of color, including\na federal lawsuit that settled for $55\nmillion related to mortgage\ndiscrimination. JPMorgan has closed\nnumerous branches in majority-Black\ncommunities, reducing its number of\nbranches to 22.8% from 2010 to 2018. A\nwidely publicized 2019 New York Times\narticle documented JPMorgan\u2019s overt\ndiscriminatory practices against both\nits clients and employees, including\nthe belittling of a Black client as\n\u201csomebody who is coming from Section\n8.\u201d 1 More recently, by the end of the\nfirst round of the Paycheck Protection\nProgram (\u201cPPP\u201d), 70% of the loans\nissued by JPMorgan, the nation\u2019s\nlargest PPP issuer, went to majority\nwhite congressional districts. The\ncompany also faces several lawsuits\nfrom Black and Hispanic employees\nalleging they were assigned poorer,\nless profitable locations or lower\nincome branches. In early 2020, a\nproposed class action was filed\nalleging JPMorgan had a \u201csegregated\nemployment policy\u201d that placed Black\npersonal bankers in lower income\nbranches and offered them fewer\npromotional opportunities. That case\nhas been stayed pending arbitration.\nThe company also faces a pending suit\nrelated to claims made by a long-time\nBlack secretary of being subject to\nrepeated bullying and microaggressions\nby other JPMorgan employees. JPMorgan\u2019s\ncharitable contributions are not fully\naligned with its public statements.\nJPMorgan has contributed to police\nfoundations in New York and New\nOrleans, which bypass normal\nprocurement processes to buy equipment\nfor police departments, including\nsurveillance technology that has been\n\nused to target communities of color and\nnonviolent protestors. A racial equity\naudit would help JPMorgan identify,\nprioritize, remedy and avoid adverse\nimpacts on nonwhite stakeholders and\ncommunities of color. We urge JPMorgan\nto assess its behavior through a racial\nequity lens in order to obtain a\ncomplete picture of how it contributes\nto, and could help dismantle, systemic\nracism. 1 Emily Flitter, New York Times\n, \u201cThis is what racism sounds like in\nthe banking industry,\u201d December 14,\n2019, available at https://www.nytimes.\ncom/2019/12/11/business/jpmorgan-\nbanking-racism.html. Board Response to\nProposal 6 The Board of Directors\nrecommends that shareholders vote\nAGAINST this proposal for the following\nreasons:\n                                                                                  \n  \u2022The Firm is committed to maintaining a culture of respect and inclusion and    \n  to advancing racial equity, and we have taken significant steps to combat       \n  systemic racism in the communities in which we are present.                     \n  \u2022In developing our commitments to advance racial equity, we considered the      \n  impact of our businesses, products and services on all our stakeholders,        \n  including our employees, customers and suppliers, and the communities in which  \n  we are present.                                                                 \n  \u2022Our commitments include continued extensive engagement with stakeholders who   \n  are impacted by our activities.                                                 \n  \u2022We have developed a formal accountability process which considers feedback     \n  from our partners at both the national and local level, and strengthens the     \n  way we incorporate diversity, equity and inclusion priorities and progress      \n  into year-end performance evaluations and compensation decisions.               \n  \u2022We believe our Board provides effective oversight of culture and human         \n  capital management, in addition to our lending and charitable contributions     \n  practices.                                                                      \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm is committed to maintaining a\nculture of respect and inclusion and to\nadvancing racial equity, and we have\ntaken significant steps to combat\nsystemic racism in the communities in\nwhich we work. Integrity, fairness and\nresponsibility are foundational\nprinciples at JPMorgan Chase & Co. We\nbelieve there is no place for racism,\nprejudice or discrimination within the\nFirm or elsewhere. Where we have\nchallenges, or can improve, we seek to\ndo better. We have made and continue to\nmake substantial commitments to advance\nracial equity and combat systemic\nracism. These include: \u2022 Committing $30\nbillion through business, community and\npolicy solutions to close the racial\nwealth divide, support employees and\nbreak down barriers of systemic racism\n(for\n                                                       \n  2021 PROXY STATEMENT    101    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.  \n                                                       \nTable of Contents\n                         \n  SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                         \nmore information, please see page 6 of\nthis proxy and our website at\njpmorganchase.com/impact/path-forward;\n\u2022 Increasing diversity, equity and\ninclusion and equality across\nleadership, underrepresented groups and\nat the Company, overall; \u2022 Continuing\ninvestments in Advancing Black Pathways\nin an effort to strengthen the economic\nfoundation of the Black community (for\nmore information on Advancing Black\nPathways, see page 60 of this proxy);\nand \u2022 Building on the Firm's supplier\ndiversity efforts by spending an\nadditional $750 million with Black and\nLatinx suppliers. In developing our\ncommitments to advance racial equity,\nwe considered the impact of our\nbusinesses, products and services on\nall our stakeholders, including our\nemployees, customers and suppliers, and\nthe communities in which we are\npresent. We reviewed data and conducted\nan analysis of the Firm\u2019s existing\ncommitments and programs and additional\nactions the Firm could take to make\nmeaningful advances in equity and\ninclusion for the Firm. In addition to\nour ongoing engagement with\nstakeholders, we solicited input and\nsought feedback from more than 65\nexternal organizations, local community\ngroups and philanthropic partners, as\nwell as employees and customers to\ndefine priority areas of focus and\ngoals. Our commitments include\ncontinued extensive engagement with\nstakeholders who are impacted by our\nactivities, and we have developed a\nformal accountability process which\nconsiders feedback from our external\npartners at both the national and local\nlevel and regularly provides updates on\nprogress. Through the Chase Advisory\nPanel program, our senior executives\nengage with national civil rights\norganizations and consumer policy\ngroups to discuss issues related to the\nFirm\u2019s products, policies, customer\nfacing practices and communications,\nand public policy issues. On a local\nlevel, in each of the 25 cities we have\ntargeted for our racial equity efforts,\nwe engage community stakeholders,\nincluding a diverse set of nonprofits,\nadvocacy organizations and local\ncommunity groups, to understand local\nneeds and develop recommendations that\nshape local investments. Through this\neffort, we expect to engage this year\nwith nearly 300 national and local\norganizations. Regular meetings will\nprovide transparency, as we report our\nprogress, respond to feedback and\nremain accountable to our stakeholders\nto address the problems we set out to\nsolve.\n\nWe have established an executive\naccountability framework, which\nstrengthens the way JPMorgan Chase\nincorporates diversity, equity and\ninclusion priorities and progress into\nyear-end performance evaluations and\ncompensation decisions for members of\nthe Operating Committee and their\ndirect reports. It will also position\nthe Firm to drive additional\naccountability to managers throughout\nthe Firm. Additionally, we believe that\ntransparency will enable all of our\nstakeholders to hold us accountable.\nDetails about our commitments are\navailable on our website\njpmorganchase.com/impact/path-forward.\nOne example of how we are applying a\nracial equity lens is our hiring\nprocess. We are intentionally focused\non hiring diverse talent and have\nlaunched initiatives focused on\nunderrepresented ethnic groups, as well\nas women, people with disabilities,\nveterans and others. Through our\nAdvancing Black Pathways initiative, we\nstrive to increase representation of\nBlack talent across the Firm and have\ncommitted to hiring more than 4,000\nblack students over five years for\napprenticeships, internships and post-\ngraduation roles. We believe our Board\nprovides effective oversight of culture\nand human capital management, in\naddition to our lending and charitable\ncontributions practices. It is deeply\ncommitted to advancing racial equity\nand has set expectations for\nachievement. The full Board provides\nrigorous oversight of our efforts and\nreceives regular detailed updates on\nour progress, and the CMDC and PRC\nconsider racial equity relevant to\ntheir respective oversight\nresponsibilities. We believe we are\ntaking appropriate action to address\nthe issues raised in the proposal,\nparticularly with respect to\nidentifying, prioritizing, remedying\nand avoiding adverse impacts of our\nbusiness, and we have embarked on an\neffective path forward. The work to\nadvance racial equity is complex and we\nare determined to get it right.\nConducting a racial equity audit at\nthis point in time would not provide us\nwith useful additional information. We\nbelieve our shareholders would be\nbetter served by the Firm\u2019s vigilant\nfocus on building on current momentum\nto maintain a culture of respect and\ninclusion and advance racial equity.\n                                       \n  The Board of Directors recommends a  \n  voteAGAINSTthis proposal.            \n                                       \n                                                       \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.    102    2021 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                                       \nTable of Contents\n                         \n  SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                         \nProposal 7 \u2013 Independent board chairman\n\nJohn Chevedden, on behalf of Kenneth\nSteiner, has advised us that he intends\nto introduce the following resolution:\nShareholders request that our Board of\nDirectors adopt as policy, and amend\nthe bylaws as necessary, to require the\nChair of the Board of Directors,\nwhenever possible, to be an independent\nmember of the Board. This policy could\nbe phased in for the next CEO\ntransition. If the Board determines\nthat a Chair is no longer independent,\nthe Board shall select a new Chair who\nsatisfies the requirements of the\npolicy within a reasonable amount of\ntime. Compliance with this policy is\ntemporarily waived if in the unlikely\nevent no independent director is\navailable and willing to serve as\nChair. This proposal topic won 52%\nsupport at Boeing and 54% support at\nBaxter International in 2020. Boeing\nadopted this proposal topic in June\n2020. The roles of Chairman and CEO are\nfundamentally different and should be\nheld by 2 directors, a CEO and a\nChairman who is completely independent\nof the CEO and our company. \u2022 The role\nof the CEO and management is to run the\ncompany. \u2022 The role of the Board of\nDirectors is to provide independent\noversight of management and the CEO. \u2022\nThere is potential conflict of interest\nfor a CEO to have the oversight role of\nChairman. It is more important to have\nan independent Chairman of the Board\nsince our 2020 Lead Director, Mr. Lee\nRaymond, at age 82, has 20-years long-\ntenure. Long-tenure in a director is\nthe opposite of independence and\nindependence can be the most important\nattribute for a director \u2014 especially a\nLead Director. Plus Mr. Raymond serves\non no other major Board of Directors to\nkeep his skills up to date.\nShareholders are becoming impatient\nwith Mr. Raymond and he was rejected by\nmore votes than any other director in\n2020. Mr. Raymond was rejected by\n3-times as many votes as Mr. James\nDimon and 40-times as many votes as Ms.\nLinda Bammann. A Lead Director has a\nrisk management role. Mr. Raymond spent\nmost of his long Exxon Mobil career\ncovering up the enormous risk of\nclimate change. Mr. Dimopn's [sic] role\nin selecting Mr. Raymond as Lead\nDirector reflects poorly on Mr. Dimon\nand shows that Mr. Dimon's goal is to\nhave a lap dog Lead Director as long as\npossible. This proposal topic won our\n41%-support at the 2020 JPM annual\nmeeting. This was probably close to\n51%-support from the shares that have\naccess to independent proxy voting\nadvice. Unfortunately most retail\nshareholders do not have access to\nindependent proxy voting advice.\n\nThis 41%-support in 2020 was in spite\nof JPM management having its hand on\nthe scale by forcing JPM shareholders\nto pay for lavish advertising against\nthis proposal topic. Shareholders can\ncheck on EDGAR a week before the annual\nmeeting to see if management repeats\nthis frequent JPM hand-on-the scale\npractice in 2021. Please vote yes:\nIndependent Board Chairman \u2014 Proposal 7\nBoard Response to Proposal 7 The Board\nof Directors recommends that\nshareholders vote AGAINST this proposal\nfor the following reasons:\n                                                                                  \n  \u2022In exercising its fiduciary duty, the Board believes it is important to        \n  retain the flexibility to determine the leadership structure that will best     \n  serve shareholders' interests.                                                  \n  \u2022The combined Chairman and CEO role currently provides the Firm and the Board   \n  with strong leadership and continuity of expertise.                             \n  \u2022The Lead Independent Director provides an independent counterbalance to the    \n  Chairman.                                                                       \n  \u2022The Board annually reviews its leadership structure.                           \n  \u2022The Board's leadership structure is consistent with the majority of top U.S.   \n  public companies.                                                               \n                                                                                  \nThe Board believes its responsibilities\nto shareholders are best fulfilled by\nretaining flexibility to determine the\nright leadership structure for the\ncircumstances. Any decision to separate\nthe Chairman and CEO roles should not\nbe mechanical; it should be contextual\nbased on the composition of the Board,\nthe individual serving as CEO and the\nneeds and opportunities of the Firm.\nThe Board has separated the Chairman\nand CEO positions in the past and will\ndo so again if it believes that it is\nin the best interests of shareholders.\nThe proposed policy would restrict the\nBoard's discretion to use its\nexperience, judgment, and ongoing\nshareholder feedback, to make the best-\ninformed decision on its leadership\nstructure. The Firm\u2019s Corporate\nGovernance Principles require that the\nindependent directors annually\ndetermine whether the Chairman and CEO\npositions should be held by the same\nindividual. If the independent\ndirectors conclude that an independent\nChairman is in the best interests of\nour shareholders, they will appoint\none. If they determine that the roles\nshould be held by one person, they will\nappoint a Lead Independent Director,\nproviding for strong independent\noversight.\n                                                       \n  2021 PROXY STATEMENT    103    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.  \n                                                       \nTable of Contents\n                         \n  SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                         \nThe Lead Independent Director provides\nan independent counterbalance to the\nChairman by focusing on the Board's\npriorities and promoting open dialogue\namong the independent directors during\nand between Board meetings in executive\nsessions. The role is robust and\nincludes the authority to call Board\nand independent director meetings and\nto approve Board agendas. The Lead\nIndependent Director guides discussions\nregarding the Chairman and CEO's annual\nperformance, compensation and\ndiscussions regarding CEO succession.\nIn March 2021, in the independent\ndirectors' annual review of Board\nleadership structure, they determined\nthat a combined Chairman and CEO, with\na robust Lead Independent Director\nrole, continues to provide the Board\nwith strong leadership and independent\noversight of management and serves to\nprotect shareholder interests. In\nmaking this determination, they\nconsidered the factors described on\npage 23, the Firm\u2019s governance\npractices, which include executive\nsessions of independent directors as\npart of each regularly scheduled Board\nmeeting, and the directors' frequent\nand open interactions with senior\nmanagement including management\npresentations to the Board and its\ncommittees, Board dinners, annual\nsenior leaders' meetings and informal\nsessions with members of the Operating\nCommittee and other senior leaders.\n\nIn connection with the determination of\nits leadership structure, the Board re-\nappointed Stephen B. Burke to serve as\nLead Independent Director, taking into\naccount his background and experience,\nincluding his in-depth knowledge of the\nFirm and its businesses, and strong\ninterpersonal skills, demonstrated\nindependent judgment and financial and\noperational track record as former CEO\nof NBCUniversal. These attributes allow\nMr. Burke to act as a robust and\nindependent counterbalance to the\nChairman and CEO. While we recognize\nthere are different views, a majority\nof the Firm's shareholders supported\nthe Board's ability to determine its\nleadership structure, as evidenced by\nrepeated votes against proposals that\nwould mandate a separation of the\nChairman and CEO roles and eliminate\nBoard discretion. Further, the Board\u2019s\nposition is consistent with the\npractices of other large companies.\nAccording to Shearman & Sterling\u2019s 2020\nCorporate Governance & Executive\nCompensation Survey, of the top 100\nU.S. public companies, only 39 have a\nseparate chairman and CEO, and even\nfewer, only 25 of those board chairs\nare independent. These statistics\nsupport the Board\u2019s view that it should\nretain the flexibility to determine the\nleadership structure that will best\nserve the interests of the Firm and its\nshareholders.\n                                       \n  The Board of Directors recommends a  \n  voteAGAINSTthis proposal.            \n                                       \n                                                       \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.    104    2021 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                                       \nTable of Contents\n                         \n  SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                         \nProposal 8 \u2013 Political and\nelectioneering expenditure congruency\nreport\n\nRhia Ventures on behalf of Jonathan\nWeinstock has advised us that it\nintends to introduce the following\nresolution: Whereas: The Public\nResponsibility Committee of our\ncompany\u2019s Board of Directors reviews\nsignificant policies and practices\nregarding political contributions,\nmajor lobbying priorities and principal\ntrade association memberships,\nincluding their continued relevance to\nour company\u2019s public policy objectives.\nThe Government Relations and Public\nPolicy (GRPP) group of JP Morgan & Co.\n(\u201cJP Morgan\u201d) directs our company\u2019s\npolitical spending for both the\ncorporate treasury and our political\naction committees (PACs). However, some\nof JP Morgan's politically focused\nexpenditures appear to undermine the\ncompany's values and interests. JP\nMorgan has affirmed its support for the\nParis Climate Accord and sponsors\nmultiple operational and financial\ninitiatives to support a transition to\na lower-carbon economy. Our company has\nimplemented exemplary LGBTQ workplace\npolicies and is a recognized friend and\nally to that community. Our Women on\nthe Move initiative provides a platform\nfor networking and career development\nat all levels of the company and is\nexpanding credit and opportunity to\nfemale clients and customers as well.\nManagement is working to expand\nsupportive policies to working parents\nand their families. However, in\ncontrast to these stated and implied\nvalues, JP Morgan has: \u2022 Repeatedly\ncontributed to a 527 organization that\nhas led efforts to prevent enforcement\nof the EPA's Clean Power Plan; \u2022\nConsistently made direct donations to\ncandidates opposing LGBTQ equality, and\ngiven more than $185,000 in five recent\nelection cycles (2010 \u2014 2018) to a 527\norganization that uses these donations\nto fund politicians who have attacked\nLGBTQ equality and also worked to\nundermine women's reproductive rights;\n\u2022 Contributed over the last three\nelection cycles (2016 \u2014 2020) at least\n$2.8 million to anti-choice candidates\nand political committees from the\ncorporate treasury and company-\nsponsored political action committees,\naccording to an analysis conducted by\nthe Sustainable Investments Institute.\nThe GRPP does not provide transparent\nexplanations as to why J.P. Morgan's\npolitically focused expenditures appear\nto be misaligned with the company's\nvalues and interests. Proponents\nbelieve that JP Morgan should establish\npolicies and reporting systems that\nminimize risk to the firm's reputation\nand brand by addressing possible\nmissteps in corporate electioneering\nand political spending that contrast\nwith our company's stated and implied\nvalues.\n\nResolved: JP Morgan publish an annual\nreport, at reasonable expense,\nanalyzing the congruency of political\nand electioneering expenditures during\nthe preceding year against publicly\nstated company values and policies.\nSupporting Statement: Proponents\nrecommend that such report also contain\nmanagement's analysis of risks to our\ncompany's brand, reputation, or\nshareholder value of expenditures in\nconflict with publicly stated company\nvalues. \"Expenditures for\nelectioneering communications\" means\nspending, from the corporate treasury\nand from the PACs, directly or through\na third party, at any time during the\nyear, on printed, internet or broadcast\ncommunications, which are reasonably\nsusceptible to interpretation as in\nsupport of or opposition to a specific\ncandidate. Board Response to Proposal 8\nThe Board of Directors recommends that\nshareholders vote AGAINST this proposal\nfor the following reasons:\n                                                                                  \n  \u2022JPMorgan Chase has long been engaged in the political process, and believe it  \n  is in shareholders' best interest that we do so.                                \n  \u2022Governance and transparency are important components of our approach. Our      \n  lobbying and political activities, as well as our governance and oversight      \n  practices, are described in detail on the Political Engagement and Public       \n  Policy Statement page of our website.                                           \n  \u2022The Firm has paused all giving from its PAC to evaluate our overall PAC        \n  mission, governance and giving strategies.

Because of the potential impact\npublic policy can have on our\nbusinesses, employees, communities and\ncustomers, we believe it is important\nto engage with policymakers in order to\nadvance and protect the long-term\ninterests of the Firm. Governance and\ntransparency are important components\nof our approach. Our lobbying and\npolitical activities, as well as our\ngovernance and oversight practices, are\ndescribed in detail on the Political\nEngagement and Public Policy Statement\npage of our website, which also\nincludes our annual Political\nEngagement Reports and information\nabout our trade association memberships\nand payments. Our policies prohibit the\nuse of corporate funds to contribute to\ncandidates, political party committees\nand PACs. The Firm does not use\ncorporate funds to make independent\npolitical expenditures or\nelectioneering communications, and\nrestricts\n                                                       \n  2021 PROXY STATEMENT    105    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.  \n                                                       \nTable of Contents\n                         \n  SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                         \ntrade associations to which we belong\nfrom using our membership dues for any\nsuch election-related activity.

The GRPP team reports to the\nHead of Corporate Responsibility who\nregularly reports to the PRC of the\nBoard regarding the Firm\u2019s political\nactivity, expenditures and engagement.\nAt least once per year, the PRC reviews\nthe Firm's significant policies and\npractices regarding political\ncontributions, major lobbying\npriorities and principal trade\nassociation memberships, including\ntheir continued relevance to the Firm's\npublic policy objectives. This\norganization and leadership helps us\nfocus the Firm\u2019s political engagement\nefforts on those public policy issues\nmost relevant to the long-term\ninterests of the Firm and our clients\nand shareholders. Given our prudent\npolicies and practices described above\nand in our Policy Statement, we\nreceived a \u201cTrendsetter\u201d ranking\n(scoring 90 percent or higher, with a\nscore of over 97 percent) for political\ndisclosure and accountability by the\nmost recent Center for Political\nAccountability-Zicklin Index of\nCorporate Political Accountability and\nDisclosure, which ranks the political\nspending disclosure of S&P 500\ncompanies.\n\nThe JPMorgan Chase PAC is funded\nentirely by voluntary contributions\nfrom eligible employees. They support\ncandidates, parties and committees\nwhose views on specific issues are\nconsistent with the Firm\u2019s priorities,\nprioritizing candidates that represent\ncommunities we serve, serve in\nleadership positions and demonstrate\nsupport for policies of importance to\nthe Firm. Contributions are made on a\nbi-partisan basis and are not made to\ncandidates running for U.S. president.\nMore recently, the violence at the U.S.\nCapitol on January 6, 2021 prompted us\nto pause all giving from the JPMorgan\nChase PAC.

This process enables us to\nexpedite delivery of materials to our\nshareholders and reduces the costs to\nus of printing and mailing paper proxy\nmaterials.\n\nIn accordance with the Notice and\nAccess rules, on or about April 7,\n2021, we sent those current\nshareholders of record on March 19,\n2021, the Record Date for the annual\nmeeting, a Notice. The Notice contains\ninstructions on how to access our proxy\nstatement and annual report online. If\nyou received a Notice, you will not\nreceive a printed copy of the proxy\nmaterials in the mail.\n\nIf you received a Notice, and would\nlike to receive copies of our proxy\nmaterials in print by mail, or\nelectronically by email, please follow\nthe instructions in the Notice.\n\nShareholders who do not receive the\nNotice will receive either by mail a\npaper, or by email an electronic, copy\nof our proxy statement and 2020 Annual\nReport to Shareholders, which will be\nsent on or about April 7, 2021.\n\nHow can I obtain an additional proxy\ncard?\n\nShareholders of record can contact the\nOffice of the Secretary by sending an\nemail to\ncorporate.secretary@jpmchase.com or\ncalling (212) 270-6000.\n\nIf you hold your shares of common stock\nin street name, contact your account\nrepresentative at the bank, brokerage\nfirm, broker-dealer or similar\norganization through which you hold\nyour shares.\n                                                       \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.    110    2021 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                                       \nTable of Contents\n                                                    \n  INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL SHAREHOLDER MEETING  \n                                                    \nHow do I sign up for electronic\ndelivery of proxy materials?\n\nThis proxy statement and our 2020\nAnnual Report to Shareholders are\navailable on our website at:\njpmorganchase.com.

The Firm reviews the results of the lines of business on a \u201cmanaged\u201d basis. The\nFirm\u2019s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S.\nGAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue\nfor the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on a fully taxable-\nequivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits\nand tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis\ncomparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow\nmanagement to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from\nboth taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related\nto tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have\nno impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of\nbusiness.\n\n2.
