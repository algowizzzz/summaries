Certain\nOfficers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (the \u201cFirm\u201d) announced that the independent members of the Board of Directors (the\n\u201cBoard\u201d) approved the annual compensation for 2022 for Mr. James Dimon, CEO, in the amount of $34,500,000,\nwhich is unchanged from his annual compensation last year. There was no special award granted to Mr. Dimon\nin 2022 and the Board has committed to not grant any special awards to him in the future.\n\nMr. Dimon\u2019s total compensation includes an annual base salary of $1,500,000 and performance-based variable\nincentive compensation of $33,000,000. $5,000,000 of the variable incentive compensation will be delivered\nin cash and the remaining $28,000,000 will be delivered in the form of at-risk Performance Share Units\n(\"PSUs\"). PSUs tie 100% of Mr. Dimon\u2019s annual equity-based compensation to ongoing performance metrics,\namounting to 85% of his total variable incentive compensation. The amounts of base salary, cash incentive\nand PSUs remain unchanged from last year. The key features of the PSU program are also consistent with last\nyear, including the financial metric (return on tangible common equity 1 - \"ROTCE\") with absolute and\nrelative performance goals, payout levels, vesting and hold requirements, as well as clawback and recovery\nprovisions 2 .\n\nAmid the significant challenges of strong competition, growing geopolitical tensions, global economic\nuncertainty, mounting inflation and higher rates, and the lingering impacts of COVID-19, under Mr. Dimon's\nstewardship, the Firm continued to serve its clients and customers around the world during a time of\nunprecedented business demands, while investing in and executing on long-term strategic initiatives. In 2022\nthe Firm reported record revenue for the 5th consecutive year of $132.3 billion 1 and net income of $37.7\nbillion, or $12.09 per share, with ROTCE of 18%. The Firm maintained its quarterly common dividend of $1.00\nper share and continued to reinforce its fortress balance sheet.\n\nThe Firm ended the year with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 13.2%, CET1 capital of $219 billion and $1.4\ntrillion of cash and marketable securities, providing it with meaningful capacity to support clients and\nfurther invest in its business and communities. During 2022 the Firm raised over $2.4 trillion 3 of credit\nand capital for its consumer and institutional clients around the world, which includes individuals,\nhomeowners, small businesses, larger corporations, schools, hospitals, cities and countries in all regions\nof the world. The Firm continued its investments in technology, people, systems and products, as well as its\ninclusive efforts to help grow economies and advance cities and neighborhoods around the world, positioning\nthe Firm for future success.\n\nAs part of determining Mr. Dimon\u2019s compensation, the Board considered his holistic performance across\nfinancial and non-financial performance dimensions, as well as feedback from investors at the 2022 Annual\nMeeting and the Firm\u2019s ongoing shareholder engagement.\n\nIn addition to the Firm\u2019s strong financial performance in 2022 and its continued momentum over the long-\nterm, the Board considered the stability and strength of the Firm\u2019s operating performance during the three\nyears marked by the pandemic and subsequent reopening of the global economy, which introduced volatility to\nthe Firm\u2019s reported financial performance primarily as a function of large reserve builds in 2020, followed\nby subsequent releases in 2021.\n\nThe Board also took into account Mr. Dimon\u2019s continued exemplary leadership of the Firm, which continues to\nbe one of the largest financial services firms in the world and is a leader in investment banking, financial\nservices for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset\nmanagement. Under the J.P. Morgan and Chase brands, the Company serves millions of customers, predominantly\nin the United States, and many of the world\u2019s most prominent corporate, institutional and government clients\nglobally.\n\nThe Board continues to recognize that the Firm is in a uniquely fortunate position to be led by such a\nhighly talented and experienced executive who continues to grow the company, maintain market leadership\npositions, strengthen the Firm\u2019s reputation, invest at the cutting edge in opportunities for the future,\npromote diversity and best practices, manage risk and develop great leaders, while also maintaining his\nfocus on the Firm\u2019s clients.\n\n1 Revenue is on a managed basis.
