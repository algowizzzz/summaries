Comparisons noted in the sections below are for the first quarter of\n2021 versus the first quarter of 2020, unless otherwise specified. Firmwide\noverview JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $14.3 billion for the first quarter\nof 2021, or $4.50 per share, on net revenue of $32.3 billion. The Firm reported\nROE of 23% and ROTCE of 29%. The Firm's results for the first quarter of 2021\nincluded a reduction in the allowance for credit losses of $5.2 billion compared\nto an increase in the allowance for credit losses of $6.8 billion in the prior\nyear, as well as a $550 million contribution to the Firm's Foundation. \u2022 Net\nincome was $14.3 billion, up $11.4 billion. \u2022 Total net revenue was up 14%.\nNoninterest revenue was $19.4 billion, up 40%, predominantly driven by higher CIB\nMarkets revenue, higher Investment Banking fees, and the absence of losses in\nCredit Adjustments and Other in CIB and markdowns on held-for-sale positions in\nthe bridge financing portfolio in CIB and CB recorded in the prior year. Net\ninterest income was $12.9 billion, down 11%, predominantly driven by the impact of\nlower rates partially offset by balance sheet growth.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense was $18.7 billion, up 12%, predominantly driven by higher\nvolume- and revenue-related expense and continued investments in the businesses.\nThe increase in expense also included a $550 million contribution to the Firm's\nFoundation. \u2022 The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $4.2 billion\ndriven by net reductions in the allowance for credit losses of $5.2 billion,\ncompared to an expense of $8.3 billion in the prior year predominantly driven by\nnet additions to the allowance for credit losses of $6.8 billion. \u2022 The total\nallowance for credit losses was $25.6 billion at March 31, 2021. The Firm had an\nallowance for loan losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 2.42%, compared with\n2.95% in the fourth quarter of 2020, and 2.32% in the prior year; the decrease\nfrom the fourth quarter of 2020 was driven by net reductions in the allowance for\nloan losses. \u2022 The Firm\u2019s nonperforming assets totaled $10.3 billion at March 31,\n2021, an increase of $3.2 billion from the prior year, reflecting client credit\ndeterioration across multiple industries, including Real Estate, in the wholesale\nportfolio; and in the consumer portfolio, loans placed on nonaccrual status\nrelated to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the first quarter of 2021,\nnonperforming assets decreased $649 million from December 31, 2020, driven by\nlower nonaccrual loans in the wholesale portfolio, reflecting the impact of net\nportfolio activity and select client upgrades in Oil & Gas and Individuals; and\nlower nonaccrual loans at fair value in the CIB consumer portfolio, due to sales.\n\u2022 Firmwide average loans of $1.0 trillion were up 1%, driven by higher loans in\nAWM and CIB, predominantly offset by lower loans in CCB and CB. The increase in\nloans also reflects loans originated under the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d)\nin CCB and CB. \u2022 Firmwide average deposits of $2.2 trillion were up 36%,\nreflecting significant inflows across the LOBs primarily driven by the effect of\ncertain government actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2022 As of March 31,\n2021, the Firm had average eligible High Quality Liquid Assets (\u201cHQLA\u201d) of\napproximately $697 billion and unencumbered marketable securities with a fair\nvalue of approximately $841 billion, resulting in approximately $1.5 trillion of\nliquidity sources.

(b) Prior-period amount has been revised to\nconform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.\nInvestment banking fees increased across products in CIB, reflecting: \u2022 higher\nequity underwriting fees largely driven by the IPO market due to increased\nindustry-wide fees \u2022 higher advisory fees driven by a higher number of completed\ntransactions, in part related to transactions announced in the second half of\n2020, and \u2022 higher debt underwriting fees driven by high-yield bonds and leveraged\nloans due to increased industry-wide fees and wallet share gains. Refer to CIB\nsegment results on pages 23-27 and Note 5 for additional information. Principal\ntransactions revenue increased, in part due to the absence of two significant\nitems in the prior year: a $951 million loss in CIB\u2019s Credit Adjustments & Other;\nand an $896 million markdown on held-for-sale positions, in the bridge financing\nportfolio in CIB and CB. Excluding these two items, principal transactions revenue\nincreased in CIB driven by strong performance in: \u2022 Equity Markets across\nderivatives, Cash Equities, and prime brokerage, and \u2022 Fixed Income Markets\nparticularly in Securitized Products and Credit, largely offset by lower revenue\nin Rates and Currencies & Emerging Markets compared to a strong prior year.\n\nThe increase in principal transactions revenue also reflected net gains on certain\nlegacy private equity investments in Corporate, compared with net losses in the\nprior year. Principal transactions revenue in CIB may in certain cases have\noffsets across other revenue lines, including net interest income. The Firm\nassesses the performance of its CIB Markets business on a total revenue basis.\nRefer to CIB and Corporate segment results on pages 23-27 and pages 33-34, and\nNote 5 for additional information. Lending- and deposit-related fees decreased\nreflecting: \u2022 lower deposit-related fees in CCB given the higher deposits held in\nexisting and new accounts, predominantly offset by \u2022 higher cash management fees\nin CIB and CB, and higher len ding-related fees, particularly loan commitment fees\nin CIB. Refer to CCB segment results on pages 20-22, CIB on pages 23-27 and CB on\npages 28-29, respectively, and Note 5 for additional information. Asset\nmanagement, administration and commissions revenue increased driven by higher\nasset management fees as a result of: \u2022 strong cumulative net inflows into long-\nterm and liquidity products and higher average market levels, net of liquidity fee\nwaivers, in AWM, and to a lesser extent, \u2022 higher levels of investment assets on\nhigher average market levels and net inflows in CCB. Refer to CCB and AWM segment\nresults on pages 20-22 and pages 30-32, respectively, and Note 5 for information\non asset management, administration and commissions revenue. Investment securities\ngains in both periods reflected the impact of repositioning the investment\nsecurities portfolio . Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 33-34 and Note\n9 for information on investment securities gains. Mortgage fees and related income\nincreased predominantly due to higher mortgage production revenue reflecting\nhigher production margins and volumes. Refer to CCB segment results on pages\n20-22, Note 5 and 14 for further information. Card income increased driven by\nlower acquisition costs, and higher net interchange income in CCB, with debit and\ncredit card sales volume returning to pre-pandemic levels. Refer to CCB segment\nresults on pages 20-22 and Note 5 for further information.\n                                        9                                         \nOther income decreased reflecting: \u2022 Weather-related write-downs on certain\nrenewable energy investments, as well as increased amortization on a higher level\nof alternative energy investments in the tax-oriented investment portfolio in CIB.\nThe increased amortization was more than offset by lower income tax expense from\nthe associated tax credits \u2022 lower gains on certain Corporate investments, and \u2022\nlower operating lease income from a decline in auto operating lease volume in CCB,\npartially offset by \u2022 net valuation gains on certain investments, compared with\nlosses in the prior year, in AWM, and \u2022 the absence of losses on certain equity\ninvestments in CIB in the prior year. Net interest income decreased predominantly\ndriven by the impact of lower rates, partially offset by balance sheet growth. The\nFirm\u2019s average interest-earning assets were $3.1 trillion, up $661 billion,\npredominantly driven by higher deposits with banks and investment securities, and\nthe yield was 1.87%, down 127 basis points (\u201cbps\u201d), primarily due to lower rates.\nThe net yield on these assets, on an FTE basis, was 1.69%, a decrease of 68 bps.\nThe net yield excluding CIB Markets was 1.93%, down 108 bps. Net yield on an FTE\nbasis, and n et yield excluding CIB Markets are non-GAAP financial measures.

The\ndecrease in consumer was driven by: \u2022 a\n$4.5 billion reduction in the allowance\nfor credit losses, including $3.5\nbillion in Card reflecting improvements\nin the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios,\nand $625 million in Home Lending\nprimarily due to the continued\nimprovement in home price index (\"HPI\")\nexpectations and to a lesser extent\nportfolio run-off, and \u2022 lower net\ncharge-offs predominantly in Card,\nreflecting lower charge-offs and higher\nrecoveries primarily benefiting from\npayment assistance and government\nstimulus; \u2022 the prior year included a\n$4.4 billion addition to the allowance\nfor credit losses. The decrease in\nwholesale reflects a net reduction of\n$716 million in the allowance for\ncredit losses across the LOBs\nreflecting improvements in the Firm's\nmacroeconomic scenarios.

Deposits with banks reflect\nthe Firm\u2019s placements of its excess\ncash with various central banks,\nincluding the Federal Reserve Banks.\n\nFederal funds sold and securities\npurchased under resale agreements\ndecreased driven by the lower\ndeployment of funds in Treasury and\nCIO; and in CIB lower client-driven\nmarket-making activities, partially\noffset by higher demand for securities\nto cover short positions. Refer to\nLiquidity Risk Management on pages\n42-46 and Note 10 for additional\ninformation.\n\nSecurities borrowed increased driven by\nclient-driven activities in Fixed\nIncome Financing and Equity Markets,\nand higher demand for securities to\ncover short positions in CIB. Refer to\nLiquidity Risk Management on pages\n42-46 and Note 10 for additional\ninformation.\n\nTrading assets increased due to strong\nclient-driven market-making activities\nin equity instruments in CIB Markets,\nincluding prime brokerage. Refer to\nNotes 2 and 4 for additional\ninformation.\n\nInvestment securities increased,\nreflecting net purchases of U.S.\nTreasuries in the held-to-maturity\n(\u201cHTM\u201d) portfolio predominantly offset\nby a decrease in the available-for-sale\n(\"AFS\") portfolio. The decrease in AFS\nwas due to paydowns and net valuation\nlosses, partially offset by net\npurchases.\n\nRefer to Corporate segment results on\npages 33-34, Investment Portfolio Risk\nManagement on page 65, and Notes 2 and\n9 for additional information on\nInvestment securities.\n\nLoans were flat as :\n\n\u2022 the reduction in Card due to the\nimpact of seasonality, and higher\npayment rates; lower loans in CB; and\nnet paydowns in Home Lending\n\nwere offset by\n\n\u2022 the origination of PPP loans in CBB\nand CB; growth in CIB loans held-for-\nsale and loans at fair value, and in\nAWM securities-based and custom\nlending, as well as mortgages.\n\nThe allowance for loan losses decreased\nconsisting of:\n\n\u2022 a $4.5 billion reduction in consumer,\npredominantly in the credit card\nportfolio, reflecting improvements in\nthe Firm's macroeconomic scenarios, and\nin the residential real estate\nportfolio primarily due to the\ncontinued improvement in the HPI\nexpectations and to a lesser extent\nportfolio run-off , and\n\n\u2022 an $875 million net reduction in\nwholesale, across the LOBs reflecting\nimprovements in the Firm's\nmacroeconomic scenarios.\n\nThere was a $107 million addition to\nthe allowance for lending-related\ncommitments, which is included in other\nliabilities on the consolidated balance\nsheets.

Refer to pages 42-46\nfor information on changes in Liquidity\nRisk Management.\n\nTrading liabilities increased due to\nclient-driven market-making activities\nin CIB Fixed Income Markets, which\nresulted in higher levels of short\npositions in debt instruments,\npartially offset by lower derivative\npayables as a result of market\nmovements. Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for\nadditional information.\n\nAccounts payable and other liabilities\nincreased largely due to the impact of\nsecurities financing transactions in\nCIB prime brokerage. Refer to Note 10\nfor additional information on\nsecurities lending transactions.\n\nBeneficial interests issued by\nconsolidated VIEs decreased driven by\nlower issuances as a result of lower\nloan balances in the Firm-administered\nmulti-seller conduits. Refer to Off-\nBalance Sheet Arrangements on page 15\nand Notes 13 and 22 for further\ninformation on Firm-sponsored VIEs and\nloan securitization trusts.\n\nLong-term debt was relatively flat as\nmaturities and fair value hedge\naccounting adjustments related to\nhigher rates were offset by net\nissuances. Refe r to Liquidity Risk\nManagement on pages 42-46 for\nadditional information.\n\nStockholders\u2019 equity was relatively\nflat as net income was offset by the\nimpact of capital actions and a\ndecrease in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d).

In addition,\nthere is a Corporate segment.\n\nThe business segments are determined\nbased on the products and services\nprovided, or the type of customer\nserved, and they reflect the manner in\nwhich financial information is\ncurrently evaluated by the Firm\u2019s\nOperating Committee. Segment results\nare presented on a managed basis. Refer\nto Explanation and Reconciliation of\nthe Firm\u2019s use of Non-GAAP Financial\nMeasures on pages 16-17 for a\ndefinition of managed basis.\n\nDescription of business segment\nreporting methodology\n\nResults of the business segments are\nintended to present each segment as if\nit were a stand-alone business. The\nmanagement reporting process that\nderives business segment results\nincludes the allocation of certain\nincome and expense items. The Firm\nperiodically assesses the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting\nclassifications used for segment\nreporting, and further refinements may\nbe implemented in future periods. The\nFirm also assesses the level of capital\nrequired for each LOB on at least an\nannual basis. The Firm\u2019s LOBs also\nprovide various business metrics which\nare utilized by the Firm and its\ninvestors and analysts in assessing\nperformance.\n\nRevenue sharing\n\nWhen business segments join efforts to\nsell products and services to the\nFirm\u2019s clients, the participating\nbusiness segments may agree to share\nrevenue from those transactions.\nRevenue is generally recognized in the\nsegment responsible for the related\nproduct or service, with allocations to\nthe other segment(s) involved in the\ntransaction. The segment results\nreflect these revenue-sharing\nagreements.\n\nCapital allocation\n\nThe amount of capital assigned to each\nsegment is referred to as equity.\nPeriodically, the assumptions and\nmethodologies used to allocate capital\nare assessed and as a result, the\ncapital allocated to the LOBs may\nchange.

Net revenue was $12.5 billion, a\ndecrease of 6%. Net interest income was $7.9 billion, down 14%, driven by: \u2022 the\nimpact of deposit margin compression in CBB, lower loans in Card due to the\ncumulative impact of lower spend throughout 2020 and higher payment rates, and\nlower loans in Home Lending due to net paydowns, partially offset by \u2022 growth in\ndeposits in CBB. Noninterest revenue was $4.6 billion, up 12%, driven by: \u2022 higher\nmortgage production revenue reflecting higher production margins and volumes, and\n\u2022 higher card income due to lower acquisition costs and higher net interchange\nincome, with debit and credit card sales volume returning to pre-pandemic levels,\npartially offset by \u2022 lower deposit-related fees given the higher deposits held in\nexisting and new accounts, and \u2022 lower auto lease volume. Refer to Note 14 for\nfurther information regarding changes in the value of the MSR asset and related\nhedges, and mortgage fees and related income. Noninterest expense was $7.2\nbillion, relatively flat, reflecting: \u2022 higher investments in the business offset\nby \u2022 lower structural expenses, and \u2022 lower volume- and revenue-related expense,\nincluding lower depreciation on auto lease assets.

Net revenue was $2.4\nbillion, up 11%. Net interest income\nwas $1.5 billion, down 5%, driven by\ndeposit margin compression,\npredominantly offset by higher deposit\nbalances and lending revenue due to\nincreased portfolio spreads.\nNoninterest revenue was $917 million,\nup 51%, predominantly driven by higher\ninvestment banking revenue, the absence\nof prior year markdowns in the bridge\nfinancing portfolio, and higher\ndeposit-related fees, particularly cash\nmanagement fees. Noninterest expense\nwas $969 million, down 2%, driven by\nlower structural expense. The provision\nfor credit losses was a net benefit of\n$118 million, driven by a net reduction\nin the allowance for credit losses,\ncompared with an expense of $1.0\nbillion in the prior year.\n

In the fourth quarter of 2020, certain wealth management\nclients were transferred from AWM Global Private Bank to the J.P. Morgan Wealth\nManagement unit in CCB\u2019s Consumer & Business Banking business. For further\ninformation see page 80 of the 2020 Form 10-K.\n\nQuarterly results Net income was $1.2 billion, up 86%. Net revenue was $4.1\nbillion, up 20%. Net interest income was $931 million, up 8%. Noninterest revenue\nwas $3.1 billion, up 24%. Revenue from Asset Management was $2.2 billion, up 26%,\npredominantly driven by: \u2022 higher asset management fees on strong cumulative net\ninflows into long-term and liquidity products and higher average market levels,\nnet of liquidity fee waivers, and \u2022 net investment valuation gains, compared with\nlosses in the prior year. Revenue from Global Private Bank was $1.9 billion, up\n15%, largely driven by: \u2022 higher deposit and loan balances, higher asset\nmanagement fees, loan margin expansion and an investment valuation gain, largely\noffset by \u2022 deposit margin compression. Noninterest expense was $2.6 billion, up\n6% predominantly driven by higher volume- and revenue-related expense, partially\noffset by lower structural expense. The provision for credit losses was a net\nbenefit of $121 million, driven by a reduction in the allowance for credit losses.\nRefer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 47-65 and

compared with a net loss of $125\nmillion in the prior year. Net revenue was a loss of $473 million, down $639\nmillion. The decrease was driven by: \u2022 lower net interest income on lower rates,\nas well as limited opportunities to deploy funds in response to continued deposit\ngrowth, partially offset by \u2022 higher noninterest revenue reflecting net gains on\ncertain legacy private equity investments compared with net losses in the prior\nyear, offset by lower investment securities gains reflecting the impact of\nrepositioning the investment securities portfolio, as well as lower gains on\ncertain Corporate investments. Noninterest expense of $876 million was up $730\nmillion primarily due to a higher contribution to the Firm's Foundation and higher\nstructural expense. The current period income tax benefit was driven by the change\nin the level and mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal, and state and\nlocal taxes as well as the impact of the Firm\u2019s estimated full-year expected tax\nrate relative to the level of year-to-date pretax income, partially offset by the\nresolution of certain tax audits.\n                                        33                                        \n                                                                                  \n   Treasury and CIO overview                                                      \n                                                                                  \nAt March 31, 2021, the average credit\nrating of the Treasury and CIO\ninvestment securities comprising the\nportfolio in the table below was AA+\n(based upon external ratings where\navailable and, where not available,\nbased primarily upon internal risk\nratings).

The minimum amount of\nregulatory capital that must be held by\nBHCs and banks is determined by\ncalculating risk-weighted assets\n(\u201cRWA\u201d), which are on-balance sheet\nassets and off-balance sheet exposures,\nweighted according to risk. Two\ncomprehensive approaches are prescribed\nfor calculating RWA: a standardized\napproach (\u201cBasel III Standardized\u201d),\nand an advanced approach (\u201cBasel III\nAdvanced\u201d). For each of the risk-based\ncapital ratios, the capital adequacy of\nthe Firm is evaluated against the lower\nof the Standardized or Advanced\napproaches compared to their respective\nminimum capital ratios.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s Basel III Standardized-risk-\nbased ratios are currently more binding\nthan the Basel III Advanced-risk-based\nratios.\n\nBasel III also includes a requirement\nfor Advanced Approach banking\norganizations, including the Firm, to\ncalculate the SLR. Refer to SLR on page\n39 for additional information.\n\nKey Regulatory Developments\n\nCECL regulatory capital transition\ndelay. As part of their response to the\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the\nfederal banking agencies issued a final\nrule that provided the option beginning\nJanuary 1, 2020 to delay the effects of\nCECL on regulatory capital for two\nyears, followed by a three-year\ntransition period beginning January 1,\n2022 (\u201cCECL capital transition\nprovisions\u201d).\n\nThe Firm has elected to apply the CECL\ncapital transition provisions, and\naccordingly, for the period ended March\n31, 2021, the capital metrics of the\nFirm exclude $4.5 billion, which is the\n$2.7 billion day 1 impact to retained\nearnings and 25% of the $7.0 billion\nincrease in the allowance for credit\nlosses from January 1, 2020 (excluding\nallowances on PCD loans).\n\nThe impacts of the CECL capital\ntransition provisions have also been\nincorporated into Tier 2 capital,\nadjusted average assets, and total\nleverage exposure. Refer to Capital\nRisk Management on pages 91-101 and\nNote 1 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form\n10-K for further information on CECL\ncapital transition provisions and the\nCECL accounting guidance.\n\nSLR temporary revision. The Federal\nReserve issued an interim final rule\nthat requires, on a temporary basis,\nthe calculation of total leverage\nexposure for purposes of calculating\nthe SLR for bank holding companies, to\nexclude the on-balance sheet amounts of\nU.S. Treasury securities and deposits\nat Federal Reserve Banks. These\nexclusions became effective April 1,\n2020, and remained in effect through\nMarch 31, 2021.\n\nOn June 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve,\nOffice of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency (\"OCC\") and FDIC issued an\ninterim final rule which became\neffective April 1, 2020 and remained in\neffect through March 31, 2021 that\nprovides IDI subsidiaries with an\noption to apply this temporary\nexclusion subject to certain\nrestrictions. As of March 31, 2021,\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. did not elect\nto apply this exclusion.\n\nPPP. On April 13, 2020, the federal\nbanking agencies issued an interim\nfinal rule (issued as final on\nSeptember 29, 2020) to neutralize the\nregulatory capital effects of\nparticipating in the PPP on risk-based\ncapital ratios by applying a zero\npercent risk weight to loans originated\nunder the program. Given that PPP loans\nare guaranteed by the SBA, the Firm\ndoes not expect to realize material\ncredit losses on these loans. As of\nMarch 31, 2021, the Firm had\napproximately $32 billion of loans\nunder the program.\n\nTotal leverage exposure for purposes of\ncalculating the SLR includes PPP loans\nas the Firm did not participate in the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s Paycheck Protection\nProgram Lending (\u201cPPPL\u201d) Facility,\nwhich would allow the Firm to exclude\nthem under the final rule.\n\nTLAC Holdings rule . On October 20,\n2020, the federal banking agencies\nissued a final rule prescribing the\nregulatory capital treatment for\nholdings of Total Loss-Absorbing\nCapacity (\"TLAC\") debt instruments by\ncertain large banking organizations,\nsuch as the Firm and JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. This rule expands the scope\nof the existing capital deductions rule\naround the holdings of capital\ninstruments of financial institutions\nto also include TLAC debt instruments\nissued by systemically important\nbanking organizations. The final rule\nbecame effective April 1, 2021 and is\nnot expected to have a material impact\non the Firm\u2019s risk-based capital\nmetrics.\n                                        36                                        \nThe following table presents the Firm\u2019s risk-based and leverage-based capital\nmetrics under both the Basel III Standardized and Advanced approaches.

(d) Excludes average excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The Firm\u2019s\naverage LCR was 110% for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and December 31,\n2020. The Firm's average LCR decreased during the three months ended March 31,\n2021, compared with the prior year period primarily due to the relative impact on\nnet cash outflows from a significant increase in deposits.\n\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s average LCR increased during the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2021, compared with both the three month periods ended December 31, 2020\nand March 31, 2020 primarily due to growth in deposits. Deposits continued to\nincrease in the first quarter primarily driven by the effect of certain government\nactions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in excess liquidity in\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is excluded from the Firm\u2019s reported LCR under the LCR\nrule. The Firm\u2019s average LCR fluctuates from period to period, due to changes in\nits eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business\nactivity. Other liquidity sources In addition to the assets reported in the Firm\u2019s\neligible HQLA above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as\nequity and debt securities, that the Firm believes would be available to raise\nliquidity. This includes securities included as part of the excess eligible HQLA\nat JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The\nfair value of these securities was approximately $841 billion and $740 billion as\nof March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, although the amount of\nliquidity that could be raised would be dependent on prevailing market conditions.\nThe fair value increased compared to December 31, 2020, primarily due to an\nincrease in CIB trading assets and an increase in excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. which was primarily a result of increased deposits. The Firm also\nhad available borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Banks (\"FHLBs\") and the\ndiscount window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral pledged by\nthe Firm to such banks of approximately $301 billion and $307 billion as of March\n31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the\nbenefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm\u2019s eligible HQLA or other\nunencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank\ndiscount window and other central banks. Although available, the Firm does not\nview this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and the\nother central banks as a primary source of liquidity. NSFR The net stable funding\nratio (\u201cNSFR\u201d) is a liquidity requirement for large banking organizations that is\nintended to measure the adequacy of \u201cavailable\u201d and \u201crequired\u201d amounts of stable\nfunding over a one-year horizon. On October 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies\nissued a final NSFR rule under which large banking organizations such as the Firm\nwill be required to maintain an NSFR of at least 100% on an ongoing basis. The\nfinal NSFR rule will become effective on July 1, 2021, and the Firm will be\nrequired to publicly disclose its quarterly average NSFR semi-annually beginning\nin 2023. The Firm estimates that it is compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR which\nbecomes effective July 1, 2021, based on its current understanding of the final\nrule.\n                                        42                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Funding                                                                         \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Sources of funds                                                                \n                                                                                  \nManagement believes that the Firm\u2019s\nunsecured and secured funding capacity\nis sufficient to meet its on- and off-\nbalance sheet obligations.\n\nThe Firm funds its global balance sheet\nthrough diverse sources of funding\nincluding stable deposits, secured and\nunsecured funding in the capital\nmarkets and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nDeposits are the primary funding source\nfor JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nAdditionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nmay also access funding through short-\nor long-term secured borrowings,\nthrough the issuance of\n\nunsecured long-term debt, or from\nborrowings from the Parent Company or\nthe Intermediate Holding Company\n(\u201cIHC\u201d).

However, during\nperiods of market disruption those trends could be affected. Average deposits\nincreased for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months\nended March 31, 2020, reflecting significant inflows across the LOBs primarily\ndriven by the effect of certain government actions in response to the COVID-19\npandemic. In CCB, the increase was also driven by lower spending, as well as\ngrowth from existing and new accounts across both consumer and small business\ncustomers.

These\ninstruments are secured predominantly\nby high-quality securities collateral,\nincluding government-issued debt and\nU.S. GSE and government agency MBS.\nSecurities sold under agreements to\nrepurchase increased at March 31, 2021,\ncompared with December 31, 2020,\nreflecting higher secured financing of\nAFS investment securities in Treasury\nand CIO, as well as higher trading\nassets in CIB, and the impact of client\nactivities in CIB.\n\nThe balances associated with securities\nloaned or sold under agreements to\nrepurchase fluctuate over time due to\ninvestment and financing activities of\nclients, the Firm\u2019s demand for\nfinancing, the ongoing management of\nthe mix of the Firm\u2019s liabilities,\nincluding its secured and unsecured\nfinancing (for both the investment\nsecurities and market-making\nportfolios), and other market and\nportfolio factors.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s sources of short-term\nunsecured funding consist of other\nborrowed funds and issuance of\nwholesale commercial paper. The\nincrease in commercial paper at March\n31, 2021, from December 31, 2020 was\ndue to higher net issuance primarily\nfor short-term liquidity management.\n                                        44                                        \nLong-term funding and issuance Long-\nterm funding provides an additional\nsource of stable funding and liquidity\nfor the Firm. The Firm\u2019s long-term\nfunding plan is driven primarily by\nexpected client activity, liquidity\nconsiderations, and regulatory\nrequirements, including TLAC. Long-term\nfunding objectives include maintaining\ndiversification, maximizing market\naccess and optimizing funding costs.\nThe Firm evaluates various funding\nmarkets, tenors and currencies in\ncreating its optimal long-term funding\nplan. The significant majority of the\nFirm\u2019s long-term unsecured funding is\nissued by the Parent Company to provide\nflexibility in support of both bank and\nnon-bank subsidiary funding needs. The\nParent Company advances substantially\nall net funding proceeds to its\nsubsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not\nissue debt to external counterparties.\nThe following table summarizes long-\nterm unsecured issuance and maturities\nor redemptions for the three months\nended March 31, 2021 and 2020.

During the\nfirst quarter of 2021, there were\napproximately $886 million of new\nenrollments\n\nin payment deferral programs\npredominantly in residential real\nestate and credit card. Predominantly\nall borrowers that exited payment\ndeferral programs are current.

Auto operating lease asset\npayment assistance is currently\noffering one month payment deferral\n(initially offered three month payment\ndeferral). Deferrals do not extend the\nterm of the lease and all deferred\npayments are due at the end of the\nlease term.\n\n(d) Includes $3.6 billion, $3.8\nbillion, $3.8 billion and $5.7 billion\nof loans that were accounted for as\nTDRs prior to payment deferral as of\nMarch 31, 2021, December 31, 2020,\nSeptember 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020,\nrespectively.\n\n(e) Represents the unpaid principal\nbalance of retained loans which were\nstill under payment deferral programs,\ndivided by the total unpaid principal\nbalance of the respective loan classes\nretained loans.\n\n(f) 89% of the balance that exited\ndeferral were current at March 31,\n2021.\n\nOf the $9.3 billion of loans still\nunder payment deferral programs as of\nMarch 31, 2021, approximately $3.9\nbillion were accounted for as TDRs,\neither because they were accounted for\nas TDRs prior to payment deferral, or\nbecause they did not qualify for or the\nFirm did not elect the option to\nsuspend TDR accounting guidance\nprovided by the CARES Act and extended\nby the Consolidated Appropriations Act.\n\nPredominantly all borrowers, including\nthose with loans accounted for as TDRs,\nwere current upon enrollment in payment\ndeferral programs and are expected to\nexit payment deferral programs in a\ncurrent status, either because no\npayments are contractually due during\nthe deferral period or because payments\noriginally contractually due during the\ndeferral period will be due at maturity\nupon exit. For those borrowers that are\nunable to resume making payments in\naccordance with the original or\nmodified contractual terms of their\nagreements upon exit from deferral\nprograms, they will be placed on\nnonaccrual status in line with the\nFirm\u2019s nonaccrual policy, except for\ncredit cards as permitted by regulatory\nguidance, and charged off\n\nor down in accordance with the Firm\u2019s\ncharge-off policies.

Residential real\nestate: The residential real estate\nportfolio, including loans held-for-\nsale and loans at fair value,\npredominantly consists of prime\nmortgage loans and home equity lines of\ncredit. The retained loan portfolio\ndeclined from December 31, 2020 due to\npaydowns predominantly in Home Lending\nwhich were largely offset by\noriginations of prime mortgage loans in\nHome Lending and AWM. Retained\nnonaccrual loans were relatively flat\nfrom December 31, 2020. Net recoveries\nfor the three months ended March 31,\n2021 were lower when compared with the\nsame period in the prior year as the\nprior year benefited from a recovery on\na loan sale in Home Lending. The loans\nheld-for-sale and loans at fair value\nportfolio increased from December 31,\n2020 largely driven by warehouse loans\nin Home Lending. Nonaccrual loans at\nfair value decreased from December 31,\n2020 largely due to sales in CIB. The\ncarrying value of home equity lines of\ncredit outstanding was $22.2 billion at\nMarch 31, 2021. This amount included\n$8.6 billion of HELOCs that have recast\nfrom interest-only to fully amortizing\npayments or have been modified and $7.3\nbillion of interest-only balloon\nHELOCs, which primarily mature after\n2030. The Firm manages the risk of\nHELOCs during their revolving period by\nclosing or reducing the undrawn line to\nthe extent permitted by law when\nborrowers are exhibiting a material\ndeterioration in their credit risk\nprofile. At March 31, 2021 and December\n31, 2020, the carrying value of\ninterest-only residential mortgage\nloans were $25.9 billion and $25.6\nbillion, respectively. These loans have\nan interest-only payment period\ngenerally followed by an adjustable-\nrate or fixed-rate fully amortizing\npayment period to maturity and are\ntypically originated as higher-balance\nloans to higher-income borrowers,\npredominantly in AWM. Charge-offs for\nthe three months ended March 31, 2021\nwere consistent with the broader\nresidential mortgage portfolio as the\nperformance of this portfolio is\ngenerally in line with the performance\nof the broader residential mortgage\nportfolio.\n\nThe following table provides a summary\nof the Firm\u2019s residential mortgage\nportfolio insured and/or guaranteed by\nU.S. government agencies, including\nloans held-for-sale and loans at fair\nvalue.

The\ndelinquency rates were positively\nimpacted by borrowers who received\npayment assistance and government\nstimulus.

A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm\u2019s\nwholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm\ndistributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the\nmarket as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio\nconcentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in\npart by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and\ntransaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry,\nproduct and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 55-59\nfor further information. The Firm\u2019s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure\nheld in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated exposures held in CCB\nincluding business banking and auto dealer for which the wholesale methodology is\napplied when determining the allowance for credit losses. In the first quarter of\n2021, the macroeconomic environment continued to improve following the broad-based\ncredit deterioration in 2020 that resulted from the impacts of the COVID-19\npandemic. As of March 31, 2021, retained loans remained relatively flat while\nlending related commitments increased $31.4 billion from December 31, 2020 to\n$481.2 billion, driven by net portfolio activity in CIB and CB, including an\nincrease in held for sale commitments intended to be syndicated. In the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2021, the investment- grade percentage of the credit\nportfolio decreased from 71% to 69% driven by net portfolio activity, including\nnew commitments. Criticized exposure increased $5.3 billion from $41.6 billion at\nDecember 31, 2020 to $46.9 billion at March 31, 2021, driven by select downgrades,\npartially offset by select upgrades. Nonperforming exposure was relatively flat at\n$4.9 billion and net charge off activity was $53 million.\n                                                                                  \n

In the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2021, nonaccrual loan\nexposure decreased $390 million, when\ncompared to December 31, 2020 driven by\nnet portfolio activity and select\nclient upgrades in Oil & Gas and\nIndividuals.\n                                                              \n  Wholesale nonaccrual loan activity                          \n  Three months ended March 31,                                \n  (in millions)                             2021        2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Beginning balance(a)                  $  4,106    $  1,271  \n  Additions                                  847       1,333  \n  Reductions:                                                 \n  Paydowns and other                         819         171  \n  Gross charge-offs                           88         181  \n  Returned to performing status              209          24  \n  Sales                                      121          14  \n  Total reductions                         1,237         390  \n  Net changes                               -390         943  \n  Ending balance                        $  3,716    $  2,214  \n                                                              \n(a) In the third quarter of 2020, the\nFirm reclassified certain fair value\noption elected lending-related\npositions from trading assets to loans.\nPrior-period amounts have been revised\nto conform with the current\npresentation.\n\nThe following table presents net\ncharge-offs/recoveries, which are\ndefined as gross charge-offs less\nrecoveries, for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2021 and 2020.

The\ncontractual amounts of these financial\ninstruments represent the maximum\npossible credit risk should the clients\ndraw down on these commitments or when\nthe Firm fulfills its obligations under\nthese guarantees, and the clients\nsubsequently fail to perform according\nto the terms of these contracts. Most\nof these commitments and guarantees\nhave historically been refinanced,\nextended, cancelled, or expired without\nbeing drawn upon or a default\noccurring. As a result, the Firm does\nnot believe that the total contractual\namount of these wholesale lending-\nrelated commitments is representative\nof the Firm\u2019s expected future credit\nexposure or funding requirements. Refer\nto Note 22 for further information on\nwholesale lending-related commitments.\nReceivables from customers Receivables\nfrom customers reflect held-for-\ninvestment margin loans to brokerage\nclients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are\ncollateralized by assets maintained in\nthe clients\u2019 brokerage accounts (e.g.,\ncash on deposit, liquid and readily\nmarketable debt or equity securities).\nBecause of this collateralization, no\nallowance for credit losses is\ngenerally held against these\nreceivables. To manage its credit risk\nthe Firm establishes margin\nrequirements and monitors the required\nmargin levels on an ongoing basis, and\nrequires clients to deposit additional\ncash or other collateral, or to reduce\npositions, when appropriate. These\nreceivables are reported within accrued\ninterest and accounts receivable on the\nFirm\u2019s Consolidated balance sheets.\nDerivative contracts Derivatives enable\nclients and counterparties to manage\nrisks including credit risk and risks\narising from fluctuations in interest\nrates, foreign exchange, equities, and\ncommodities. The Firm makes markets in\nderivatives in order to meet these\nneeds and uses derivatives to manage\ncertain risks associated with net open\nrisk positions from its market-making\nactivities, including the counterparty\ncredit risk arising from derivative\nreceivables. The Firm also uses\nderivative instruments to manage its\nown credit risk and other market risk\nexposure. The nature of the\ncounterparty and the settlement\nmechanism of the derivative affect the\ncredit risk to which the Firm is\nexposed. For OTC derivatives the Firm\nis exposed to the credit risk of the\nderivative counterparty. For exchange-\ntraded derivatives (\u201cETD\u201d), such as\nfutures and options, and cleared over-\nthe-counter (\u201cOTC-cleared\u201d)\nderivatives, the Firm can also be\nexposed to the credit risk of the\nrelevant CCP. Where possible, the Firm\nseeks to mitigate its credit risk\nexposures arising from derivative\ncontracts through the use of legally\nenforceable master netting arrangements\nand collateral agreements.\n\nThe percentage of the Firm\u2019s over-the-\ncounter derivative transactions subject\nto collateral agreements \u2014 excluding\nforeign exchange spot trades, which are\nnot typically covered by collateral\nagreements due to their short maturity\nand centrally cleared trades that are\nsettled daily \u2014 was approximately 88%\nat both March 31, 2021, and December\n31, 2020, respectively. Refer to Note 4\nfor additional information on the\nFirm\u2019s use of collateral agreements.\nRefer to Note 4 for a further\ndiscussion of derivative contracts,\ncounterparties and settlement types.\nThe fair value of derivative\nreceivables reported on the\nConsolidated balance sheets were $73.1\nbillion and $79.6 billion at March 31,\n2021, and December 31, 2020,\nrespectively, with decreases in CIB\nresulting from market movements.\nDerivative receivables represent the\nfair value of the derivative contracts\nafter giving effect to legally\nenforceable master netting agreements\nand the related cash collateral held by\nthe Firm. In addition, the Firm held\nliquid securities and other cash\ncollateral that the Firm believes is\nlegally enforceable and may be used as\nsecurity when the fair value of the\nclient\u2019s exposure is in the Firm\u2019s\nfavor. Liquid securities represents\nhigh quality liquid assets as defined\nin the LCR rule. In management\u2019s view,\nthe appropriate measure of current\ncredit risk should also take into\nconsideration other collateral, which\ngenerally represents securities that do\nnot qualify as high quality liquid\nassets under the LCR rule, but that the\nFirm believes is legally enforceable.\nThe collateral amounts for each\ncounterparty are limited to the net\nderivative receivables for the\ncounterparty. The following tables\nsummarize the net derivative\nreceivables and the internal ratings\nprofile for the periods presented.\n                                                                                  \n  Derivative receivables                     March 31,              December 31,  \n  (in millions)                              2021                   2020          \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Total, net of cash             $   73,119             $   79,630                \n  collateral                                                                      \n  Liquid securities and other                                                     \n  cash                                                                            \n  collateral held against           -13,958                -14,806                \n  derivative                                                                      \n  receivables                                                                     \n  Total, net of liquid                                                            \n  securities and                 $   59,161             $   64,824                \n  other cash collateral                                                           \n  Other collateral held                                                           \n  against derivative                 -5,716                 -6,022                \n  receivables                                                                     \n  Total, net of collateral       $   53,445             $   58,802                \n                                                                                  \n                                        61                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Ratings                                                                         \n  profile                                                                         \n  of                                                                              \n  derivati\u2026        March 31,                          December                    \n  receivab\u2026             2021                          31, 2020                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (in               Exposure          % of            Exposure           % of     \n  millions,           net of      exposure              net of       exposure     \n  except          collateral        net of          collateral         net of     \n  ratios)                       collateral                         collateral     \n  Investme\u2026    $      32,774            61  %    $      37,013             63  %  \n  Noninves\u2026           20,671            39              21,789             37     \n  Total        $      53,445           100  %    $      58,802            100  %  \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm also holds additional\ncollateral (primarily cash, G7\ngovernment securities, other liquid\ngovernment agency and guaranteed\nsecurities, and corporate debt and\nequity securities) delivered by clients\nat the initiation of transactions, as\nwell as collateral related to contracts\nthat have a non-daily call frequency\nand collateral that the Firm has agreed\nto return but has not yet settled as of\nthe reporting date.

The\nallowance for credit losses comprises:\n\u2022 the allowance for loan losses, which\ncovers the Firm\u2019s retained loan\nportfolios (scored and risk-rated) and\nis presented separately on the\nConsolidated balance sheets, \u2022 the\nallowance for lending-related\ncommitments, which is presented on the\nConsolidated balance sheets in accounts\npayable and other liabilities, and \u2022\nthe allowance for credit losses on\ninvestment securities, which covers the\nFirm\u2019s HTM and AFS securities and is\nrecognized within Investment Securities\non the Consolidated balance sheets.\nDiscussion of changes in the allowance\nThe allowance for credit losses as of\nMarch 31, 2021 decreased when compared\nto December 31, 2020, consisting of: \u2022\na $4.5 billion reduction in consumer,\npredominantly in the credit card\nportfolio, reflecting improvements in\nthe Firm's macroeconomic scenarios, and\nin the residential real estate\nportfolio primarily due to the\ncontinued improvement in the HPI\nexpectations and to a lesser extent\nportfolio run-off, and \u2022 a $716 million\nnet reduction in wholesale, across the\nLOBs reflecting improvements in the\nFirm's macroeconomic scenarios While\nthe economy is showing signs of\nimprovement, t he COVID-19 pandemic has\nstressed many MEVs used in the Firm's\nallowance estimate at a speed and to\ndegrees not experienced in recent\nhistory, which has created additional\nchallenges in the use of modeled credit\nloss estimates and increased the\nreliance on management judgment. These\nchallenges in the use of modeled credit\nloss estimates remain, albeit to a\nlesser extent than experienced during\n2020. In periods where certain MEVs are\noutside the range of historical\nexperience on which the Firm\u2019s models\nhave been trained, the Firm makes\nadjustments to appropriately address\nthese economic circumstances. Further,\ndespite the improvement in the economy,\nuncertainties remain, including the\nhealth of underlying labor markets,\nvaccine efficacy against new virus\nstrains, and the potential for changes\nin consumer behavior that could have\nlonger term impacts on certain sectors.\nAs a result of these uncertainties, the\nFirm continued to place significant\nweighting on its adverse scenarios,\nwhich incorporate more punitive\nmacroeconomic factors than the central\ncase assumptions outlined below,\nresulting in weighted average U.S.\nunemployment rates rising above eight\npercent in 2021 and remaining at\napproximately six percent into the\nsecond quarter of 2022 with U.S. gross\n\ndomestic product (\"GDP\") returning to\npre-pandemic levels in 1Q22.

The investment securities\nportfolio is predominantly held by\nTreasury and CIO in connection with the\nFirm\u2019s balance sheet or asset-liability\nmanagement objectives. Principal\ninvestments are predominantly\nprivately-held non-traded financial\ninstruments and are managed in the LOBs\nand Corporate. Investments are\ntypically intended to be held over\nextended periods and, accordingly, the\nFirm has no expectation for short-term\nrealized gains with respect to these\ninvestments. Investment securities risk\nInvestment securities risk includes the\nexposure associated with a default in\nthe payment of principal and interest.\nThis risk is mitigated given that the\ninvestment securities portfolio held by\nTreasury and CIO is predominantly\ninvested in high-quality securities. At\nMarch 31, 2021, the Treasury and CIO\ninvestment securities portfolio, net of\nallowance for credit losses, was $595.4\nbillion, and the average credit rating\nof the securities comprising the\nportfolio was AA+ (based upon external\nratings where available and where not\navailable, based primarily upon\ninternal risk ratings). Refer to\nCorporate segment results on pages\n33-34 and Note 9 for further\ninformation on the investment\nsecurities portfolio and internal risk\nratings. Refer to Market Risk\nManagement on pages 66-70 for further\ninformation on the market risk inherent\nin the portfolio. Refer to Liquidity\nRisk Management on pages 42-46 for\nfurther information on related\nliquidity risk.\n\nPrincipal investment risk Principal\ninvestments are typically privately\nheld non-traded financial instruments\nrepresenting ownership or other forms\nof junior capital and span multiple\nasset classes. These investments are\nmade by dedicated investing businesses\nor as part of a broader business\nstrategy. In general, principal\ninvestments include tax-oriented\ninvestments and investments made to\nenhance or accelerate the Firm\u2019s\nbusiness strategies . The Firm\u2019s\ninvestments will continue to evolve in\nline with its strategies, including the\nFirm\u2019s commitment to support\nunderserved communities and minority-\nowned businesses. The Firm\u2019s principal\ninvestments are managed by the LOBs and\nCorporate and are reflected within\ntheir respective financial results.

Year over\nyear results Average total VaR\nincreased by $47 million for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2021, compared\nwith the same period in the prior year.\nThis increase was driven by volatility\nwhich occurred at the onset of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and predominantly\nimpacted exposure in fixed income, as\nwell as increases from Corporate VaR\ndue to the inclusion of a private\nequity position that became publicly\ntraded at the end of the third quarter\nof 2020. These increases were partially\noffset by risk reductions in equities.\n\nEffective July 1, 2020, the Firm\nrefined the scope of VaR to exclude\ncertain asset-backed fair value option\nelected loans, and included them in\nother sensitivity-based measures to\nmore effectively measure the risk from\nthese loans.

The gains and losses depicted in the chart below do not\nreflect the Firm\u2019s reported revenue as they exclude select components of total net\nrevenue, such as those associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e.,\nintraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees,\ncommissions, certain valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded\ncomponents of total net revenue may more than offset backtesting gains and losses\non a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is\nconsistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.\n\nFor the 12 months ended March 31, 2021, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 165\nof the 259 days, and observed two VaR backtesting exceptions. For the three months\nended March 31, 2021, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 47 of the 63 days, and\ndid not observe any VaR backtesting exceptions.\n\nThe following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains\nand losses for the trailing 12 months and three months ended March 31, 2021. The\ndaily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding daily\nRisk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in\naggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals. A backtesting exception occurs\nwhen the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the\nprior day. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are\ngreater than one hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the\nresults of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm\u2019s Basel\nIII Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory\nVaR applied to the Firm\u2019s covered positions.\n\nDistribution of Daily Backtesting Gains and Losses\n                                        68                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Earnings-at-risk                                                                \n                                                                                  \nThe effect of interest rate exposure on\nthe Firm\u2019s reported net income is\nimportant as interest rate risk\nrepresents one of the Firm\u2019s\nsignificant market risks. Interest rate\nrisk arises not only from trading\nactivities but also from the Firm\u2019s\ntraditional banking activities, which\ninclude extension of loans and credit\nfacilities, taking deposits and issuing\ndebt as well as from the investment\nsecurities portfolio. Refer to the\ntable on page 136 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n2020 Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and\nCorporate, identifying positions\nincluded in earnings-at-risk. One way\nthe Firm evaluates its structural\ninterest rate risk is through earnings-\nat-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the\nFirm\u2019s interest rate exposure for a\ngiven interest rate scenario. It is\npresented as a sensitivity to a\nbaseline, which includes net interest\nincome and certain interest rate\nsensitive fees. The baseline uses\nmarket interest rates and in the case\nof deposits, pricing assumptions. The\nFirm conducts simulations of changes to\nthis baseline for interest rate-\nsensitive assets and liabilities\ndenominated in U.S. dollars and other\ncurrencies (\u201cnon-U.S. dollar\u201d\ncurrencies). These simulations\nprimarily include retained loans,\ndeposits, deposits with banks,\ninvestment securities, long-term debt\nand any related interest rate hedges,\nand funds transfer pricing of other\npositions in risk management VaR and\nother sensitivity-based measures as\ndescribed on page 136 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K. Earnings-at-\nrisk scenarios estimate the potential\nchange to a net interest income\nbaseline, over the following 12 months\nutilizing multiple assumptions. These\nscenarios include a parallel shift\ninvolving changes to both short-term\nand long-term rates by an equal amount;\na steeper yield curve involving holding\nshort-term rates constant and\nincreasing long-term rates; and a\nflatter yield curve involving\nincreasing short-term rates and holding\nlong-term rates constant. These\nscenarios consider many different\nfactors, including: \u2022 The impact on\nexposures as a result of instantaneous\nchanges in interest rates from baseline\nrates. \u2022 Forecasted balance sheet, as\nwell as modeled prepayment and\nreinvestment behavior, but do not\ninclude assumptions about actions that\ncould be taken by the Firm or its\nclients and customers in response to\nany such instantaneous rate changes.\nMortgage prepayment assumptions are\nbased on the interest rates used in the\nscenarios compared with underlying\ncontractual rates, the time since\norigination, and other factors which\nare updated periodically based on\nhistorical experience. \u2022 The pricing\nsensitivity of deposits, known as\ndeposit betas, represent the amount by\nwhich deposit rates paid could change\nupon a given change in market interest\nrates over the cycle.

The Firm\u2019s sensitivity to rates\nis primarily a result of assets\nrepricing at a faster pace than\ndeposits. Based upon current and\nimplied market rates as of March 31,\n2021, scenarios reflecting lower rates\ncould result in negative interest\nrates. The U.S. has never experienced\nan interest rate environment where the\nFederal Reserve has a negative interest\nrate policy. While the impact of\nnegative interest rates on the Firm's\nearnings-at-risk would vary by\nscenario, a parallel shift downward of\nup to 100bps would negatively impact\nnet interest income. In a negative\ninterest rate environment, the modeling\nassumptions used for certain assets and\nliabilities require additional\nmanagement judgment and therefore, the\nactual outcomes may differ from these\nassumptions.

Given the remaining\nuncertainty around the COVID-19\npandemic, Country Risk Management\ncontinues to monitor the impact to\nindividual countries. Refer to pages\n143-144 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form\n10-K for a further discussion of the\nFirm\u2019s country risk management. Risk\nReporting The following table presents\nthe Firm\u2019s top 20 exposures by country\n(excluding the U.S.) as of March 31,\n2021 and their comparative exposures as\nof December 31, 2020. The selection of\ncountries represents the Firm\u2019s largest\ntotal exposures by individual country,\nbased on the Firm\u2019s internal country\nrisk management approach, and does not\nrepresent the Firm\u2019s view of any\nexisting or potentially adverse credit\nconditions. Country exposures may\nfluctuate from period to period due to\nclient activity and market flows. The\nincrease in exposure to Australia was\npredominantly due to increased cash\nplacements with the central bank of\nAustralia, driven by client activity\nfollowing recent policy decisions in\nthe country and growth in client\ndeposits.\n                                                                                  \n  Top                                                                             \n  20                                                                              \n  co\u2026                                                                             \n  ex\u2026                                                                             \n  (e\u2026                                                                             \n  the                                                                             \n  U.\u2026    March                                                  Dec\u2026              \n  (in    31,                                                    31,               \n  bi\u2026    2021                                                   202\u2026              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                     Len\u2026       Trad\u2026                  Total               Total  \n                      and         and       Oth\u2026       expo\u2026               expo\u2026  \n                     dep\u2026       inve\u2026                                             \n  Ge\u2026             $  110\u2026    $    5.0    $   0.5    $  115.6            $  127.2  \n  Un\u2026                52.8        13.1        2.3        68.2                68.4  \n  Ki\u2026                                                                             \n  Ja\u2026                38.4        14.0        0.3        52.7                45.6  \n  Au\u2026                24.5         6.7          \u2014        31.2                15.9  \n  Fr\u2026                13.4         3.8        2.7        19.9                18.8  \n  Ch\u2026                10.0         6.5        1.6        18.1                21.2  \n  Sw\u2026                10.2         0.5        4.5        15.2                18.7  \n  Br\u2026                 5.8         8.1          \u2014        13.9                10.8  \n  Ca\u2026                12.4         0.5        0.2        13.1                14.5  \n  Lu\u2026                11.0         1.1          \u2014        12.1                12.4  \n  In\u2026                 4.8         4.0        0.9         9.7                10.5  \n  So\u2026                 4.4         4.7        0.4         9.5                10.1  \n  Ko\u2026                                                                             \n  Ne\u2026                 7.4         0.1        2.0         9.5                 7.7  \n  Si\u2026                 4.9         2.7        0.8         8.4                 8.7  \n  It\u2026                 4.1         3.2        0.2         7.5                 9.7  \n  Ho\u2026                                                                             \n  Ko\u2026                 4.6         1.8        0.2         6.6                 6.2  \n  SAR                                                                             \n  Sa\u2026                 5.7         0.8          \u2014         6.5                 5.8  \n  Ar\u2026                                                                             \n  Sp\u2026                 3.9         2.1          \u2014         6.0                 5.8  \n  Be\u2026                 2.8         1.6        0.1         4.5                 4.0  \n  Me\u2026                 4.0         0.1          \u2014         4.1                 4.9  \n                                                                                  \n(a) Country exposures presented in the\ntable reflect 89% and 90% of total\nFirmwide non-U.S. exposure, where\nexposure is attributed to an individual\ncountry, at March 31, 2021, and\nDecember 31, 2020, respectively.

Operational\nrisk is inherent in the Firm\u2019s\nactivities and can manifest itself in\nvarious ways, including fraudulent\nacts, business interruptions, cyber\nattacks, inappropriate employee\nbehavior, failure to comply with\napplicable laws and regulations or\nfailure of vendors to perform in\naccordance with their agreements.\nOperational Risk Management attempts to\nmanage operational risk at appropriate\nlevels in light of the Firm\u2019s financial\nposition, the characteristics of its\nbusinesses, and the markets and\nregulatory environments in which it\noperates.

Details on other\nselect examples of operational risks\nare provided below.\n\nBusiness and technology resiliency risk\n\nBusiness disruptions can occur due to\nforces beyond the Firm\u2019s control such\nas the spread of infectious diseases or\npandemics, severe weather, power or\ntelecommunications loss, accidents,\nfailure of a third party to provide\nexpected services, cyberattack,\nflooding, transit strikes, terrorism,\nhealth emergencies. The safety of the\nFirm\u2019s employees and customers is of\nthe highest priority. The Firmwide\nresiliency program is intended to\nenable the Firm to recover its critical\nbusiness functions and supporting\nassets (i.e., staff, technology and\nfacilities) in the event of a business\ninterruption. The program includes\ngovernance, awareness training, and\ntesting of recovery strategies, as well\nas strategic and tactical initiatives\nto identify, assess, and manage\nbusiness interruption and public safety\nrisks. The strength and proficiency of\nthe Firmwide resiliency program has\nplayed an integral role in maintaining\nthe Firm\u2019s business operations during\nand after various events.\n\nCybersecurity Risk\n\nDue to the on-going impact of COVID-19,\nthe Firm continues to leverage use of\nremote access and also video\nconferencing solutions provided by\nthird parties to facilitate remote\nwork. As a result, the Firm deployed\nadditional precautionary measures to\nmitigate cybersecurity risks.\n\nPayment Fraud Risk\n\nThe risk of payment fraud remains at a\nheightened level across the industry,\nparticularly during the COVID-19\npandemic due to the use of contingent\nforms of payment authentication methods\nand the perpetuation of scams involving\nthe pandemic, including an increase in\nthe level of fraud attempts against\nconsumers. The complexities of these\nincidents and the strategies used by\nperpetrators continue to evolve. The\nFirm employs various controls for\nmanaging payment fraud risk as well as\nproviding employee and client education\nand awareness trainings.\n                                        72                                        \n                                         \n  ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT  \n                                         \nEstimations and Model risk, a\nsubcategory of operational risk, is the\npotential for adverse consequences from\ndecisions based on incorrect or misused\nestimation outputs.\n\nThe Firm uses models and other\nanalytical and judgment- based\nestimations across various businesses\nand functions. The estimation methods\nare of varying levels of sophistication\nand are used for many purposes, such as\nthe valuation of positions and\nmeasurement of risk, assessing\nregulatory capital requirements,\nconducting stress testing, and making\nbusiness decisions.\n\nWhile models are inherently imprecise,\nthe degree of imprecision or\nuncertainty can be heightened by the\nmarket or economic environment. This is\nparticularly true when the current and\nforecasted environment is significantly\ndifferent from the historical\nmacroeconomic environments upon which\nthe models were trained, as the Firm\nhas experienced during the COVID-19\npandemic. This uncertainty may\nnecessitate a greater degree of\njudgment and analytics to inform\nadjustments to model outputs than in\ntypical periods.\n\nRefer to Critical Accounting Estimates\nUsed by the Firm on pages 74-76 and\nNote 2 of this Form 10-Q, and\nEstimations and Model Risk Management\nsection on page 151 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n2020 Form 10-K for a summary of model-\nbased valuations and other valuation\ntechniques.\n                                        73                                        \n                                                  \n  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM  \n                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s accounting policies\nand use of estimates are integral to\nunderstanding its reported results. The\nFirm\u2019s most complex accounting\nestimates require management\u2019s judgment\nto ascertain the appropriate carrying\nvalue of assets and liabilities. The\nFirm has established policies and\ncontrol procedures intended to ensure\nthat estimation methods, including any\njudgments made as part of such methods,\nare well-controlled, independently\nreviewed and applied consistently from\nperiod to period. The methods used and\njudgments made reflect, among other\nfactors, the nature of the assets or\nliabilities and the related business\nand risk management strategies, which\nmay vary across the Firm\u2019s businesses\nand portfolios. In addition, the\npolicies and procedures are intended to\nensure that the process for changing\nmethodologies occurs in an appropriate\nmanner. The Firm believes its estimates\nfor determining the carrying value of\nits assets and liabilities are\nappropriate. The following is a brief\ndescription of the Firm\u2019s critical\naccounting estimates involving\nsignificant judgments.\n                                                                                  \n  Allowance for credit losses                                                     \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses\nrepresents management\u2019s estimate of\nexpected credit losses over the\nremaining expected life of the Firm\u2019s\nfinancial assets measured at amortized\ncost and certain off-balance sheet\nlending-related commitments. The\nallowance for credit losses comprises:\n\n\u2022 The allowance for loan losses, which\ncovers the Firm\u2019s retained loan\nportfolios (scored and risk-rated),\n\n\u2022 The allowance for lending-related\ncommitments, and\n\n\u2022 The allowance for credit losses on\ninvestment securities, which covers the\nFirm\u2019s HTM and AFS securities.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses\ninvolves significant judgment on a\nnumber of matters including development\nand weighting of macroeconomic\nforecasts, incorporation of historical\nloss experience, assessment of risk\ncharacteristics, assignment of risk\nratings, valuation of collateral, and\nthe determination of remaining expected\nlife. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 of\nJPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for\nfurther information on these judgments\nas well as the Firm\u2019s policies and\nmethodologies used to determine the\nFirm\u2019s allowance for credit losses; and\nrefer to Allowance for credit losses on\npages 63\u201364 and Note 12 of this Form\n10-Q for further information.\n\nOne of the most significant judgments\ninvolved in estimating the Firm\u2019s\nallowance for credit losses relates to\nthe macroeconomic forecasts used to\nestimate credit losses over the eight-\nquarter forecast period within the\nFirm\u2019s methodology. The eight-quarter\nforecast incorporates hundreds of\nmacroeconomic variables (\u201cMEVs\u201d) that\nare relevant for exposures across the\nFirm, with modeled credit losses being\ndriven primarily by a subset of less\nthan twenty variables. The specific\nvariables that have the greatest\n\neffect on the modeled losses of each\nportfolio vary by portfolio and\ngeography.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio\ninclude U.S. unemployment, HPI and U.S.\nreal GDP.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio\ninclude U.S. real GDP, U.S.\nunemployment, U.S. equity prices,\ncorporate credit spreads, oil prices,\ncommercial real estate prices and HPI.\n\nChanges in the Firm\u2019s assumptions and\nforecasts of economic conditions could\nsignificantly affect its estimate of\nexpected credit losses in the portfolio\nat the balance sheet date or lead to\nsignificant changes in the estimate\nfrom one reporting period to the next.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a\nweak labor market and weak overall\neconomic conditions that affected\nborrowers across the Firm\u2019s consumer\nand wholesale lending portfolios. While\nthe economy is showing signs of\nimprovement, uncertainties remain,\nincluding the health of underlying\nlabor markets, vaccine efficacy against\nnew virus strains, and the potential\nfor changes in consumer behavior that\ncould have longer term impacts on\ncertain sectors. Further, significant\njudgment is still required to estimate\nthe speed and trajectory of the\neconomic recovery.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate how\npotential changes in any one factor or\ninput might affect the overall\nallowance for credit losses because\nmanagement considers a wide variety of\nfactors and inputs in estimating the\nallowance for credit losses. Changes in\nthe factors and inputs considered may\nnot occur at the same rate and may not\nbe consistent across all geographies or\nproduct types, and changes in factors\nand inputs may be directionally\ninconsistent, such that improvement in\none factor or input may offset\ndeterioration in others.\n\nTo consider the impact of a\nhypothetical alternate macroeconomic\nforecast, the Firm compared the modeled\ncredit losses determined using its\ncentral and relative adverse\nmacroeconomic scenarios, which are two\nof the five scenarios considered in\nestimating the allowances for loan\nlosses and lending-related commitments.\nThe central and relative adverse\nscenarios each included a full suite of\nMEVs, but differed in the levels, paths\nand peaks/troughs of those variables\nover the eight-quarter forecast period.\n\nFor example, compared to the Firm\u2019s\ncentral scenario described on page 63\nand in Note 12, the Firm\u2019s relative\nadverse scenario assumes a\nsignificantly elevated U.S.\nunemployment rate through 2021,\naveraging 2.4% higher over the eight-\nquarter forecast, with a peak\ndifference of approximately 4.4% in the\nthird quarter of 2021; lower U.S. real\nGDP with a slower recovery, remaining\n2.6% lower at the end of the eight-\nquarter forecast, with a peak\ndifference of nearly 6.6% in the third\nquarter of 2021; and lower national HPI\nwith a peak difference of 17.4% and a\ntrough in the second quarter of 2022.\n                                        74                                        \nThis analysis is not intended to\nestimate expected future changes in the\nallowance for credit losses, for a\nnumber of reasons, including: \u2022 the\nFirm has placed significant weight on\nits adverse scenarios in estimating its\nallowance for credit losses as of March\n31, 2021, and accordingly, the existing\nallowance already reflects credit\nlosses beyond those estimated under the\ncentral scenario \u2022 the impacts of\nchanges in many MEVs are both\ninterrelated and nonlinear, so the\nresults of this analysis cannot be\nsimply extrapolated for more severe\nchanges in macroeconomic variables \u2022\nthe COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many\nMEVs used in the Firm's allowance\nestimate at a speed and to degrees not\nseen in recent history, which continues\nto add higher degrees of uncertainty\naround modeled credit loss estimations\n\u2022 significant changes in the expected\nseverity and duration of the economic\ndownturn caused by the COVID-19\npandemic, effects of government support\nand customer assistance, and speed and\ntrajectory of the subsequent recovery\ncould significantly affect the Firm\u2019s\nestimate of expected credit losses\nirrespective of the estimated\nsensitivities described below. To\ndemonstrate the sensitivity of credit\nloss estimates to macroeconomic\nforecasts as of March 31, 2021, the\nFirm compared the modeled estimates\nunder its relative adverse scenario to\nits central scenario. Without\nconsidering the additional weight the\nFirm has placed on its adverse\nscenarios or any other offsetting or\ncorrelated effects in other qualitative\ncomponents of the Firm\u2019s allowance for\ncredit losses for these lending\nexposures, the comparison between these\ntwo scenarios reflects the following\ndifferences: \u2022 An increase of\napproximately $700 million for\nresidential real estate loans and\nlending-related commitments \u2022 An\nincrease of approximately $3.6 billion\nfor credit card loans \u2022 An increase of\napproximately $2.1 billion for\nwholesale loans and lending-related\ncommitments This analysis relates only\nto the modeled credit loss estimates\nand is not intended to estimate changes\nin the overall allowance for credit\nlosses as it does not reflect any\npotential changes in other adjustments\nto the quantitative calculation, which\nwould also be influenced by the\njudgment management applies to the\nmodeled lifetime loss estimates to\nreflect the uncertainty and imprecision\nof these modeled lifetime loss\nestimates based on then-current\ncircumstances and conditions.\nRecognizing that forecasts of\nmacroeconomic conditions are inherently\nuncertain, particularly in light of the\nrecent economic conditions, the Firm\nbelieves that its process to consider\nthe available information and\nassociated risks and uncertainties is\nappropriately governed and that its\n\nestimates of expected credit losses\nwere reasonable and appropriate for the\nperiod ended March 31, 2021.

The level 3 balances would\nbe reduced if netting were applied,\nincluding the netting benefit\nassociated with cash collateral.\n                                        75                                        \nValuation\nEstimating fair value requires the\napplication of judgment. The type and\nlevel of judgment required is largely\ndependent on the amount of observable\nmarket information available to the\nFirm. For instruments valued using\ninternally developed valuation models\nand other valuation techniques that use\nsignificant unobservable inputs and are\ntherefore classified within level 3 of\nthe valuation hierarchy, judgments used\nto estimate fair value are more\nsignificant than those required when\nestimating the fair value of\ninstruments classified within levels 1\nand 2.\n\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair\nvalue for an instrument within level 3,\nmanagement must first determine the\nappropriate valuation model or other\nvaluation technique to use. Second, the\nlack of observability of certain\nsignificant inputs requires management\nto assess all relevant empirical data\nin deriving valuation inputs including,\nfor example, transaction details, yield\ncurves, interest rates, prepayment\nspeed, default rates, volatilities,\ncorrelations, prices (such as\ncommodity, equity or debt prices),\nvaluations of comparable instruments,\nforeign exchange rates and credit\ncurves. Refer to Note 2 for a further\ndiscussion of the valuation of level 3\ninstruments, including unobservable\ninputs used.\n\nFor instruments classified in levels 2\nand 3, management judgment must be\napplied to assess the appropriate level\nof valuation adjustments to reflect\ncounterparty credit quality, the Firm\u2019s\ncreditworthiness, market funding rates,\nliquidity considerations, unobservable\nparameters, and for portfolios that\nmeet specified criteria, the size of\nthe net open risk position. The\njudgments made are typically affected\nby the type of product and its specific\ncontractual terms, and the level of\nliquidity for the product or within the\nmarket as a whole. In periods of\nheightened market volatility and\nuncertainty judgments are further\naffected by the wider variation of\nreasonable valuation estimates,\nparticularly for positions that are\nless liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a\nfurther discussion of valuation\nadjustments applied by the Firm.\n\nImprecision in estimating unobservable\nmarket inputs or other factors can\naffect the amount of gain or loss\nrecorded for a particular position.\nFurthermore, while the Firm believes\nits valuation methods are appropriate\nand consistent with those of other\nmarket participants, the methods and\nassumptions used reflect management\njudgment and may vary across the Firm\u2019s\nbusinesses and portfolios.\n\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and\nassumptions in the determination of\nfair value.

Refer to Note 25\nfor a further discussion of the Firm\u2019s business segments. The accounting and\nfinancial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to\nU.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting\nand reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. The unaudited\nConsolidated Financial Statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets\nand liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the\nopinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included such\nthat this interim financial information is fairly stated. These unaudited\nConsolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited\nConsolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K. Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been\nreclassified to conform with the current presentation, including certain deferred\ninvestment tax credits. In the first quarter of 2021 the Firm reclassified certain\ndeferred investment tax credits from accounts payable and other liabilities to\nother assets to be a reduction to the carrying value of certain tax-oriented\ninvestments. The reclassification also resulted in an increase in income tax\nexpense and a corresponding increase in other income, with no effect on net\nincome. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current\npresentation, including the Firm\u2019s effective income tax rate. The reclassification\ndid not change the Firm\u2019s results of operations on a managed basis. Consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and\nother entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All\nmaterial intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Assets held\nfor clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of\nJPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm\ndetermines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first\nevaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest\nentity. Refer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for a further\ndescription of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s accounting policies regarding consolidation.\nOffsetting assets and liabilities U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative\nreceivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related\ncash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S.\nGAAP also permits securities financing activities to be presented on a net basis\nwhen specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally\nenforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances\nwhen the specified conditions are met.

obligations\nof $ 96.3billion and $ 117.6billion, respectively, which were mortgage-related.\n\n(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of\ncost or net realizable value. \u201cNet realizable value\u201d is a term defined in U.S.\nGAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (\u201ctransaction costs\u201d).\nTransaction costs for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories are either not\napplicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable\nvalue approximates fair value for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories.\nWhen fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below\ncost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because\nunder fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair\nvalue. Refer to Note 4 for a further\n                                        87                                        \ndiscussion of the Firm\u2019s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent\nfair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been\nincluded in each period presented.\n\n(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the\namount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).\n\n(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value\nper share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be\nclassified in the fair value hierarchy. At March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020,\nthe fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private\nequity funds, real estate and other funds, were $ 678million and $ 670million,\nrespectively. Included in these balances at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020,\nwere trading assets of $ 55million and $ 52million, respectively, and other assets\nof $ 623million and $ 618million, respectively.\n\n(e) At March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, included within loans were $\n20.1billion and $ 15.1billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages,\nand $ 6.0billion and $ 6.3billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien\nmortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated\nwith the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $ 11.9billion and\n$ 8.4billion, respectively.\n\n(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative\nreceivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and\npaid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3\nbalances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit\nassociated with cash collateral.\n\n(g) The prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period\npresentation.\n\nLevel 3 valuations\n\nRefer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for further information on the\nFirm\u2019s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair\nvalue for individual financial instruments. The following table presents the\nFirm\u2019s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to\nmeasure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant\nunobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or\narithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an\ninstrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs\nto the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically\ninclude observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and\ncan be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components.\nThe level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the\nFirm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial\ninstruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within\nlevels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of values presented in the\ntable is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the\nsignificant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification.\nWhere provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table\nare calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being\nused to value. In the Firm\u2019s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic\naverage values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of\nthe reasonableness of the Firm\u2019s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect\nthe characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative\ndistribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two\noption contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation\nuncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels\nbecause the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices.\nThe input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-\nperiod and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments\nheld by the Firm at each balance sheet date.\n                                        88                                        \n

type, which may differ from their classification on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in\nthe table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the\ntechnique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ.\n\n(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $ 397million, nonagency\nsecurities of $ 32million and non-trading loans of $ 562million.\n\n(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $ 2million, trading loans of $ 41million and\nnon-trading loans of $ 473million.\n\n(d) Comprises trading loans of $ 791million and non-trading loans of $ 788million.\n\n(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes\nissued by the Firm that are financial instruments that typically contain embedded\nderivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the\nderivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable\ninputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.\n\n(f) Includes equity securities of $ 968million, including $ 280million in Other\nAssets, for which quoted prices are not readily available and the fair value is\ngenerally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA multiples and\ncomparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant\nboth individually and in aggregate.\n\n(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted\nmarket prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price-\nbased internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par\nvalue of $ 100.\n\n(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.\n\n(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where\narithmetic averages are used.\n                                        89                                        \nChanges in and ranges of unobservable inputs Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in\nunobservable inputs and the relationships between unobservable inputs as well as a\ndescription of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market\nfactors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm\u2019s\npositions. Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements The following\ntables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including\nchanges in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within\nlevel 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and\n2020. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level\n3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to\nthe overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments\ntypically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components,\nobservable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be\nvalidated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table\nbelow include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are\npart of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable\ncomponents of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative\npositions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as\nthese level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the\ngains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm\u2019s\nrisk management activities

For certain loans, the fair value is\nmeasured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the\nloan takes into account the loan\u2019s allowance for loan losses, which represents the\nloan\u2019s expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference\nbetween the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally\nattributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market\nliquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do\nnot affect its carrying value.\nThe majority of the Firm\u2019s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis on the Consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value\nand the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related commitments were\nas follows for the periods indicated.\n                                                                                  \n         \u2026                                       \u2026                                \n         \u2026                                       \u2026                                \n         \u2026                                       \u2026                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                 \u2026                                       \u2026                        \n                 \u2026                                       \u2026                        \n                 \u2026                                       \u2026                        \n                 \u2026                                       \u2026                        \n         \u2026                               \u2026       \u2026                                \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                \n         \u2026       1       2       3       \u2026       \u2026       1       2                \n                                         \u2026                                        \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $      $    \n                                                                                  \n(a) Excludes the current carrying values of the guarantee liability and the\noffsetting asset, each of which is recognized at fair value at the inception of\nthe guarantees.\n(b) Includes the wholesale allowance for lending-related commitments.\nThe Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-\nrelated commitments.

Derivatives\ncontracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to\nbe triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a\nsingle rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting\ncorresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not\nresult in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional\ninitial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination\npayments requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon\na downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in\nthe derivative contract.\n                                                                                  \n  Liquidi\u2026                                                                        \n  impact                                                                          \n  of                                                                              \n  downgra\u2026                                                                        \n  triggers                                                                        \n  on OTC                                                                          \n  and                                                                             \n  OTC-cle\u2026       March 31,                        December                        \n  derivat\u2026            2021                        31, 2020                        \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (in            Single-n\u2026       Two-notch       Single-n\u2026       Two-notch        \n  million\u2026       downgrade       downgrade       downgrade       downgrade        \n  Amount                                                                          \n  of                                                                              \n  additio\u2026                                                                        \n  collate\u2026    $        178    $      1,448    $        119    $      1,243        \n  to be                                                                           \n  posted                                                                          \n  upon                                                                            \n  downgra\u2026                                                                        \n  Amount                                                                          \n  required                                                                        \n  to                                                                              \n  settle                                                                          \n  contrac\u2026             127             833             153           1,682    -c  \n  with                                                                            \n  termina\u2026                                                                        \n  triggers                                                                        \n  upon                                                                            \n  downgra\u2026                                                                        \n                                                                                  \n(a) Includes the additional collateral to be posted for initial margin.\n(b) Amounts represent fair values of derivative payables, and do not reflect\ncollateral posted.\n(c) Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation.\nDerivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset\n\nIn certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers\nfinancial assets but maintains the economic exposure to the transferred assets by\nentering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the\ninitial transfer.

purchased where the\nunderlying reference instrument is identical to the reference instrument on\nprotection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each individual\nidentical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than the\nnotional amount of protection sold.\n(c) Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the\ntime of settlement, which would generally reduce the amount the seller of\nprotection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement value.\n(d) Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-\nname, portfolio or index) where the Firm has not sold any protection on the\nidentical reference instrument.\nThe following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity\nprofile, and total fair value, of credit derivatives and credit-related notes as\nof March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of\nprotection. The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of\nthe credit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the\nreference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and\nmaturity profile of credit derivatives and credit-related notes where JPMorgan\nChase is the purchaser of protection are comparable to the profile reflected\nbelow.\n

The\neffective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and\naccretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-\nequivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes\nunscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of\nsecurities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain\nsecurities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the\naverage yield is calculated to the earliest call date.\n(b) Substantially all of the Firm\u2019s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized\nmortgage obligations are due in 10years or more, based on contractual maturity.\nThe estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future\nprepayments, is approximately 6years for agency residential MBS, 4years for agency\nresidential collateralized mortgage obligations and 3years for nonagency\nresidential collateralized mortgage obligations.\n                                       118                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Note 10 \u2013 Securities financing activities                                       \n                                                                                  \nRefer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting\npolicies relating to securities financing activities.

The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the\nFirm\u2019s securities financing agreements as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\nWhen the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master\nnetting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria\nunder U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the\nbalances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same\ncounterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral\nwith its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but\nsuch collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation.\nWhere the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the\ncounterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with securities\nfinancing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S.\nGAAP, is presented in the table below as \u201cAmounts not nettable on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets,\u201d and reduces the \u201cNet amounts\u201d presented.

held $ 603million and $\n598million, respectively, of financial assets for which the rights have been\ntransferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized\nfinancing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and\nloans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in short-term\nborrowings on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n                                       120                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Note 11 \u2013 Loans                                                                 \n                                                                                  \nLoan accounting framework\n\nThe accounting for a loan depends on management\u2019s strategy for the loan. The Firm\naccounts for loans based on the following categories:\n\n\u2022 Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., \u201cretained\u201d)\n\n\u2022 Loans held-for-sale\n\n\u2022 Loans at fair value\n\nRefer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of\nloans, including accounting policies.

The Firm typically elects to\nrepurchase these delinquent loans as it continues to service them and/or manage\nthe foreclosure process in accordance with applicable requirements of Ginnie Mae,\nFHA, RHS, and/or VA.\n(c) Excludes purchases of retained loans of $ 7.0billion and $ 3.6billion for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which are predominantly\nsourced through the correspondent origination channel and underwritten in\naccordance with the Firm\u2019s standards.\nGains and losses on sales of loans Net gains/(losses) on sales of loans and\nlending-related commitments (including adjustments to record loans and lending-\nrelated commitments held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value) recognized\nin noninterest revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was $ 132million,\nof which $ 135million related to loans. Net losses on sales of loans and lending-\nrelated commitments for the three months ended March 31, 2020 was $( 913) million,\nof which $( 142) million related to loans. In addition, the sale of loans may also\nresult in write downs, recoveries or changes in the allowance recognized in the\nprovision for credit losses. Loan modifications The Firm has granted various forms\nof assistance to customers and clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic,\nincluding payment deferrals and covenant modifications. The majority of the Firm\u2019s\nCOVID-19 related loan modifications have not been considered TDRs because: \u2022 they\nrepresent short-term or other insignificant modifications, whether under the\nFirm\u2019s regular loan modification assessments or as permitted by regulatory\nguidance, or \u2022 the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application\nof accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the\nConsolidated Appropriations Act. To the extent that certain modifications do not\nmeet any of the above criteria, the Firm accounts for them as TDRs. As permitted\nby regulatory guidance, the Firm does not place loans with deferrals granted due\nto COVID-19 on nonaccrual status where such loans are not otherwise reportable as\nnonaccrual. The Firm considers expected losses of principal and accrued interest\nassociated with all COVID-19 related loan modifications in its allowance for\ncredit losses.

residential real estate loans that are charged\ndown to the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm\nreports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans\nthat have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the\nborrower (\u201cChapter 7 loans\u201d) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless\nof their delinquency status. At March 31, 2021, approximately 7% of Chapter 7\nresidential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.\n\n(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with\nregulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-\ndependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value\nof their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying\ncollateral has subsequently improved, the related allowance may be negative.\n\n(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $ 45million\nand $ 43million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n(d) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response\nto the COVID-19 pandemic. Includes loans to customers that have exited COVID-19\npayment deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly all of\nwhich are considered collateral-dependent and charged down to the lower of\namortized cost or fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell.\n\n(e) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed\nby U.S government agencies. Typically the principal balance of the loans is\ninsured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to\nmeeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020,\nthese balances were no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing\nguidelines. There were noloans that were not guaranteed by U.S. government\nagencies that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at March\n31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\n\n(f) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the\nestimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a\nminimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized\nhome price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent\navailable and forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current\nestimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available\nlien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.\n\n(g) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower\u2019s most recent credit score,\nwhich is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.\n\n(h) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.\n\n(i) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the\nmagnitude of the corresponding loan balances at March 31, 2021.\n\n(j) At both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, included mortgage loans insured\nby U.S. government agencies of $ 76million.

Loans with short-\nterm or other insignificant\nmodifications that are not considered\nconcessions are not TDRs nor are loans\nfor which the Firm has elected to apply\nthe option to suspend the application\nof accounting guidance for TDRs as\nprovided by the CARES Act and extended\nby the Consolidated Appropriations Act.\nThe carrying value of new TDRs was $\n251million and $ 142million for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2021 and\n2020, respectively. There were no\nadditional commitments to lend to\nborrowers whose residential real estate\nloans have been modified in TDRs.\nNature and extent of modifications The\nFirm\u2019s proprietary modification\nprograms as well as government\nprograms, including U.S. GSE programs,\ngenerally provide various concessions\nto financially troubled borrowers\nincluding, but not limited to, interest\nrate reductions, term or payment\nextensions and delays of principal\nand/or interest payments that would\notherwise have been required under the\nterms of the original agreement.\nThe following table provides information about how residential real estate loans\nwere modified in TDRs under the Firm\u2019s loss mitigation programs described above\nduring the periods presented.

Redefaults of\nloans modified within the last twelve monthsmay not be representative of ultimate\nredefault levels.\nAt March 31, 2021, the weighted-average\nestimated remaining lives of\nresidential real estate loans\npermanently modified in TDRs were six\nyears. The estimated remaining lives of\nthese loans reflect estimated\nprepayments, both voluntary and\ninvoluntary (i.e., foreclosures and\nother forced liquidations).\n                                       126                                        \nActive and suspended foreclosure\n\nAt March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Firm had residential real estate\nloans, excluding those insured by U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value\nof $ 802million and $ 846million, respectively, that were not included in REO, but\nwere in the process of active or suspended foreclosure. In response to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, the Firm has temporarily suspended certain foreclosure\nactivities.

concessions to credit\ncard borrowers who are experiencing\nfinancial difficulty. The Firm grants\nconcessions for most of the credit card\nloans under long-term programs. These\nmodifications involve placing the\ncustomer on a fixed payment plan,\ngenerally for 60months, and typically\ninclude reducing the interest rate on\nthe credit card. Substantially all\nmodifications under the Firm\u2019s long-\nterm programs are considered to be\nTDRs. Loans with short-term or other\ninsignificant modifications that are\nnot considered concessions are not\nTDRs. If the cardholder does not comply\nwith the modified payment terms, then\nthe credit card loan continues to age\nand will ultimately be charged-off in\naccordance with the Firm\u2019s standard\ncharge-off policy. In most cases, the\nFirm does not reinstate the borrower\u2019s\nline of credit.\n\nFinancial effects of modifications and\nredefaults\n\nThe following table provides\ninformation about the financial effects\nof the concessions granted on credit\ncard loans modified in TDRs and\nredefaults for the periods presented.\nFor all periods disclosed, new\nenrollments were less than 1% of total\nretained credit card loans.\n                                                                                  \n  (in millions, except                   Three months ended                       \n  weighted-average data)        2021              March 31,  2020                 \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Balance of new TDRs(a)              $                       143  $         277  \n  Weighted-average interest                                                       \n  rate of loans                                       17.74     %     18.82    %  \n  \u2013 before TDR                                                                    \n  Weighted-average interest                                                       \n  rate of loans                                        5.23            4.02       \n  \u2013 after TDR                                                                     \n  Balance of loans that                                                           \n  redefaulted within                  $                        19  $          36  \n  one year of modification(b)                                                     \n                                                                                  \n(a) Represents the outstanding balance\nprior to modification.\n\n(b) Represents loans modified in TDRs\nthat experienced a payment default in\nthe periods presented, and for which\nthe payment default occurred within one\nyearof the modification.

The carrying value of TDRs was $ 1.2billion and $ 954million as of March 31,\n2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. The carrying value of new TDRs was $\n428million and $ 76million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively. The new TDRs for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were\nprimarily from Commercial and Industrial loan modifications that included\nextending maturity dates and the receipt of assets in partial satisfaction of the\nloan. The impact of these modifications resulting in new TDRs was not material to\nthe Firm for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.\n                                       133                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Note 12 \u2013 Allowance for credit losses                                           \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses\nrepresents management's estimate of\nexpected credit losses over the\nremaining expected life of the Firm's\nfinancial assets measured at amortized\ncost and certain off-balance sheet\nlending-related commitments.

These\nchallenges in the use of modeled credit\nloss estimates remain, albeit to a\nlesser extent than experienced during\n2020. In periods where certain MEVs are\noutside the range of historical\nexperience on which the Firm\u2019s models\nhave been trained, the Firm makes\nadjustments to appropriately address\nthese economic circumstances.\n\nFurther, despite the improvement in the\neconomy, uncertainties remain,\nincluding the health of underlying\nlabor markets, vaccine efficacy against\nnew virus strains, and the potential\nfor changes in consumer behavior that\ncould have longer term impacts on\ncertain sectors. As a result of these\nuncertainties, the Firm continued to\nplace significant weighting on its\nadverse scenarios, which incorporate\nmore punitive macroeconomic factors\nthan the central case assumptions\noutlined below, resulting in weighted\naverage U.S. unemployment rates rising\nabove eight percent in 2021 and\nremaining at approximately six percent\ninto the second quarter of 2022 with\nU.S. GDP returning to pre-pandemic\nlevels in 1Q22.\nThe Firm\u2019s central case assumptions\nreflected U.S. unemployment rates and\nU.S. real GDP as follows :\n

The assets and liabilities\ninclude third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and exclude\nintercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.\n(e) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated\nVIEs are classified in the line item on the Consolidated balance sheets titled,\n\u201cBeneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interest entities.\u201d The\nholders of these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the\ngeneral credit of JPMorgan Chase. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets\nare long-term beneficial interests of $ 4.7billion and $ 5.2billion at March 31,\n2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively.\n(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets.\nVIEs sponsored by third parties\n\nThe Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These\ninclude, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider,\ninvestor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian.\nThese transactions are conducted at arm\u2019s-length, and individual credit decisions\nare based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the\nquality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct\nthe activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic\nperformance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the\nFirm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these\npositions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record\nand report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. Tax credit\nvehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which\nare limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable\nhousing, energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs.\nA third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control\nover the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the\nFirm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these\npartnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt\nof tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented\nby equity investments and funding commitments, was $ 23.1billion and $\n23.6billion, of which $ 8.5billion and $ 8.7billion was unfunded at March 31, 2021\nand December 31, 2020, respectively. The prior-period maximum loss exposure amount\nhas been revised to conform with the current presentation. The Firm assesses each\nproject and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its\ncapital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25\nof JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for further information on affordable housing\ntax credits and Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for more information on off-balance\nsheet lending-related commitments.\n                                       140                                        \nCustomer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm may provide various\nservices to customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender\noption provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity\nprovider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In\nthose transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to\nthe third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any\nintent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying\nmunicipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm\ndoes not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm\u2019s maximum exposure as a\nliquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020\nwas $ 6.5billion and $ 6.7billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by\nsuch VIEs at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, was $ 10.2billion and $\n10.5billion, respectively. Loan securitizations The Firm has securitized and sold\na variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, and commercial\nmortgage.Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for a further\ndescription of the Firm\u2019s accounting policies regarding securitizations.\n\nSecuritization activity\nThe following table provides information related to the Firm\u2019s securitization\nactivities for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, related to assets\nheld in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the\nFirm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization.\n                                                                                  \n                       Three                                                      \n                      months                                                      \n                       ended                                                      \n                   March 31,                                                      \n                        2021       Commercial              2020       Commercial  \n  (in             Residenti\u2026              and       Residential              and  \n  millions)       mortgage(\u2026         other(e)       mortgage(d)         other(e)  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Principal    $       4,077    $       1,912    $        3,064    $       3,188  \n  securiti\u2026                                                                       \n  All cash                                                                        \n  flows                                                                           \n  during                                                                          \n  the                                                                             \n  period:(\u2026                                                                       \n  Proceeds                                                                        \n  received                                                                        \n  from loan    $       4,234    $       1,970    $        3,136    $       3,273  \n  sales as                                                                        \n  financial                                                                       \n  instrume\u2026                                                                       \n  Servicing                                                                       \n  fees                    41                \u2014                62                \u2014  \n  collected                                                                       \n  Cash                                                                            \n  flows                                                                           \n  received               183               52               117               29  \n  on                                                                              \n  interests                                                                       \n                                                                                  \n(a) Excludes re-securitization transactions.\n(b) Predominantly includes Level 2 assets.\n(c) The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the\nproceeds received upon loan sale.\n(d) Represents prime mortgages.

Refer to Note 15 of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for a\nfurther discussion of the Firm\u2019s\ngoodwill impairment testing, including\nthe primary method used to estimate the\nfair value of the reporting units and\nthe assumptions used in the goodwill\nimpairment test. Unanticipated declines\nin business performance, increases in\ncredit losses, increases in capital\nrequirements, as well as deterioration\nin economic or market conditions,\nadverse regulatory or legislative\nchanges or increases in the estimated\nmarket cost of equity, could cause the\nestimated fair values of the Firm\u2019s\nreporting units to decline in the\nfuture, which could result in a\nmaterial impairment charge to earnings\nin a future period related to some\nportion of the associated goodwill. As\nof March 31, 2021, the Firm reviewed\ncurrent economic conditions, including\nthe potential impacts of the COVID-19\npandemic on business performance,\nestimated market cost of equity, as\nwell as actual business results and\nprojections of business performance for\nall its reporting units. The Firm has\nconcluded that the goodwill allocated\nto its reporting units was not impaired\nas of March 31, 2021, or December 31,\n2020, nor was goodwill written off due\nto impairment during the three months\nended March 31, 2021 or 2020.\n                                       143                                        \nMortgage servicing rights\n\nMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing\nservicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future\nservicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the\nloans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received,\neffectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary\nfee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale\nor securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained.

they were\nnot made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.\n                                       144                                        \nThe following table presents the components

The\ncontractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible\ncredit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or\nthe Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the\ncustomer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the\ncontract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been\nrefinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default\noccurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not,\nin the Firm\u2019s view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or\nfunding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for a\nfurther discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm\u2019s\nrelated accounting policies. To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale\nand certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses\non lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further\ninformation regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related\ncommitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying\nvalues of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and\nother commitments at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020. The amounts in the\ntable below for credit card, home equity and certain scored business banking\nlending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these\nproducts. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all\navailable lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time.\nThe Firm can reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business banking\nlines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by\nlaw, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when\nthe borrower is 60days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when\nthere are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when\nthere has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.\n                                       152                                        \n                                                                                  \n         \u2026

If Merchant\nServices is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, Merchant Services will\nbear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. Merchant\nServices mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash\nreserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, Merchant Services\nrecognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk to\nthe Firm related to charge-backs.\n                                       154                                        \nLoan sales- and securitization-related\nindemnifications In connection with the\nFirm\u2019s mortgage loan sale and\nsecuritization activities with GSEs the\nFirm has made representations and\nwarranties that the loans sold meet\ncertain requirements, and that may\nrequire the Firm to repurchase mortgage\nloans and/or indemnify the loan\npurchaser if such representations and\nwarranties are breached by the Firm.\nThe liability related to repurchase\ndemands associated with private label\nsecuritizations is separately evaluated\nby the Firm in establishing its\nlitigation reserves. Refer to Note 24\nof this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for\nadditional information regarding\nlitigation. Sponsored member repo\nprogram The Firm acts as a sponsoring\nmember to clear eligible overnight\nresale and repurchase agreements\nthrough the Government Securities\nDivision of the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation (\u201cFICC\u201d) on behalf of\nclients that become sponsored members\nunder the FICC\u2019s rules. The Firm also\nguarantees to the FICC the prompt and\nfull payment and performance of its\nsponsored member clients\u2019 respective\nobligations under the FICC\u2019s rules. The\nFirm minimizes its liability under\nthese overnight guarantees by obtaining\na security interest in the cash or\nhigh-quality securities collateral that\nthe clients place with the clearing\nhouse therefore the Firm expects the\nrisk of loss to be remote. The Firm\u2019s\nmaximum possible exposure, without\ntaking into consideration the\nassociated collateral, is included in\nthe Exchange & clearing house\nguarantees and commitments line on page\n153. Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for additional\ninformation on credit risk mitigation\npractices on resale agreements and the\ntypes of collateral pledged under\nrepurchase agreements.

The\nlitigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class\naction lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve\nboth formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-\nregulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of\nadjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm\u2019s lines\nof business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common\nlaw tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer\nprotection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm believes\nthe estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of\nreserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $ 0to approximately $\n1.5billion at March 31, 2021. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably\npossible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those\nproceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible\nloss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an\nestimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm\u2019s estimate of the aggregate range\nof reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: \u2022 the number,\nvariety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in\npreliminary stages, \u2022 the existence in many such proceedings of multiple\ndefendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be\ndetermined, \u2022 the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings,\nincluding issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the\nclaims, and \u2022 the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such\nproceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future\nrulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of\nadverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be\nincorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result\nwhich the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had\ndeemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm\u2019s\nestimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from\ntime to time, and actual losses may vary significantly. Set forth below are\ndescriptions of the Firm\u2019s material legal proceedings. Amrapali . India\u2019s\nEnforcement Directorate (\u201cED\u201d) is investigating JPMorgan India Private Limited in\nconnection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by twooffshore funds formerly\nmanaged by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects developed by\nthe Amrapali Group (\u201cAmrapali\u201d). In 2017, numerous creditors filed civil claims\nagainst Amrapali including petitions brought by home buyers relating to delays in\ndelivering or failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers\u2019 petitions\nhave been overseen by the Supreme Court of India since 2017 pursuant to its\njurisdiction over public interest litigation. In July 2019, the Supreme Court of\nIndia issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties,\nincluding unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had\ninvested in the projects, violated certain currency control and money laundering\nprovisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry under India\u2019s\nPrevention of Money Laundering Act (\u201cPMLA\u201d) and Foreign Exchange Management Act\n(\u201cFEMA\u201d). In May 2020, the Enforcement Directorate issued a provisional attachment\norder as part of the criminal PMLA proceedings freezing approximately $ 25million\nheld by JPMorgan India Private Limited. In June 2020, the funds were transferred\nto an account held by the Supreme Court of India. A separate civil proceeding\nrelating to alleged FEMA violations is ongoing. The Firm is responding to and\ncooperating with the investigation. Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation.\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the\nFederal Government of Nigeria (\u201cFGN\u201d) and two major international oil companies.\nThe account held approximately $ 1.1billion in connection with a dispute among the\nclients over rights to an oil field. Following the settlement of the dispute,\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in\naccordance with directions received from its clients. In November 2017, the\nFederal Republic of Nigeria (\u201cFRN\u201d) commenced a claim in the English High Court\nfor approximately $ 875million in payments made out of the accounts. The FRN,\nclaiming to be the same entity as the FGN, alleges that the payments were\ninstructed as part of a complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but\nthat JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or should have been on notice that the payments\nmay be fraudulent. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. applied for summary judgment and was\nunsuccessful. The claim is ongoing and a trial has been scheduled to commence in\nFebruary 2022. Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously\nreported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign\nexchange (\u201cFX\u201d) sales and trading activities and controls related to those\nactivities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded\n                                       156                                        \nguilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. In January 2017, the Firm\nwas sentenced, with judgment entered thereafter and a term of probation ending in\nJanuary 2020. The term of probation has concluded, with the Firm remaining in good\nstanding throughout the probation period. The Department of Labor granted the Firm\na five-yearexemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and its affiliates\nto continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under\nthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d) until January 2023. The Firm\nwill need to reapply in due course for a further exemption to cover the remainder\nof the ten-yeardisqualification period. A South Africa Competition Commission\nmatter is the remaining FX-related governmental inquiry, and is currently pending\nbefore the South Africa Competition Tribunal. In August 2018, the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval to the\nFirm\u2019s settlement of a consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs,\nwhich principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged\nconspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf\nof persons who transacted in FX futures and options on futures. Certain members of\nthe settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class,\nand certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm and other foreign exchange\ndealers in November 2018. A number of these actions remain pending. Further, a\nputative class action has been filed against the Firm and other foreign exchange\ndealers on behalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at\nallegedly inflated rates. Another putative class action was brought against the\nFirm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of purported indirect purchasers\nof FX instruments. In 2020, the Court approved a settlement by the Firm and\n11other defendants of that class action for a total of $ 10million. In addition,\nsome FX-related individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged\nunderlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel\nand Australia. Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations\nfiled a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as\nwell as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card\ninterchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In\n2012, the parties initially settled the cases for a cash payment, a temporary\nreduction of credit card interchange, and modifications to certain credit card\nnetwork rules. In 2017, after the approval of that settlement was reversed on\nappeal, the case was remanded to the United States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of New York for further proceedings consistent with the appellate\ndecision. The original class action was divided into twoseparate actions, one\nseeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive\nrelief. In September 2018, the parties to the class action seeking monetary relief\nfinalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement.\nPursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an additional\n$ 900million to the approximately $ 5.3billion previously held in escrow from the\noriginal settlement. In December 2019, the amended agreement was approved by the\nDistrict Court. Certain merchants appealed the District Court\u2019s approval order,\nand those appeals are pending. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out\nof the amended class settlement, $ 700million has been returned to the defendants\nfrom the settlement escrow in accordance with the settlement agreement. The class\naction seeking primarily injunctive relief continues separately. In addition,\ncertain merchants have filed individual actions raising similar allegations\nagainst Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks, and some\nof those actions remain pending. LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and\nLitigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various governmental\nagencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers\nAssociation\u2019s (\"BBA\") London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) for various\ncurrencies and the European Banking Federation\u2019s Euro Interbank Offered Rate\n(\u201cEURIBOR\u201d). The Swiss Competition Commission\u2019s investigation relating to EURIBOR,\nto which the Firm and other banks are subject, continues. In December 2016, the\nEuropean Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an\ninfringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed\nan appeal of that decision with the European General Court, and that appeal is\npending. In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other\nbanks in various individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates,\nincluding U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the\nperiod that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of\ncertain actions and resolved certain other actions, and others are in various\nstages of litigation. The United States District Court for the Southern District\nof New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds\nand interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. In a\nconsolidated putative class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR\nwas administered by ICE Benchmark Administration, the District Court granted the\nmotion by defendants, including the Firm, to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, and\nthe plaintiffs have appealed. In addition, in August 2020, a group of individual\nplaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and\nother defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR\nand conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit\ncards. In November 2020, plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction\nseeking to enjoin defendants from setting U.S. dollar LIBOR and to prohibit\ndefendants from enforcing any financial instruments that rely on U.S. dollar\nLIBOR. Defendants opposed that motion, which remains pending. The Firm\u2019s\nsettlements of putative\n                                       157                                        \nclass actions related to Swiss franc LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate\nand the Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference\nRate remain subject to court approval. Metals and U.S. Treasuries Investigations\nand Litigation and Related Inquiries. The Firm previously reported that it and/or\ncertain of its subsidiaries had entered into resolutions with the U.S. Department\nof Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d), the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) and the\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), which, collectively, resolved\nthose agencies\u2019 respective investigations relating to historical trading practices\nby former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related\nconduct from 2008 to 2016. The Firm entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement\n(\u201cDPA\u201d) with the DOJ in which it agreed to the filing of a criminal information\ncharging JPMorgan Chase & Co. with twocounts of wire fraud and agreed, along with\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to certain terms and\nobligations as set forth therein. Under the terms of the DPA, the criminal\ninformation will be dismissed after three years, provided that JPMorgan Chase &\nCo., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC fully comply with\nall of their obligations. Across the threeresolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC,\nJPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC\nagreed to pay a total monetary amount of approximately $ 920million. A portion of\nthe total monetary amount includes victim compensation payments. Several putative\nclass action complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for\nthe Southern District of New York against the Firm and certain former employees,\nalleging a precious metals futures and options price manipulation scheme in\nviolation of the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust\nenrichment and deceptive acts or practices under the General Business Law of the\nState of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class actions in February\n2019, and the consolidated action is stayed through May 2021. In Canada,\nplaintiffs have moved to commence putative class action proceedings based on\nsimilar alleged underlying conduct for precious metals. In addition, several\nputative class actions have been filed in the United States District Courts for\nthe Northern District of Illinois and Southern District of New York against the\nFirm, alleging manipulation of U.S. Treasury futures and options, and bringing\nclaims under the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust\nenrichment. The actions in the Northern District of Illinois have been transferred\nto the Southern District of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class\nactions in October 2020 and plaintiffs filed their consolidated amended complaint\nin April 2021. Twoputative class action complaints have also been filed under the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 in the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of New York against the Firm and certain individual defendants on\nbehalf of shareholders who acquired shares during the putative class period\nalleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially false or misleading\nin that they did not disclose certain information relating to the above-referenced\ninvestigations. The Court consolidated these putative class actions in January\n2021, and plaintiffs filed their consolidated amended complaint in March 2021.\nSecurities Lending Antitrust Litigation . JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan\nSecurities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities\nLending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint\nasserts violations of federal antitrust law and New York State common law in\nconnection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous\nexchange trading for securities lending transactions. Defendants\u2019 motion to\ndismiss the complaint was denied. Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this\naction, which defendants are opposing. Wendel. Since 2012, the French criminal\nauthorities have been investigating a series of transactions entered into by\nsenior managers of Wendel Investissement (\u201cWendel\u201d) during the period from 2004\nthrough 2007 to restructure their shareholdings in Wendel. JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A., Paris branch provided financing for the transactions to a number of managers\nof Wendel in 2007. JPMorgan Chase cooperated with the investigation. The\ninvestigating judges issued an ordonnance de renvoi in November 2016, referring\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel for alleged\ncomplicity in tax fraud. In January 2018, the Paris Court of Appeal issued a\ndecision cancelling the mise en examen of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Court of\nCassation, France\u2019s highest court, ruled in September 2018 that a mise en examen\nis a prerequisite for an ordonnance de renvoi and in January 2020 ordered the\nannulment of the ordonnance de renvoi referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the\nFrench tribunal correctionnel . The Court of Appeal found in January 2021 that it\nhad no power to take further action against JPMorgan Chase following the Court of\nCassation\u2019s ruling. At the opening of a trial of the managers of Wendel in January\n2021, the tribunal correctionnel directed the criminal authorities to clarify\nwhether a further investigation should be opened against JPMorgan Chase, pending\nwhich the trial was postponed. In April 2021, the Court of Cassation declined to\nhear JPMorgan Chase\u2019s appeal of the January 2021 decision of the tribunal\ncorrectionnel at this stage of the proceedings. In addition, a number of the\nmanagers have commenced civil proceedings against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The\nclaims are separate, involve different allegations and are at various stages of\nproceedings. * * * In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above,\nJPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise\ninvolved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it\nhas\n                                       158                                        \nmeritorious defenses to the claims\nasserted against it in its currently\noutstanding legal proceedings and it\nintends to defend itself vigorously.\nAdditional legal proceedings may be\ninitiated from time to time in the\nfuture. The Firm has established\nreserves for several hundred of its\ncurrently outstanding legal\nproceedings. In accordance with the\nprovisions of U.S. GAAP for\ncontingencies, the Firm accrues for a\nlitigation-related liability when it is\nprobable that such a liability has been\nincurred and the amount of the loss can\nbe reasonably estimated. The Firm\nevaluates its outstanding legal\nproceedings each quarter to assess its\nlitigation reserves, and makes\nadjustments in such reserves, upward or\ndownward, as appropriate, based on\nmanagement\u2019s best judgment after\nconsultation with counsel. The Firm\u2019s\nlegal expense was $ 28million and $\n197million for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThere is no assurance that the Firm\u2019s\nlitigation reserves will not need to be\nadjusted in the future. In view of the\ninherent difficulty of predicting the\noutcome of legal proceedings,\nparticularly where the claimants seek\nvery large or indeterminate damages, or\nwhere the matters present novel legal\ntheories, involve a large number of\nparties or are in early stages of\ndiscovery, the Firm cannot state with\nconfidence what will be the eventual\noutcomes of the currently pending\nmatters, the timing of their ultimate\nresolution or the eventual losses,\nfines, penalties or consequences\nrelated to those matters. JPMorgan\nChase believes, based upon its current\nknowledge and after consultation with\ncounsel, consideration of the material\nlegal proceedings described above and\nafter taking into account its current\nlitigation reserves and its estimated\naggregate range of possible losses,\nthat the other legal proceedings\ncurrently pending against it should not\nhave a material adverse effect on the\nFirm\u2019s consolidated financial\ncondition. The Firm notes, however,\nthat in light of the uncertainties\ninvolved in such proceedings, there is\nno assurance that the ultimate\nresolution of these matters will not\nsignificantly exceed the reserves it\nhas currently accrued or that a matter\nwill not have material reputational\nconsequences. As a result, the outcome\nof a particular matter may be material\nto JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operating results\nfor a particular period, depending on,\namong other factors, the size of the\nloss or liability imposed and the level\nof JPMorgan Chase\u2019s income for that\nperiod.\n                                       159                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Note 25 \u2013 Business segments                                                     \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm is managed on an LOB basis.

In addition, there is a Corporate segment.\nThe business segments are determined based on the products and services provided,\nor the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial\ninformation is currently evaluated by the Firm\u2019s Operating Committee. Segment\nresults are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results below, and Note\n32 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbusiness segments. Segment results The following table provides a summary of the\nFirm\u2019s segment results as of or for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and\n2020, on a managed basis. The Firm\u2019s definition of managed basis starts with the\nreported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total\nnet revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE\nbasis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-\nexempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to\ntaxable investments and securities.

The current estimated LTV ratios\nare calculated using estimated\ncollateral values derived from a\nnationally recognized home price index\nmeasured at the metropolitan\nstatistical area (\u201cMSA\u201d) level. These\nMSA-level home price indices consist of\nactual data to the extent available and\nforecasted data where actual data is\nnot available. As a result, the\nestimated collateral values used to\ncalculate these ratios do not represent\nactual appraised loan-level collateral\nvalues; as such, the resulting LTV\nratios are necessarily imprecise and\nshould therefore be viewed as\nestimates.\n                                                                                  \n  Combined LTV ratio                                                              \n                                                                                  \nThe LTV ratio considering all available\nlien positions, as well as unused\nlines, related to the property.\nCombined LTV ratios are used for junior\nlien home equity products.\n\nManaged basis: A non-GAAP presentation\nof Firmwide financial results that\nincludes reclassifications to present\nrevenue on a fully taxable-equivalent\nbasis.

A\nsubstantial proportion of the Firm\u2019s\nAlt-A loans are those where a borrower\ndoes not provide complete documentation\nof his or her assets or the amount or\nsource of his or her income.\n\nOption ARMs\n\nThe option ARM real estate loan product\nis an adjustable-rate mortgage loan\nthat provides the borrower with the\noption each month to make a fully\namortizing, interest-only or minimum\npayment. The minimum payment on an\noption ARM loan is based on the\ninterest rate charged during the\nintroductory period. This introductory\nrate is usually significantly below the\nfully indexed rate. The fully indexed\nrate is calculated using an index rate\nplus a margin. Once the introductory\nperiod ends, the contractual interest\nrate charged on the loan increases to\nthe fully indexed rate and adjusts\nmonthly to reflect movements in the\nindex. The minimum payment is typically\ninsufficient to cover interest accrued\nin the prior month, and any unpaid\ninterest is deferred and added to the\nprincipal balance of the loan. Option\nARM loans are subject to payment\nrecast, which converts the loan to a\nvariable-rate fully amortizing loan\nupon meeting specified loan balance and\nanniversary date triggers.\n                                       165                                        \nPrime\n\nPrime mortgage loans are made to\nborrowers with good credit records who\nmeet specific underwriting\nrequirements, including prescriptive\nrequirements related to income and\noverall debt levels.

Risk           \u2502\n\u2502  Factors.The following discussion supplements the discussion of riskfactors    \u2502\n\u2502  affecting the Firm as set forth in Part I, Item 1A:Risk Factors on pages      \u2502\n\u2502  8-32 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K. The discussion of risk factors, as   \u2502\n\u2502  so supplemented, sets forth the material risk factors that could affect       \u2502\n\u2502  JPMorgan Chase\u2019s financial condition and operations. Readers should not       \u2502\n\u2502  consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all         \u2502\n\u2502  potential risks that could affect the Firm.The COVID-19 pandemic has caused   \u2502\n\u2502  and is causing significant harm to the global economy and could further       \u2502\n\u2502  negatively affect certain of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses.On March 11, 2020,   \u2502\n\u2502  the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a strain of novel      \u2502\n\u2502  coronavirus disease, COVID-19, to be a global pandemic. The COVID-19          \u2502\n\u2502  pandemic and governmental responses to the pandemic led to the institution    \u2502\n\u2502  of social distancing and shelter-in-place requirements in certain areas of    \u2502\n\u2502  the U.S. and other countries resulting in ongoing severe impacts on global    \u2502\n\u2502  economic conditions, including:\u2022significant disruption and volatility in the  \u2502\n\u2502  financial markets\u2022significant disruption of global supply chains,             \u2502\n\u2502  and\u2022closures of many businesses, leading to loss of revenues and increased    \u2502\n\u2502  unemployment.A prolongation or worsening of the pandemic, or the emergence    \u2502\n\u2502  of other diseases that give rise to similar effects, could deepen the         \u2502\n\u2502  adverse impact on the global economy.The adverse economic conditions caused   \u2502\n\u2502  by the pandemic have had a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s     \u2502\n\u2502  businesses and results of operations, including:\u2022reduction in demand for      \u2502\n\u2502  certain products and services from JPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients and customers,    \u2502\n\u2502  resulting in lower revenue, and\u2022increases in the allowance for credit         \u2502\n\u2502  losses.Certain models used by JPMorgan Chase in connection with the           \u2502\n\u2502  determination of the allowance for credit losses have heightened performance  \u2502\n\u2502  risk in the economic environment precipitated by the effects of the COVID-19  \u2502\n\u2502  pandemic and government stimulus. There can be no assurance that, even after  \u2502\n\u2502  adjustments have been made to model outputs, JPMorgan Chase will not          \u2502\n\u2502  recognize unexpected losses arising from the model uncertainty that has       \u2502\n\u2502  resulted from these developments.                                             \u2502\n\u2502                                                                                \u2502\n\u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256f\n                                       172                                        \nA prolongation or worsening of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and the negative\neconomic impacts of the pandemic could\nhave other significant adverse effects\non JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses, results\nof operations and financial condition,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 recognition of credit losses and\nfurther increases in the allowance for\ncredit losses, especially to the extent\nthat businesses remain closed,\nunemployment continues at elevated\nlevels, clients and customers draw on\ntheir lines of credit or significant\nnumbers of people relocate from\nmetropolitan areas\n\n\u2022 material impacts on the value of\nsecurities, derivatives and other\nfinancial instruments which JPMorgan\nChase owns or in which it makes markets\n\n\u2022 downgrades in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit\nratings\n\n\u2022 constraints on liquidity or capital\ndue to elevated levels of deposits,\nincreases in risk-weighted assets\n(\u201cRWA\u201d) related to supporting client\nactivities, downgrades in client credit\nratings, regulatory actions or other\nfactors, any or all of which could\nrequire JPMorgan Chase to take or\nrefrain from taking actions that it\notherwise would under its liquidity and\ncapital management strategies, and\n\n\u2022 the possibility that significant\nportions of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s workforce\nare unable to work effectively,\nincluding because of illness,\nquarantines, shelter-in-place\narrangements, government actions or\nother restrictions in connection with\nthe pandemic.\n\nThe extent to which the COVID-19\npandemic negatively affects JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s businesses, results of\noperations and financial condition, as\nwell as its regulatory capital and\nliquidity ratios, will depend on future\ndevelopments that are highly uncertain\nand cannot be predicted, including the\nultimate scope and duration of the\npandemic, the effectiveness of\nvaccination programs and actions taken\nby governmental authorities and other\nthird parties in response to the\npandemic. Those negative effects,\nincluding the possible recognition of\ncharge-offs, may be delayed\n\nbecause of the impact of prior and\npotential future government stimulus\nactions or payment assistance provided\nto clients and customers.\n\nIn addition, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nparticipation directly or indirectly,\nincluding on behalf of customers and\nclients or by affiliated entities, in\nU.S. government programs designed to\nsupport individuals, households and\nbusinesses impacted by the economic\ndisruptions caused by the COVID-19\npandemic could be criticized and\nsubject JPMorgan Chase to:\n\n\u2022 increased governmental and regulatory\nscrutiny\n\n\u2022 negative publicity, and\n\n\u2022 increased exposure to litigation,\n\nany or all of which could increase\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational, legal and\ncompliance costs and damage its\nreputation. To the extent that the\nCOVID-19 pandemic adversely affects\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business, results of\noperations and financial condition, it\nmay also have the effect of heightening\nmany of the other risks described in\nRisk Factors in the 2020 Form 10-K.\n                                                                                  \n  Supervision and regulation                                                      \n                                                                                  \nRefer to the Supervision and regulation\nsection on pages 3\u20137 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for information\non Supervision and Regulation.\n\nItem 2.
