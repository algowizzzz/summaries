The Firm's results for the second quarter\nof 2023 included an estimated bargain purchase gain\nof $2.7 billion in Corporate and a net addition to\nthe allowance for credit losses of $1.2 billion\nassociated with the First Republic acquisition. The\nFirm's results also included investment securities\nlosses of $900 million in Treasury and CIO.\n\n\u2022 Total net revenue was $41.3 billion, up 34%,\nreflecting:\n\n\u2013 Net interest income of $21.8 billion, up 44%,\ndriven by higher rates and, to a lesser extent, the\nimpact of the First Republic acquisition, partially\noffset by lower Markets net interest income and\nlower average deposit\n\nbalances. Net interest income excluding Markets was\n$22.4 billion, up 63%.\n\n\u2013 Noninterest revenue was $19.5 billion, up 25%,\ndriven by the impact of the First Republic\nacquisition, higher Markets noninterest revenue and\nthe absence of losses on equity investments in\nPayments in the prior year, partially offset by\nhigher net investment securities losses in Treasury\nand CIO. The impact of the First Republic\nacquisition included a $2.7 billion estimated\nbargain purchase gain in Corporate.\n\n\u2013 Total Markets revenue declined reflecting lower\nMarkets NII, largely offset by higher NIR.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense was $20.8 billion, up 11%,\ndriven by higher compensation expense due to\nadditional headcount and the impact of wage\ninflation, $599 million expense associated with the\nFirst Republic acquisition, higher technology and\nmarketing investments and higher legal expense.\n                                                     5                                                      \n\u2022 The provision for credit losses was $2.9 billion,\nreflecting a $1.5 billion net addition to the\nallowance for credit losses and $1.4 billion of net\ncharge-offs. The net addition to the allowance for\ncredit losses included $1.2 billion to establish\nthe allowance for the First Republic loans and\nlending-related commitments.

In addition, the stress capital buffer\nrequirement would be applicable to both the\nexpanded risk-based approach and the standardized\napproach. The proposal would significantly revise\nrisk-based capital requirements for all banks with\nassets of $100 billion or more, including the Firm\nand other U.S. global systemically important banks\n(\"GSIBs\"). The proposed effective date is July 1,\n2025 with a three year transition period applicable\nto the expanded risk-based approach.\n\n\u2022 GSIB Surcharge: In July 2023, the Federal Reserve\nalso released a proposal to amend the calculation\nof the GSIB surcharge. If adopted as proposed,\nthese amendments would require the Firm to assess\nits GSIB surcharge on an annual basis, using the\naverage of the quarterly surcharge calculations\nthroughout the calendar year, with daily averaging\nrequired for certain measures within the surcharge\ncalculation. Surcharge increments would be reduced\nfrom 50bp to 10bp and there would also be other\ntechnical amendments to the Method 2 calculation.\nThe proposed amendments would revise risk-based\ncapital requirements for the Firm and other U.S.\nGSIBs, and would become effective on two calendar\nquarters after the adoption of the final rule.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 48-53 for\nadditional information.\n                                                                                                            \n  Outlook                                                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \nThese current expectations are forward-looking\nstatements within the meaning of the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Deposits with banks\nreflect the Firm\u2019s placement of its excess cash\nwith various central banks, including the Federal\nReserve Banks.\n\nFederal funds sold and securities purchased under\nresale agreements increased due to the impact of a\nlower level of netting on a reduced level of resale\nbalances in Markets.\n\nSecurities borrowed decreased driven by Markets,\nreflecting lower client-driven activities and lower\ndemand for securities to cover short positions.\n\nRefer to Note 11 for additional information on\nsecurities purchased under resale agreements and\nsecurities borrowed.\n\nTrading assets increased due to higher levels of\ndebt and equity instruments in Markets, in response\nto demand from client-driven market-making\nactivities, and when compared with the seasonally\nlower levels at year-end. Refer to Notes 2 and 5\nfor additional information.\n\nInvestment securities decreased due to:\n\n\u2022 lower available-for-sale (\"AFS\") securities\ndriven by paydowns, maturities and net sales,\npartially offset by $25.8 billion of securities\nassociated with the First Republic acquisition as\nwell as the transfer of securities from held-to-\nmaturity in the first quarter of 2023 (\u201cHTM\u201d), and\n\n\u2022 lower HTM securities driven by paydowns,\nmaturities and the transfer of securities to AFS.\n\nRefer to Corporate segment results on pages 45-46,\n\nInvestment Portfolio Risk Management on page 83,\nand Notes 2 and 10 for additional information.\n\nLoans increased, reflecting :\n\n\u2022 $150 billion of loans associated with the First\nRepublic acquisition, primarily reflected in CCB,\nCB and AWM.\n\nThe increase also included:\n\n\u2022 growth in new accounts and revolving balances\nwhich continued to normalize to pre-pandemic levels\nin Card Services, and\n\n\u2022 higher revolver utilization and originations in\nCB,\n\npartially offset by\n\n\u2022 lower securities-based lending in AWM.\n\nThe allowance for loan losses increased,\nreflecting:\n\n\u2022 a net addition to the allowance for loan losses\nof $1.8 billion, c onsisting of:\n\n\u2013 $1.1 billion in wholesale, predominantly driven\nby net downgrade activity, updates to certain\nassumptions related to office real estate in CB in\nthe second quarter of 2023, and the impact of the\nadditional weight placed on the adverse scenarios\nin the first quarter of 2023, and\n\n\u2013 $620 million in consumer , predominantly driven\nby Card Services, reflecting loan growth, the net\neffect of changes in the Firm's macroeconomic\noutlook, including the impact from the weighted\naverage U.S. unemployment rate peaking in the third\nquarter of 2024, and the additional weight placed\non the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of\n2023, partially offset by reduced borrower\nuncertainty, and\n\n\u2022 $1.1 billion to establish the allowance for the\nFirst Republic loans in the second quarter of 2023.\n                                                     16                                                     \nThe allowance for loan losses also reflected a\nreduction of $587 million, on January 1, 2023, as a\nresult of the adoption of the Financial Instruments\n- Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings\naccounting guidance. References in this Form 10-Q\nto \"changes to the TDR accounting guidance\" pertain\nto the Firm's adoption of this guidance.\n\nThere was also a $196 million net reduction in the\nallowance for lending-related commitments\nrecognized in other liabilities on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets, which included a $97 million\naddition to establish the allowance for the First\nRepublic lending-related commitments .\n\nRefer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on\npages 62-83, and Notes 2, 3, 12 and 13 for\nadditional information on loans and the total\nallowance for credit losses; and Business Segment\nResults on page 24 and Note 28 for additional\ninformation on the First Republic acquisition.\n\nAccrued interest and accounts receivable decreased\nprimarily due to lower client receivables related\nto client-driven activities in Markets.\n\nPremises and equipment increased as a result of the\nFirst Republic acquisition, largely lease right-of-\nuse assets, and the construction-in-process\nassociated with the Firm's headquarters. Refer to\nNote 17 for information on leases.\n\nGoodwill, MSRs and other intangible assets\nincreased predominantly due to the other\nintangibles and goodwill related to the Firm's\nacquisition of the remaining 51% interest in CIFM,\nand the core deposit intangibles associated with\nthe First Republic acquisition.

There are four\nmajor reportable business segments \u2013 Consumer &\nCommunity Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank,\nCommercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management.\nIn addition, there is a Corporate segment.\n\nThe business segments are determined based on the\nproducts and services provided, or the type of\ncustomer served, and they reflect the manner in\nwhich financial information is currently evaluated\nby the Firm\u2019s Operating Committee. Segment results\nare presented on a managed basis. Refer to\nExplanation and Reconciliation of the Firm\u2019s use of\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 20-21 for a\ndefinition of managed basis.\n\nDescription of business segment reporting\nmethodology\n\nResults of the business segments are intended to\npresent each segment as if it were a stand-alone\nbusiness. The management reporting process that\nderives business segment results includes the\nallocation of certain income and expense items. The\nFirm periodically assesses the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications used\nfor segment reporting, and further refinements may\nbe implemented in future periods. The Firm also\nassesses the level of capital required for each LOB\non at least an annual basis. The Firm\u2019s LOBs also\nprovide various business metrics which are utilized\nby the Firm and its investors and analysts in\nassessing performance.\n\nRevenue sharing\n\nWhen business segments join efforts to sell\nproducts and services to the Firm\u2019s clients and\ncustomers, the participating business segments may\nagree to share revenue from those transactions.\nRevenue is generally recognized in the segment\nresponsible for the related product or service,\nwith allocations to the other segment(s) involved\nin the transaction. The segment results reflect\nthese revenue-sharing agreements.\n\nFunds transfer pricing\n\nFunds transfer pricing (\u201cFTP\u201d) is the process by\nwhich the Firm allocates interest income and\nexpense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and\ntransfers the primary interest rate risk and\nliquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.\n\nThe funds transfer pricing process considers the\ninterest rate risk and liquidity risk\ncharacteristics of assets and liabilities and off-\nbalance sheet products. Periodically the\nmethodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP\nprocess are adjusted to reflect economic conditions\nand other factors, which may impact the allocation\nof net interest income to the segments.\n\nForeign exchange risk\n\nForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs\nand Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain\nrevenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages\nthese risks centrally and reports the impact of\nforeign exchange rate movements related to the\ntransferred risk in its results. Refer to Market\nRisk Management on pages 84-89 for additional\ninformation.\n\nCapital allocation\n\nThe amount of capital assigned to each business\nsegment is referred to as equity. At least\nannually, the assumptions, judgments and\nmethodologies used to allocate capital are\nreassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated\nto the LOBs may change. As of June 30, 2023, the\nFirm updated its line of business capital\nallocations to reflect the impact of the First\nRepublic acquisition. Refer to Line of business\nequity on page 51, and page 93 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n2022 Form 10-K for additional information on\ncapital allocation.\n\nRefer to Business Segment Results \u2013 Description of\nbusiness segment reporting methodology on pages\n61-62 and Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form\n10-K for a further discussion of those\nmethodologies.\n

balances,\n\npartially offset by\n\n\u2022 the impact of lower PPP loan forgiveness in BWM.\n\nNoninterest revenue was $7.2 billion, down 7%,\ndriven by:\n\n\u2022 lower auto operating lease income as a result of\na decline in volume and\n\n\u2022 in Home Lending, lower production revenue from a\ndecline in volume and lower net mortgage servicing\nrevenue predominantly driven by lower net gains on\nMSR risk management,\n\npartially offset by\n\n\u2022 higher travel-related commissions in Card\nServices,\n\n\u2022 higher asset management fees in BWM driven by the\nimpact of the First Republic acquisition.\n\nCard income was relatively flat as the increase in\nnet interchange in the first quarter of 2023 due to\na reduction in rewards costs and partner payments\nrelated to a periodic tax refund on airline miles\nredeemed was offset by an increase to the rewards\nliability due to adjustments to certain reward\nprogram terms in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNoninterest expense was $16.4 billion, up 7%,\ndriven by:\n\n\u2022 higher compensation expense, including wage\ninflation and headcount growth, as well as higher\nmarketing and technology,\n\npartially offset by\n\n\u2022 lower auto lease depreciation on lower auto lease\nassets.\n\nThe provision for credit losses was $3.3 billion,\nand included:\n\n\u2022 net charge-offs of $2.3 billion, up $1.1 billion,\npredominantly driven by Card Services, as 30+ day\ndelinquencies have returned to pre-pandemic levels,\nand\n\n\u2022 a $553 million net addition, predominantly driven\nby Card Services, reflecting loan growth, the net\neffect of changes in the Firm's macroeconomic\noutlook, including the impact from the weighted\naverage U.S. unemployment rate peaking in the third\nquarter of 2024, and the additional weight placed\non the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of\n2023, partially offset by reduced borrower\nuncertainty, and\n\n\u2022 a $408 million net addition to the allowance for\ncredit losses to establish the allowance for the\nFirst Republic loans and lending-related\ncommitments, in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nThe prior year included a $275 million addition to\nthe allowance for credit losses in Card Services\nand Home Lending.\n                                                     26                                                     \n

90 or more days past due and insured\nby U.S. government agencies of $139 million and $257 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded\nbased upon the government guarantee. In addition, the Firm\u2019s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans\nfrom being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance.\n\n(b) At June 30, 2023 and 2022, generally excludes loans that were under payment deferral programs offered in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to Credit Portfolio on pages 108-109 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form\n10-K for further information on consumer assistance.\n\n(c) At June 30, 2023 and 2022, included $163 million and $1.5 billion of loans, respectively, in Business\nBanking under the PPP. The Firm does not expect to realize material credit losses on PPP loans because the\nloans are guaranteed by the SBA. Refer to Credit Portfolio on pages 108-109 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form\n10-K for a further discussion of the PPP.\n\n(d) At June 30, 2023 and 2022, the principal balance of loans under payment deferral programs offered in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic was $177 million and $513 million in Home Lending, respectively. Loans\nthat are performing according to their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent. Refer to\nCredit Portfolio on pages 108-109 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for further information on consumer\nassistance.\n\n(e) At June 30, 2023 and 2022, excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $195 million\nand $315 million, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based\nupon the government guarantee.\n\n(f) As of June 30, 2023, included a $377 million allowance established as part of the First Republic\nacquisition.\n\n(g) On January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted changes to the TDR accounting guidance. The adoption of this\nguidance resulted in a net decrease in the allowance for loan losses of $591 million, driven by residential\nreal estate and credit card.

When the Firm extends a\nconsumer or wholesale loan, advises customers and\nclients on their investment decisions, makes\nmarkets in securities, or offers other products or\nservices, the Firm takes on some degree of risk.\nThe Firm\u2019s overall objective is to manage its\nbusiness, and the associated risks, in a manner\nthat balances serving the interests of its clients,\ncustomers and investors, and protecting the safety\nand soundness of the Firm. The Firm believes that\neffective risk management requires, among other\nthings: \u2022 Acceptance of responsibility, including\nidentification and escalation of risks by all\nindividuals within the Firm; \u2022 Ownership of risk\nidentification, assessment, data and management\nwithin each of the LOBs and Corporate; and \u2022 A\nFirmwide risk governance and oversight structure.\nThe Firm follows a disciplined and balanced\ncompensation framework with strong internal\ngovernance and independent oversight by the Board\nof Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d). The impact of risk and\ncontrol issues is carefully considered in the\nFirm\u2019s performance evaluation and incentive\ncompensation processes. Risk governance framework\nThe Firm\u2019s risk governance framework involves\nunderstanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and\nimpacts of risks.

The minimum amount of\nregulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and\nbanks is determined by calculating risk-weighted\nassets (\"RWA\"), which are on-balance sheet assets\nand off-balance sheet exposures, weighted according\nto risk. Two comprehensive approaches are\nprescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized\napproach (\u201cBasel III Standardized\u201d), and an\nadvanced approach (\u201cBasel III Advanced\u201d). For each\nof the risk-based capital ratios, the capital\nadequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower\nof the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared\nto their respective regulatory capital ratio\nrequirements. The Firm\u2019s Basel III Standardized\nrisk-based ratios are currently more binding than\nthe Basel III Advanced risk-based ratios.\n\nBasel III also includes a requirement for Advanced\nApproaches banking organizations, including the\nFirm, to calculate its SLR. Refer to SLR on page 51\nfor additional information.\n\nKey Regulatory Developments\n\nCECL regulatory capital transition\n\nBeginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9 billion CECL\ncapital benefit, provided by the Federal Reserve in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic, is being phased\nout at 25% per year over a three-year period. As of\nJune 30, 2023, the Firm's CET1 capital reflected\nthe remaining $1.4 billion benefit associated with\nthe CECL capital transition provisions.\n\nAdditionally, effective January 1, 2023, the Firm\nphased out 50% of the other CECL capital transition\nprovisions which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted\naverage assets, total leverage exposure and RWA, as\napplicable.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 and\nNote 1 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for\nfurther information on CECL capital transition\nprovisions and the CECL accounting guidance.\n\nRisk-based Capital Targets\n\nThe Firm\u2019s target for its Basel III Standardized\nCET1 capital ratio for the first quarter of 2024\nremains at 13.5%. The Firm\u2019s quarterly capital\nratios may vary from the target dependent on market\nconditions. The target is based on the Basel III\ncapital rules currently in effect.\n\nBasel III Finalization\n\nIn July 2023, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the\nFDIC released a proposal to amend the risk-based\ncapital framework, entitled \"Regulatory capital\nrule: Amendments applicable to large banking\norganizations and to banking organizations with\nsignificant trading activity\". Under the proposal,\nchanges would include replacement of the advanced\napproach with an expanded risk-based approach,\nwhich would not permit the use of internal models\nfor the calculation of risk-weighted assets, other\nthan for Market risk. In addition, the stress\ncapital buffer requirement would be applicable to\nboth the expanded risk-based approach and the\nstandardized approach. The proposal would\nsignificantly revise risk-based capital\nrequirements for all banks with assets of $100\nbillion or more, including the Firm and other U.S.\nGSIBs. The proposed effective date is July 1, 2025\nwith a three year transition period applicable to\nthe expanded risk-based approach.\n\nGSIB Surcharge\n\nIn July 2023, the Federal Reserve also released a\nproposal to amend the calculation of the GSIB\nsurcharge. If adopted as proposed, these amendments\nwould require the Firm to assess its GSIB surcharge\non an annual basis, using the average of the\nquarterly surcharge calculations throughout the\ncalendar year, with daily averaging required for\ncertain measures within the surcharge calculation.\nSurcharge increments would be reduced from 50bp to\n10bp and there would also be other technical\namendments to the Method 2 calculation. The\nproposed amendments would revise risk-based capital\nrequirements for the Firm and other U.S. GSIBs, and\nwould become effective on two calendar quarters\nafter the adoption of the final rule. Refer to\nRisk-based Capital Regulatory Requirements on pages\n89-90 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for\nfurther information on the GSIB surcharge.\n                                                     48                                                     \nThe following tables present the Firm\u2019s risk-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and\nAdvanced approaches and leverage-based capital metrics. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of these capital metrics. Refer to Note 23 for\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s risk-based and leverage-based capital metrics. First Republic Bank was not\nsubject to Advanced approach regulatory capital requirements. As a result, for certain exposures associated\nwith the First Republic acquisition, Advanced RWA and any impact on Advanced Total capital is calculated\nunder the Standardized approach as permitted by the transition provisions in the U.S. capital rules. Refer\nto Note 28 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition.\n                                                                                                            \n  (in         Standa\u2026                                        Advan\u2026                                         \n  mill\u2026          June          Decem\u2026       Capital            June                Decemb\u2026       Capit\u2026     \n  exce\u2026           30,             31,         ratio             30,                    31,        ratio     \n  rati\u2026          2023            2022       requir\u2026            2023                   2022       requi\u2026     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Risk\u2026                                                                                                     \n  capi\u2026                                                                                                     \n  metr\u2026                                                                                                     \n  CET1     $  235,827       $  218,9\u2026                     $  235,8\u2026             $  218,934                  \n  capi\u2026                                                                                                     \n  Tier                                                                                                      \n  1           262,585          245,6\u2026                        262,5\u2026                245,631                  \n  capi\u2026                                                                                                     \n  Total       295,281          277,7\u2026                        281,9\u2026       -c       264,583                  \n  capi\u2026                                                                                                     \n  Risk\u2026       1,706,\u2026          1,653\u2026                        1,694\u2026       -c       1,609,\u2026                  \n  asse\u2026                                                                                                     \n  CET1                                                                                                      \n  capi\u2026          13.8  %         13.2  %       12.5  %         13.9  %                13.6  %      11.0  %  \n  ratio                                                                                                     \n  Tier                                                                                                      \n  1              15.4            14.9          14.0            15.5                   15.3         12.5     \n  capi\u2026                                                                                                     \n  ratio                                                                                                     \n  Total                                                                                                     \n  capi\u2026          17.3            16.8          16.0            16.6                   16.4         14.5     \n  ratio                                                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n(a) The capital metrics reflect the CECL capital transition provisions.\n\n(b) Represents minimum requirements and regulatory buffers applicable to the Firm for the period ended June\n30, 2023.

Refer to pages 97-104 of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K and the Firm\u2019s U.S.\nLCR Disclosure reports, which are available on the\nFirm\u2019s website, for a further discussion of the\nFirm\u2019s liquidity risk. LCR and HQLA The LCR rule\nrequires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is\nsufficient to meet their respective estimated total\nnet cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-\nday period of significant stress. Under the LCR\nrule, the amount of eligible HQLA held by JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand-\nalone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not\ntransferable to non-bank affiliates, must be\nexcluded from the Firm\u2019s reported eligible HQLA.\nThe LCR for both the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. is required to be a minimum of 100%.

The Firm\u2019s average LCR decreased during the three months\nended June 30, 2023, compared with the three months period ended March 31, 2023, due to long-term debt\nmaturities, common stock repurchases and common stock\n\ndividends paid, predominantly offset by a dividend payment from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the Parent\nCompany. The Firm's average LCR increased during the three months ended June 30, 2023, compared with the\nprior year period, driven by dividend payments from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the Parent Company,\npartially offset by common stock repurchases and common stock dividends paid. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s\naverage LCR decreased during the three months ended June 30, 2023, compared with the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2023, reflecting an approximate 50% decline associated with the First Republic acquisition,\nreducing HQLA and increasing net cash outflows. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s HQLA was further impacted by a\nreduction in cash primarily driven by higher average loans, a dividend payment to the Parent Company, and a\ndecline in average deposits. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s average LCR for the three months ended June 30,\n2023 decreased when compared with the same period in the prior year, reflecting a decrease in JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A.\u2019s HQLA as a result of a reduction in cash from a decline in average deposits and loan growth, as\nwell as lower market values of HQLA-eligible investment securities and the impact of the First Republic\nacquisition. Refer to Note 10 and Note 28 for additional information on the Firm's investment securities\nportfolio and the First Republic acquisition. Actions by the Federal Reserve have impacted depositor\nbehavior, resulting in reductions to system-wide deposits, including those held by the Firm. Each of the\nFirm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR may fluctuate from period to period due to changes in their\nrespective eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity and from\nthe continued impacts of Federal Reserve actions as well as other factors. Refer to page 98 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K and the Firm\u2019s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports for additional information on HQLA and net\ncash outflows. Internal stress testing The Firm conducts internal liquidity stress testing that is intended\nto ensure that the Firm and its material legal entities have sufficient liquidity under a variety of adverse\nscenarios, including scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm\u2019s resolution and recovery planning. Internal\nStress scenarios are produced on a regular basis, and other stress tests are performed in response to\nspecific market events or concerns. Results of stress tests are considered in the formulation of the Firm\u2019s\nfunding plan and assessment of its liquidity position. The Firm maintains liquidity at the Parent Company,\nthe Intermediate Holding Company (\u201cIHC\u201d), and operating subsidiaries at levels sufficient to comply with\nliquidity risk tolerances and minimum liquidity requirements, and to\n                                                     54                                                     \nmanage through periods of stress when access to\nnormal funding sources may be disrupted.\n                                                                                                            \n   Other liquidity sources                                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \nIn addition to the assets reported in the Firm\u2019s\neligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had\nunencumbered marketable securities, such as equity\nand debt securities, that the Firm believes would\nbe available to raise liquidity. This includes\nexcess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank\naffiliates. The fair value of these securities was\napproximately $620 billion and $694 billion as of\nJune 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively,\nalthough the amount of liquidity that could be\nraised at any particular time would be dependent on\nprevailing market conditions. The decrease compared\nto December 31, 2022, was driven by a reduction in\nexcess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A., largely offset by an increase in CIB\ntrading assets and AFS securities associated with\nthe First Republic acquisition.\n\nThe Firm also had available borrowing capacity at\nthe Federal Home Loan Banks (\u201cFHLBs\u201d) and the\ndiscount window at the Federal Reserve Banks as a\nresult of collateral pledged by the Firm to such\nbanks of approximately $332 billion and $323\nbillion as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nrespectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the\nbenefit of cash and securities reported in the\nFirm\u2019s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered\nsecurities that are currently pledged at the\nFederal Reserve Banks discount window and other\ncentral banks. Although available, the Firm does\nnot view this borrowing capacity at the Federal\nReserve Banks discount window and the other central\nbanks as a primary source of liquidity.\n                                                                                                            \n  NSFR                                                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nThe net stable funding ratio (\u201cNSFR\u201d) is a\nliquidity requirement for large banking\norganizations that is intended to measure the\nadequacy of \u201cavailable\u201d stable funding that is\nsufficient to meet their \u201crequired\u201d amounts of\nstable funding over a one-year horizon.\n\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Firm and JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. were compliant with the 100% minimum\nNSFR requirement, based on the Firm's current\ninterpretation of the final rule.

A significant\nportion of the Firm\u2019s deposits are consumer\ndeposits and wholesale operating deposits, which\nare both considered to be stable sources of\nliquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are\ngenerally considered to be stable sources of\nliquidity because they are generated from customers\nthat maintain operating service relationships with\nthe Firm.\n\nThe Firm believes that average deposit balances are\ngenerally more representative of deposit trends\nthan period-end deposit balances. However, during\nperiods of market disruption those trends could be\naffected.\n\nAverage deposits were lower for the three months\nended June 30, 2023 compared to the three months\nended June 30, 2022. The decrease was driven by:\n\n\u2022 the continued migration into higher-yielding\ninvestments in AWM as a result of the rising\ninterest rate environment,\n\n\u2022 continued deposit attrition in CIB, including\nactions to reduce certain deposits, partially\noffset by net issuances of structured notes as a\nresult of client demand,\n\n\u2022 continued deposit attrition in CB, partially\noffset by continued inflows as a result of\ndisruptions in the market in the first quarter of\n2023, and\n\n\u2022 a net decline in CCB primarily from existing\naccounts due to increased customer spending,\nlargely offset by the impact of the First Republic\nacquisition,\n\npartially offset by\n\n\u2022 an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's\ninternational consumer initiatives.\n\nAverage deposits were lower for the six months\nended June 30, 2023 compared to the six months\nended June 30, 2022. The decrease was driven by:\n\n\u2022 the continued migration into higher-yielding\ninvestments in AWM as a result of the rising\ninterest rate environment,\n\n\u2022 continued deposit attrition in CIB, including\nactions to reduce certain deposits, partially\noffset by net issuances of structured notes as a\nresult of client demand,\n\n\u2022 continued deposit attrition in CB, partially\noffset by continued inflows as a result of\ndisruptions in the market in the first quarter of\n2023, and\n\n\u2022 a net decline in CCB primarily from existing\naccounts due to increased customer spending,\npartially offset by the impact of the First\nRepublic acquisition,\n\npartially offset by\n\n\u2022 an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's\ninternational consumer initiatives.\n                                                     56                                                     \nPeriod-end deposits increased, reflecting: \u2022\nincreases in CIB due to deposit inflows related to\nclient-driven activities and net issuances of\nstructured notes as a result of client demand, \u2022\n$68 billion of deposits in CCB associated with the\nFirst Republic acquisition, partially offset by a\nnet decline primarily in existing accounts due to\nincreased customer spending, and \u2022 an increase in\nCorporate related to the Firm's international\nconsumer initiatives, partially offset by \u2022 the\ncontinued migration into higher-yielding\ninvestments in AWM as a result of the rising\ninterest rate environment, and \u2022 ongoing attrition\nin CB driven by higher rates and seasonal outflows,\npredominantly offset by inflows as a result of\ndisruptions in the market in the first quarter of\n2023. Refer to the Firm\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheets Analysis and the Business Segment Results on\npages 16-19 and pages 22-46, respectively, for\nfurther information on deposit and liability\nbalance trends. Refer to Note 3 for further\ninformation on structured notes.\n\nCertain deposits are covered by insurance\nprotection that provides additional funding\nstability and results in a benefit to the LCR.\nDeposit insurance protection may be available to\ndepositors in the countries in which the deposits\nare placed. For example, the FDIC provides deposit\ninsurance protection for deposits placed in a U.S.\ndepository institution. At June 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022 (a) , the Firmwide estimated\nuninsured deposits were $1,381.1 billion and\n$1,353.1 billion, respectively, primarily\nreflecting wholesale operating deposits. Total\nuninsured deposits include time deposits. The table\nbelow presents an estimate of uninsured U.S. and\nnon-U.S. time deposits, and their remaining\nmaturities. The Firm\u2019s estimates of its uninsured\nU.S. time deposits are based on data that the Firm\ncalculates periodically under applicable FDIC\nregulations.

These instruments\nare secured predominantly by high-quality\nsecurities collateral, including government-issued\ndebt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS.\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase\nincreased at June 30, 2023, compared with December\n31, 2022, due to higher secured financing of\ntrading assets and the impact of a lower level of\nnetting on client-driven market-making activities\nin Markets.\n\nThe balances associated with securities loaned or\nsold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over\ntime due to investment and financing activities of\nclients, the Firm\u2019s demand for financing, the\nongoing management of the mix of the Firm\u2019s\nliabilities, including its secured and unsecured\nfinancing (for both the investment securities and\nmarket-making portfolios), and other market and\nportfolio factors.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s sources of short-term unsecured funding\nprimarily consist of issuances of wholesale\ncommercial paper and other borrowed funds.\n\nThe decrease in commercial paper at June 30, 2023\nfrom December 31, 2022, and for the average three\nand six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the\nprior year periods, was due to lower net issuance\nlevels resulting from short-term liquidity\nmanagement.\n\nThe decrease in average unsecured other borrowed\nfunds for the three and six months ended June 30,\n2023 compared to the prior year periods was due to\na lower level of overdrafts as well as net\nmaturities of structured notes classified as other\nborrowed funds in CIB.\n                                                     59                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Long-term funding and issuance                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \nLong-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm\u2019s\nlong-term funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and\nregulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification,\nmaximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors\nand currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan.\n\nThe significant majority of the Firm\u2019s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to\nprovide flexibility in support of the funding needs of both bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The Parent\nCompany advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue\ndebt to external counterparties.

Reductions in these\nratings could have an adverse effect on the Firm\u2019s\naccess to liquidity sources, increase the cost of\nfunds, trigger additional collateral or funding\nrequirements and decrease the number of investors\nand counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The\nnature and magnitude of the impact of ratings\ndowngrades depends on numerous contractual and\nbehavioral factors, which the Firm believes are\nincorporated in its liquidity risk\n\nand stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that\nit maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a\npotential decrease in funding capacity due to\nratings downgrades.\n\nAdditionally, the Firm\u2019s funding requirements for\nVIEs and other third-party commitments may be\nadversely affected by a decline in credit ratings.\nRefer to Note 5 and Note 14 for additional\ninformation.\n\nThe credit ratings of the Parent Company and the\nFirm\u2019s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as\nof June 30, 2023, were as follows:\n                                                                                                            \n                                                                              J.P.                          \n                                                                              Morgan                        \n                                                                              Securi\u2026                       \n                                                                              LLC                           \n                                                                              J.P.                          \n                                                                              Morgan                        \n                                                                              Securi\u2026                       \n                                             JPMorg\u2026                          plc                           \n            JPMorg\u2026                          Chase                            J.P.                          \n            Chase &                          Bank,                            Morgan                        \n  June      Co.

On January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted changes to the\nTDR accounting guidance, which eliminated the accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs including the\nrequirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession. The new\nguidance requires disclosure for loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty\nconsisting of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, other-than-insignificant payment delay, term\nextension or a combination of these modifications. The Firm has defined these types of modifications as\nfinancial difficulty modifications (\"FDMs\"). As a result of the elimination of the requirement to assess\nwhether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession, the population of loans considered\nFDMs will differ from those previously considered TDRs.

to\nDecember 31, 2022 driven by residential real estate\nloans associated with the First Republic\nacquisition and higher auto loans. Residential real\nestate: The residential real estate portfolio,\nincluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair\nvalue, predominantly consists of prime mortgage\nloans and home equity lines of credit. Retained\nloans increased compared to December 31, 2022,\nreflecting residential real estate loans associated\nwith the First Republic acquisition. Retained\nnonaccrual loans decreased compared to December 31,\n2022. Net recoveries were lower for the three and\nsix months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same\nperiods in the prior year driven by lower\nprepayments due to higher interest rates. Loans at\nfair value decreased from December 31, 2022, driven\nby a decrease in CIB due to sales outpacing\npurchases largely offset by an increase in Home\nLending as originations outpaced warehouse loan\nsales. Nonaccrual loans at fair value were\nrelatively flat compared to December 31, 2022. At\nJune 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the carrying\nvalue of interest-only residential mortgage loans\nwas $90.0 billion and $36.3 billion, respectively.\nThe increase was driven by the impact of the First\nRepublic acquisition. These loans have an interest-\nonly payment period generally followed by an\nadjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing\npayment period to maturity and are typically\noriginated as higher-balance loans to higher-income\nborrowers. The credit performance of this portfolio\nis comparable with the performance of the broader\nprime mortgage portfolio and there were no charge-\noffs associated with the First Republic\nacquisition. The carrying value of home equity\nlines of credit outstanding was $16.9 billion at\nJune 30, 2023, which included $2.6 billion\nassociated with the First Republic acquisition. The\ncarrying value of home equity lines of credit\noutstanding included $4.6 billion of HELOCs that\nhave recast from interest-only to fully amortizing\npayments or have been modified and $4.7 billion of\ninterest-only balloon HELOCs, which primarily\nmature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk of\nHELOCs during their revolving period by closing or\nreducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted\nby law when borrowers are exhibiting a material\ndeterioration in their credit risk profile.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the\nFirm\u2019s residential mortgage portfolio insured\nand/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies,\npredominantly loans held-for-sale and loans at fair\nvalue. The Firm monitors its exposure to certain\npotential unrecoverable claim payments related to\ngovernment-insured loans and considers this\nexposure in estimating the allowance for loan\nlosses.\n                                                                                 \n                                               June 30,            December 31,  \n  (in millions)                                2023                2022          \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Current                              $  614            $    659                \n  30-89 days past due                     112                 136                \n  90 or more days past due                215                 302                \n  Total government guaranteed loans    $  941            $  1,097                \n                                                                                 \nGeographic composition and current estimated loan-\nto-value ratio of residential real estate loans At\nJune 30, 2023, $229.8 billion, or 70% of the total\nretained residential real estate loan portfolio,\nwas concentrated in California, New York, Florida,\nTexas and Massachusetts, compared with $147.8\nbillion, or 62% at December 31, 2022. Refer to Note\n12 for information on the geographic composition\nand current estimated LTVs of the Firm\u2019s\nresidential real estate loans. Modified residential\nreal estate loans For the three and six months\nended June 30, 2023, residential real estate FDMs\nwere $35 million and $75 million, respectively. In\naddition to FDMs, the Firm also had $33 million and\n$48 million of loans subject to trial modification\nwhere the terms of the loans have not been\npermanently modified, as well as $3 million and $5\nmillion of loans subject to discharge under Chapter\n7 bankruptcy proceedings (\"Chapter 7 loans\") for\nthe three and six months ended June 30, 2023,\nrespectively. The changes to the TDR accounting\nguidance eliminated the TDR reasonably expected and\nconcession assessment criteria. Accordingly, trial\nmodifications and Chapter 7 loans were considered\nTDRs, but not FDMs. Refer to Note 1 and Note 12 for\nfurther information. For the three and six months\nended June 30, 2022, residential real estate TDRs\nwere $115 million and $233 million, respectively.\nRefer to Note 12 for further information on TDRs in\nprior periods.\n                                                     67                                                     \nAuto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio,\nincluding loans at fair value consists of prime-\nquality scored auto and business banking loans,\nother consumer unsecured loans, and overdrafts. The\nportfolio increased when compared to December 31,\n2022 due to originations of scored Auto loans and\nan increase in other consumer unsecured fair value\noption loans associated with the First Republic\nacquisition, largely offset by paydowns. Net\ncharge-offs increased for the three and six months\nended June 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in\nthe prior year due to higher scored Auto charge-\noffs as delinquency levels normalized and vehicle\nvaluations declined. The scored Auto net charge-off\nrates were 0.41% and 0.12% for the three months\nended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and\n0.43% and 0.15% for the six months ended June 30,\n2023 and 2022, respectively.

The June 30, 2023 30+ and 90+\nday delinquency rates of 1.70% and 0.84%,\nrespectively, increased compared to the December\n31, 2022 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.45%\nand 0.68% respectively, and net charge-offs\nincreased for the three and six months ended June\n30, 2023 compared to the same periods in the prior\nyear as 30+ day delinquencies have normalized.\n\nConsistent with the Firm\u2019s policy, all credit card\nloans typically remain on accrual status until\ncharged off. However, the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan\nlosses includes the estimated uncollectible portion\nof accrued and billed interest and fee income.\nRefer to Note 12 for further information about this\nportfolio, including information about\ndelinquencies.\n\nGeographic and FICO composition of credit card\nloans\n\nRefer to Note 12 for information on the geographic\nand FICO composition of the Firm\u2019s credit card\nloans.\n                                                                                                            \n  Modifications of credit card loans                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2023,\ncredit card FDMs were $181 million and $326\nmillion, respectively. In addition to FDMs, the\nFirm also had $26 million of loans subject to trial\nmodification where the terms of the loans have not\nbeen permanently modified for both the three and\nsix months ended June 30, 2023. The changes to the\nTDR accounting guidance eliminated the TDR\nreasonably expected and concession assessment\ncriteria. Accordingly, trial modifications were\nconsidered TDRs, but not FDMs.\n\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2022,\ncredit card TDRs were $81 million and $163 million,\nrespectively.\n\nRefer to Note 1 and Note 12 for further\ninformation.\n                                                     69                                                     \n                              \n  WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO  \n                              \nIn its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending,\nmarket-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various\noperating services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and\ncash placed with banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm\u2019s wholesale businesses is\ngenerally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it\noriginates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations\nand credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth\nreviews of client credit quality and transaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of\nindustry, product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 72-75 for further\ninformation. The Firm\u2019s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as\nwell as risk-rated BWM and auto dealer exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied\nwhen determining the allowance for loan losses. The Firm continues to convert certain operations, and to\nintegrate clients, products and services, associated with the First Republic acquisition to align with the\nFirm\u2019s businesses and operations. Accordingly, reporting classifications and internal risk rating profiles\nin the wholesale portfolio may change in future periods. Refer to Business Developments on page 9 for\nadditional information. As of June 30, 2023, the increase in nonperforming exposure was driven by loans,\nresulting from client-specific downgrades in CB and AWM, partially offset by a reduction in lending-related\ncommitments. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, wholesale charge-offs remained low, despite an increase\nin charge-offs in the second quarter of 2023 concentrated in Office real estate. As of June 30, 2023,\nretained loans increased $64.5 billion predominantly driven by the impact of the First Republic acquisition.\nLending-related commitments increased $69.1 billion driven by the impact of the First Republic acquisition,\nand net portfolio activity in CIB and CB, including an increase in held-for-sale positions in the bridge\nfinancing portfolio.\n

Total criticized exposure,\nexcluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $35.0 billion and $31.3 billion as of June 30,\n2023 and December 31, 2022, representing approximately 2.8% and 2.7% of total wholesale credit exposure,\nrespectively . Criticized exposure increased, driven by client-specific downgrades largely in Real Estate,\nConsumer and Retail, Technology, Media & Telecommunications, and Healthcare, as well as exposures associated\nwith the First Republic acquisition, partially offset by client-specific upgrades. Of the $35.0 billion of\ncriticized exposure at June 30, 2023, approximately half was undrawn and $31.8 billion was performing.\n\nThe table below summarizes by industry the Firm\u2019s exposures as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

(including\nrevolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to\naddress the financing needs of its clients. The\ncontractual amounts of these financial instruments\nrepresent the maximum possible credit risk should\nthe clients draw down on these commitments or when\nthe Firm fulfills its obligations under these\nguarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to\nperform according to the terms of these contracts.\nMost of these commitments and guarantees have\nhistorically been refinanced, extended, cancelled,\nor expired without being drawn upon or a default\noccurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe\nthat the total contractual amount of these\nwholesale lending-related commitments is\nrepresentative of the Firm\u2019s expected future credit\nexposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 24\nfor further information on wholesale lending-\nrelated commitments.\n                                                                                                            \n  Receivables from customers                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nReceivables from customers reflect held-for-\ninvestment margin loans to brokerage clients in\nCIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets\nmaintained in the clients\u2019 brokerage accounts\n(e.g., cash on deposit, and liquid and readily\nmarketable debt or equity securities). Because of\nthis collateralization, no allowance for credit\nlosses is generally held against these receivables.\nTo manage its credit risk the Firm establishes\nmargin requirements and monitors the required\nmargin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires\nclients to deposit additional cash or other\ncollateral, or to reduce positions, when\nappropriate. These receivables are reported within\naccrued interest and accounts receivable on the\nFirm\u2019s Consolidated balance sheets.\n                                                                                                            \n  Derivative contracts                                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to\nmanage risk including credit risk and risks arising\nfrom fluctuations in interest rates, foreign\nexchange and equities and commodities prices. The\nFirm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet\nthese needs and uses derivatives to manage certain\nrisks associated with net open risk positions from\nits market-making activities, including the\ncounterparty credit risk arising from derivative\nreceivables. The Firm also uses derivative\ninstruments to manage its own credit risk and other\nmarket risk exposure. The nature of the\ncounterparty and the settlement mechanism of the\nderivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm\nis exposed. For over-the-counter (\"OTC\")\nderivatives the Firm is exposed to the credit risk\nof the derivative counterparty. For exchange-traded\nderivatives (\u201cETD\u201d), such as futures and options,\nand cleared over-the-counter (\u201cOTC-cleared\u201d)\nderivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the\ncredit risk of the relevant central counterparty\nclearing house (\u201cCCP\u201d). Where possible, the Firm\nseeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising\nfrom derivative contracts through the use of\nlegally enforceable master netting arrangements and\ncollateral agreements.\n\nThe percentage of the Firm\u2019s over-the-counter\nderivative transactions subject to collateral\nagreements \u2014 excluding foreign exchange spot\ntrades, which are not typically covered by\ncollateral agreements due to their short maturity,\nand centrally cleared trades that are settled daily\n\u2014 was approximately 88% and 87% at June 30, 2023,\nand December 31, 2022, respectively. Refer to Note\n5 for additional information on the Firm\u2019s use of\ncollateral agreements and for a further discussion\nof derivative contracts, counterparties and\nsettlement types.\n\nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported\non the Consolidated balance sheets was $64.2\nbillion and $70.9 billion at June 30, 2023, and\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively. The decrease was\nprimarily driven by market movements in CIB\nMarkets. Derivative receivables represent the fair\nvalue of the derivative contracts after giving\neffect to legally enforceable master netting\nagreements and the related cash collateral held by\nthe Firm.\n\nIn addition, the Firm held liquid securities and\nother cash collateral that may be used as security\nwhen the fair value of the client\u2019s exposure is in\nthe Firm\u2019s favor. For these purposes, the\ndefinition of liquid securities is consistent with\nthe definition of high quality liquid assets as\ndefined in the LCR rule.\n\nIn management\u2019s view, the appropriate measure of\ncurrent credit risk should also take into\nconsideration other collateral, which generally\nrepresents securities that do not qualify as high\nquality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The\nbenefits of these additional collateral amounts for\neach counterparty are subject to a legally\nenforceable master netting agreement and limited to\nthe net amount of the derivative receivables for\neach counterparty.\n\nThe Firm also holds additional collateral\n(primarily cash, G7 government securities, other\nliquid government agency and guaranteed securities,\nand corporate debt and equity securities) delivered\nby clients at the initiation of transactions, as\nwell as collateral related to contracts that have a\nnon-daily call frequency and collateral that the\nFirm has agreed to return but has not yet settled\nas of the reporting date. Although this collateral\ndoes not reduce the balances and is not included in\nthe tables below, it is available as security\nagainst potential exposure that could arise should\nthe fair value of the client\u2019s derivative contracts\nmove in the Firm\u2019s favor.

The allowance for credit losses\ngenerally consists of : \u2022 the allowance for loan\nlosses, which covers the Firm\u2019s retained loan\nportfolios (scored and risk-rated), \u2022 the allowance\nfor lending-related commitments, which is reflected\nin accounts payable and other liabilities on the\nConsolidated balance sheets, and \u2022 the allowance\nfor credit losses on investment securities, which\nis reflected in investment securities on the\nConsolidated balance sheets. Discussion of changes\nin the allowance The allowance for credit losses as\nof June 30, 2023 was $24.3 billion, reflecting a\nnet addition of $2.7 billion from December 31,\n2022. The net addition to the allowance for credit\nlosses included $1.5 billion, consisting of: \u2022 $819\nmillion in wholesale , predominantly driven by net\ndowngrade activity, updates to certain assumptions\nrelated to office real estate in CB in the second\nquarter of 2023, and the impact of the additional\nweight placed on the adverse scenarios in the first\nquarter of 2023, and \u2022 $649 million in consumer ,\npredominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting\nloan growth, the net effect of changes in the\nFirm's macroeconomic outlook, including the impact\nfrom the weighted average U.S. unemployment rate\npeaking in the third quarter of 2024, and the\nadditional weight placed on the adverse scenarios\nin the first quarter of 2023, partially offset by\nreduced borrower uncertainty. The net addition also\nincluded $1.2 billion to establish the allowance\nfor the First Republic loans and lending-related\ncommitments in the second quarter of 2023. The Firm\nhas maintained the additional weight placed on the\nrelative adverse scenario in the first quarter of\n2023, reflecting an increased probability of a\nmoderate recession due to tightening financial\nconditions. The allowance for credit losses also\nreflected a reduction of $587 million as a result\nof the adoption of changes to the TDR accounting\nguidance on January 1, 2023.

1, 2023. The adoption of this guidance eliminated the existing accounting and\ndisclosure requirements for TDRs, including the requirement to measure the allowance using a discounted cash\nflow (\"DCF\") methodology. The Firm elected to change from an asset-specific allowance approach to its non-\nDCF, portfolio-based allowance approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers for all portfolios except\ncollateral-dependent loans and nonaccrual risk-rated loans, for which the asset-specific allowance approach\nwill continue to apply. Refer to Note 1 for further information.\n\n(b) Includes collateral-dependent loans, including those for which foreclosure is deemed probable, and\nnonaccrual risk-rated loans for all periods presented. Prior periods also include non collateral-dependent\nTDRs or reasonably expected TDRs and modified purchased credit deteriorated (\"PCD\") loans.\n\n(c) At June 30, 2023, in addition to the allowance for credit losses in the table above, the Firm also had\nan allowance for credit losses of $18 million associated with certain accounts receivable in CIB.\n\n(d) As of June 30, 2023 included$1.2 billion allowance for credit losses associated with the First Republic\nacquisition.\n\n(e) The Firm\u2019s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as\npermitted by regulatory guidance.\n                                                     81                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Allocation of allowance for loan losses                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \nThe table below presents a breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan class.

The investment securities portfolio is\npredominantly held by Treasury and CIO in\nconnection with the Firm\u2019s balance sheet and asset-\nliability management objectives. Principal\ninvestments are predominantly privately-held\nfinancial instruments and are managed in the LOBs\nand Corporate. Investments are typically intended\nto be held over extended periods and, accordingly,\nthe Firm has no expectation for short-term realized\ngains with respect to these investments. Investment\nsecurities risk Investment securities risk includes\nthe exposure associated with a default in the\npayment of principal and interest. This risk is\nmitigated given that the investment securities\nportfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly\nconsists of high-quality securities. At June 30,\n2023, the Treasury and CIO investment securities\nportfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses,\nwas $610.2 billion, and the average credit rating\nof the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+\n(based upon external ratings where available, and\nwhere not available, based primarily upon internal\nrisk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results\non pages 45-46 and Note 10 for further information\non the investment securities portfolio and internal\nrisk ratings. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on\npages 54-61 for further information on related\nliquidity risk. Refer to Market Risk Management on\npages 84-89 for further information on the market\nrisk inherent in the portfolio.\n\nPrincipal investment risk Principal investments are\ntypically privately-held financial instruments\nrepresenting ownership interests or other forms of\njunior capital. In general, principal investments\ninclude tax-oriented investments and investments\nmade to enhance or accelerate the Firm\u2019s business\nstrategies and exclude those that are consolidated\non the Firm's balance sheets. These investments are\nmade by dedicated investing businesses or as part\nof a broader business strategy.

The Firm has a single VaR\nframework used as a basis for calculating Risk\nManagement VaR and Regulatory VaR.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR is calculated\nassuming a one-day holding period and an expected\ntail-loss methodology which approximates a 95%\nconfidence level. For risk management purposes, the\nFirm believes this methodology provides a daily\nmeasure of risk that is closely aligned to risk\nmanagement decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate\nand, along with other market risk measures,\nprovides the appropriate information needed to\nrespond to risk events. The Firm calculates\nseparately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance\nwith regulatory rules (\u201cRegulatory VaR\u201d), which is\nused to derive the Firm\u2019s regulatory VaR-based\ncapital requirements under Basel III.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s VaR model calculations are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in response to changes in\nthe composition of the Firm\u2019s portfolios, changes\nin market conditions, improvements in the Firm\u2019s\nmodeling techniques and measurements, and other\nfactors. Such changes may affect historical\ncomparisons of VaR results.

This reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across\nLOBs, Corporate, and risk types. For maximum and minimum VaR, diversification benefit is not meaningful as\nthe maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the\ncomponents.\n\n(b) Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan\nportfolio, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan\nportfolio, which is not reported at fair value. In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's\ninternal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed\nfrom Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated\nlevels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now reflected in\nother sensitivity-based measures.\n\n(c) Corporate and other LOB VaR includes a legacy private equity position in Corporate which is publicly\ntraded.\n\n(d) The increase in CCB VaR is driven by interest rate volatility impacting Home Lending warehouse loans,\nMSR, and related hedges.\n\n(e) For the period ended June 30, 2022, maximum Credit Portfolio VaR remained elevated due to the effects of\nnickel price increases and the associated volatility in the nickel market which occurred during the first\nquarter of 2022.\n                                                                                                            \n   Quarter over quarter results                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \nAverage total VaR was flat for the three months\nended June 30, 2023, when compared with March 31,\n2023, reflecting increases in fixed income offset\nby market volatility relating to commodities\nrolling out of the one-year historical look-back\nperiod.\n                                                                                                            \n   Year over year results                                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \nAverage total VaR decreased by $7 million for the\nthree months ended June 30, 2023, compared with the\nsame period in the prior year predominantly driven\nby risk reductions impacting Credit Portfolio VaR\nas well as fixed income.\n\nThe following graph presents daily Risk Management\nVaR for the five trailing quarters.\n                                                                                                            \n                                         Daily Risk Management VaR                                          \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                         \n  Second  Quarter    Third Quarter    Fourth Quarter    First Quarter    Second Quarter  \n  2022               2022             2022              2023             2023            \n                                                                                         \n                                                     85                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  VaR backtesting                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the\ndaily gains and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the\nchart below do not reflect the Firm\u2019s reported revenue as they exclude certain components of total net\nrevenue, such as those associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven\ntrading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, other valuation adjustments and net\ninterest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or\nloss on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the\nrequirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.\n\nA backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the\nprior day. Under the Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are\nconsistent with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR\nbacktesting exceptions five times every 100 trading days on average. The number of VaR backtesting\nexceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the\ncurrent level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility during the 12\nmonths of historical data used in the VaR calculation.\n\nFor the 12 months ended June 30, 2023, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 134 of the 259 days, and\nobserved 15 VaR backtesting exceptions. For the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Firm posted\nbacktesting gains on 34 of the 65 days, and observed two VaR backtesting exceptions.\n\nThe following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the\ntrailing 12 months and three months ended June 30, 2023. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a\npercentage of the corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are\nshown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the\nintervals that are greater than one hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the results\nof backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm\u2019s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital\nDisclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm\u2019s covered positions.\n                             Distribution of Daily Backtesting Gains and Losses                             \n                                                                                                            \n                                                     86                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Structural interest rate risk management                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \nThe effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm\u2019s\nreported net income is important as interest rate\nrisk represents one of the Firm\u2019s significant\nmarket risks. Interest rate risk arises not only\nfrom trading activities but also from the Firm\u2019s\ntraditional banking activities, which include\nextension of loans and credit facilities, taking\ndeposits, issuing debt and the investment\nsecurities portfolio. One way that the Firm\nevaluates its structural interest rate risk is\nthrough earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk\nestimates the Firm\u2019s interest rate exposure for a\ngiven interest rate scenario. It is presented as a\nsensitivity to a baseline, which includes net\ninterest income and certain interest rate sensitive\nfees. The baseline uses market interest rates and\nin the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The\nFirm conducts simulations of changes to this\nbaseline for interest rate-sensitive assets and\nliabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other\ncurrencies (\u201cnon-U.S. dollar\u201d currencies). These\nsimulations primarily include retained loans,\ndeposits, deposits with banks, investment\nsecurities, long-term debt and any related interest\nrate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of other\npositions in risk management VaR and other\nsensitivity-based measures as described on page 132\nof JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K. Earnings-at-\nrisk scenarios estimate the potential change to a\nnet interest income baseline, over the following 12\nmonths utilizing multiple assumptions. These\nscenarios include a parallel shift involving\nchanges to both short-term and long-term rates by\nan equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving\nholding short-term rates constant and increasing\nlong-term rates; and a flatter yield curve\ninvolving increasing short-term rates and holding\nlong-term rates constant or holding short-term\nrates constant and decreasing long-term rates.\nThese scenarios consider many different factors,\nincluding: \u2022 The impact on exposures as a result of\ninstantaneous changes in interest rates from\nbaseline rates. \u2022 Forecasted balance sheet, as well\nas modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior,\nbut excluding assumptions about actions that could\nbe taken by the Firm or its clients and customers\nin response to instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage\nprepayment assumptions are based on the interest\nrates used in the scenarios compared with\nunderlying contractual rates, the time since\norigination, and other factors which are updated\nperiodically based on historical experience.\nDeposit forecasts are a key assumption in the\nFirm's earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects\ncertain assumptions relating to the reversal of\nQuantitative Easing that are highly uncertain and\nrequire management judgment. Therefore, the actual\namount of deposits held by the Firm, at any\nparticular time, could be impacted by actions the\nFederal Reserve may take as part of monetary\npolicy, including through the use of the Reverse\nRepurchase Facility. In addition, there are other\nfactors that impact the amount of deposits held at\nthe Firm such\n\nas the level of loans across the industry and\ncompetition for deposits. \u2022 The pricing sensitivity\nof deposits, known as deposit betas, represent the\namount by which deposit rates paid could change\nupon a given change in market interest rates. As\npart of the Firm's continuous evaluation and\nperiodic enhancements to its earnings-at-risk\ncalculations, the Firm updated its model in the\nsecond quarter of 2023 to incorporate deposit\nrepricing lags impacting both consumer and\nwholesale deposits. The model change incorporated\nobserved pricing and customer behavior in both\nrising and falling interest rate environments.\nActual deposit rates paid may differ from the\nmodeled assumptions, primarily due to customer\nbehavior and competition for deposits. The Firm\u2019s\nearnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in response to changes in\nthe composition of the Firm\u2019s balance sheet,\nchanges in market conditions, improvements in the\nFirm\u2019s simulation and other factors. While a\nrelevant measure of the Firm\u2019s interest rate\nexposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis does not\nrepresent a forecast of the Firm\u2019s net interest\nincome.

Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to\nmarket risk on page 138 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on the positions\ncaptured in other sensitivity-based measures.\n\nThe table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-\nsensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used\nfor hedging purposes are reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the\ntable below may not be representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at June 30,\n2023 and December 31, 2022, as the movement in market parameters across maturities may vary and are not\nintended to imply management\u2019s expectation of future changes in these sensitivities.\n

The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various\nportfolios which may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the Firm\u2019s exposures\nare diversified given the Firm\u2019s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country. Refer to pages 139-140\nof JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm\u2019s country risk management. Risk\nReporting The following table presents the Firm\u2019s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of\nJune 30, 2023 and their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2022. The selection of countries represents\nthe Firm\u2019s largest total exposures by individual country, based on the Firm\u2019s internal country risk\nmanagement approach, and does not represent the Firm\u2019s view of any existing or potentially adverse credit\nconditions. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to client activity and market flows.\nThe increases in exposures to Germany and the United Kingdom were primarily driven by increases in cash\nplaced with the central banks of those countries, due to client-driven activities, including as a result of\nchanges in interest rates. The decrease in exposure to Australia was driven by a reduction in cash placed\nwith the central bank of Australia due to client-driven activities resulting from changes in interest rates.\nThe Firm continues to monitor potential impacts to the Firm associated with the war in Ukraine. As of June\n30, 2023, exposure to Russia was approximately $430 million. This amount excludes certain deposits placed on\nbehalf of clients at the Depository Insurance Agency of Russia.\n

The Firm\u2019s most complex\naccounting estimates require management\u2019s judgment\nto ascertain the appropriate carrying value of\nassets and liabilities. The Firm has established\npolicies and control procedures intended to ensure\nthat estimation methods, including any judgments\nmade as part of such methods, are well-controlled,\nindependently reviewed and applied consistently\nfrom period to period. The methods used and\njudgments made reflect, among other factors, the\nnature of the assets or liabilities and the related\nbusiness and risk management strategies, which may\nvary across the Firm\u2019s businesses and portfolios.\nIn addition, the policies and procedures are\nintended to ensure that the process for changing\nmethodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The\nFirm believes its estimates for determining the\ncarrying value of its assets and liabilities are\nappropriate. The following is a brief description\nof the Firm\u2019s critical accounting estimates\ninvolving significant judgments.\n                                                                                                            \n  Allowance for credit losses                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement\u2019s estimate of expected credit losses\nover the remaining expected life of the Firm\u2019s\nfinancial assets measured at amortized cost and\ncertain off-balance sheet lending-related\ncommitments. The allowance for credit losses\ngenerally consists of:\n\n\u2022 The allowance for loan losses, which covers the\nFirm\u2019s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-\nrated).\n\n\u2022 The allowance for lending-related commitments,\nwhich is reflected in accounts payable and other\nliabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, and\n\n\u2022 The allowance for credit losses on investment\nsecurities, which is reflected in investment\nsecurities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses involves\nsignificant judgment on a number of matters\nincluding development and weighting of\nmacroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of\nhistorical loss experience, assessment of risk\ncharacteristics, assignment of risk ratings,\nvaluation of collateral, and the determination of\nremaining expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note\n13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for further\ninformation on these judgments as well as the\nFirm\u2019s policies and methodologies used to determine\nthe Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses; and refer\nto Allowance for credit losses on pages 80-82 and\nNote 13 of this Form 10-Q for further information.\n\nOne of the most significant judgments involved in\nestimating the Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses\nrelates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to\nestimate credit losses over the eight-quarter\nforecast period within the Firm\u2019s methodology. The\neight-quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of\nmacroeconomic variables (\"MEVs\") that are relevant\nfor exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit\nlosses being driven primarily by a subset of less\nthan twenty\n\nvariables. The specific variables that have the\ngreatest effect on the modeled losses of each\nportfolio vary by portfolio and geography.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include\nregional U.S. unemployment and HPI.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S.\nunemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices,\nU.S. interest rates, corporate credit spreads, oil\nprices, commercial real estate prices and HPI.\n\nChanges in the Firm\u2019s assumptions and forecasts of\neconomic conditions could significantly affect its\nestimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio\nat the balance sheet date or lead to significant\nchanges in the estimate from one reporting period\nto the next.\n\nAs a result of the First Republic acquisition, the\nFirm recorded an allowance for credit losses for\nthe loans acquired and lending-related commitments\nassumed as of May 1, 2023. Given the differences in\nrisk rating methodologies for the First Republic\nPortfolio, and the ongoing integration of products\nand systems, the allowance for credit losses for\nthe acquired wholesale portfolio was measured based\non other facilities underwritten by the Firm with\nsimilar risk characteristics and not based on\nmodeled estimates. As such, the First Republic\nwholesale portfolio is excluded from the modeled\nestimates sensitivity analysis below. The allowance\nfor credit losses for predominantly all of the\nconsumer portfolio was measured using the Firm\u2019s\nmodeled approach, as the consumer portfolio is\npredominantly residential real estate that has more\ncommonly defined risk characteristics including\nloan to value ratio and credit score, and therefore\nis reflected in the sensitivity analysis below.\nRefer to Note 28 for additional information on the\nFirst Republic acquisition.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes\nin any one factor or input might affect the overall\nallowance for credit losses because management\nconsiders a wide variety of factors and inputs in\nestimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes\nin the factors and inputs considered may not occur\nat the same rate and may not be consistent across\nall geographies or product types, and changes in\nfactors and inputs may be directionally\ninconsistent, such that improvement in one factor\nor input may offset deterioration in others.\n\nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate\nmacroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the\nmodeled credit losses determined using its central\nand relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which\nare two of the five scenarios considered in\nestimating the allowances for loan losses and\nlending-related commitments. The central and\nrelative adverse scenarios each included a full\nsuite of MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths\nand peaks/troughs of those variables over the\neight-quarter forecast period.\n\nFor example, compared to the Firm\u2019s central\nscenario shown on page 80and in Note 13, the Firm\u2019s\nrelative adverse scen\n                                                     91                                                     \nario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment rate,\naveraging approximately 1.6% higher over the eight-\nquarter forecast, with a peak difference of 2.2% in\nthe first quarter of 2024; lower U.S. real GDP with\na slower recovery, remaining approximately 3.1%\nlower at the end of the eight-quarter forecast,\nwith a peak difference of approximately 3.4% in the\nthird quarter of 2024; and lower national HPI with\na peak difference of approximately 10.5% in the\nfirst quarter of 2025. This analysis is not\nintended to estimate expected future changes in the\nallowance for credit losses, for a number of\nreasons, including: \u2022 The allowance as of June 30,\n2023, reflects credit losses beyond those estimated\nunder the central scenario due to the weight placed\non the adverse scenarios. \u2022 The impacts of changes\nin many MEVs are both interrelated and nonlinear,\nso the results of this analysis cannot be simply\nextrapolated for more severe changes in\nmacroeconomic variables. \u2022 Expectations of future\nchanges in portfolio composition and borrower\nbehavior can significantly affect the allowance for\ncredit losses. To demonstrate the sensitivity of\ncredit loss estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as\nof June 30, 2023, the Firm compared the modeled\nestimates under its relative adverse scenario to\nits central scenario. Without considering\noffsetting or correlated effects in other\nqualitative components of the Firm\u2019s allowance for\ncredit losses, the comparison between these two\nscenarios for the exposures below reflect the\nfollowing differences: \u2022 An increase of\napproximately $750 million for residential real\nestate loans and lending-related commitments,\nincluding the First Republic portfolios \u2022 An\nincrease of approximately $2.4 billion for credit\ncard loans \u25aa An increase of approximately $3.8\nbillion for wholesale loans and lending-related\ncommitments, excluding the First Republic\nportfolios. This analysis relates only to the\nmodeled credit loss estimates and is not intended\nto estimate changes in the overall allowance for\ncredit losses as it does not reflect any potential\nchanges in other adjustments to the quantitative\ncalculation, which would also be influenced by the\njudgment management applies to the modeled lifetime\nloss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and\nimprecision of these modeled lifetime loss\nestimates based on then-current circumstances and\nconditions. Recognizing that forecasts of\nmacroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain,\nparticularly in light of the recent economic\nconditions, the Firm believes that its process to\nconsider the available information and associated\nrisks and uncertainties is appropriately governed\nand that its estimates of expected credit losses\nwere reasonable and appropriate for the period\nended June 30, 2023.\n\nFair value JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its\nassets and liabilities at fair value. The majority\nof such assets and liabilities are measured at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis, including derivatives,\nstructured note products and certain securities\nfinancing agreements. Certain assets and\nliabilities are measured at fair value on a\nnonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage,\nhome equity and other loans, where the carrying\nvalue is based on the fair value of the underlying\ncollateral.

The type and level of judgment required\nis largely dependent on the amount of observable\nmarket information available to the Firm. For\ninstruments valued using internally developed\nvaluation models and other valuation techniques\nthat use significant unobservable inputs and are\ntherefore classified within level 3 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair\nvalue are more significant than those required when\nestimating the fair value of instruments classified\nwithin levels 1 and 2.\n\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an\ninstrument within level 3, management must first\ndetermine the appropriate valuation model or other\nvaluation technique to use. Second, the lack of\nobservability of certain significant inputs\nrequires management to assess relevant empirical\ndata in deriving valuation inputs including, for\nexample, transaction details, yield curves,\ninterest rates, prepayment speeds, default rates,\nvolatilities, correlations, prices (such as\ncommodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of\ncomparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and\ncredit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further\ndiscussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments,\nincluding unobservable inputs used.\n\nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3,\nmanagement judgment must be applied to assess the\nappropriate level of valuation adjustments to\nreflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm\u2019s\ncreditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity\nconsiderations, unobservable parameters, and for\nportfolios that meet specified criteria, the size\nof the net open risk position. The judgments made\nare typically affected by the type of product and\nits specific contractual terms, and the level of\nliquidity for the product or within the market as a\nwhole. In periods of heightened market volatility\nand uncertainty judgments are further affected by\nthe wider variation of reasonable valuation\nestimates, particularly for positions that are less\nliquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of\nvaluation adjustments applied by the Firm.\n\nImprecision in estimating unobservable market\ninputs or other factors can affect the amount of\ngain or loss recorded for a particular position.\nFurthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation\nmethods are appropriate and consistent with those\nof other market participants, the methods and\nassumptions used reflect management judgment and\nmay vary across the Firm\u2019s businesses and\nportfolios.\n\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions\nin the determination of fair value. The use of\nmethodologies or assumptions different than those\nused by the Firm could result in a different\nestimate of fair value at the reporting date. Refer\nto Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm\u2019s\nvaluation process and hierarchy, and its\ndetermination of fair value for individual\nfinancial instruments.\n                                                                                                            \n  Credit card rewards liability                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \nThe credit card rewards liability was $12.2 billion\nand $11.3 billion at June 30, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, respectively, and is recorded in accounts\npayable and other liabilities on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets. The increase in the liability was\npredominantly driven by continued growth in rewards\npoints earned on higher spend and promotional\noffers outpacing redemptions throughout 2023, and,\nto a lesser extent, adjustments to certain reward\nprogram terms in the second quarter.

(\u201cJPMorgan Chase\u201d or the \u201cFirm\u201d), a financial holding company incorporated under\nDelaware law in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The\nFirm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial\nbanking, financial transaction processing and asset management. On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired\ncertain assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank (the \u201cFirst Republic acquisition\u201d)\nfrom the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d). The Firm continues to convert certain operations,\nand to integrate clients, products and services, associated with the First Republic acquisition, to align\nwith the Firm\u2019s businesses and operations. The Firm also continues to evaluate to which segments certain\nclients, products and services associated with the First Republic acquisition, including deposits, should be\nallocated. Accordingly, reporting classifications and allocations may change in future periods including\nacross the Firm's segments. Refer to Note 27 for a further discussion of the Firm\u2019s business segments and\nNote 28 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition. The accounting and financial reporting\npolicies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the\npolicies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. The\nunaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and\nthe disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these\nestimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included such that this\ninterim financial information is fairly stated. These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be\nread in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included\nin JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K. Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been revised to conform\nwith the current presentation. Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of\nJPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material\nintercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Assets held for clients in an agency or\nfiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets. The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first\nevaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity. Refer to Notes 1\nand 14 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for a further description of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s accounting policies\nregarding consolidation. Offsetting assets and liabilities U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative\nreceivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables\nand payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting\nagreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities financing balances to be presented on a net basis when\nspecified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The\nFirm has elected to net such balances where it has determined that the specified conditions are met. Refer\nto Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for further information on offsetting assets and liabilities.\nAccounting standards adopted January 1, 2023 Derivatives and Hedging: Fair Value Hedging \u2013 Portfolio Layer\nMethod The adoption of this guidance expanded the ability to hedge a portfolio of prepayable assets to allow\nmore of the portfolio to be hedged. Non-prepayable assets can also be included in the same portfolio, thus\nincreasing the size of the portfolio and the amount available to be hedged. This guidance also clarified the\ntypes of derivatives that can be used as hedges, and the balance sheet presentation and disclosure\nrequirements for the hedge accounting adjustments. As permitted by the guidance, the Firm elected to\ntransfer HTM securities to AFS and designate those securities in a portfolio layer method hedge upon\nadoption. The adoption impact of the transfer on retained earnings was not material. Refer to Note 5 and\nNote 10 for additional information. Financial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings and\nVintage Disclosures The adoption of this guidance eliminated the accounting and disclosure requirements for\nTDRs, including the requirement to measure the allowance using a discounted cash flow (\u201cDCF\u201d) methodology,\nand allowed the option of a non-DCF portfolio-based approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers. If a\nDCF methodology is still applied for these modified loans, the discount rate must be the post-\n                                                    101                                                     \nmodification effective interest rate, instead of\nthe pre-modification effective interest rate. The\nFirm elected to apply its non-DCF, portfolio-based\nallowance approach for modified loans to troubled\nborrowers for all portfolios except modified\nnonaccrual risk-rated loans which the Firm elected\nto continue applying a DCF methodology. Refer to\nNote 13 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for a\ndescription of the portfolio-based allowance\napproach and the asset-specific allowance approach.\nThis guidance was adopted under the modified\nretrospective method which resulted in a net\ndecrease to the allowance for credit losses of $\n587million and an increase to retained earnings of\n$ 446million, after-tax, predominantly driven by\nresidential real estate and credit card. The\nadoption of this guidance eliminated the disclosure\nrequirements for TDRs including the requirement to\nassess whether a modification is reasonably\nexpected or involves a concession. The new guidance\nrequires disclosure for loan modifications to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty\nconsisting of principal forgiveness, interest rate\nreduction, other-than-insignificant payment delay,\nterm extension or a combination of these\nmodifications. The Firm has defined these types of\nmodifications as financial difficulty modifications\n(\"FDMs\"). As a result of the elimination of the\nrequirement to assess whether a modification is\nreasonably expected or involves a concession, the\npopulation of loans considered FDMs will differ\nfrom those previously considered TDRs. This\nguidance also requires disclosure of current period\ngross charge-offs by vintage origination year.\nRefer to Note 12 for further information.\n

93.5billion and $\n73.8billion, respectively, which were mortgage-related.\n\n(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable\nvalue. \u201cNet realizable value\u201d is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell\n(\u201ctransaction costs\u201d). Transaction costs for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories are either not\napplicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair\nvalue for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net\nrealizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because\nunder fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 5 for\na further discussion of the Firm\u2019s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value\ndisclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.\n                                                    105                                                     \n(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical\nsecurities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).\n\n(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its\nequivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At June\n30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds,\nprivate equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $ 956million and $ 950million, respectively.\nIncluded in these balances at June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, were trading assets of $ 40million and $\n43million, respectively, and other assets of $ 916million and $ 907million, respectively.\n\n(e) At June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, included $ 9.3billion and $ 9.7billion, respectively, of\nresidential first-lien mortgages, and $ 6.8billion of commercial first-lien mortgages for both periods.\nResidential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs\nand government agencies of $ 3.3billion and $ 2.4billion, respectively.\n\n(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables\nand the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement\nexists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit\nassociated with cash collateral.\n\nLevel 3 valuations\n\nRefer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm\u2019s valuation process\nand a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. The\nfollowing table presents the Firm\u2019s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to\nmeasure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of\nvalues for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to\nclassify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall\nfair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is,\ncomponents that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the\nunobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the\nFirm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and\nderivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of\nvalues presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the\nsignificant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted\naverages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the\ninstruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm\u2019s view, the input range, weighted and\narithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the\nreasonableness of the Firm\u2019s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the\nvarious instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of\ncharacteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and\nvaluation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option\ncontracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted average values\nwill therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the\ninstruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.\n                                                    106                                                     \n

The estimation of the fair value of\nstructured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant\nunobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.\n\n(f) Includes equity securities of $ 843million including $ 213million in Other assets, for which quoted\nprices are not readily available and the fair value is generally based on internal valuation techniques such\nas EBITDA multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant both\nindividually and in aggregate.\n\n(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not\nreadily available, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal valuation techniques. The price\ninput is expressed assuming a par value of $ 100.\n\n(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.\n\n(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are\nused.\n                                                    107                                                     \nChanges in and ranges of unobservable inputs Refer\nto Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for a\ndiscussion of the impact on fair value of changes\nin unobservable inputs and the relationships\nbetween unobservable inputs as well as a\ndescription of attributes of the underlying\ninstruments and external market factors that affect\nthe range of inputs used in the valuation of the\nFirm\u2019s positions. Changes in level 3 recurring fair\nvalue measurements The following tables include a\nrollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets\namounts (including changes in fair value) for\nfinancial instruments classified by the Firm within\nlevel 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. When a\ndetermination is made to classify a financial\ninstrument within level 3, the determination is\nbased on the significance of the unobservable\ninputs to the overall fair value measurement.\nHowever, level 3 financial instruments typically\ninclude, in addition to the unobservable or level 3\ncomponents, observable components (that is,\ncomponents that are actively quoted and can be\nvalidated to external sources); accordingly, the\ngains and losses in the table below include changes\nin fair value due in part to observable factors\nthat are part of the valuation methodology. Also,\nthe Firm risk-manages the observable components of\nlevel 3 financial instruments using securities and\nderivative positions that are classified within\nlevel 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these\nlevel 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are\nnot included below, the gains or losses in the\nfollowing tables do not reflect the effect of the\nFirm\u2019s risk management

For the three months ended June 30, 2023, there were no significant transfers\nfrom level 3 into level 2. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, significant transfers from level 2 into\nlevel 3 included the following: \u2022 $ 1.6billion of gross interest rate derivative payables as a result of\ntransition to term SOFR for certain interest rate options. \u2022 $ 901million of gross equity derivative\nreceivables as a result of a decrease in observability and an increase in the significance of unobservable\ninputs. \u2022 $ 917million of non-trading loans driven by a decrease in observability. For the six months ended\nJune 30, 2023, significant transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the following: \u2022 $ 1.3billion and $\n827million of gross equity derivative receivables and gross equity derivative payables, respectively, as a\nresult of an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. For the\nthree months ended June 30, 2022, there were no significant transfers from level 2 into level 3. For the\nthree months ended June 30, 2022, significant transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the following: \u2022\n$ 930million of gross interest rate derivative receivables as a result of an increase in observability and a\ndecrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. For the six months ended June 30, 2022, significant\ntransfers from level 2 into level 3 included the following: \u2022 $ 1.6billion of total debt and equity\ninstruments, largely due to equity securities of $ 959million driven by a decrease in observability\npredominantly as a result of restricted access to certain markets. \u2022 $ 1.3billion of gross equity derivative\npayables as a result of a decrease in observability and an increase in the significance of unobservable\ninputs. For the six months ended June 30, 2022, significant transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the\nfollowing: \u2022 $ 965million of gross interest rate derivative receivables as a result of an increase in\nobservability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. \u2022 $ 920million and $ 1.4billion of\ngross equity derivative receivables and gross equity derivative payables, respectively, as a result of an\nincrease in observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. All transfers are based\non changes in the observability and/or significance of the valuation inputs and are assumed to occur at the\nbeginning of the quarterly reporting period in which they occur.\n                                                    113                                                     \nGains and losses The following describes\nsignificant components of total realized/unrealized\ngains/(losses) for instruments measured at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis for the periods\nindicated.

These discounts ranged from 3%\nto 56% with a weighted average of 25%.\nNonrecurring fair value changes\n\nThe following table presents the total change in value of assets and liabilities for which fair value\nadjustments have been recognized for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 , related to\nassets and liabilities held at those dates.\n                                                                                                            \n                               Three months ended June                    Six months ended June             \n                                                   30,                                      30,             \n  (in millions)                                   2023       2022                          2023       2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Loans                     $                      -96    $   -80    $                     -128    $   -91  \n  Other assets(a)                                  -36       -389                           -99        -45  \n  Accounts payable and                               \u2014       -269                             \u2014       -288  \n  other liabilities                                                                                         \n  Total nonrecurring                                                                                        \n  fair value                $                     -132    $  -738    $                     -227    $  -424  \n  gains/(losses)                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n(a) Included $( 32) million and $( 387) million for\nthe three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, and $( 93) million and $( 29) million\nfor the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, of net gains/(losses) as a result of\nthe measurement alternative.\n\nRefer to Note 12 for further information about the\nmeasurement of collateral-dependent loans.\n                                                    115                                                     \nEquity securities without readily determinable fair values\n\nThe Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment\n(if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer\n(i.e., measurement alternative), with such changes recognized in other income.\n\nIn its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the\nprices if deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm\u2019s estimated fair values.

The period-end carrying values reflect\ncumulative purchases and sales in addition to upward and downward carrying value changes.\n(b) The cumulative upward carrying value changes between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2023 were $\n1.5billion.\n(c) The cumulative downward carrying value changes/impairment between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2023 were\n$( 1.0) billion.\nIncluded in other assets above is the Firm\u2019s interest in approximately 37million Visa Class B common shares\n(\u201cVisa B shares\u201d). These shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa\nClass A common shares (\u201cVisa A shares\u201d) at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain\nlitigation matters involving Visa. On June 29, 2023, Visa filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC\nindicating that the conversion rate of Visa B shares to Visa A shares decreased from 1.5991to\n1.5902effective June 28, 2023. The conversion rate may be further adjusted by Visa depending on developments\nrelated to the litigation matters. The outcome of those litigation matters, and the effect that the\nresolution of those matters may have on the conversion rate, is unknown. Accordingly, as of June 30, 2023,\nthere is significant uncertainty regarding when the transfer restrictions on Visa B shares may be terminated\nand what the final conversion rate for the Visa B shares will be. As a result of these considerations, as\nwell as differences in voting rights, Visa B shares are not considered to be similar to Visa A shares, and\nthey continue to be held at their nominal carrying value.\n\nIn connection with prior sales of Visa B shares, the Firm has entered into derivative instruments with the\npurchasers of the shares under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the conversion\nrate. Under the terms of the derivative instruments, the Firm will (a) make or receive payments based on\nsubsequent changes in the conversion rate and (b) make periodic interest payments to the purchasers of the\nVisa B shares. The payments under the derivative instruments will continue as long as the Visa B shares\nremain subject to transfer restrictions. The derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value using a\ndiscounted cash flow methodology based upon the Firm\u2019s estimate of the timing and magnitude of final\nresolution of the litigation matters. The derivative instruments are recorded in trading liabilities, and\nchanges in fair value are recognized in other income. As of June 30, 2023, the Firm held derivative\ninstruments associated with 23million Visa B shares that the Firm had previously sold, which are all subject\nto similar terms and conditions.\n

underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual\nfees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and\nprimary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the\nvalue of the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan\u2019s allowance for\nloan losses, which represents the loan\u2019s expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The\ndifference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to\nchanges in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that\naffect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value.\n(b) Includes FHLB advances in level 2 of Long-term debt and Short-term borrowings and the Purchase Money\nNote in level 3 of Long-term debt associated with the First Republic acquisition. Refer to Notes 18 and 28\nfor additional information.\nThe majority of the Firm\u2019s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets.

elected are recorded in OCI, while realized gains/(losses) are recorded in\nprincipal transactions revenue.

Although the risk\nassociated with the structured notes is actively managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this table do not\ninclude the income statement impact of the risk management instruments used to manage such risk.\n\n(c) Reported in mortgage fees and related income.\n\n(d) Reported in other income.\n\n(e) Changes in fair value exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest\nexpense for all instruments other than certain hybrid financial instruments in CIB. Refer to Note 7 for\nfurther information regarding interest income and interest expense.\n\n(f) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.\n

However, investors are exposed to the credit\nrisk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.\n(d) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the\ncontractual principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm\u2019s\nnext call date.\nAt June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the\nfair value option was elected was $ 10.2billion and $ 7.6billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair\nvalue of $ 264million and $ 24million, respectively.

JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit portfolios to\nassess potential credit risk concentrations and to obtain additional collateral when deemed necessary and\npermitted under the Firm\u2019s agreements. Senior management is significantly involved in the credit approval\nand review process, and risk levels are adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm\u2019s risk appetite. In the\nFirm\u2019s consumer portfolio, concentrations are managed primarily by product and by U.S. geographic region,\nwith a key focus on trends and concentrations at the portfolio level, where potential credit risk\nconcentrations can be remedied through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. Refer to\nNote 12 for additional information on the geographic composition of the Firm\u2019s consumer loan portfolios. In\nthe wholesale portfolio, credit risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by industry and monitored\nregularly on both an aggregate portfolio level and on an individual client or counterparty basis. The Firm\u2019s\nwholesale exposure is managed through loan syndications and participations, loan sales, securitizations,\ncredit derivatives, master netting agreements, collateral and other risk-reduction techniques. Refer to Note\n12 for additional information on loans. The Firm does not believe that its exposure to any particular loan\nproduct or industry segment results in a significant concentration of credit risk. Terms of loan products\nand collateral coverage are included in the Firm\u2019s assessment when extending credit and establishing its\nallowance for loan losses.\n                                                    122                                                     \nThe table below presents both on\u2013balance sheet and off\u2013balance sheet consumer and wholesale credit exposure\nby the Firm\u2019s three credit portfolio segments as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Refer to\nNote 14 for more information on exposures to SPEs.\n(f) Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and\nAWM that are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients\u2019 brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit,\nliquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of this collateralization, no allowance\nfor credit losses is generally held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm\nestablishes margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires\nclients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate.

Excluded components may impact earnings either through amortization of the\ninitial amount over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current\nperiod.\n(f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the\namortization approach, predominantly cross-currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the\nhedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative.\n                                                    130                                                     \nAs of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated balance\nsheets related to certain cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that are expected to reverse through\nthe income statement in future periods as an adjustment to yield.\n                                                                                                            \n                                                                     Cumulative                             \n                                                                 amount of fair                             \n                                                                  value hedging                             \n                                                                    adjustments                             \n                                                                included in the                             \n                                                                carrying amount                             \n                                                                      of hedged                             \n                       Carrying amount                                   items:                             \n                                of the                             Discontinued                             \n  June 30, 2023                 hedged    Active hedging                hedging                             \n  (in millions)            items(a)(b)    relationships(\u2026       relationships(\u2026        Total                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Assets                                                                                                    \n  Investment                                                                                                \n  securities -

As a result of\nthe application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing\nunrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is\nno incremental impact to net income in future periods.\n(b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis\nadjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future\nperiods. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities is $\n20.9billion and $ 20.3billion, respectively, and for long-term debt is $ 216million and $ 221million,\nrespectively.\n(c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. Effective January 1,\n2023, the Firm adopted the new portfolio layer method hedge accounting guidance which expanded the ability\nto hedge a portfolio of prepayable assets to allow more of the portfolio to be hedged. At June 30, 2023, the\namortized cost of the portfolio layer method closed portfolios was $ 67.8billion, of which $ 49.6billion was\ndesignated as hedged. The cumulative amount of basis adjustments was $( 1.1) billion, reflecting $( 865)\nmillion and $( 229) million for active and discontinued hedging relationships, respectively.

computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period,\nweighted based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon,\namortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives,\nincluding closed portfolio hedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield\nexcludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from\ntheir contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable\ndebt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.\n(b) For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the allowance\nfor credit losses of $( 30) million and the portfolio layer fair value hedge basis adjustments of $( 865)\nmillion at June 30, 2023. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities also excludes the allowance for\ncredit losses of $( 74) million at June 30, 2023.\n(c) Substantially all of the Firm\u2019s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in\n10years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects\nanticipated future prepayments, is approximately eight yearsfor agency residential MBS, seven yearsfor\nagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations, and six yearsfor nonagency residential\ncollateralized mortgage obligations.\n(d) Includes AFS securities associated with the First Republic acquisition, primarily impacting due after 10\nyears.

Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding securities financing\nagreements for which the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 25 for further information\nregarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements. The table below\nsummarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm\u2019s securities financing agreements as of June 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting\nagreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm\nnets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements\nwith the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its\ncounterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for\nnet Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with\nrespect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with securities financing\nbalances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table\nbelow as \u201cAmounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,\u201d and reduces the \u201cNet amounts\u201d presented.\nWhere a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are\npresented gross in the \u201cNet amounts\u201d below. In transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a\nsecurities-for-securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as\ncollateral, the Firm recognizes the securities received at fair value within other assets and the obligation\nto return those securities within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n

The adoption of this guidance eliminated\nthe existing accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs, and implemented additional disclosure\nrequirements for FDMs. The disclosure requirements for FDMs are effective for periods beginning on or after\nJanuary 1, 2023. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion on loan\nmodifications prior to January 1, 2023, which were accounted for and reported as TDRs. This new guidance\nalso requires disclosure of current period gross charge-offs by vintage origination year, effective for\nperiods beginning on or after January 1, 2023.\n\nLoan portfolio\nThe Firm\u2019s loan portfolio, including loans of $ 149.8billion associated with the First Republic acquisition,\nis divided into threeportfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the\nallowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each\nportfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on\nthe risk characteristics of each loan class.\n                                                                                      \n  Consumer, excluding             Credit card            Wholesale(c)(d)              \n  credit card                                                                         \n  \u2022 Residential real estate(a)                           \u2022 Secured by real estate     \n  \u2022 Auto and other(b)             \u2022 Credit card loans    \u2022 Commercial and industrial  \n                                                         \u2022 Other(e)                   \n                                                                                      \n(a) Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored mortgage loans held in\nCIB.\n(b) Includes scored auto, business banking loans and overdrafts in BWM and other consumer unsecured loans in\nCIB.\n(c) Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM, Corporate as well as risk-rated BWM and auto dealer loans held in\nCCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses.\n(d) The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the bank\nregulatory agencies, based on the loan's collateral, purpose, and type of borrower.\n(e) Includes loans to financial institutions, states and political subdivisions, SPEs, nonprofits, personal\ninvestment companies and trusts, as well as loans to individuals and individual entities (predominantly\nGlobal Private Bank clients within AWM and J.P.

material at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. These amounts have been excluded based upon the\ngovernment guarantee.\n\n(e) Included $ 158million of 30+ days past due loans associated with the First Republic acquisition.\n\n(f) Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated.\n\nApproximately 37% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien\nloans. The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses. Revolving\nloans that have been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within\nthe revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for\nthose products is higher than the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving\nperiod.\n                                                    150                                                     \nNonaccrual loans and other credit quality indicators\n\nThe following

The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance,\nresidential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the\nborrower (\u201cChapter 7 loans\u201d) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual loans, regardless of their delinquency\nstatus. At June 30, 2023, approximately 9% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more\npast due.\n\n(b) Mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies excluded from nonaccrual loans were not material at\nJune 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\n(c) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance,\ncertain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of\namortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the\nunderlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.\n\n(d) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $ 44million and $ 45million and $\n89million and $ 90million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n(e) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n(f) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property\nvalue. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using\nnationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available\nand forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home\nequity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.\n\n(g) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower\u2019s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm\non at least a quarterly basis.\n\n(h) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO\nscore. These loans have been included in a FICO band based on management\u2019s estimation of the borrower\u2019s\ncredit quality.\n\n(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.\n\n(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding\nloan balances at June 30, 2023.\n\n(k) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.\n\n(l) Included $ 4.3billion in equal to or greater than 660 FICO scores within 80% to 100% LTV ratio, and $\n85.3billion and $ 1.2billion in equal to or greater than 660 and less than 660 FICO scores, respectively,\nwithin less than 80% LTV ratio associated with the First Republic acquisition.\n\n(m) Included $ 91.9billion of loans associated with the First Republic acquisition.\n\n(n) Included $ 55.5billion, $ 15.2billion, $ 3.6billion and $ 8.0billion in California, New York, Florida\nand Massachusetts, respectively, associated with the First Republic acquisition.\n                                                    151                                                     \nLoan modifications\n\nThe Firm grants certain modifications of\nresidential real estate loans to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty, which effective\nJanuary 1, 2023, are reported as FDMs. The Firm's\nproprietary modification programs as well as\ngovernment programs, including U.S. GSE programs,\nthat generally provide various modifications to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty\nincluding, but not limited to, interest rate\nreductions, term extensions, other-than-\ninsignificant payment delay and principal\nforgiveness that would otherwise have been required\nunder the terms of the original agreement, are\nconsidered FDMs. For the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2023, residential real estate FDMs were $\n35million and $ 75million, respectively. The\nfinancial effects of the FDMs, which were largely\nin the form of term extensions and interest rate\nreductions, included extending the weighted-average\nlife of the loans by 15years and 18years, and\nreducing the weighted-average contractual interest\nrate from 6.90% to 4.21% and 6.75% to 4.01% for the\nthree and six months ended June 30, 2023,\nrespectively. There were noadditional commitments\nto lend to borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty whose loans have been modified as FDMs.\nIn addition to FDMs, the Firm also had $ 33million\nand $ 48million of loans subject to a trial\nmodification, and $ 3million and $ 5million of\nChapter 7 loans for the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2023, respectively. The changes to the TDR\naccounting guidance eliminated the TDR reasonably\nexpected and concession assessment criteria.\nAccordingly, trial modifications and Chapter 7\nloans were considered TDRs, but not FDMs. For\nperiods ending prior to January 1, 2023,\nmodifications of residential real estate loans\nwhere the Firm granted concessions to borrowers who\nwere experiencing financial difficulty were\ngenerally accounted for and reported as TDRs. For\nthe three and six months ended June 30, 2022, new\nTDRs were $ 115million and $ 233million,\nrespectively. There were no additional commitments\nto lend to borrowers whose residential real estate\nloans have been modified in TDRs.

certain modifications of credit card loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty,\nwhich effective January 1, 2023, are reported as FDMs. These modifications involve placing the customer on

The financial effects of\nFDMs were largely term extensions which extended\nthe loans by a weighted-average of nine months.\nThere were nore-defaults during the three months\nended June 30, 2023 and $ 1million in modified term\nextensions that re-defaulted during the six months\nended June 30, 2023.

New TDRs for the three and six months\nended June 30, 2022 reflected extended maturity\ndates and covenant waivers primarily in the\nCommercial and Industrial loan class. For the three\nand six months ended June 30, 2022, the impact of\nthese modifications were not material to the Firm.\n\nAs a result of the elimination of the requirement\nto assess whether a modification is reasonably\nexpected or involves a concession, the population\nof loans considered FDMs is greater than those\npreviously considered TDRs.\n                                                    161                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Note 13 \u2013 Allowance for credit losses                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement's estimate of expected credit losses\nover the remaining expected life of the Firm's\nfinancial assets measured at amortized cost and\ncertain off-balance sheet lending-related\ncommitments. On January 1, 2023 the Firm adopted\nthe Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled\nDebt Restructurings accounting guidance as\ndescribed in Note 1. The adoption of this guidance\neliminated the requirement to measure the allowance\nfor TDRs using a DCF methodology and allowed the\noption of a non-DCF portfolio-based approach for\nmodified loans to borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty. If a DCF methodology is still applied\nfor these modified loans, the discount rate must be\nthe post-modification effective interest rate,\ninstead of the pre-modification effective interest\nrate. The Firm elected to change from an asset-\nspecific allowance approach to its non-DCF,\nportfolio-based allowance approach for modified\nloans to troubled borrowers for all portfolios\nexcept collateral-dependent loans and nonaccrual\nrisk-rated loans, for which the asset-specific\nallowance approach will continue to apply. This\nguidance was adopted under the modified\nretrospective method which resulted in a net\ndecrease to the allowance for credit losses of $\n587million and an increase to retained earnings of\n$ 446million, after-tax predominantly driven by\nresidential real estate and credit card.

The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included $\n1.5billion, consisting of: \u2022 $ 819million in wholesale , predominantly driven by net downgrade activity,\nupdates to certain assumptions related to office real estate in CB in the second quarter of 2023, and the\nimpact of the additional weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, and \u2022 $\n649million in consumer , predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting loan growth, the net effect of\nchanges in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, including the impact from the weighted average U.S.\nunemployment rate peaking in the third quarter of 2024, and the additional weight placed on the adverse\nscenarios in the first quarter of 2023, partially offset by reduced borrower uncertainty. The net addition\nalso included $ 1.2billion to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related\ncommitments in the second quarter of 2023. The Firm has maintained the additional weight placed on the\nrelative adverse scenario in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting an increased probability of a moderate\nrecession due to tightening financial conditions. The allowance for credit losses also reflected a reduction\nof $ 587million as a result of the adoption of changes to the TDR accounting guidance on January 1, 2023.\nRefer to Note 1 for further information. The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a\nweighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate\nmore punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the table below, resulting\nin a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.8% in the third quarter of 2024, and a 1.5% lower\nU.S. real GDP exiting the fourth quarter of 2024.\nThe Firm\u2019s central case assumptions reflected U.S.\nunemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:\n                                                                                               \n                                        Assumptions at June 30, 2023                           \n                                                                4Q23       2Q24       4Q24     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. unemployment rate(a)                                      4.2  %     4.9  %     5.0  %  \n  YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                                 0.5  %       \u2014  %     1.0  %  \n                                    Assumptions at December 31, 2022                           \n                                                                2Q23       4Q23       2Q24     \n  U.S. unemployment rate(a)                                      3.8  %     4.3  %     5.0  %  \n  YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                                 1.5  %     0.4  %       \u2014  %  \n                                                                                               \n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S.\nunemployment rate.\n(b) The year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in\nthe forecast horizon of the central scenario is\ncalculated as the percentage change in U.S. real\nGDP levels from the prior year.

in\nCIB.\n(c) Includes assets classified as cash and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n(d) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the\nliabilities of those entities. The assets and liabilities include third-party assets and liabilities of\nconsolidated VIEs and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.\n(e) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the\nline item on the Consolidated balance sheets titled, \u201cBeneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs\u201d. The\nholders of these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan\nChase. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $ 1.1billion and\n$ 2.1billion at June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively.\n(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance\nsheets.\nVIEs sponsored by third parties\n\nThe Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting\nas a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent,\ntrustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm\u2019s-length, and individual credit decisions are\nbased on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets.\nWhere the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact\nthe VIE\u2019s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm\ngenerally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated\nbalance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party\ntransaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are\nlimited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other\nprojects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or\nmanaging member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly\nthe Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a\nlimited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects.\nThe maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $ 32.4billion and\n$ 30.2billion at June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, of which $ 12.6billion and $ 10.6billion was unfunded\nat June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk\nof loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits.\nRefer to Note 25 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for further information on affordable housing tax\ncredits and Note 24 of this Form 10-Q for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.\n                                                    168                                                     \nCustomer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts,\nincluding remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the\nFirm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those\ntransactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders\nfor any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on\nany of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm\ndoes not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the\nmunicipal bond vehicle. The Firm\u2019s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at June\n30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $ 5.9billion and $ 5.8billion, respectively. The fair value of assets\nheld by such VIEs at both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $ 8.2billion. Loan securitizations The\nFirm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgages, credit card receivables,\ncommercial mortgages and other consumer loans.\n\nSecuritization activity\nThe following table provides information related to the Firm\u2019s securitization activities for the three and\nsix months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities\nthat were not consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the\nsecuritization.\n

These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the\npurpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit\nenhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae\nguidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does\nnot consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary\nbeneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk\nassociated with the sold loans with the purchaser.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, represents estimated\ngoodwill associated with the acquisitions of Frosch Travel Group, LLC in CCB and Volkswagen Payments S.A. in\nCIB.\n(b) Predominantly foreign currency adjustments.\nGoodwill impairment testing Goodwill is tested for\nimpairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal\nyear, or more often if events or circumstances,\nsuch as adverse changes in the business climate,\nindicate that there may be an impairment. Refer to\nNote 15 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for a\nfurther discussion of the Firm\u2019s goodwill\nimpairment testing. Unanticipated declines in\nbusiness performance, increases in credit losses,\nincreases in capital requirements, as well as\ndeterioration in economic or market conditions,\nadverse regulatory or legislative changes or\nincreases in the estimated market cost of equity,\ncould cause the estimated fair values of the Firm\u2019s\nreporting units to decline in the future, which\ncould result in a material impairment charge to\nearnings in a future period related to some portion\nof the associated goodwill. As of June 30, 2023,\nthe Firm reviewed current economic conditions,\nestimated market cost of equity, as well as actual\nbusiness results and projections of business\nperformance. Based on such reviews, the Firm has\nconcluded that goodwill was not impaired as of June\n30, 2023, or December 31, 2022, nor was goodwill\nwritten off due to impairment during the six months\nended June 30, 2023 or 2022.\n                                                    171                                                     \nMortgage servicing rights\n\nMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others.\nThe fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to\nservice the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively\namortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased\nfrom third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained.\nRefer to Notes 2 and 15 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for

Includes excess MSRs transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage-backed\nsecurities (\u201cSMBS\u201d). In each transaction, a portion of the SMBS was acquired by third parties at the\ntransaction date; the Firm acquired the remaining balance of those SMBS as trading securities.\n(c) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest\nrates, and the difference between actual and expected prepayments.\n(d) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates.\n(e) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and\ninsurance), which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future\ncash flows from the trust or the underlying loans. The Firm\u2019s credit risk associated with these servicer\nadvances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to\ninvestors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is\ninsufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if\nthey were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.\n                                                    172

In order to modify exposure to\ninterest rate and currency exchange rate movements,\nJPMorgan Chase utilizes derivative instruments,\nprimarily interest rate and cross-currency interest\nrate swaps, in conjunction with some of its debt\nissuances. The use of these instruments modifies\nthe Firm\u2019s interest expense on the associated debt.\nThe modified weighted-average interest rates for\ntotal long-term debt, including the effects of\nrelated derivative instruments, were 5.02% and\n4.89% as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nrespectively.

The amount of such\nguaranteed long-term debt and structured notes was\n$ 34.5billion and $ 28.2billion at June 30, 2023\nand December 31, 2022, respectively. The Firm\u2019s\nunsecured debt does not contain requirements that\nwould call for an acceleration of payments,\nmaturities or changes in the structure of the\nexisting debt, provide any limitations on future\nborrowings or require additional collateral, based\non unfavorable changes in the Firm\u2019s credit\nratings, financial ratios, earnings or stock price.\n

The contractual amount of these financial instruments\nrepresents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the\ncommitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or\nclient subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and\nguarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a\ndefault occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm\u2019s\nview, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and\nthe Firm\u2019s related accounting policies. To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain\nconsumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is\nmaintained. Refer to Note 13 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-\nrelated commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-\nbalance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at June 30, 2023, and\nDecember 31, 2022. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain scored business\nbanking lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has\nnot experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be\nutilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business banking\nlines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In\naddition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60days or more past due. The Firm\nmay reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or\nwhen there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.\n                                                    184                                                     \n

Refer to Note 5 for a further\ndiscussion of credit derivatives.\n\nMerchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment networks, in its role as a merchant acquirer, the Firm's\nMerchant Services business in CIB Payments, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed credit and\ndebit card transactions that result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the\ncardholder\u2019s favor, the Firm will (through the cardholder\u2019s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the\ncardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If the Firm is unable to collect the amount\nfrom the merchant, the Firm will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. The\nFirm mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining\nother collateral. In addition, the Firm recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or\nperformance risk related to charge-backs.\n                                                    186                                                     \nLoan sales and securitization-related\nindemnifications In connection with the Firm\u2019s\nmortgage loan sale and securitization activities\nwith GSEs the Firm has made representations and\nwarranties that the loans sold meet certain\nrequirements, and that may require the Firm to\nrepurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan\npurchaser if such representations and warranties\nare breached by the Firm. The liability related to\nrepurchase demands associated with private label\nsecuritizations is separately evaluated by the Firm\nin establishing its litigation reserves. Refer to\nNote 26 of this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information\nregarding litigation. Sponsored member repo program\nThe Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear\neligible overnight and term resale and repurchase\nagreements through the Government Securities\nDivision of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation\n(\u201cFICC\u201d) on behalf of clients that become sponsored\nmembers under the FICC\u2019s rules. The Firm also\nguarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment\nand performance of its sponsored member clients\u2019\nrespective obligations under the FICC\u2019s rules. The\nFirm minimizes its liability under these guarantees\nby obtaining a security interest in the cash or\nhigh-quality securities collateral that the clients\nplace with the clearing house therefore the Firm\nexpects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm\u2019s\nmaximum possible exposure, without taking into\nconsideration the associated collateral, is\nincluded in the Exchange & clearing house\nguarantees and commitments line on page 185.

The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits\nwith potentially millions of class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement matters involve both\nformal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These\nlegal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of\nthe Firm\u2019s lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort\nand contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which\npresent novel legal theories. The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible\nlosses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $ 0to approximately $\n1.3billion at June 30, 2023. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon\ninformation available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of\nreasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate\ncan be made, as of that date. The Firm\u2019s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses\ninvolves significant judgment, given: \u2022 the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including\nthe fact that many are in preliminary stages, \u2022 the existence in many such proceedings of multiple\ndefendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, \u2022 the numerous\nyet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the\nscope of many of the claims, and \u2022 the uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings,\nincluding where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator,\nor about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions\nprove to be incorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm\ndid not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be\nremote. Accordingly, the Firm\u2019s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change\nfrom time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly. Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm\u2019s\nmaterial legal proceedings. 1MDB Litigation . J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a defendant in a civil\nlitigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (\u201c1MDB\u201d), a Malaysian state-owned\nand controlled investment fund. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was served in August 2022. The claim alleges\n\u201cdishonest assistance\u201d against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in relation to payments of $ 300million and $\n500million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan\nSuisse (SA) held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings\n(Cayman) Limited. In September 2022, the Firm filed an application challenging the validity of service and\nthe Malaysian Court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear the claim. In April 2023, 1MDB discontinued its claim against\nJ.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA, but requested permission of the Court to refile in the future, which the Court took\nunder consideration. Amrapali . India\u2019s Enforcement Directorate (\u201cED\u201d) is investigating J.P. Morgan India\nPrivate Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by twooffshore funds formerly managed\nby JPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (\u201cAmrapali\u201d).\nIn 2017, numerous creditors filed civil claims against Amrapali, including petitions brought by home buyers\nrelating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers\u2019 petitions have\nbeen overseen by the Supreme Court of India and are ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining\nJ.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $ 31.5million. The Firm is appealing the order and the fine.\nRelatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that\nAmrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had\ninvested in the projects, violated certain currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordering\nthe ED to conduct a further inquiry under India\u2019s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (\u201cPMLA\u201d) and Foreign\nExchange Management Act (\u201cFEMA\u201d). In May 2020, the ED attached approximately $ 25million from J.P. Morgan\nIndia Private Limited in connection with the criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and\ncooperating with the PMLA investigation. Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously\nreported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (\u201cFX\u201d) sales and\ntrading activities and controls related to those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm\npleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The Department of Labor (\"DOL\") granted the\nFirm exemptions that permit the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional\nAsset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d)\n                                                    188                                                     \nthrough the ten-yeardisqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related\ngovernmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter which is currently pending before the\nSouth Africa Competition Tribunal. With respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the United\nStates District Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval to the Firm\u2019s settlement\nof a consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of\nfederal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought\ndamages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures and options on futures. Although certain members\nof the settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, an agreement to resolve\ntheir claims was reached in December 2022. The District Court denied certification of a putative class\naction against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain parties who purchased\nforeign currencies at allegedly inflated rates and granted summary judgment against the named plaintiffs in\nMarch 2023. Those plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal. In addition, some FX-related individual and\nputative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S.,\nincluding in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. An agreement to resolve one of the UK\nactions was reached in December 2022. In July 2023, the U.K. Court of Appeal overturned the Competition\nAppeal Tribunal's earlier denial of a request for class certification on an opt-out basis. In Israel, a\nsettlement in principle has been reached in the putative class action, which remains subject to court\napproval. Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action\ncomplaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit\nand debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the\nparties initially settled the cases for a cash payment, but that settlement was reversed on appeal and\nremanded to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The original class action\nwas divided into twoseparate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily\ninjunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties to the monetary class action finalized an agreement which\namends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants\ncollectively contributed an additional $ 900million to the approximately $ 5.3billion previously held in\nescrow from the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended settlement agreement was approved by the\nDistrict Court. In March 2023, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the\nDistrict Court\u2019s approval of the settlement, and two merchants have filed petitions for rehearing of the\nAppellate Court\u2019s approval. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended class\nsettlement, $ 700million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with\nthe settlement agreement. The injunctive class action continues separately, and in September 2021, the\nDistrict Court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion in part. Of\nthe merchants who opted out of the amended damages class settlement, certain merchants filed individual\nactions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other\nbanks. While some of those actions remain pending, the defendants have reached settlements with the\nmerchants who opted out representing approximately 65% of the combined Mastercard-branded and Visa-branded\npayment card sales volume. Jeffrey Epstein Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was named as a defendant in\ntwolawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. knowingly facilitated Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s sex trafficking and other unlawful conduct\nby providing banking services to Epstein until 2013. One case, which was filed in November 2022, was a\nputative class action filed by an alleged sex-trafficking victim of Epstein, and the other case, which was\nfiled in December 2022, was brought on behalf of the government of the United States Virgin Islands and also\nalleges certain Virgin Islands statutory claims. In March 2023, the Court granted in part and denied in part\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s motions to dismiss these complaints, allowing some claims to proceed in both\nlawsuits. Also in March 2023, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. filed third-party complaints impleading the Firm\u2019s\nformer employee, James Edward Staley, into the twolawsuits, asserting claims for indemnification,\ncontribution, breach of fiduciary duty and violation of the faithless servant doctrine. In May 2023, the\nCourt denied Staley\u2019s motion to dismiss the impleader complaints. In June 2023, the Court granted the\nputative class\u2019 motion for class certification and granted a preliminary approval of a settlement between\nthe class and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., pursuant to which JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. will pay $ 290million\nto a fund for Epstein survivors. The actions involving the government of the United States Virgin Islands\nand Staley are proceeding. LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has\nresponded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily\nto the British Bankers Association\u2019s (\u201cBBA\u201d) London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) for various currencies\nand the European Banking Federation\u2019s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cEURIBOR\u201d). The Swiss Competition\nCommission\u2019s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain subject,\ncontinues. In December 2016, the European Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other banks\nfinding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of\nthat decision with the European General Court, and that appeal is pending.\n                                                    189                                                     \nIn addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in various individual and\nputative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S.\ndollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of\ncertain actions and resolved certain other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of New York has granted class certification of\nantitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, including the\nFirm. A consolidated putative class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was administered by\nICE Benchmark Administration has been dismissed. In addition, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a\nlawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful\nagreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and\ncredit cards. In September 2022, the Court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint in its entirety, and plaintiffs\nfiled an amended complaint asserting similar antitrust claims, which defendants have moved to dismiss. The\nFirm\u2019s settlements of putative class actions related to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the\nSingapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate received final court approval in\nNovember 2022, while the settlement related to Swiss franc LIBOR remains subject to court approval.\nSecurities Lending Antitrust Litigation . JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan\nPrime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class\naction filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint\nasserts violations of federal antitrust law and New York State common law in connection with an alleged\nconspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange trading for securities lending transactions.\nDefendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint was denied. Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this\naction, which defendants have opposed. The parties have reached an agreement in principle to settle this\naction, subject to final documentation and court approval. Shareholder Litigation . Several shareholder\nputative class actions, as well as shareholder derivative actions purporting to act on behalf of the Firm,\nhave been filed against the Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its current and former officers.\nCertain of these shareholder suits relate to historical trading practices by former employees in the\nprecious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct which were the subject of the Firm\u2019s\nresolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary activities that were separately the\nsubject of a resolution between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in November 2020. One of these\nshareholder derivative suits was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in May 2022, asserting\nbreach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims relating to the historical trading practices and\nrelated conduct and fiduciary activities which were the subject of the resolutions described above. In\nDecember 2022, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss this action in full, and in January 2023, the\nplaintiff filed a notice of appeal, which remains pending. A second shareholder derivative action was filed\nin the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in December 2022 relating to the\nhistorical trading practices and related conduct, which asserts breach of fiduciary duty and contribution\nclaims and alleges that the shareholder is excused from making a demand to commence litigation because such\na demand would have been futile. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint. In addition, a consolidated\nputative class action is pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York on\nbehalf of shareholders who acquired shares of JPMorgan Chase common stock during the putative class period,\nalleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially false or misleading because they did not\ndisclose certain information relating to the historical trading practices and conduct. Defendants have moved\nto dismiss the amended complaint in this action. A separate shareholder derivative suit was filed in March\n2022 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting breaches of\nfiduciary duty and violations of federal securities laws based on the alleged failure of the Board of\nDirectors to exercise adequate oversight over the Firm\u2019s compliance with records preservation requirements\nwhich were the subject of resolutions between certain of the Firm\u2019s subsidiaries and the SEC and the CFTC.\nDefendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the amended complaint is pending. Twoshareholder derivative suits were filed\nin May and June 2023, respectively, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New\nYork asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment based on the alleged failure of the Board of\nDirectors and James Dimon to exercise adequate oversight with respect to the Firm\u2019s provision of banking\nservices to Jeffrey Epstein. These actions allege that the shareholders are excused from making a demand to\ncommence litigation because such a demand would have been futile. These actions were consolidated and\ndefendants have moved to dismiss the amended complaint filed by the plaintiffs. * * * In addition to the\nvarious legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or\nare otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has\nmeritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it\nintends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the\nfuture. The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal\nproceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a\nlitigation-related liability when it is probable\n                                                    190                                                     \nthat such a liability has been incurred and the\namount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The\nFirm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings\neach quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and\nmakes adjustments in such reserves, upward or\ndownward, as appropriate, based on management\u2019s\nbest judgment after consultation with counsel. The\nFirm\u2019s legal expense was $ 420million and $\n73million for the three months ended June 30, 2023\nand 2022, respectively. There is no assurance that\nthe Firm\u2019s litigation reserves will not need to be\nadjusted in the future. In view of the inherent\ndifficulty of predicting the outcome of legal\nproceedings, particularly where the claimants seek\nvery large or indeterminate damages, or where the\nmatters present novel legal theories, involve a\nlarge number of parties or are in early stages of\ndiscovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence\nwhat will be the eventual outcomes of the currently\npending matters, the timing of their ultimate\nresolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties\nor consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan\nChase believes, based upon its current knowledge\nand after consultation with counsel, consideration\nof the material legal proceedings described above\nand after taking into account its current\nlitigation reserves and its estimated aggregate\nrange of possible losses, that the other legal\nproceedings currently pending against it should not\nhave a material adverse effect on the Firm\u2019s\nconsolidated financial condition. The Firm notes,\nhowever, that in light of the uncertainties\ninvolved in such proceedings, there is no assurance\nthat the ultimate resolution of these matters will\nnot significantly exceed the reserves it has\ncurrently accrued or that a matter will not have\nmaterial reputational consequences. As a result,\nthe outcome of a particular matter may be material\nto JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operating results for a\nparticular period, depending on, among other\nfactors, the size of the loss or liability imposed\nand the level of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s income for that\nperiod.\n                                                    191                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Note 27 \u2013 Business segments                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are fourmajor reportable business segments - Consumer & Community\nBanking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there\nis a Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or\nthe type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently\nevaluated by the Firm\u2019s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to\nSegment results below, and Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s business segments. Segment results The following table provides a summary of the Firm\u2019s segment\nresults as of or for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, on a managed basis. The Firm\u2019s\ndefinition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain\nreclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments)\non an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is\npresented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. Refer to Note\n32 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm\u2019s managed basis. Capital\nallocation The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is referred to as equity. At least\nannually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a\nresult, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. As of June 30, 2023, the Firm updated its line of\nbusiness capital allocations to reflect the impact of the First Republic acquisition.

The estimated\nbargain purchase gain represents the excess of the\nestimated fair value of the net assets acquired\nabove the purchase price. The First Republic\nacquisition further advances the Firm's wealth\nmanagement strategy and is complementary to the\nFirm's existing franchises. The Firm has determined\nthat this acquisition constitutes a business\ncombination under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the\ninitial recognition of the assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed were generally measured at\ntheir estimated fair values as of May 1, 2023. The\ndetermination of those fair values required\nmanagement to make certain market-based assumptions\nabout expected future cash flows, discount rates\nand other valuation inputs at the time of the\nacquisition. The Firm believes that the fair value\nestimates of the assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed provide a reasonable basis for determining\nthe estimated bargain purchase gain. The Firm and\nthe FDIC have not yet completed the settlement\nprocess under which the purchase price, and the\nidentification of the assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed, will be finalized. The\nfinalization of this settlement process may impact\nthe amount of the estimated bargain purchase gain.\nThe purchase and assumption agreement entered into\nwith the FDIC allows for final settlement to occur\nup to a year after the acquisition date. In\naddition, the purchase price and the estimated\nbargain purchase gain could change pending\nmanagement's finalization of its acquisition date\nfair value estimates for certain of the assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed (such as loans and\ncommitments, intangible assets and leases), which\nmay take place up to one year from the acquisition\ndate, as permitted by U.S. GAAP. In connection with\nthe First Republic acquisition, the Firm and the\nFDIC entered into twoshared-loss agreements with\nrespect to certain loans and lending-related\ncommitments (the \"shared-loss assets\"): the\nCommercial Shared-Loss Agreement (\"CSLA\") and the\nSingle-Family Shared-Loss Agreement (\u201cSFSLA\u201d). The\nCSLA covers 80% of credit losses, on a pari-passu\nbasis, over 5years with a subsequent 3-yearrecovery\nperiod for certain acquired commercial loans and\nother real estate exposure. The SFSLA covers 80% of\ncredit losses, on a pari-passu basis, for 7years\nfor certain acquired loans secured by mortgages on\nreal property or shares in cooperative property\nconstituting a primary residence. The\nindemnification assets which represent the fair\nvalue of the CSLA and SFSLA are reflected in the\ntotal assets acquired.\n\nAs part of the consideration paid, JPMorgan Chase\nissued a five-year, $ 50billion secured note to the\nFDIC (the \"Purchase Money Note\"). The Purchase\nMoney Note bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.4%\nand is secured by certain of the acquired loans.\nThe Purchase Money Note is prepayable upon notice\nto the FDIC. The Firm had placed a $ 5billion\ndeposit with First Republic Bank on March 16, 2023,\nas part of $ 30billion of deposits provided by a\nconsortium of large U.S. banks. The Firm's $\n5billion deposit was effectively settled as part of\nthe acquisition and the associated allowance for\ncredit losses was released upon closing. The Firm\nsubsequently repaid the remaining $ 25billion of\ndeposits to the consortium of banks, including\naccrued interest through the payment date on May 9,\n2023.\n                                                    194                                                     \nThe computation of the purchase price, the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed as part of the First Republic acquisition and the related estimated bargain purchase gain are\npresented below.\n                                                                                \n                                                           Fair value purchase  \n                                                        price allocation as of  \n                                                                   May 1, 2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (in millions)                                                                 \n  Purchase price consideration                                                  \n  Amounts paid/due to the FDIC, net of cash          $                  13,589  \n  acquired(a)                                                                   \n  Purchase Money Note (at fair value)                                   48,848  \n  Settlement of First Republic deposit and other                         5,447  \n  related party transactions(b)                                                 \n  Contingent consideration - Shared-loss                                    15  \n  agreements                                                                    \n  Purchase price consideration                       $                  67,899  \n  Assets                                                                        \n  Securities                                         $                  30,285  \n  Loans                                                                152,335  \n  Core deposit and customer relationship                                 1,462  \n  intangibles                                                                   \n  Indemnification assets - Shared-loss agreements                          675  \n  Accounts receivable and other assets(c)                                7,551  \n  Total assets acquired                              $                 192,308  \n  Liabilities                                                                   \n  Deposits                                           $                  87,507  \n  FHLB advances                                                         27,919  \n  Lending-related commitments                                            2,409  \n  Accounts payable and other liabilities(c)                              3,006  \n  Deferred tax liabilities                                                 856  \n  Total liabilities assumed                          $                 121,697  \n  Fair value of net assets acquired                  $                  70,611  \n  Estimated gain on acquisition, after income        $                   2,712  \n  taxes                                                                         \n                                                                                \n(a) Includes $ 10.6billion of cash paid to the FDIC at acquisition and $ 3.7billion payable to the FDIC,\nless cash acquired of $ 680million.\n(b) Includes $ 447million of securities financing transactions with First Republic Bank that were\neffectively settled on the acquisition date.\n(c) Other assets include $ 1.2billion in tax-oriented investments and $ 756million of lease right-of-use\nassets.

Refer to Note 14 and Note 17 for additional information.\nThe issuance of the $ 50billion Purchase Money Note, the effective settlement of the Firm's $ 5billion\ndeposit and $ 447million of securities financing with First Republic Bank, and the $ 3.7billion payable to\nthe FDIC as part of the purchase price consideration are considered non-cash transactions.\n\nThe following describes the accounting policies and fair value methodologies generally used by the Firm for\nthe following assets acquired and liabilities assumed: core deposit and customer relationship intangibles,\nshared-loss agreements and the related indemnification assets, Purchase Money Note, and FHLB advances.\n\nRefer to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm\u2019s accounting policies and valuation\nmethodologies for securities, loans, deposits, and lending-related commitments.\n\nCore deposit and customer relationship intangibles Core deposit and certain wealth management customer\nrelationship intangibles were acquired as part of the First Republic transaction. The core deposit\nintangible of $ 1.3billion was valued by discounting estimated after-tax cost savings over the remaining\nuseful life of the deposits using the favorable source of funds method. The after-tax cost savings were\nestimated based on the difference between the cost of maintaining the core deposit base relative to the cost\nof next best alternative funding sources available to market participants. The customer relationship\nintangibles of $ 187million were valued by discounting estimated after-tax earnings over their remaining\nuseful lives using the multi-period excess earnings method. Both intangible asset valuations utilized\nassumptions that the Firm believes a market participant would use to estimate fair values, such as growth\nand attrition rates, projected fee income as well as related costs to service the relationships, and\ndiscount rates. The core deposit and customer relationship intangibles will be amortized over a projected\nperiod of future cash flows of approximately 7years. As of June 30, 2023, the carrying values of the core\ndeposit and customer relationship intangibles were $ 1.2billion and $ 183million, respectively, reflecting\naccumulated amortization of approximately $ 30million and $ 4million, respectively. Indemnification assets -\nShared-loss agreements The indemnification assets represent forecasted recoveries from the FDIC associated\nwith the shared-loss assets over the respective shared loss recovery periods. The indemnification assets\nwere recorded at fair value in other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets on the acquisition date. The\nfair values of the indemnification assets were estimated based on the timing of the forecasted losses\nunderlying the related allowance for credit losses.\n                                                    195                                                     \nThe subsequent quarterly remeasurement of the indemnification assets will be based on changes in amount and\ntiming of forecasted losses in the allowance for credit losses associated with the shared loss assets and\nwill be recorded in other income. Under certain circumstances, the Firm may be required to make a payment to\nthe FDIC upon termination of the shared-loss agreements based on the level of actual losses and recoveries\non the shared-loss assets. The estimated potential future payment is reflected as contingent consideration\nas part of the purchase price consideration. Purchase Money Note and FHLB advances The Purchase Money Note\nis recorded in long-term debt on the Consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the Purchase Money Note\nwas estimated based on a discounted cash flow methodology and incorporated estimated market discount rates.\nThe FHLB advances assumed in the acquisition are recorded in short-term borrowings and in long-term debt.\nThe fair value of the FHLB advances was based on a discounted cash flow methodology and considered the\nobserved FHLB advance issuance rates.\n\nLoans\n\nThe following table presents the unpaid principal balance and estimated fair value of the loans acquired as\nof May 1, 2023.\n                                                              \n                                May 1, 2023                   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (in millions)                         UPB       Fair value  \n  Residential real estate    $      106,240    $      91,906  \n  Auto and other                      3,092            2,031  \n  Total consumer                    109,332           93,937  \n  Secured by real estate             37,119           33,605  \n  Commercial & industrial             4,333            3,933  \n  Other                              22,597           20,860  \n  Total wholesale                    64,049           58,398  \n  Total loans                $      173,381    $     152,335  \n                                                              \nUnaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information\n\nIncluded in the Firm's Consolidated statements of income are noninterest revenue, net interest income and\nnet income contributed by First Republic since the acquisition date of May 1, 2023 of $ 3.1billion, $\n897million and $ 2.4billion, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023.\nThe following table presents certain unaudited pro forma financial information for the three and six months\nended June 30, 2023 and 2022 as if the First Republic acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2022, including\nrecognition of the estimated bargain purchase gain of $ 2.7billion and the provision for credit losses of $\n1.2billion.

The\nminimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on\nthe interest rate charged during the introductory\nperiod. This introductory rate is usually\nsignificantly below the fully indexed rate. The\nfully indexed rate is calculated using an index\nrate plus a margin. Once the introductory period\nends, the contractual interest rate charged on the\nloan increases to the fully indexed rate and\nadjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index.\nThe minimum payment is typically insufficient to\ncover interest\n                                                    202                                                     \naccrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest\nis deferred and added to the principal balance of\nthe loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment\nrecast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate\nfully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan\nbalance and anniversary date triggers.\n\nPrime\n\nPrime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with\ngood credit records who meet specific underwriting\nrequirements, including prescriptive requirements\nrelated to income and overall debt levels.

Loans (other\nthan credit card loans and certain consumer loans\ninsured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on\nnonaccrual status when full payment of principal\nand interest is not expected, regardless of\ndelinquency status, or when principal and\n\ninterest has been in default for a period of 90\ndays or more unless the loan is both well-secured\nand in the process of collection. Collateral-\ndependent loans are typically maintained on\nnonaccrual status.\n\nNonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include\nnonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and\ncertain assets acquired in loan satisfactions,\npredominantly real estate owned and other\ncommercial and personal property.\n\nNSFR: Net Stable Funding Ratio\n\nOCC : Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\n\nOCI : Other comprehensive income/(loss)\n\nOPEB : Other postretirement employee benefit\n\nOTC : \u201cOver-the-counter derivatives\u201d: Derivative\ncontracts that are negotiated, executed and settled\nbilaterally between two derivative counterparties,\nwhere one or both counterparties is a derivatives\ndealer.\n\nOTC cleared : \u201cOver-the-counter cleared\nderivatives\u201d: Derivative contracts that are\nnegotiated and executed bilaterally, but\nsubsequently settled via a central clearing house,\nsuch that each derivative counterparty is only\nexposed to the default of that clearing house.\n\nOverhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage\nof total net revenue.\n\nParent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nParticipating securities: represents unvested\nshare-based compensation awards containing\nnonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend\nequivalents (collectively, \u201cdividends\u201d), which are\nincluded in the earnings per share calculation\nusing the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase grants\nrestricted stock and RSUs to certain employees\nunder its share-based compensation programs, which\nentitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable\ndividends during the vesting period on a basis\nequivalent to the dividends paid to holders of\ncommon stock. These unvested awards meet the\ndefinition of participating securities.

The Firm believes\nthat this financial measure is useful in assessing\nthe ability of a lending institution to generate\nincome in excess of its provision for credit\nlosses.\n\nPrincipal transactions revenue : Principal\ntransactions revenue is driven by many factors,\nincluding the bid-offer spread, which is the\ndifference between the price at which the Firm is\nwilling to buy a financial or other instrument and\nthe price at which the Firm is willing to sell that\ninstrument. It also consists of realized (as a\nresult of closing out or termination of\ntransactions, or interim cash payments) and\nunrealized (as a result of changes in valuation)\ngains and losses on financial and other instruments\n(including those accounted for under the fair value\noption) primarily used in client-driven market-\nmaking activities and on private equity\ninvestments. In connection with its client-driven\nmarket-making activities, the Firm transacts in\ndebt and equity instruments, derivatives and\ncommodities (including physical commodities\ninventories and financial instruments that\nreference commodities). Principal transactions\nrevenue also includes certain realized and\nunrealized gains and losses related to hedge\naccounting and specified risk-management\nactivities, including: (a) certain derivatives\ndesignated in qualifying hedge accounting\nrelationships (primarily fair value hedges of\ncommodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain\nderivatives used for specific risk management\npurposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and\nforeign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.\n\nPSU(s) : Performance share units\n\nRegulatory VaR: Daily aggregated VaR calculated in\naccordance with regulatory rules.\n\nREO: Real estate owned\n\nReported basis: Financial statements prepared under\nU.S. GAAP, which excludes the impact of taxable-\nequivalent adjustments.\n\nRetained loans : Loans that are held-for-investment\n(i.e. excludes loans held-for-sale and loans at\nfair value).\n\nRevenue wallet: Total fee revenue based on\nestimates of investment banking fees generated\nacross the industry (i.e., the revenue wallet) from\ninvestment banking transactions in M&A, equity and\ndebt underwriting, and loan syndications.

There can be no assurance that the First Republic acquisition will have the anticipated  \u2502\n\u2502  positive results, including with respect to:\u2022the total cost of integration\u2022the time required to         \u2502\n\u2502  complete the integration\u2022the amount of longer-term cost savings\u2022the overall performance of the assets   \u2502\n\u2502  and liabilities acquired in the First Republic acquisition, or\u2022an improved price for JPMorgan Chase\u2019s   \u2502\n\u2502  common stock.Integration of an acquired business can be complex and costly, and typically will involve  \u2502\n\u2502  the combination of relevant accounting and data processing systems and management controls, as well as  \u2502\n\u2502  managing relevant relationships with employees, clients, suppliers and other business partners.         \u2502\n\u2502  Integration efforts could divert management attention and resources, which could adversely affect       \u2502\n\u2502  JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations or results. In addition, JPMorgan Chase could incur unanticipated costs or  \u2502\n\u2502  losses in connection with the First Republic acquisition and its integration efforts.Acquisitions may   \u2502\n\u2502  also result in business disruptions that cause JPMorgan Chase to lose clients and customers, or cause   \u2502\n\u2502  clients and customers to move their business to competing financial institutions. It is possible that   \u2502\n\u2502  the integration process could result in the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in      \u2502\n\u2502  standards, controls, procedures and policies that could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to    \u2502\n\u2502  maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees. In addition, the loss of key  \u2502\n\u2502  employees in connection with the First Republic acquisitioncould adversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s      \u2502\n\u2502  ability to successfully conduct its business.Supervision and regulationRefer to the Supervision and     \u2502\n\u2502  regulation section on pages 4\u20138 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for information on Supervision and   \u2502\n\u2502  Regulation.Item 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.The Firm did not      \u2502\n\u2502  have any unregistered sale of equity securities during the three months ended June\u00a030,                  \u2502\n\u2502  2023.Repurchases under the common share repurchase programRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages     \u2502\n\u2502  48-53 of this Form 10-Q and pages 86-96 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for information regarding    \u2502\n\u2502  repurchases under the Firm\u2019s common share repurchase program.The Firm is authorized to purchase up to   \u2502\n\u2502  $30\u00a0billion under its common share repurchase program previously approved by the Board of Directors.    \u2502\n\u2502                                                                                                          \u2502\n\u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256f\n                                                    209                                                     \nShares repurchased pursuant to the common share repurchase program during the six months ended June 30, 2023\nwere as follows.\n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                           Dollar value of  \n                                                                          Aggregate              remaining  \n                      Total number of          Average price         purchase price             authorized  \n  Six months                shares of               paid per        of common stock             repurchase  \n  ended June 30,         common stock        share of common            repurchases                    (in  \n  2023                    repurchased               stock(a)       (in millions)(a)        millions)(a)(b)  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  First quarter            21,995,253    $            133.67    $             2,940    $            26,693  \n  April                     5,327,553    $            134.39    $               716    $            25,977  \n  May                       6,251,030                 136.77                    855                 25,122  \n  June                      5,132,716                 140.66                    722                 24,400  \n  Second quarter           16,711,299    $            137.20    $             2,293    $            24,400  \n  Year-to-date             38,706,552    $            135.19    $             5,233    $            24,400  \n                                                                                                            \n(a) Excludes excise tax and commissions cost.
