There are four major\nreportable business segments \u2013\nConsumer & Community Banking,\nCorporate & Investment Bank,\nCommercial Banking and Asset &\nWealth Management. In\naddition, there is a Corporate\nsegment.\n\nThe business segments are\ndetermined based on the\nproducts and services\nprovided, or the type of\ncustomer served, and they\nreflect the manner in which\nfinancial information is\ncurrently evaluated by the\nFirm\u2019s Operating Committee.\nSegment results are presented\non a managed basis. Refer to\nExplanation and Reconciliation\nof the Firm\u2019s use of Non-GAAP\nFinancial Measures on pages\n19-20 for a definition of\nmanaged basis.\n\nDescription of business\nsegment reporting methodology\n\nResults of the business\nsegments are intended to\npresent each segment as if it\nwere a stand-alone business.\nThe management reporting\nprocess that derives business\nsegment results includes the\nallocation of certain income\nand expense items. The Firm\nperiodically assesses the\nassumptions, methodologies and\nreporting classifications used\nfor segment reporting, and\nfurther refinements may be\nimplemented in future periods.\nThe Firm also assesses the\nlevel of capital required for\neach LOB on at least an annual\nbasis. The Firm\u2019s LOBs also\nprovide various business\nmetrics which are utilized by\nthe Firm and its investors and\nanalysts in assessing\nperformance.\n\nRevenue sharing\n\nWhen business segments join\nefforts to sell products and\nservices to the Firm\u2019s\nclients, the participating\nbusiness segments may agree to\nshare revenue from those\ntransactions. Revenue is\ngenerally recognized in the\nsegment responsible for the\nrelated product or service,\nwith allocations to the other\nsegment(s) involved in the\ntransaction. The segment\nresults reflect these revenue-\nsharing agreements.\n\nFunds transfer pricing\n\nFunds transfer pricing (\u201cFTP\u201d)\nis the process by which the\nFirm allocates interest income\nand expense to the LOBs and\nOther Corporate and transfers\nthe primary interest rate risk\nand liquidity risk to Treasury\nand CIO.\n\nThe funds transfer pricing\nprocess considers the interest\nrate risk and liquidity risk\ncharacteristics of assets and\nliabilities and off-balance\nsheet products. Periodically\nthe methodology and\nassumptions utilized in the\nFTP process are adjusted to\nreflect economic conditions\nand other factors, which may\nimpact the allocation of net\ninterest income to the\nsegments.\n\nForeign exchange risk\n\nForeign exchange risk is\ntransferred from the LOBs and\nOther Corporate to Treasury\nand CIO for certain revenues\nand expenses.

When the Firm\nextends a consumer or\nwholesale loan, advises\ncustomers and clients on their\ninvestment decisions, makes\nmarkets in securities, or\noffers other products or\nservices, the Firm takes on\nsome degree of risk. The\nFirm\u2019s overall objective is to\nmanage its businesses, and the\nassociated risks, in a manner\nthat balances serving the\ninterests of its clients,\ncustomers and investors and\nprotects the safety and\nsoundness of the Firm. The\nFirm believes that effective\nrisk management requires,\namong other things: \u2022\nAcceptance of responsibility,\nincluding identification and\nescalation of risks by all\nindividuals within the Firm; \u2022\nOwnership of risk\nidentification, assessment,\ndata and management within\neach of the LOBs and\nCorporate; and \u2022 Firmwide\nstructures for risk\ngovernance. The Firm follows a\ndisciplined and balanced\ncompensation framework with\nstrong internal governance and\nindependent oversight by the\nBoard of Directors (the\n\u201cBoard\u201d). The impact of risk\nand control issues is\ncarefully considered in the\nFirm\u2019s performance evaluation\nand incentive compensation\nprocesses. Risk governance and\noversight framework The Firm\u2019s\nrisk management governance and\noversight framework involves\nunderstanding drivers of\nrisks, types of risks, and\nimpacts of risks.

The\nminimum amount of regulatory\ncapital that must be held by\nBHCs and banks is determined\nby calculating risk-weighted\nassets (\u201cRWA\u201d), which are on-\nbalance sheet assets and off-\nbalance sheet exposures,\nweighted according to risk.\nTwo comprehensive approaches\nare prescribed for calculating\nRWA: a standardized approach\n(\u201cBasel III Standardized\u201d),\nand an advanced approach\n(\u201cBasel III Advanced\u201d). For\neach of the risk-based capital\nratios, the capital adequacy\nof the Firm is evaluated\nagainst the lower of the\nStandardized or Advanced\napproaches compared to their\nrespective regulatory capital\nratio requirements. The Firm\u2019s\nBasel III Standardized-risk-\nbased ratios are currently\nmore binding than the Basel\nIII Advanced-risk-based\nratios.\n\nBasel III also includes a\nrequirement for Advanced\nApproaches banking\norganizations, including the\nFirm, to calculate the SLR.\nWhile the Firm\u2019s SLR is\ncurrently more binding than\nthe Basel III Standardized-\nrisk-based ratios, the Firm\nexpects that in the fourth\nquarter of 2022, the Basel III\nStandardized-risk-based ratios\nwill become more binding due\nto increases in the Firm's\nrisk-based regulatory capital\nrequirements. As a result, the\nFirm announced the redemption\nof $5.43 billion of preferred\nstock and issued $3.5 billion\nof subordinated notes in the\nthird quarter of 2022 to\nrebalance the Firm's capital\ncomponents. Refer to SLR on\npage 48 and capital actions on\npages 48-49 for additional\ninformation.\n\nKey Regulatory Developments\n\nCECL regulatory capital\ntransition. On December 31,\n2021, the CECL capital\ntransition provisions , which\ndelayed the effects of CECL on\nregulatory capital for two\nyears, expired. Beginning\nJanuary 1, 2022, the $2.9\nbillion CECL capital benefit\nrecognized as of December 31,\n2021, is being phased out at\n25% per year over a three-year\nperiod. As of September 30,\n2022, CET1 capital reflected\nthe remaining $2.2 billion\nbenefit associated with the\nCECL capital transition\nprovisions.\n\nAdditionally, effective\nJanuary 1, 2022, the Firm\nphased out 25% of the other\nrelevant CECL capital\ntransition provisions\nrecognized as of December 31,\n2021, from Tier 2 capital,\nadjusted average assets, total\nleverage exposure and RWA, as\napplicable.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk\nManagement on pages 86-96 and\nNote 1 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n2021 Form 10-K for further\ninformation on CECL capital\ntransition provisions and the\nCECL accounting guidance.\n\nStandardized Approach for\nCounterparty Credit Risk. On\nJanuary 1, 2022, the Firm\nadopted \u201cStandardized Approach\nfor Counterparty Credit Risk\u201d\n(\u201cSA-CCR\u201d), which replaced the\nCurrent Exposure Method used\nto measure derivatives\ncounterparty exposure under\nthe Standardized and Advanced\napproach RWA where internal\nmodels are not used, as well\nas leverage exposure used to\ncalculate the SLR in the\nregulatory capital framework.\nThe rule issued by the U.S.\nbanking regulators in November\n2019 applies to Basel III\nAdvanced Approaches banking\norganizations, such as the\nFirm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A.\n\nThe adoption of SA-CCR on\nJanuary 1, 2022 increased the\nFirm\u2019s Standardized RWA by\napproximately $40 billion\nbased on the Firm's\nderivatives exposure as of\nDecember 31, 2021, which\nresulted in a decrease of\napproximately 30 bps to the\nFirm's CET1 capital ratio and\na modest decrease in its total\nleverage exposure. In\naddition, the adoption of SA-\nCCR increased the Firm's\nAdvanced RWA, but to a lesser\nextent than Standardized.\n\nRisk-based Capital Targets\n\nThe Firm's current target for\nits Basel III Standardized\nCET1 capital ratio is 12.5%\nfor the fourth quarter of 2022\nand 13.0% by the end of the\nfirst quarter of 2023. These\ntargets are based on the Basel\nIII capital rules currently in\neffect, taking into account\nthe Firm's increasing risk-\nbased regulatory capital\nrequirements.\n                              45                               \nThe following tables present the Firm\u2019s risk-based capital\nmetrics under both the Basel III Standardized and Advanced\napproaches and leverage-based capital metrics.

(d)\nExcludes average excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The\nFirm\u2019s average LCR increased during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022, compared with the three months ended June\n30, 2022, predominantly due to long-term debt issuances and CIB\nMarkets activities.\n\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR decreased during the\nthree months ended September 30, 2022, compared with the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2022 due to a decrease in JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A.\u2019s HQLA, primarily from a reduction in cash from a\ndecline in deposits and loan growth. JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A.\u2019s average LCR for the three months ended September 30,\n2022 was lower than the same period in the prior year due to a\ndecrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s HQLA as a result of a\nreduction in cash from loan growth, non-HQLA investment\nsecurity purchases, and a decline in the market value of HQLA-\neligible investment securities in Treasury and CIO, partially\noffset by an increase in deposits. Refer to Note 9 for\nadditional information on the Firm's investment securities\nportfolio. The Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR\nfluctuates from period to period, due to changes in its\neligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of\nongoing business activity. Refer to page 98 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n2021 Form 10-K and the Firm\u2019s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports for\nadditional information on HQLA and net cash outflows. Other\nliquidity sources In addition to the assets reported in the\nFirm\u2019s eligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered\nmarketable securities, such as equity and debt securities, that\nthe Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. This\nincludes excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates.\nThe fair value of these securities was approximately $771\nbillion and $914 billion as of September 30, 2022 and December\n31, 2021, respectively, although the amount of liquidity that\ncould be raised at any particular time would be dependent on\nprevailing market conditions. The fair value decreased compared\nto December 31, 2021, primarily due to a decrease in excess\neligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as noted above. The\nFirm also had available borrowing capacity at the Federal Home\nLoan Banks (\u201cFHLBs\u201d) and the discount window at the Federal\nReserve Bank as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to\nsuch banks of approximately $317 billion and $308 billion as of\nSeptember 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. This\nborrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities\nreported in the Firm\u2019s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered\nsecurities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve\nBank discount window and other central banks. Although\navailable, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at\nthe Federal Reserve Bank discount window and the other central\nbanks as a primary source of liquidity.\n                              51                               \n                                                               \n  NSFR                                                         \n                                                               \nThe net stable funding ratio\n(\u201cNSFR\u201d) rule requires that\nthe Firm and JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. maintain an amount\nof \u201cavailable\u201d stable funding\nthat is sufficient to meet\ntheir \u201crequired\u201d amounts of\nstable funding over a one-year\nhorizon.\n\nAs of September 30, 2022, the\nFirm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. were compliant with the\n100% minimum NSFR requirement,\nbased on the Firm's current\nunderstanding of the final\nrule.

However, during periods of market disruption those\ntrends could be affected.\n\nAverage deposits were higher for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended September\n30, 2021, reflecting: \u2022 an increase in CCB driven by growth\nfrom new and existing accounts across both consumer and small\nbusines s customers, and growth in time deposits in AWM,\npartially offset by \u2022 declines in both Payments and Securities\nServices in CIB and in non-operating deposits in CB. Average\ndeposits were higher for the nine months ended September 30,\n2022 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021,\nreflecting: \u2022 increases in CCB driven by growth from existing\nand new accounts across both consumer and small business\ncustomers, and \u2022 net inflows in AWM resulting from the residual\neffects of certain government actions, partially offset by \u2022 a\ndecline in Securities Services in CIB. Period-end deposits have\ndeclined as a result of the migration that began in the second\nquarter of 2022. The decrease in period-end deposits reflects a\nreduction in non-operating deposits in CB, and in AWM net\noutflows into investments as a result of the rising interest\nrate environment, partially offset by growth from new consumer\nand small business accounts in CCB that more than offset the\n                              53                               \ndecline in deposits in\nexisting accounts as spending\ncontinued to grow.\n\nThe increase in deposits in\nCorporate was driven by the\nFirm's international consumer\ngrowth initiatives.\n\nRefer to the discussion of the\nFirm\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheets Analysis and the\nBusiness Segment Results on\npages 16-17 and pages 21-43,\nrespectively, for further\ninformation on deposit and\nliability balance trends.\n\nThe following table summarizes\nshort-term and long-term\nfunding, excluding deposits,\nas of September 30, 2022, and\nDecember 31, 2021, and average\nbalances for the three and\nnine months ended September\n30, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively.

These instruments\nare secured predominantly by\nhigh-quality securities\ncollateral, including\ngovernment-issued debt and\nU.S. GSE and government agency\nMBS. Securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase\nincreased at September 30,\n2022, compared with December\n31, 2021, due to higher\nsecured financing of trading\nassets and the impact of\nnetting on client-driven\nmarket-making activities in\nMarkets, partially offset by\nlower secured financing of AFS\ninvestment securities in\nTreasury and CIO.\n\nThe balances associated with\nsecurities loaned or sold\nunder agreements to repurchase\nfluctuate over time due to\ninvestment and financing\nactivities of clients, the\nFirm\u2019s demand for financing,\nthe ongoing management of the\nmix of the Firm\u2019s liabilities,\nincluding its secured and\nunsecured financing (for both\nthe investment securities and\nmarket-making portfolios), and\nother market and portfolio\nfactors.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s sources of short-\nterm unsecured funding\nprimarily consist of issuances\nof wholesale commercial paper\nand other borrowed funds. The\nincrease in commercial paper\nfor the average three and nine\nmonths ended September 30,\n2022 compared to the prior\nyear period, and the decrease\nin commercial paper at\nSeptember 30, 2022, from\nDecember 31, 2021, was due to\nchanges in the net issuance\nlevels primarily for short-\nterm liquidity management.\n                              54                               \n                                                               \n  Long-term funding and issuance                               \n                                                               \nLong-term funding provides an additional source of stable\nfunding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm\u2019s long-term\nfunding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity,\nliquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements,\nincluding TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include\nmaintaining diversification, maximizing market access and\noptimizing funding costs.

Residential\nreal estate: The residential\nreal estate portfolio,\nincluding loans held-for-sale\nand loans at fair value,\npredominantly consists of\nprime mortgage loans and home\nequity lines of credit.\nRetained loans increased\ncompared to December 31, 2021,\nreflecting originations, net\nof paydowns. Retained\nnonaccrual loans decreased\nfrom December 31, 2021\nreflecting improved credit\nperformance and loan sales.\nNet recoveries were lower for\nthe three and nine months\nended September 30, 2022 when\ncompared to the same periods\nin the prior year driven by\nlower prepayments in the\ncurrent year due to higher\ninterest rates. Loans at fair\nvalue decreased from December\n31, 2021, as warehouse loan\nsales in Home Lending outpaced\noriginations due to higher\ninterest rates and lower loan\npurchase activity in CIB.\nNonaccrual loans at fair value\ndecreased from December 31,\n2021 driven by net portfolio\nactivity in CIB. The carrying\nvalue of home equity lines of\ncredit outstanding was $16.3\nbillion at September 30, 2022.\nThis amount included $5.3\nbillion of HELOCs that have\nrecast from interest-only to\nfully amortizing payments or\nhave been modified and $5.2\nbillion of interest-only\nballoon HELOCs, which\nprimarily mature after 2030.\nThe Firm manages the risk of\nHELOCs during their revolving\nperiod by closing or reducing\nthe undrawn line to the extent\npermitted by law when\nborrowers are exhibiting a\nmaterial deterioration in\ntheir credit risk profile.

Net\ncharge-offs decreased for the\nnine months ended September\n30, 2022 compared with the\nsame period in the prior year\n.

A portion of the loans\noriginated or acquired by the Firm\u2019s wholesale businesses is\ngenerally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a\nsignificant percentage of the loans that it originates into the\nmarket as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage\nportfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale\nportfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing,\nin-depth reviews of client credit quality and transaction\nstructure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of\nindustry, product and client concentrations. Refer to the\nindustry discussion on pages 66-69 for further information. The\nFirm\u2019s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in\nCIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated exposures\nheld in CCB, including business banking and auto dealer\nexposure for which the wholesale methodology is applied when\ndetermining the allowance for credit losses. In the nine months\nended September 30, 2022, credit continued to perform well with\ncharge-offs remaining low. As of September 30, 2022, the\ndecrease in nonperforming exposure was driven by a decline in\nlending related commitments and loans, predominantly in CIB and\nAWM, as a result of net portfolio activity and upgrades,\nlargely offset by downgrades including downgrades to certain\nRussia and Russia-associated clients in the first quarter of\n2022. Refer to Business Developments on page 9 and Country Risk\non pages 82-83 for additional information. As of September 30,\n2022, retained loans increased $35.9 billion driven by CB and\nCIB, including increased revolver utilization, partially offset\nby a decline in AWM. Lending-related commitments decreased\n$13.5 billion driven by net portfolio activity in CIB,\nincluding a decrease in held-for-sale positions in the bridge\nfinancing portfolio, partially offset by net portfolio activity\nin AWM.\n                                                               \n  \u2026                                                            \n  \u2026

Most of these\ncommitments and guarantees\nhave historically been\nrefinanced, extended,\ncancelled, or expired without\nbeing drawn upon or a default\noccurring. As a result, the\nFirm does not believe that the\ntotal contractual amount of\nthese wholesale lending-\nrelated commitments is\nrepresentative of the Firm\u2019s\nexpected future credit\nexposure or funding\nrequirements. Refer to Note 22\nfor further information on\nwholesale lending-related\ncommitments.\n                                                               \n  Receivables from customers                                   \n                                                               \nReceivables from customers\nreflect held-for-investment\nmargin loans to brokerage\nclients in CIB, CCB and AWM\nthat are collateralized by\nassets maintained in the\nclients\u2019 brokerage accounts\n(e.g., cash on deposit, and\nliquid and readily marketable\ndebt or equity securities).\nBecause of this\ncollateralization, no\nallowance for credit losses is\ngenerally held against these\nreceivables. To manage its\ncredit risk the Firm\nestablishes margin\nrequirements and monitors the\nrequired margin levels on an\nongoing basis, and requires\nclients to deposit additional\ncash or other collateral, or\nto reduce positions, when\nappropriate. These receivables\nare reported within accrued\ninterest and accounts\nreceivable on the Firm\u2019s\nConsolidated balance sheets.\n                                                               \n  Derivative contracts                                         \n                                                               \nDerivatives enable clients and\ncounterparties to manage risk\nincluding credit risk and\nrisks arising from\nfluctuations in interest\nrates, foreign exchange and\nequities and commodities\nprices. The Firm makes markets\nin derivatives in order to\nmeet these needs and uses\nderivatives to manage certain\nrisks associated with net open\nrisk positions from its\nmarket-making activities,\nincluding the counterparty\ncredit risk arising from\nderivative receivables. The\nFirm also uses derivative\ninstruments to manage its own\ncredit risk and other market\nrisk exposure. The nature of\nthe counterparty and the\nsettlement mechanism of the\nderivative affect the credit\nrisk to which the Firm is\nexposed. For OTC derivatives\nthe Firm is exposed to the\ncredit risk of the derivative\ncounterparty. For exchange-\ntraded derivatives (\u201cETD\u201d),\nsuch as futures and options,\nand cleared over-the-counter\n(\u201cOTC-cleared\u201d) derivatives,\nthe Firm can also be exposed\nto the credit risk of the\nrelevant central counterparty\nclearing house (\u201cCCP\u201d). Where\npossible, the Firm seeks to\nmitigate its credit risk\nexposures arising from\nderivative contracts through\nthe use of legally enforceable\nmaster netting arrangements\nand collateral agreements.\n\nThe percentage of the Firm\u2019s\nover-the-counter derivative\ntransactions subject to\ncollateral agreements \u2014\nexcluding foreign exchange\nspot trades, which are not\ntypically covered by\ncollateral agreements due to\ntheir short maturity, and\ncentrally cleared trades that\nare settled daily \u2014 was\napproximately 88% at both\nSeptember 30, 2022, and\nDecember 31, 2021. Refer to\nNote 4 for additional\ninformation on the Firm\u2019s use\nof collateral agreements and\nfor a further discussion of\nderivative contracts,\ncounterparties and settlement\ntypes.\n\nThe fair value of derivative\nreceivables reported on the\nConsolidated balance sheets\nwere $92.5 billion and $57.1\nbillion at September 30, 2022,\nand December 31, 2021,\nrespectively. The increase was\nprimarily driven by higher\nforeign exchange and commodity\nderivative receivables as a\nresult of market movements.\nDerivative receivables\nrepresent the fair value of\nthe derivative contracts after\ngiving effect to legally\nenforceable master netting\nagreements and the related\ncash collateral held by the\nFirm.\n\nIn addition, the Firm held\nliquid securities and other\ncash collateral that may be\nused as security when the fair\nvalue of the client\u2019s exposure\nis in the Firm\u2019s favor. For\nthese purposes, the definition\nof liquid securities is\nconsistent with the definition\nof high quality liquid assets\nas defined in the LCR rule.\n\nIn management\u2019s view, the\nappropriate measure of current\ncredit risk should also take\ninto consideration other\ncollateral, which generally\nrepresents securities that do\nnot qualify as high quality\nliquid assets under the LCR\nrule. The benefits of these\nadditional collateral amounts\nfor each counterparty are\nsubject to a legally\nenforceable master netting\nagreement and limited to the\nnet amount of the derivative\nreceivables for each\ncounterparty.\n\nThe Firm also holds additional\ncollateral (primarily cash, G7\ngovernment securities, other\nliquid government agency and\nguaranteed securities, and\ncorporate debt and equity\nsecurities) delivered by\nclients at the initiation of\ntransactions, as well as\ncollateral related to\ncontracts that have a non-\ndaily call frequency and\ncollateral that the Firm has\nagreed to return but has not\nyet settled as of the\nreporting date. Although this\ncollateral does not reduce the\nbalances and is not included\nin the tables below, it is\navailable as security against\npotential exposure that could\narise should the fair value of\nthe client\u2019s derivative\ncontracts move in the Firm\u2019s\nfavor.

Discussion of changes\nin the allowance The allowance\nfor credit losses as of\nSeptember 30, 2022 was $20.8\nbillion, reflecting a net\naddition of $2.1 billion from\nDecember 31, 2021, consisting\nof: $1.9 billion in wholesale\nand $168 million in consumer.\nThe net addition to the\nwholesale allowance resulted\nfrom: \u2022 loan growth\npredominantly in CB and CIB,\nand \u2022 changes to the Firm's\nmacroeconomic forecast\nreflecting \u2013 updates to the\nFirm's macroeconomic scenarios\nincluding an increasing\nforecasted unemployment rate\nand deterioration in the\nequity market indices, and \u2013\nthe impact of the increased\nweight placed on the adverse\nscenarios beginning in the\nfirst quarter of 2022, due to\nthe effects associated with\nhigher inflation, changes in\nmonetary policy, and\ngeopolitical risks, including\nthe war in Ukraine. The\nincrease in the consumer\nallowance was driven by Card,\nreflecting a net addition to\nthe allowance for loan losses\nresulting from higher\noutstanding balances\npredominantly offset by a\nreduction related to a\ndecrease in uncertainty\nassociated with borrower\nbehavior as the effects of the\npandemic gradually recede. The\nFirm's allowance for credit\nlosses is estimated using a\nweighted average of five\ninternally developed\nmacroeconomic scenarios. The\nadverse scenarios incorporate\nmore punitive macroeconomic\nfactors than the central case\nassumptions provided in the\ntable below, resulting in a\nweighted average U.S.\nunemployment rate peaking at\n5.0% in the third quarter of\n2023, and a 1.6% lower U.S.\nreal GDP exiting the fourth\nquarter of 2023.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s central case\nassumptions reflected U.S.\nunemployment rates and U.S.\nreal GDP as follows:\n                                                               \n                      Assumptions at                           \n                      September  30,                           \n                                2022                           \n                                4Q22       2Q23       4Q23     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S.                                                         \n  unemployment                   3.8  %     3.9  %     3.9  %  \n  rate(a)                                                      \n  YoY growth in                                                \n  U.S. real                        \u2014  %     1.4  %     1.2  %  \n  GDP(b)                                                       \n                      Assumptions at                           \n                        December 31,                           \n                                2021                           \n                                2Q22       4Q22       2Q23     \n  U.S.                                                         \n  unemployment                   4.2  %     4.0  %     3.9  %  \n  rate(a)                                                      \n  YoY growth in                                                \n  U.S. real                      3.1  %     2.8  %     2.1  %  \n  GDP(b)                                                       \n                                                               \n(a) Reflects quarterly average\nof forecasted U.S.\nunemployment rate.

The investment\nsecurities portfolio is\npredominantly held by Treasury\nand CIO in connection with the\nFirm\u2019s balance sheet and\nasset-liability management\nobjectives. Principal\ninvestments are predominantly\nprivately-held financial\ninstruments and are managed in\nthe LOBs and Corporate.\nInvestments are typically\nintended to be held over\nextended periods and,\naccordingly, the Firm has no\nexpectation for short-term\nrealized gains with respect to\nthese investments. Investment\nsecurities risk Investment\nsecurities risk includes the\nexposure associated with a\ndefault in the payment of\nprincipal and interest. This\nrisk is mitigated given that\nthe investment securities\nportfolio held by Treasury and\nCIO predominantly consists of\nhigh-quality securities. At\nSeptember 30, 2022, the\nTreasury and CIO investment\nsecurities portfolio, net of\nallowance for credit losses,\nwas $616.5 billion, and the\naverage credit rating of the\nsecurities comprising the\nportfolio was AA+ (based upon\nexternal ratings where\navailable, and where not\navailable, based primarily\nupon internal risk ratings).\nRefer to Corporate segment\nresults on pages 42-43 and\nNote 9 for further information\non the investment securities\nportfolio and internal risk\nratings. Refer to Liquidity\nRisk Management on pages 51-56\nfor further information on\nrelated liquidity risk. Refer\nto Market Risk Management on\npages 77-81 for further\ninformation on the market risk\ninherent in the portfolio.\n\nPrincipal investment risk\nPrincipal investments are\ntypically privately-held\nfinancial instruments\nrepresenting ownership\ninterests or other forms of\njunior capital. In general,\nprincipal investments include\ntax-oriented investments and\ninvestments made to enhance or\naccelerate the Firm\u2019s business\nstrategies and exclude those\nthat are consolidated on the\nFirm's balance sheets. These\ninvestments are made by\ndedicated investing businesses\nor as part of a broader\nbusiness strategy.

The related hedges\nwere also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now\nreflected in other sensitivity-based measures.\n\n(c) For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the effects of\nnickel price increases and the associated volatility in the\nnickel market resulted in elevated average and maximum Credit\nPortfolio VaR which remained elevated for the period ended June\n30, 2022. For the three months ended September 30, 2022,\naverage and maximum Credit Portfolio VaR decreased driven by a\nreduction in nickel-related exposure when compared to the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2022.\n\n(d) The decrease in Corporate and other LOB VaR was driven by\nlower market values for a legacy private equity position which\nis publicly traded.\n\n(e) The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have\noccurred on different trading days than the components and\nconsequently diversification benefit is not meaningful.\n                                                               \n   Quarter over quarter results                                \n                                                               \nAverage total VaR was flat for\nthe three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 when\ncompared with June 30, 2022,\nreflecting increased market\nvolatility impacting Fixed\nincome, offset by risk\nreductions within CIB and\nCredit Portfolio VaR.\n                                                               \n   Year over year results                                      \n                                                               \nAverage total VaR increased by\n$18 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30,\n2022, compared with the same\nperiod in the prior year.

The\ngains and losses depicted in the chart below do not reflect the\nFirm\u2019s reported revenue as they exclude select components of\ntotal net revenue, such as those associated with the execution\nof new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and\nintraday risk management activities), fees, commissions,\ncertain valuation adjustments and net interest income. These\nexcluded components of total net revenue may more than offset\nthe backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The\ndefinition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent\nwith the requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital\nrules.\n\nA backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss\nexceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior day. Under\nthe Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current\nchanges in market values are consistent with the historical\nchanges used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur\nVaR backtesting exceptions on average five times every 100\ntrading days. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed\ncan differ from the statistically expected number of\nbacktesting exceptions if the current level of market\nvolatility is materially different from the level of market\nvolatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the\nVaR calculation.\n\nFor the 12 months ended September 30, 2022, the Firm posted\nbacktesting gains on 137 of the 261 days, and observed 25 VaR\nbacktesting exceptions due to market volatility that was\nmaterially higher than the levels realized in the historical\ndata used for the VaR calculation. For the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 33 of\nthe 66 days, and observed seven VaR backtesting exceptions\npredominantly driven by interest rate volatility.\n\nThe following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily\nbacktesting gains and losses for the trailing 12 months and\nthree months ended September 30, 2022. The daily backtesting\nlosses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding daily\nRisk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses\nare shown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals.\nBacktesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that\nare greater than one hundred percent. The results in the chart\nbelow differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the\nMarket Risk section of the Firm\u2019s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory\nCapital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR\napplied to the Firm\u2019s covered positions.\n      Distribution of Daily Backtesting Gains and Losses       \n                                                               \n                              79                               \n                                                               \n  Earnings-at-risk                                             \n                                                               \nThe effect of interest rate\nexposure on the Firm\u2019s\nreported net income is\nimportant as interest rate\nrisk represents one of the\nFirm\u2019s significant market\nrisks. Interest rate risk\narises not only from trading\nactivities but also from the\nFirm\u2019s traditional banking\nactivities, which include\nextension of loans and credit\nfacilities, taking deposits,\nissuing debt and the\ninvestment securities\nportfolio.

These scenarios\ninclude a parallel shift\ninvolving changes to both\nshort-term and long-term rates\nby an equal amount; a steeper\nyield curve involving holding\nshort-term rates constant and\nincreasing long-term rates;\nand a flatter yield curve\ninvolving increasing short-\nterm rates and holding long-\nterm rates constant or holding\nshort-term rates constant and\ndecreasing long-term rates.\nThese scenarios consider many\ndifferent factors, including:\n\u2022 The impact on exposures as a\nresult of instantaneous\nchanges in interest rates from\nbaseline rates. \u2022 Forecasted\nbalance sheet, as well as\nmodeled prepayment and\nreinvestment behavior, but\nexcluding assumptions about\nactions that could be taken by\nthe Firm or its clients and\ncustomers in response to any\nsuch instantaneous rate\nchanges. Mortgage prepayment\nassumptions are based on the\ninterest rates used in the\nscenarios compared with\nunderlying contractual rates,\nthe time since origination,\nand other factors which are\nupdated periodically based on\nhistorical experience. Deposit\nforecasts used in the baseline\nand scenarios include certain\nassumptions relating to the\nreversal of Quantitative\nEasing. \u2022 The pricing\nsensitivity of deposits, known\nas deposit betas, represent\nthe amount by which deposit\nrates paid could change upon a\ngiven change in market\ninterest rates. The deposit\nrates paid in these scenarios\ndiffer from actual deposit\nrates paid, due to repricing\nlags and other factors.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s earnings-at-risk\nscenarios are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in\nresponse to changes in the\ncomposition of the Firm\u2019s\nbalance sheet, changes in\nmarket conditions,\nimprovements in the Firm\u2019s\nsimulation and other factors.\nWhile a relevant measure of\nthe Firm\u2019s interest rate\nexposure, the earnings-at-risk\nanalysis does not represent a\nforecast of the Firm\u2019s net\ninterest income (Refer to\nOutlook on page 8 for\nadditional information).

Refer to Note 2 for additional information.\n\n(b) In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's\ninternal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA\nrelated to certain counterparties was removed from Credit\nPortfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit spreads for\nthose counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges\nwere also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now\nreflected in other sensitivity-based measures.\n\n(c) Impact recognized through net revenue.\n\n(d) Impact recognized through noninterest expense.\n\n(e) Impact recognized through OCI.\n                              81                               \n                           \n  COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT  \n                           \nThe Firm, through its LOBs and\nCorporate, may be exposed to\ncountry risk resulting from\nfinancial, economic, political\nor other significant\ndevelopments which adversely\naffect the value of the Firm\u2019s\nexposures related to a\nparticular country or set of\ncountries. The Country Risk\nManagement group actively\nmonitors the various\nportfolios which may be\nimpacted by these developments\nand measures the extent to\nwhich the Firm\u2019s exposures are\ndiversified given the Firm\u2019s\nstrategy and risk tolerance\nrelative to a country.\n\nRefer to pages 141-142 of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2021 Form\n10-K for a further discussion\nof the Firm\u2019s country risk\nmanagement.\n                                                               \n  Sources and measurement                                      \n                                                               \nThe Firm is exposed to country\nrisk through its lending and\ndeposits, investing, and\nmarket-making activities,\nwhether cross-border or\nlocally funded. Country\nexposure includes activity\nwith both government and\nprivate-sector entities in a\ncountry.\n\nUnder the Firm\u2019s internal\ncountry risk management\napproach, attribution of\nexposure to an individual\ncountry is based on the\ncountry where the largest\nproportion of the assets of\nthe counterparty, issuer,\nobligor or guarantor are\nlocated or where the largest\nproportion of its revenue is\nderived, which may be\ndifferent than the domicile\n(i.e. legal residence) or\ncountry of incorporation.\n\nIndividual country exposures\nreflect an aggregation of the\nFirm\u2019s risk to an immediate\ndefault, with zero recovery,\nof the counterparties,\nissuers, obligors or\nguarantors attributed to that\ncountry. Activities which\nresult in contingent or\nindirect exposure to a country\nare not included in the\ncountry exposure measure (for\nexample, providing clearing\nservices or secondary exposure\nto collateral on securities\nfinancing receivables).\n\nAssumptions are sometimes\nrequired in determining the\nmeasurement and allocation of\ncountry exposure, particularly\nin the case of certain non-\nlinear or index products, or\nwhere the nature of the\ncounterparty, issuer, obligor\nor guarantor is not suitable\nfor attribution to an\nindividual country. The use of\ndifferent measurement\napproaches or assumptions\ncould affect the amount of\nreported country exposure.\n\nUnder the Firm\u2019s internal\ncountry risk measurement\nframework:\n\n\u2022 Lending exposures are\nmeasured at the total\ncommitted amount (funded and\nunfunded), net of the\nallowance for credit losses\nand eligible cash and\nmarketable securities\ncollateral received\n\n\u2022 Deposits are measured as the\ncash balances placed with\ncentral banks, commercial\nbanks, and other financial\ninstitutions\n\n\u2022 Securities financing\nexposures are measured at\ntheir receivable balance, net\nof eligible collateral\nreceived\n\n\u2022 Debt and equity securities\nare measured at the fair value\nof all positions, including\nboth long and short positions\n\n\u2022 Counterparty exposure on\nderivative receivables is\nmeasured at the derivative\u2019s\nfair value, net of the fair\nvalue of the eligible\ncollateral received\n\n\u2022 Credit derivatives exposure\nis measured at the net\nnotional amount of protection\npurchased or sold for the same\nunderlying reference entity,\ninclusive of the fair value of\nthe derivative receivable or\npayable; reflecting the manner\nin which the Firm manages\nthese exposures\n\nThe Firm\u2019s internal country\nrisk reporting differs from\nthe reporting provided under\nthe FFIEC bank regulatory\nrequirements.\n                              82                               \nRisk Reporting The following table presents the Firm\u2019s top 20\nexposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of September 30,\n2022 and their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2021.\nThe selection of countries represents the Firm\u2019s largest total\nexposures by individual country, based on the Firm\u2019s internal\ncountry risk management approach, and does not represent the\nFirm\u2019s view of any existing or potentially adverse credit\nconditions. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to\nperiod due to client activity and market flows. The increase in\nexposure to Germany and the decrease in exposure to the U.K.\nwere primarily due to changes in cash placements with the\ncentral banks of those countries driven by balance sheet and\nliquidity management activities. The decrease in exposure to\nAustralia was largely driven by a reduction in cash placed with\nthe central bank of Australia, due to client-driven market-\nmaking activities and lower client cash deposits following\nrecent interest rate increases. As of September 30, 2022,\nexposure to Russia was approximately $600 million. This amount\nexcludes certain client deposits placed at depository\ninstitutions.\n                                                               \n  \u2026                                                            \n  \u2026                                                            \n  \u2026                                                            \n  \u2026                                                            \n  \u2026                                                            \n  \u2026                                                            \n  \u2026    S\u2026                                        D\u2026            \n  \u2026    3\u2026                                        3\u2026            \n  \u2026    2\u2026                                        2\u2026            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                L\u2026       T\u2026                T\u2026             To\u2026  \n                a\u2026       a\u2026       O\u2026       e\u2026             ex\u2026  \n                d\u2026       i\u2026                                    \n  \u2026          $  9\u2026    $  5\u2026    $  0\u2026    $  1\u2026          $  61\u2026  \n  \u2026             6\u2026       9\u2026       1\u2026       7\u2026             96\u2026  \n  \u2026                                                            \n  \u2026             3\u2026       8\u2026       0\u2026       4\u2026             45\u2026  \n  \u2026             1\u2026       4\u2026        \u2014       2\u2026             39\u2026  \n  \u2026             1\u2026       2\u2026       4\u2026       1\u2026             14\u2026  \n  \u2026             1\u2026       1\u2026       2\u2026       1\u2026             20\u2026  \n  \u2026             7\u2026       8\u2026        \u2014       1\u2026             12\u2026  \n  \u2026             1\u2026       2\u2026       0\u2026       1\u2026             16\u2026  \n  \u2026             9\u2026       5\u2026       0\u2026       1\u2026             18\u2026  \n  \u2026             6\u2026       3\u2026       0\u2026       1\u2026             12\u2026  \n  \u2026             4\u2026       4\u2026       0\u2026       9\u2026             8.7  \n  \u2026                                                            \n  \u2026             8\u2026       0\u2026        \u2014       9\u2026             10\u2026  \n  \u2026             5\u2026       2\u2026       0\u2026       8\u2026             14\u2026  \n  \u2026             5\u2026       2\u2026        \u2014       8\u2026             9.1  \n  \u2026                                                            \n  \u2026             6\u2026       1\u2026        \u2014       7\u2026             6.8  \n  \u2026             4\u2026       1\u2026        \u2014       6\u2026             11\u2026  \n  \u2026             6\u2026       -\u2026       0\u2026       6\u2026             6.8  \n  \u2026             4\u2026       0\u2026       0\u2026       5\u2026             2.7  \n  \u2026             4\u2026       0\u2026        \u2014       4\u2026             4.9  \n  \u2026                                                            \n  \u2026             2\u2026       1\u2026        \u2014       3\u2026             5.9  \n  \u2026                                                            \n                                                               \n(a) Country exposures\npresented in the table reflect\n88% of total Firmwide non-U.S.\nexposure, where exposure is\nattributed to an individual\ncountry, at both September 30,\n2022 and December 31, 2021,\nrespectively.

Operational risk is\ninherent in the Firm\u2019s\nactivities and can manifest\nitself in various ways,\nincluding fraudulent acts,\nbusiness disruptions\n(including those caused by\nextraordinary events beyond\nthe Firm's control),\ncyberattacks, inappropriate\nemployee behavior, failure to\ncomply with applicable laws,\nrules and regulations or\nfailure of vendors or other\nthird party providers to\nperform in accordance with\ntheir agreements. Operational\nRisk Management attempts to\nmanage operational risk at\nappropriate levels in light of\nthe Firm\u2019s financial position,\nthe characteristics of its\nbusinesses, and the markets\nand regulatory environments in\nwhich it operates. Refer to\nOperational Risk Management on\npages 143-149 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K for a\ndiscussion of the Firm\u2019s\nOperational Risk Management.\nDetails on other select\nexamples of operational risks\nare provided below.\n\nIn response to the war in\nUkraine, numerous sanctions\nhave been imposed on Russia\nand Russia-associated entities\nand individuals by various\ngovernments around the world,\nincluding the authorities in\nthe U.S., the U.K. and the EU.\nThese sanctions are complex\nand continue to evolve. The\nFirm continues to face\nincreased operational risk\nassociated with interpreting\nand maintaining these complex\ncompliance programs. To manage\nthis increased risk, the Firm\nimplemented additional\ncontrols reasonably designed\nto mitigate the risk of non-\ncompliance and to prevent\ndealing with sanctioned\npersons or in property subject\nto sanctions, as well as to\nblock or restrict payments as\nrequired by the applicable\nregulations.\n\nBusiness and technology\nresiliency risk\n\nDisruptions can occur due to\nforces beyond the Firm\u2019s\ncontrol such as the spread of\ninfectious diseases or\npandemics, severe weather,\npower or telecommunications\nloss, failure of a third party\nto provide expected services,\ncyberattacks and terrorism.\nThe Firmwide Business\nResiliency Program is designed\nto enable the Firm to prepare\nfor, adapt to, withstand and\nrecover from business\ndisruptions including\noccurrence of an extraordinary\nevent beyond its control that\nmay impact critical business\nfunctions and supporting\nassets (i.e., staff,\ntechnology, facilities and\nthird parties). The program\nincludes governance, awareness\ntraining, planning and testing\nof recovery strategies, as\nwell as strategic and tactical\ninitiatives to identify,\nassess, and manage business\ninterruption and public safety\nrisks.\n\nCybersecurity Risk\n\nThe Firm continues to face\nincreased risk of cyber\nattacks due to potential\nretaliation for the sanctions\nimposed as a result of the war\nin Ukraine. The Firm\nimplemented additional\nprecautionary measures and\ncontrols reasonably designed\nto address this increased\nrisk, such as enhanced threat\nmonitoring. There can be no\nassurance that the measures\ntaken by the Firm to protect\nagainst cybersecurity breaches\nwill provide absolute security\nagainst cyber attacks.\n                              84                               \n                                                  \n  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM  \n                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s accounting\npolicies and use of estimates\nare integral to understanding\nits reported results. The\nFirm\u2019s most complex accounting\nestimates require management\u2019s\njudgment to ascertain the\nappropriate carrying value of\nassets and liabilities. The\nFirm has established policies\nand control procedures\nintended to ensure that\nestimation methods, including\nany judgments made as part of\nsuch methods, are well-\ncontrolled, independently\nreviewed and applied\nconsistently from period to\nperiod. The methods used and\njudgments made reflect, among\nother factors, the nature of\nthe assets or liabilities and\nthe related business and risk\nmanagement strategies, which\nmay vary across the Firm\u2019s\nbusinesses and portfolios. In\naddition, the policies and\nprocedures are intended to\nensure that the process for\nchanging methodologies occurs\nin an appropriate manner. The\nFirm believes its estimates\nfor determining the carrying\nvalue of its assets and\nliabilities are appropriate.\nThe following is a brief\ndescription of the Firm\u2019s\ncritical accounting estimates\ninvolving significant\njudgments.\n                                                               \n  Allowance for credit losses                                  \n                                                               \nThe Firm\u2019s allowance for\ncredit losses represents\nmanagement\u2019s estimate of\nexpected credit losses over\nthe remaining expected life of\nthe Firm\u2019s financial assets\nmeasured at amortized cost and\ncertain off-balance sheet\nlending-related commitments.\nThe allowance for credit\nlosses comprises:\n\n\u2022 The allowance for loan\nlosses, which covers the\nFirm\u2019s retained loan\nportfolios (scored and risk-\nrated),\n\n\u2022 The allowance for lending-\nrelated commitments, and\n\n\u2022 The allowance for credit\nlosses on investment\nsecurities.\n\nThe allowance for credit\nlosses involves significant\njudgment on a number of\nmatters including development\nand weighting of macroeconomic\nforecasts, incorporation of\nhistorical loss experience,\nassessment of risk\ncharacteristics, assignment of\nrisk ratings, valuation of\ncollateral, and the\ndetermination of remaining\nexpected life. Refer to Note\n10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan\nChase's 2021 Form 10-K for\nfurther information on these\njudgments as well as the\nFirm\u2019s policies and\nmethodologies used to\ndetermine the Firm\u2019s allowance\nfor credit losses; and refer\nto Allowance for credit losses\non pages 73-75 and Note 12 of\nthis Form 10-Q for further\ninformation.\n\nOne of the most significant\njudgments involved in\nestimating the Firm\u2019s\nallowance for credit losses\nrelates to the macroeconomic\nforecasts used to estimate\ncredit losses over the eight-\nquarter forecast period within\nthe Firm\u2019s methodology. The\neight-quarter forecast\nincorporates hundreds of MEVs\nthat are relevant for\nexposures across the Firm,\nwith modeled credit losses\nbeing driven primarily by a\nsubset of less than twenty\nvariables. The specific\nvariables that have the\ngreatest effect on the modeled\nlosses of each portfolio vary\nby portfolio and geography.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the consumer\nportfolio include U.S.\nunemployment, HPI and U.S.\nreal GDP.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the wholesale\nportfolio include U.S. real\nGDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S.\nequity prices, corporate\ncredit spreads, oil prices,\ncommercial real estate prices\nand HPI.\n\nChanges in the Firm\u2019s\nassumptions and forecasts of\neconomic conditions could\nsignificantly affect its\nestimate of expected credit\nlosses in the portfolio at the\nbalance sheet date or lead to\nsignificant changes in the\nestimate from one reporting\nperiod to the next.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate\nhow potential changes in any\none factor or input might\naffect the overall allowance\nfor credit losses because\nmanagement considers a wide\nvariety of factors and inputs\nin estimating the allowance\nfor credit losses. Changes in\nthe factors and inputs\nconsidered may not occur at\nthe same rate and may not be\nconsistent across all\ngeographies or product types,\nand changes in factors and\ninputs may be directionally\ninconsistent, such that\nimprovement in one factor or\ninput may offset deterioration\nin others.\n\nTo consider the impact of a\nhypothetical alternate\nmacroeconomic forecast, the\nFirm compared the modeled\ncredit losses determined using\nits central and relative\nadverse macroeconomic\nscenarios, which are two of\nthe five scenarios considered\nin estimating the allowances\nfor loan losses and lending-\nrelated commitments. The\ncentral and relative adverse\nscenarios each included a full\nsuite of MEVs, but differed in\nthe levels, paths and\npeaks/troughs of those\nvariables over the eight-\nquarter forecast period.\n\nFor example, compared to the\nFirm\u2019s central scenario shown\non page 73 and in Note 12, the\nFirm\u2019s relative adverse\nscenario assumes an elevated\nU.S. unemployment rate,\naveraging approximately 2.2%\nhigher\n\nover the eight-quarter\nforecast, with a peak\ndifference of\n\n3.0% in the third quarter of\n2023; lower\n\nU.S. real GDP with a slower\nrecovery, remaining\napproximately 4.2% lower at\nthe end of the eight-quarter\nforecast, with a peak\ndifference of approximately\n4.9% in the third quarter of\n2023; and lower national HPI\nwith a peak difference of\napproximately 13.6% in the\nsecond quarter of 2024.\n\nThis analysis is not intended\nto estimate expected future\nchanges in the allowance for\ncredit losses, for a number of\nreasons, including:\n\n\u2022 The allowance as of\nSeptember 30, 2022, reflects\ncredit losses beyond those\nestimated under the central\nscenario due to the weight\nplaced on the adverse\nscenarios.\n\n\u2022 The impacts of changes in\nmany MEVs are both\ninterrelated and nonlinear, so\nthe results of this analysis\ncannot be simply extrapolated\nfor more severe changes in\nmacroeconomic variables.\n                              85                               \n\u2022 Expectations of future\nchanges in portfolio\ncomposition and borrower\nbehavior can significantly\naffect the allowance for\ncredit losses. To demonstrate\nthe sensitivity of credit loss\nestimates to macroeconomic\nforecasts as of September 30,\n2022, the Firm compared the\nmodeled estimates under its\nrelative adverse scenario to\nits central scenario. Without\nconsidering offsetting or\ncorrelated effects in other\nqualitative components of the\nFirm\u2019s allowance for credit\nlosses, the comparison between\nthese two scenarios for the\nexposures below reflect the\nfollowing differences: \u2022 An\nincrease of approximately $500\nmillion for residential real\nestate loans and lending-\nrelated commitments \u2022 An\nincrease of approximately $2.5\nbillion for credit card loans\n\u2022 An increase of approximately\n$4.2 billion for wholesale\nloans and lending-related\ncommitments This analysis\nrelates only to the modeled\ncredit loss estimates and is\nnot intended to estimate\nchanges in the overall\nallowance for credit losses as\nit does not reflect any\npotential changes in other\nadjustments to the\nquantitative calculation,\nwhich would also be influenced\nby the judgment management\napplies to the modeled\nlifetime loss estimates to\nreflect the uncertainty and\nimprecision of these modeled\nlifetime loss estimates based\non then-current circumstances\nand conditions. Recognizing\nthat forecasts of\nmacroeconomic conditions are\ninherently uncertain,\nparticularly in light of the\nrecent economic conditions,\nthe Firm believes that its\nprocess to consider the\navailable information and\nassociated risks and\nuncertainties is appropriately\ngoverned and that its\nestimates of expected credit\nlosses were reasonable and\nappropriate for the period\nended September 30, 2022.\n\nFair value JPMorgan Chase\ncarries a portion of its\nassets and liabilities at fair\nvalue.

billion of\nderivative receivables\nclassified as level 3 does not\nreflect the netting adjustment\nas such netting is not\nrelevant to a presentation\nbased on the transparency of\ninputs to the valuation of an\nasset. The level 3 balances\nwould be reduced if netting\nwere applied, including the\nnetting benefit associated\nwith cash collateral.\n                              86                               \nValuation\nEstimating fair value requires\nthe application of judgment.\nThe type and level of judgment\nrequired is largely dependent\non the amount of observable\nmarket information available\nto the Firm. For instruments\nvalued using internally\ndeveloped valuation models and\nother valuation techniques\nthat use significant\nunobservable inputs and are\ntherefore classified within\nlevel 3 of the fair value\nhierarchy, judgments used to\nestimate fair value are more\nsignificant than those\nrequired when estimating the\nfair value of instruments\nclassified within levels 1 and\n2.\n\nIn arriving at an estimate of\nfair value for an instrument\nwithin level 3, management\nmust first determine the\nappropriate valuation model or\nother valuation technique to\nuse. Second, the lack of\nobservability of certain\nsignificant inputs requires\nmanagement to assess relevant\nempirical data in deriving\nvaluation inputs including,\nfor example, transaction\ndetails, yield curves,\ninterest rates, prepayment\nspeed, default rates,\nvolatilities, correlations,\nprices (such as commodity,\nequity or debt prices),\nvaluations of comparable\ninstruments, foreign exchange\nrates and credit curves. Refer\nto Note 2 for a further\ndiscussion of the valuation of\nlevel 3 instruments, including\nunobservable inputs used.\n\nFor instruments classified in\nlevels 2 and 3, management\njudgment must be applied to\nassess the appropriate level\nof valuation adjustments to\nreflect counterparty credit\nquality, the Firm\u2019s\ncreditworthiness, market\nfunding rates, liquidity\nconsiderations, unobservable\nparameters, and for portfolios\nthat meet specified criteria,\nthe size of the net open risk\nposition. The judgments made\nare typically affected by the\ntype of product and its\nspecific contractual terms,\nand the level of liquidity for\nthe product or within the\nmarket as a whole. In periods\nof heightened market\nvolatility and uncertainty\njudgments are further affected\nby the wider variation of\nreasonable valuation\nestimates, particularly for\npositions that are less\nliquid. Refer to Note 2 for a\nfurther discussion of\nvaluation adjustments applied\nby the Firm.\n\nImprecision in estimating\nunobservable market inputs or\nother factors can affect the\namount of gain or loss\nrecorded for a particular\nposition. Furthermore, while\nthe Firm believes its\nvaluation methods are\nappropriate and consistent\nwith those of other market\nparticipants, the methods and\nassumptions used reflect\nmanagement judgment and may\nvary across the Firm\u2019s\nbusinesses and portfolios.\n\nThe Firm uses various\nmethodologies and assumptions\nin the determination of fair\nvalue.

the\n\u201cFirm\u201d), a financial holding\ncompany incorporated under\nDelaware law in 1968, is a\nleading financial services\nfirm based in the U.S., with\noperations worldwide. The Firm\nis a leader in investment\nbanking, financial services\nfor consumers and small\nbusinesses, commercial\nbanking, financial transaction\nprocessing and asset\nmanagement. Refer to Note 25\nfor a further discussion of\nthe Firm\u2019s business segments.\nThe accounting and financial\nreporting policies of JPMorgan\nChase and its subsidiaries\nconform to U.S. GAAP.\nAdditionally, where\napplicable, the policies\nconform to the accounting and\nreporting guidelines\nprescribed by regulatory\nauthorities. The unaudited\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements prepared in\nconformity with U.S. GAAP\nrequire management to make\nestimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of\nassets, liabilities, revenue\nand expense, and the\ndisclosures of contingent\nassets and liabilities. Actual\nresults could be different\nfrom these estimates. In the\nopinion of management, all\nnormal, recurring adjustments\nhave been included such that\nthis interim financial\ninformation is fairly stated.\nThese unaudited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements should be\nread in conjunction with the\naudited Consolidated Financial\nStatements, and related notes\nthereto, included in JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K.\nCertain amounts reported in\nprior periods have been\nreclassified to conform with\nthe current presentation.\n\nConsolidation The Consolidated\nFinancial Statements include\nthe accounts of JPMorgan Chase\nand other entities in which\nthe Firm has a controlling\nfinancial interest. All\nmaterial intercompany balances\nand transactions have been\neliminated. Assets held for\nclients in an agency or\nfiduciary capacity by the Firm\nare not assets of JPMorgan\nChase and are not included on\nthe Consolidated balance\nsheets. The Firm determines\nwhether it has a controlling\nfinancial interest in an\nentity by first evaluating\nwhether the entity is a voting\ninterest entity or a variable\ninterest entity. Refer to\nNotes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K for a\nfurther description of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s accounting\npolicies regarding\nconsolidation. Offsetting\nassets and liabilities\n\nU.S. GAAP permits entities to\npresent derivative receivables\nand derivative payables with\nthe same counterparty and the\nrelated cash collateral\nreceivables and payables on a\nnet basis on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets when a legally\nenforceable master netting\nagreement exists. U.S. GAAP\nalso permits securities\nfinancing activities to be\npresented on a net basis when\nspecified conditions are met,\nincluding the existence of a\nlegally enforceable master\nnetting agreement. The Firm\nhas elected to net such\nbalances where it has\ndetermined that the specified\nconditions are met. Refer to\nNote 1 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n2021 Form 10-K for further\ninformation on offsetting\nassets and liabilities.\n                              95                               \n

and December 31, 2021, included\ntotal U.S. GSE obligations of $ 90.1billion and $ 73.9billion,\nrespectively, which were mortgage-related.\n\n(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted\nfor at the lower of cost or net realizable value. \u201cNet\nrealizable value\u201d is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not\nexceeding fair value less costs to sell (\u201ctransaction costs\u201d).\nTransaction costs for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities\ninventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the\nvalue of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value\napproximates fair value for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities\ninventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when\nnet realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of\nphysical commodities approximates fair value, because under\nfair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for\nchanges in fair value. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion\nof the Firm\u2019s hedge accounting relationships. To provide\nconsistent fair value disclosure information, all physical\ncommodities inventories have been included in each period\npresented.\n                              98                               \n(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long\npositions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not\nyet purchased (short positions).\n\n(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using\nthe net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a\npractical expedient are not required to be classified in the\nfair value hierarchy. At September 30, 2022, and December 31,\n2021, the fair values of these investments, which include\ncertain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and\nother funds, were $ 882million and $ 801million, respectively.\nIncluded in these balances at September 30, 2022, and December\n31, 2021, were trading assets of $ 41million and $ 51million,\nrespectively, and other assets of $ 841million and $\n750million, respectively.\n\n(e) At September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, included $\n11.4billion and $ 26.2billion, respectively, of residential\nfirst-lien mortgages, and $ 7.5billion and $ 8.2billion,\nrespectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential\nmortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated\nwith the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of\n$ 3.4billion and $ 13.6billion, respectively.\n\n(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net\nderivative receivables and derivative payables and the related\ncash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be\nreduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit\nassociated with cash collateral.\n\nLevel 3 valuations\n\nRefer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K for further\ninformation on the Firm\u2019s valuation process and a detailed\ndiscussion of the determination of fair value for individual\nfinancial instruments. The following table presents the Firm\u2019s\nprimary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques\nused to measure the fair value of those financial instruments,\nthe significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for\nthose inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such\ninputs. While the determination to classify an instrument\nwithin level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable\ninputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial\ninstruments typically include observable components (that is,\ncomponents that are actively quoted and can be validated to\nexternal sources) in addition to the unobservable components.\nThe level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the\ntable. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable\ncomponents of level 3 financial instruments using securities\nand derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or\n2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of values presented in\nthe table is representative of the highest and lowest level\ninput used to value the significant groups of instruments\nwithin a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the\nweighted averages of the input values presented in the table\nare calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that\nthe input is being used to value. In the Firm\u2019s view, the input\nrange, weighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect\nthe degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the\nreasonableness of the Firm\u2019s estimates and assumptions. Rather,\nthey reflect the characteristics of the various instruments\nheld by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments\nwithin the range of characteristics. For example, two option\ncontracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and\nvaluation uncertainty, but may have significantly different\nimplied volatility levels because the option contracts have\ndifferent underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input\nrange and weighted average values will therefore vary from\nperiod-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the\ncharacteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each\nbalance sheet date.\n                              99                               \n                                                               \n  L\u2026

Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore,\nthe inputs presented for each valuation technique in the table\nare, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued\nusing the technique as the characteristics of the instruments\ncan differ.\n(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $\n776million, nonagency securities of $ 9million and non-trading\nloans of $ 900million.\n(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $ 11million, trading\nloans of $ 40million and non-trading loans of $ 362million.\n(d) Comprises trading loans of $ 825million and non-trading\nloans of $ 312million.\n(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include\nstructured notes issued by the Firm that are financial\ninstruments that typically contain embedded derivatives. The\nestimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the\nderivative features embedded within the instrument. The\nsignificant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with\nthose presented for derivative receivables.\n(f) Includes equity securities of $ 807million including $\n227million in Other Assets, for which quoted prices are not\nreadily available and the fair value is generally based on\ninternal valuation techniques such as EBITDA multiples and\ncomparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities\nare insignificant both individually and in aggregate.\n(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain\ninstruments. When quoted market prices are not readily\navailable, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal\nvaluation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a\npar value of $ 100.\n(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the\ncurrent equity price.\n(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative\nrelated inputs where arithmetic averages are used.\n                              100                              \nChanges in and ranges of\nunobservable inputs Refer to\nNote 2 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n2021 Form 10-K for a\ndiscussion of the impact on\nfair value of changes in\nunobservable inputs and the\nrelationships between\nunobservable inputs as well as\na description of attributes of\nthe underlying instruments and\nexternal market factors that\naffect the range of inputs\nused in the valuation of the\nFirm\u2019s positions. Changes in\nlevel 3 recurring fair value\nmeasurements The following\ntables include a rollforward\nof the Consolidated balance\nsheets amounts (including\nchanges in fair value) for\nfinancial instruments\nclassified by the Firm within\nlevel 3 of the fair value\nhierarchy for the three and\nnine months ended September\n30, 2022 and 2021. When a\ndetermination is made to\nclassify a financial\ninstrument within level 3, the\ndetermination is based on the\nsignificance of the\nunobservable inputs to the\noverall fair value\nmeasurement. However, level 3\nfinancial instruments\ntypically include, in addition\nto the unobservable or level 3\ncomponents, observable\ncomponents (that is,\ncomponents that are actively\nquoted and can be validated to\nexternal sources);\naccordingly, the gains and\nlosses in the table below\ninclude changes in fair value\ndue in part to observable\nfactors that are part of the\nvaluation methodology. Also,\nthe Firm risk-manages the\nobservable components of level\n3 financial instruments using\nsecurities and derivative\npositions that are classified\nwithin level 1 or 2 of the\nfair value hierarchy; as these\nlevel 1 and level 2 risk\nmanagement instruments are not\nincluded below, the gains or\nlosses in the following tables\ndo not reflect the effect of\nthe Firm\u2019s risk

For\ncertain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of\nthe underlying collateral. Carrying value of the loan takes\ninto account the loan\u2019s allowance for loan losses, which\nrepresents the loan\u2019s expected credit losses over its remaining\nexpected life. The difference between the estimated fair value\nand carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to\nchanges in market interest rates, including credit spreads,\nmarket liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the\nfair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value.\nThe majority of the Firm\u2019s lending-related commitments are not\ncarried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets. The carrying value and the estimated fair value\nof these wholesale lending-related commitments were as follows\nfor the periods indicated.\n                                                               \n                                                               \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                               \n                                                               \n                                                               \n                                                               \n(a) Excludes the current carrying values of the guarantee\nliability and the offsetting asset, each of which is recognized\nat fair value at the inception of the guarantees.\n(b) Includes the wholesale allowance for lending-related\ncommitments.\nThe Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-\nbalance sheet lending-related commitments.

Derivatives contracts\ngenerally require additional collateral to be posted or\nterminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold\nrating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that\ndoes not result in a rating lower than a preexisting\ncorresponding rating provided by another major rating agency\nwill generally not result in additional collateral (except in\ncertain instances in which additional initial margin may be\nrequired upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payments\nrequirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated\nbased upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the\nrating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.\n                                                               \n  Liqu\u2026                                                        \n  impa\u2026                                                        \n  of                                                           \n  down\u2026                                                        \n  trig\u2026                                                        \n  on                                                           \n  OTC                                                          \n  and         Septem\u2026                    Decemb\u2026               \n  OTC-\u2026           30,                        31,               \n  deri\u2026          2022                       2021               \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (in         Single\u2026       Two-n\u2026       Single\u2026       Two-n\u2026  \n  mill\u2026       downgr\u2026       downg\u2026       downgr\u2026       downg\u2026  \n  Amou\u2026                                                        \n  of                                                           \n  addi\u2026                                                        \n  coll\u2026    $      228    $   1,531    $      219    $   1,577  \n  to be                                                        \n  post\u2026                                                        \n  upon                                                         \n  down\u2026                                                        \n  Amou\u2026                                                        \n  requ\u2026                                                        \n  to                                                           \n  sett\u2026                                                        \n  cont\u2026            83        1,070            98          787  \n  with                                                         \n  term\u2026                                                        \n  trig\u2026                                                        \n  upon                                                         \n  down\u2026                                                        \n                                                               \n(a) Includes the additional collateral to be posted for initial\nmargin.\n(b) Amounts represent fair values of derivative payables, and\ndo not reflect collateral posted.\nDerivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the\nunderlying financial asset\n\nIn certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which\nit transfers financial assets but maintains the economic\nexposure to the transferred assets by entering into a\nderivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the\ninitial transfer.

The amount excluded\nat inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the\nlife of the derivative.\n(g) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the\ncurrent presentation.\n                              121                              \nAs of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the following\namounts were recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets\nrelated to certain cumulative fair value hedge basis\nadjustments that are expected to reverse through the income\nstatement in future periods as an adjustment to yield.\n                                                               \n                                  Cum\u2026                         \n                                  amo\u2026                         \n                                    of                         \n                                  fair                         \n                                  val\u2026                         \n                                  hed\u2026                         \n                                  adj\u2026                         \n                                  inc\u2026                         \n                                    in                         \n                                   the                         \n                                  car\u2026                         \n                                  amo\u2026                         \n             Carr\u2026                  of                         \n  Sep\u2026       amou\u2026                hed\u2026                         \n  30,           of                ite\u2026                         \n  2022         the    Acti\u2026       Dis\u2026                         \n  (in        hedg\u2026    hedg\u2026       hed\u2026                         \n  mil\u2026       item\u2026    rela\u2026       rel\u2026       Total             \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Ass\u2026                                                         \n  Inv\u2026                                                         \n  sec\u2026    $  83,8\u2026    -c       $  -6,\u2026    $    489    $  -5,\u2026  \n  -

            \n(a) Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each\nsecurity owned at the end of the period, weighted based on the\namortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers\nthe contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion\nof discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives.\nTaxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The\neffective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and\naccordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from\ntheir contractual or expected maturities as certain securities\nmay be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities,\nthe average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.\n(b) Substantially all of the Firm\u2019s U.S. residential MBS and\ncollateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10years or more,\nbased on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average\nlife, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is\napproximately nine yearsfor agency residential MBS, and six\nyearsfor both agency residential collateralized mortgage\nobligations and nonagency residential collateralized mortgage\nobligations.\n                              134                              \n                                                               \n  Note 10 \u2013 Securities financing activities                    \n                                                               \nRefer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K for a\ndiscussion of accounting policies relating to securities\nfinancing activities.

Refer to Note\n23 for further information regarding assets pledged and\ncollateral received in securities financing agreements. The\ntable below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm\u2019s\nsecurities financing agreements as of September 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate\nlegal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a\ncounterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under\nU.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance\nsheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing\nagreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm\nexchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its\ncounterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the\ncounterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net\nConsolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has\nobtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the\ncounterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along\nwith securities financing balances that do not meet all these\nrelevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the\ntable below as \u201cAmounts not nettable on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets,\u201d and reduces the \u201cNet amounts\u201d presented. Where\na legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the\nsecurities financing balances are presented gross in the \u201cNet\namounts\u201d below. In transactions where the Firm is acting as the\nlender in a securities-for-securities lending agreement and\nreceives securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral,\nthe Firm recognizes the securities received at fair value\nwithin other assets and the obligation to return those\nsecurities within accounts payable and other liabilities on the\nConsolidated balance sheets.\n

period.\n                              140                              \nNonaccrual loans and other credit quality indicators\n\nThe following table provides information on nonaccrual and\nother

ncludes collateral-dependent residential real estate\nloans that are charged down to the fair value of the underlying\ncollateral less costs to sell. The Firm reports, in accordance\nwith regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that\nhave been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not\nreaffirmed by the borrower (\u201cChapter 7 loans\u201d) as collateral-\ndependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency\nstatus. At September 30, 2022, approximately 5% of Chapter 7\nresidential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.\n\n(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance.\nIn accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual\nloans that are considered collateral-dependent have been\ncharged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value\nof their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value\nof the underlying collateral improves subsequent to charge\ndown, the related allowance may be negative.\n\n(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash\nbasis was $ 42million and $ 41million and $ 132million and $\n127million for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n(d) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs\noffered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n(e) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the\nloans are guaranteed by U.S government agencies. Typically the\nprincipal balance of the loans is insured and interest is\nguaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting\nagreed-upon servicing guidelines. At September 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, these balances were no longer accruing\ninterest based on the agreed-upon servicing guidelines. There\nwere noloans that were not guaranteed by U.S. government\nagencies that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing\ninterest at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\n\n(f) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans\ndivided by the estimated current property value. Current\nproperty values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based\non home valuation models using nationally recognized home price\nindex valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the\nextent available and forecasted data where actual data is not\navailable. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home\nequity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as\nunused lines, related to the property.\n\n(g) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower\u2019s most recent\ncredit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a\nquarterly basis.\n\n(h) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in\nLLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO score. These\nloans have been included in a FICO band based on management\u2019s\nestimation of the borrower\u2019s credit quality.\n\n(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.\n\n(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered\nbased on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at\nSeptember 30, 2022.\n\n(k) At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, included\nmortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $\n53million and $ 66million, respectively. These amounts have\nbeen excluded from the geographic regions presented based upon\nthe government guarantee.\n                              141                              \nLoan modifications Modifications of residential real estate\nloans where the Firm grants concessions to borrowers who are\nexperiencing financial difficulty are generally accounted for\nand reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term or other\ninsignificant modifications that are not considered concessions\nare not TDRs. The carrying value of new TDRs was $ 80million\nand $ 116million for the three months ended September 30, 2022\nand 2021, respectively, and $ 313million and $ 674million for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. There were no additional commitments to lend to\nborrowers whose residential real estate loans have been\nmodified in TDRs. Nature and extent of modifications The Firm\u2019s\nproprietary modification programs as well as government\nprograms, including U.S. GSE programs, generally provide\nvarious concessions to financially troubled borrowers\nincluding, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term\nor payment extensions and delays of principal and/or interest\npayments that would otherwise have been required under the\nterms of the original agreement. The following table provides\ninformation about how residential real estate loans were\nmodified in TDRs under the Firm\u2019s loss mitigation programs\ndescribed above during the periods presented.

that\nexperienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for\nwhich the payment default occurred within one yearof the\nmodification. The dollar amounts presented represent the\nbalance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in\nwhich such loans defaulted. For residential real estate loans\nmodified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the\nloan becomes twocontractual payments past due. In the event\nthat a modified loan redefaults, it will generally be\nliquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of\nliquidation transaction.

If the value\nof the underlying collateral improves subsequent to the charge\ndown, the related allowance may be negative.\n\n(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash\nbasis was not material for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 and 2021 .\n\n(d) The geographic regions presented in this table are ordered\nbased on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at\nSeptember 30, 2022.\n\nLoan modifications Certain auto and other loan modifications\nare considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions\nto borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Loans\nwith short-term or other insignificant modifications that are\nnot considered concessions are not TDRs. The impact of these\nmodifications, as well as new TDRs, were not material to the\nFirm for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and\n2021. Additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose loans\nhave been modified in TDRs as of September 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021 were not material.\n                              145                              \nCredit card loan portfolio\n\nThe credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans\noriginated and purchased by the Firm.

financial\ndifficulty. The Firm grants\nconcessions for most of the\ncredit card loans under long-\nterm programs. These\nmodifications involve placing\nthe customer on a fixed\npayment plan, generally for\n60months, and typically\ninclude reducing the interest\nrate on the credit card.\nSubstantially all\nmodifications under the Firm\u2019s\nlong-term programs are\nconsidered to be TDRs. Loans\nwith short-term or other\ninsignificant modifications\nthat are not considered\nconcessions are not TDRs. If\nthe cardholder does not comply\nwith the modified payment\nterms, then the credit card\nloan continues to age and will\nultimately be charged-off in\naccordance with the Firm\u2019s\nstandard charge-off policy. In\nmost cases, the Firm does not\nreinstate the borrower\u2019s line\nof credit.\n\nFinancial effects of\nmodifications and redefaults\n\nThe following table provides\ninformation about the\nfinancial effects of the\nconcessions granted on credit\ncard loans modified in TDRs\nand redefaults for the periods\npresented.

The\nnet addition to the wholesale\nallowance resulted from: \u2022\nloan growth predominantly in\nCB and CIB, and \u2022 changes to\nthe Firm's macroeconomic\nforecast reflecting \u2013 updates\nto the Firm's macroeconomic\nscenarios including an\nincreasing forecasted\nunemployment rate and\ndeterioration in the equity\nmarket indices, and \u2013 the\nimpact of the increased weight\nplaced on the adverse\nscenarios beginning in the\nfirst quarter of 2022, due to\nthe effects associated with\nhigher inflation, changes in\nmonetary policy, and\ngeopolitical risks, including\nthe war in Ukraine. The\nincrease in the consumer\nallowance was driven by Card,\nreflecting a net addition to\nthe allowance for loan losses\nresulting from higher\noutstanding balances\npredominantly offset by a\nreduction related to a\ndecrease in uncertainty\nassociated with borrower\nbehavior as the effects of the\npandemic gradually recede. The\nFirm's allowance for credit\nlosses is estimated using a\nweighted average of five\ninternally developed\nmacroeconomic scenarios. The\nadverse scenarios incorporate\nmore punitive macroeconomic\nfactors than the central case\nassumptions provided in the\ntable below, resulting in a\nweighted average U.S.\nunemployment rate peaking at\n5.0% in the third quarter of\n2023, and a 1.6% lower U.S.\nreal GDP exiting the fourth\nquarter of 2023.\nThe Firm\u2019s central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment\nrates and U.S. real GDP as follows:\n                                                               \n                      Assumptions at                           \n                      September  30,                           \n                                2022                           \n                                4Q22       2Q23       4Q23     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S.                                                         \n  unemployment                   3.8  %     3.9  %     3.9  %  \n  rate(a)                                                      \n  YoY growth in                                                \n  U.S. real                        \u2014  %     1.4  %     1.2  %  \n  GDP(b)                                                       \n                      Assumptions at                           \n                        December 31,                           \n                                2021                           \n                                2Q22       4Q22       2Q23     \n  U.S.                                                         \n  unemployment                   4.2  %     4.0  %     3.9  %  \n  rate(a)                                                      \n  YoY growth in                                                \n  U.S. real                      3.1  %     2.8  %     2.1  %  \n  GDP(b)                                                       \n                                                               \n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment\nrate.\n(b) As of September 30, 2022,\nthe year over year growth in\nU.S. real GDP in the forecast\nhorizon of the central\nscenario is calculated as the\npercent change in U.S. real\nGDP levels from the prior\nyear.

The Firm serves\nas sponsor for all non-\ncustomer TOB transactions.\n                              156                              \nConsolidated VIE assets and liabilities\nThe following table presents information on assets and\nliabilities related to VIEs consolidated by the Firm as of\nSeptember 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021.\n                                                               \n                                           \u2026                   \n                                           \u2026                   \n                                           \u2026                   \n                                           \u2026                   \n                                           \u2026              \u2026    \n                          \u2026                \u2026              \u2026    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                               \n                               $    \u2026           $    3         \n                                    \u2026                \u2026         \n                                    \u2026                5         \n                                    \u2026                \u2026         \n                   \u2026                \u2026                \u2026         \n                               $    \u2026           $    \u2026         \n                                           \u2026                   \n                                           \u2026                   \n                                           \u2026              \u2026    \n                          \u2026                \u2026              \u2026    \n                                           \u2026                   \n                                           \u2026                   \n                                                               \n                               $    \u2026           $    1         \n                                    \u2026                \u2026         \n                                    \u2026                \u2014         \n                                    \u2026                \u2026         \n                   \u2026                \u2026                \u2026         \n                               $    \u2026           $    \u2026         \n                                                               \n(a) Includes residential and commercial mortgage\nsecuritizations.\n(b) Primarily includes purchased supply chain finance\nreceivables and purchased auto loan securitizations in CIB.\n(c) Includes assets classified as cash and other assets on the\nConsolidated balance sheets.\n(d) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program\ntypes above are used to settle the liabilities of those\nentities. The assets and liabilities include third-party assets\nand liabilities of consolidated VIEs and exclude intercompany\nbalances that eliminate in consolidation.\n(e) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued\nby consolidated VIEs are classified in the line item on the\nConsolidated balance sheets titled, \u201cBeneficial interests\nissued by consolidated VIEs\u201d. The holders of these beneficial\ninterests generally do not have recourse to the general credit\nof JPMorgan Chase. Included in beneficial interests in VIE\nassets are long-term beneficial interests of $ 2.1billion and $\n2.6billion at September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021,\nrespectively.\n(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and\nother liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\nVIEs sponsored by third parties\n\nThe Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other\nparties. These include, for example, acting as a derivative\ncounterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter,\nplacement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These\ntransactions are conducted at arm\u2019s-length, and individual\ncredit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE,\ntaking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets.\nWhere the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities\nof the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic\nperformance, or a variable interest that could potentially be\nsignificant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE,\nbut it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated\nbalance sheets in the same manner it would record and report\npositions in respect of any other third-party transaction. Tax\ncredit vehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated\ntax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar\nentities that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and\nother projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A\nthird party is typically the general partner or managing member\nand has control over the significant activities of the tax\ncredit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate\ntax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these\npartnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily\nthrough the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects.\nThe maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments\nand funding commitments, was $ 27.6billion and $ 26.8billion,\nof which $ 10.0billion and $ 9.4billion was unfunded at\nSeptember 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The\nFirm assesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may\nwithhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the\nproject qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K for further information on affordable\nhousing tax credits and Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for more\ninformation on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.\n                              157                              \nCustomer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm may\nprovide various services to customer TOB trusts, including\nremarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In\ncertain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity\nprovider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the\nResidual holder. In those transactions, upon the termination of\nthe vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual\nholders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to\nprotect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the\nunderlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate\ncustomer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to\nmake decisions that significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm\u2019s maximum\nexposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at\nSeptember 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was $ 6.2billion and $\n6.8billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such\nVIEs at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was $\n8.2billion and $ 10.5billion, respectively. Loan\nsecuritizations The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of\nloans, including residential mortgages, credit card\nreceivables, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans.\n\nSecuritization activity\nThe following table provides information related to the Firm\u2019s\nsecuritization activities for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 and 2021, related to assets held in Firm-\nsponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by\nthe Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of\nthe securitization.\n                                                               \n         \u2026                                                     \n         \u2026                                                     \n         \u2026                                                     \n         \u2026                                                     \n         \u2026                                                     \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                                     \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                                     \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                                     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                               \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026                                     \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                                     \n                                                               \n(a) Excludes re-securitization transactions.\n(b) Predominantly includes Level 2 assets.\n(c) The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value\napproximated the proceeds received upon loan sale.\n(d) Represents prime mortgages.

These loans and excess MSRs are\nsold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S.\nGSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit\nenhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into\nsecuritization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines;\nthese loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S.\ngovernment agency.

second quarter. For the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2021, represents estimated\ngoodwill associated with the acquisitions of Nutmeg in\nCorporate, OpenInvest and Campbell Global in AWM and Frank in\nCCB.\n(b) Primarily foreign currency adjustments and, in 2021,\nadjustments to goodwill related to prior period acquisitions.\nGoodwill impairment testing\nGoodwill is tested for\nimpairment during the fourth\nquarter of each fiscal year,\nor more often if events or\ncircumstances, such as adverse\nchanges in the business\nclimate, indicate that there\nmay be an impairment. Refer to\nNote 15 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n2021 Form 10-K for a further\ndiscussion of the Firm\u2019s\ngoodwill impairment testing.\nUnanticipated declines in\nbusiness performance,\nincreases in credit losses,\nincreases in capital\nrequirements, as well as\ndeterioration in economic or\nmarket conditions, adverse\nregulatory or legislative\nchanges or increases in the\nestimated market cost of\nequity, could cause the\nestimated fair values of the\nFirm\u2019s reporting units to\ndecline in the future, which\ncould result in a material\nimpairment charge to earnings\nin a future period related to\nsome portion of the associated\ngoodwill. As of September 30,\n2022, the Firm reviewed\ncurrent economic conditions,\nestimated market cost of\nequity, as well as actual\nbusiness results and\nprojections of business\nperformance. Based on such\nreviews, the Firm has\nconcluded that goodwill was\nnot impaired as of September\n30, 2022, or December 31,\n2021, nor was goodwill written\noff due to impairment during\nthe nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 or 2021.\n                              160                              \nMortgage servicing rights\n\nMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for\nperforming servicing activities for others. The fair value\nconsiders estimated future servicing fees and ancillary\nrevenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and\ngenerally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are\nreceived, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against\ncontractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either\npurchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or\nsecuritization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained.\nRefer to Notes 2 and 15 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K for\na further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk\nmanagement, and the valuation of MSRs.\nThe following table summarizes MSR activity for the three and\nnine months ended September 30,

pays as the servicer (e.g.,\nscheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance), which\nwill generally be reimbursed within a short period of time\nafter the advance from future cash flows from the trust or the\nunderlying loans. The Firm\u2019s credit risk associated with these\nservicer advances is minimal because reimbursement of the\nadvances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors.\nIn addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to\ninvestors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the\nadvance.

The contractual amount of\nthese financial instruments represents the maximum possible\ncredit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon\nthe commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its\nobligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or\nclient subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of\nthe contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have\nhistorically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired\nwithout being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the\ntotal contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the\nFirm\u2019s view, representative of its expected future credit\nexposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of lending-\nrelated commitments and guarantees, and the Firm\u2019s related\naccounting policies. To provide for expected credit losses in\nwholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an\nallowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is\nmaintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information regarding\nthe allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments.\nThe following table summarizes the contractual amounts and\ncarrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial\ninstruments, guarantees and other commitments at September 30,\n2022, and December 31, 2021. The amounts in the table below for\ncredit card, home equity and certain scored business banking\nlending-related commitments represent the total available\ncredit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and\ndoes not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for\nthese products will be utilized at the same time.

Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of credit\nderivatives.\n\nMerchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment networks, the\nFirm, in its role as a merchant acquirer, retains a contingent\nliability for disputed processed credit and debit card\ntransactions that result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a\ndispute is resolved in the cardholder\u2019s favor, Merchant\nServices will (through the cardholder\u2019s issuing bank) credit or\nrefund the amount to the cardholder and will charge back the\ntransaction to the merchant. If Merchant Services is unable to\ncollect the amount from the merchant, Merchant Services will\nbear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the\ncardholder.

The\nlitigations range from individual actions involving a single\nplaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of\nclass members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement\nmatters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both\ngovernmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These\nlegal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication,\narbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm\u2019s\nlines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of\nclaims (including common law tort and contract claims and\nstatutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection\nclaims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm\nbelieves the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably\npossible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its\nlegal proceedings is from $ 0to approximately $ 1.2billion at\nSeptember 30, 2022. This estimated aggregate range of\nreasonably possible losses was based upon information available\nas of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm\nbelieves that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be\nmade. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such\nan estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm\u2019s estimate\nof the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves\nsignificant judgment, given: \u2022 the number, variety and varying\nstages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in\npreliminary stages, \u2022 the existence in many such proceedings of\nmultiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of\nliability (if any) has yet to be determined, \u2022 the numerous\nyet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including\nissues regarding class certification and the scope of many of\nthe claims, and \u2022 the attendant uncertainty of the various\npotential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the\nFirm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the\ncourt or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives\nof adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those\nassumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition, the outcome of\na particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not\ntake into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed\nthe likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the\nFirm\u2019s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible\nlosses will change from time to time, and actual losses may\nvary significantly. Set forth below are descriptions of the\nFirm\u2019s material legal proceedings. 1MDB Litigation . J.P.\nMorgan (Suisse) SA was named as a defendant in a civil\nlitigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by 1Malaysia\nDevelopment Berhad (\u201c1MDB\u201d), a Malaysian state-owned and\ncontrolled investment fund. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was served\nin August 2022. The claim alleges \u201cdishonest assistance\u201d\nagainst J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in relation to payments of $\n300million and $ 500million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively,\nreceived from 1MDB and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan\nSuisse (SA) held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture\ncompany between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited.\nIn September 2022, the Firm filed an application challenging\nthe validity of service and the Malaysian court\u2019s jurisdiction\nto hear the claim. Amrapali . India\u2019s Enforcement Directorate\n(\u201cED\u201d) is investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in\nconnection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by\ntwooffshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities\ninto residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali\nGroup (\u201cAmrapali\u201d). In 2017, numerous creditors filed civil\nclaims against Amrapali, including petitions brought by home\nbuyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver\nresidential units. The home buyers\u2019 petitions have been\noverseen by the Supreme Court of India and are ongoing. In\nAugust 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India\nPrivate Limited approximately $ 31.5million. The Firm is\nappealing the order and the fine. Relatedly, in July 2019, the\nSupreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary\nfindings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified\nJPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had\ninvested in the projects, violated certain currency control and\nmoney laundering provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a\nfurther inquiry under India\u2019s Prevention of Money Laundering\nAct (\u201cPMLA\u201d) and Foreign Exchange Management Act (\u201cFEMA\u201d). In\nMay 2020, the ED attached approximately $ 25million from J.P.\nMorgan India Private Limited in connection with the criminal\nPMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and cooperating\nwith the PMLA investigation. Federal Republic of Nigeria\nLitigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. operated an escrow and\ndepository account for the Federal Government of Nigeria\n(\u201cFGN\u201d) and two major international oil companies. The account\nheld approximately $ 1.1billion in connection with a dispute\namong the clients over rights to an oil field. Following the\nsettlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out\nthe monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in accordance with\ndirections received from its clients. In November 2017, the\nFederal Republic of Nigeria (\u201cFRN\u201d) commenced a claim in the\nEnglish High Court for approximately $ 875million in payments\nmade out of the accounts. The FRN alleged that the payments\nwere\n                              175                              \ninstructed as part of a complex fraud not involving JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A., but that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or\nshould have been on notice that the payments may be fraudulent.\nA trial was held between February and April 2022. In June 2022,\nthe Court decided the case in favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. and dismissed it in full. The FRN has requested permission\nto appeal the decision relating solely to the 2013 payment of\napproximately $ 75million. Foreign Exchange Investigations and\nLitigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with\ncertain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange\n(\u201cFX\u201d) sales and trading activities and controls related to\nthose activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the\nFirm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust\nlaw. The Department of Labor (\"DOL\") granted the Firm a five-\nyearexemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and its\naffiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional\nAsset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income\nSecurity Act (\u201cERISA\u201d) until January 2023. The Firm will need\nthe DOL to approve a further exemption to cover the remainder\nof the ten-yeardisqualification period following the antitrust\nplea. In October 2022, the DOL published a proposed exemption\nfor the remainder of the disqualification period. This proposal\nwill be open for public comment until December 2022. The only\nremaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa\nCompetition Commission matter which is currently pending before\nthe South Africa Competition Tribunal. With respect to civil\nlitigation matters, in August 2018, the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of New York granted final\napproval to the Firm\u2019s settlement of a consolidated class\naction brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally\nalleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an\nalleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and\nalso sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX\nfutures and options on futures. Certain members of the\nsettlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded\nfrom the class, and certain of them filed a complaint against\nthe Firm and other foreign exchange dealers in November 2018. A\nnumber of these actions remain pending. Further, a putative\nclass action has been filed against the Firm and other foreign\nexchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who purchased\nforeign currencies at allegedly inflated rates. Another\nputative class action was brought against the Firm and other\nforeign exchange dealers on behalf of purported indirect\npurchasers of FX instruments. In 2020, the Court approved a\nsettlement by the Firm and 11other defendants of that class\naction for a total of $ 10million. In addition, some FX-related\nindividual and putative class actions based on similar alleged\nunderlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including\nin the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. In\na putative class action pending before the U.K. Competition\nAppeal Tribunal, proposed class representatives have appealed\nthe tribunal's denial of a request for class certification on\nan opt-out basis. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been\nreached in the putative class action, which remains subject to\ncourt approval. Inquiries Concerning Preservation Requirements\n. In December 2021 certain of the Firm\u2019s subsidiaries entered\ninto resolutions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) to resolve their respective civil\ninvestigations of compliance with records preservation\nrequirements applicable to broker-dealer firms, swap dealers\nand futures commission merchants. The SEC and CFTC found that\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC did not maintain copies of certain\ncommunications required to be maintained under their respective\nrecord keeping rules, where such communications were sent or\nreceived by employees over electronic messaging channels that\nhad not been approved for employee use by the Firm. The CFTC\nresolution also included JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P.\nMorgan Securities plc as swap dealers. The SEC and CFTC also\nfound related supervision failures. Under these resolutions,\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC paid a $ 125million civil monetary\npenalty to the SEC, and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities plc paid a total $\n75million civil monetary penalty to the CFTC. The Firm\ncontinues to respond to requests for information and other\nmaterial from certain authorities concerning its compliance\nwith records preservation requirements in connection with\nbusiness communications sent over electronic messaging channels\nthat have not been approved by the Firm. The Firm is\ncooperating with these inquiries. In March 2022, a shareholder\nderivative action was filed in the United States District Court\nfor the Eastern District of New York against the Firm\u2019s Board\nof Directors asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and violation\nof federal securities laws based on the Board\u2019s alleged failure\nto exercise adequate oversight over compliance with records\npreservation requirements. The complaint seeks damages,\nrestitution, disgorgement and corporate governance reforms. The\nplaintiff filed an amended complaint in August 2022, which\ndefendants have moved to dismiss. Interchange Litigation.\nGroups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of\nclass action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as\nwell as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and\ndebit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in\nviolation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially\nsettled the cases for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of\ncredit card interchange, and modifications to certain credit\ncard network rules. In 2017, after the approval of that\nsettlement was reversed on appeal, the case was remanded to the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork for further proceedings consistent with the appellate\ndecision. The original class action was divided into\ntwoseparate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and\nthe other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September\n2018, the\n                              176                              \nparties to the monetary class action finalized an agreement\nwhich amends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement.\nPursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively\ncontributed an additional $ 900million to the approximately $\n5.3billion previously held in escrow from the original\nsettlement. In December 2019, the amended settlement agreement\nwas approved by the District Court. Certain merchants appealed\nthe District Court\u2019s approval order, and those appeals are\npending. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of\nthe amended class settlement, $ 700million has been returned to\nthe defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with\nthe settlement agreement. The injunctive class action continues\nseparately, and in September 2021, the District Court granted\nplaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification in part, and denied\nthe motion in part. In addition, certain merchants have filed\nindividual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and\nMastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks, and\nsome of those actions remain pending. LIBOR and Other Benchmark\nRate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has\nresponded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and\nentities around the world relating primarily to the British\nBankers Association\u2019s (\u201cBBA\u201d) London Interbank Offered Rate\n(\u201cLIBOR\u201d) for various currencies and the European Banking\nFederation\u2019s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cEURIBOR\u201d). The Swiss\nCompetition Commission\u2019s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to\nwhich the Firm and one other bank remain subject, continues. In\nDecember 2016, the European Commission issued a decision\nagainst the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of\nEuropean antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has\nfiled an appeal of that decision with the European General\nCourt, and that appeal is pending. In addition, the Firm has\nbeen named as a defendant along with other banks in various\nindividual and putative class actions related to benchmark\nrates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S.\ndollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the\nBBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and\nresolved certain other actions, and others are in various\nstages of litigation. The United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York has granted class certification\nof antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps\nsold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. A\nconsolidated putative class action related to the period that\nU.S. dollar LIBOR was administered by ICE Benchmark\nAdministration has been dismissed. In addition, a group of\nindividual plaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting antitrust\nclaims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were\nengaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and\nconspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer\nloans and credit cards. Defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019\ncomplaint. In December 2021, the court denied plaintiffs\u2019\nmotions for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin\ndefendants from setting U.S. dollar LIBOR and enforcing any\nfinancial instruments that rely on U.S. dollar LIBOR. In\nSeptember 2022, the Court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint in\nits entirety, and plaintiffs filed an amended complaint\nasserting similar antitrust claims in October 2022. The Firm\u2019s\nsettlements of putative class actions related to Swiss franc\nLIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore\nSwap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference\nRate remain subject to court approval. Metals and U.S.\nTreasuries Investigations and Litigation and Related Inquiries.\nThe Firm previously reported that it and/or certain of its\nsubsidiaries had entered into resolutions with the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d), the U.S. Commodity Futures\nTrading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) and the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), which, collectively, resolved\nthose agencies\u2019 respective investigations relating to\nhistorical trading practices by former employees in the\nprecious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct\nfrom 2008 to 2016. The Firm entered into a Deferred Prosecution\nAgreement (\u201cDPA\u201d) with the DOJ in which it agreed to the filing\nof a criminal information charging JPMorgan Chase & Co. with\ntwocounts of wire fraud and agreed, along with JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to certain terms and\nobligations as set forth therein. Under the terms of the DPA,\nthe criminal information will be dismissed after three years,\nprovided that JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nand J.P. Morgan Securities LLC fully comply with all of their\nobligations. Across the threeresolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and\nSEC, JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P.\nMorgan Securities LLC agreed to pay a total monetary amount of\napproximately $ 920million. A portion of the total monetary\namount includes victim compensation payments. Several putative\nclass action complaints have been filed in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York against\nthe Firm and certain former employees, alleging a precious\nmetals futures and options price manipulation scheme in\nviolation of the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints\nalso allege unjust enrichment and deceptive acts or practices\nunder the General Business Law of the State of New York. The\nCourt consolidated these putative class actions, and, in July\n2022, the Court granted final approval of a settlement among\nthe parties. In addition, several putative class actions were\nfiled in the United States District Courts for the Northern\nDistrict of Illinois and Southern District of New York against\nthe Firm, alleging manipulation of U.S. Treasury futures and\noptions, and bringing claims under the Commodity Exchange Act.\nThe actions in the Northern District of Illinois were\ntransferred to the Southern District of New York. The Court\nconsolidated these putative class actions, and, in June 2022,\nthe Court granted final approval of a settlement among the\nparties. In Canada, plaintiffs have commenced\n                              177                              \nputative class action proceedings based on similar alleged\nunderlying conduct related to precious metals. In October 2020,\ntwoputative class action complaints were filed under the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 in the United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of New York against the Firm and\ncertain individual defendants on behalf of shareholders who\nacquired shares during the putative class period alleging that\ncertain SEC filings of the Firm were materially false or\nmisleading in that they did not disclose certain information\nrelating to the above-referenced investigations. The Court\nconsolidated these putative class actions in January 2021.\nPlaintiffs filed their second amended complaint in May 2021,\nwhich additionally alleged that certain orders in precious\nmetals futures contracts placed by precious metals futures\ntraders during the putative class period were materially false\nand misleading. Defendants have moved to dismiss. In May 2022,\na shareholder derivative suit purporting to act on behalf of\nthe Firm, was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New\nYork asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment\nclaims against certain current and former officers and\ndirectors of the Firm. The complaint claims the Firm\u2019s Board of\nDirectors wrongfully rejected the shareholder\u2019s demand to\ncommence litigation and seeks damages, disgorgement and\ncorporate governance reforms on the basis of alleged\nsupervisory failures with regard to certain historical\nspoofing-related conduct that was the subject of the Firm\u2019s\nresolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, as\nwell as certain fiduciary activities that were separately the\nsubject of a resolution between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and\nthe OCC in November 2020. Defendants have moved to dismiss.\nSecurities Lending Antitrust Litigation . JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and\nJ.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are named as\ndefendants in a putative class action filed in the United\nStates District Court for the Southern District of New York.\nThe complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law and\nNew York State common law in connection with an alleged\nconspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange\ntrading for securities lending transactions. Defendants\u2019 motion\nto dismiss the complaint was denied. Plaintiffs have moved to\ncertify a class in this action, which defendants are opposing.\n* * * In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed\nabove, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as\ndefendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of\nother legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious\ndefenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently\noutstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself\nvigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from\ntime to time in the future. The Firm has established reserves\nfor several hundred of its currently outstanding legal\nproceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for\ncontingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related\nliability when it is probable that such a liability has been\nincurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably\nestimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings\neach quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes\nadjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as\nappropriate, based on management\u2019s best judgment after\nconsultation with counsel. The Firm\u2019s legal expense was $\n47million and $ 76million for the three months ended September\n30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 239million and $\n289million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and\n2021, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm\u2019s\nlitigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future.\nIn view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of\nlegal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very\nlarge or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present\nnovel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are\nin early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with\nconfidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently\npending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the\neventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to\nthose matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current\nknowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of\nthe material legal proceedings described above and after taking\ninto account its current litigation reserves and its estimated\naggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal\nproceedings currently pending against it should not have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Firm\u2019s consolidated financial\ncondition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the\nuncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no\nassurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will\nnot significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued\nor that a matter will not have material reputational\nconsequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter\nmay be material to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operating results for a\nparticular period, depending on, among other factors, the size\nof the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s income for that period.\n                              178                              \n                                                               \n  Note 25 \u2013 Business segments                                  \n                                                               \nThe Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are fourmajor\nreportable business segments - Consumer & Community Banking,\nCorporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset &\nWealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment.\nThe business segments are determined based on the products and\nservices provided, or the type of customer served, and they\nreflect the manner in which financial information is currently\nevaluated by the Firm\u2019s Operating Committee. Segment results\nare presented on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results\nbelow, and Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K for a\nfurther discussion of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business segments.\nSegment results The following table provides a summary of the\nFirm\u2019s segment results as of or for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2022 and 2021, on a managed basis. The\nFirm\u2019s definition of managed basis starts with the reported\nU.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to\npresent total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the\nreportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly,\nrevenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-\nexempt securities is presented in the managed results on a\nbasis comparable to taxable investments and securities. Refer\nto Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K for additional\ninformation on the Firm\u2019s managed basis. Capital allocation The\namount of capital assigned to each business segment is referred\nto as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and methodologies\nused to allocate capital are reassessed and as a result, the\ncapital allocated to the LOBs may change.

The\nminimum payment on an option\nARM loan is based on the\ninterest rate charged during\nthe introductory period. This\nintroductory rate is usually\nsignificantly below the fully\nindexed rate. The fully\nindexed rate is calculated\nusing an index rate plus a\nmargin. Once the introductory\nperiod ends, the contractual\ninterest rate charged on the\nloan increases to the fully\nindexed rate and adjusts\nmonthly to reflect movements\nin the index. The minimum\npayment is typically\ninsufficient to cover interest\naccrued in the prior month,\nand any unpaid interest is\ndeferred and added to the\nprincipal balance of the loan.\nOption ARM loans are subject\nto payment recast, which\nconverts the loan to a\nvariable-rate fully amortizing\nloan upon meeting specified\nloan balance and anniversary\ndate triggers.\n\nPrime\n\nPrime mortgage loans are made\nto borrowers with good credit\nrecords who meet specific\nunderwriting requirements,\nincluding prescriptive\nrequirements related to income\nand overall debt levels.
