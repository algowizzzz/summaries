of Certain\nOfficers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (the \u201cFirm\u201d) announced that the independent members of the Board of Directors (the\n\u201cBoard\u201d) approved the annual compensation for 2024 for Mr. James Dimon, CEO, in the amount of $39,000,000,\ncompared to last year\u2019s annual compensation of $36,000,000. The annual compensation for 2024 reflects Mr.\nDimon\u2019s stewardship of the Firm, with growth across all of its market-leading lines of business, record\nfinancial results and a fortress balance sheet, and continues to demonstrate strong pay-for-performance\nalignment.\n\nMr. Dimon\u2019s total compensation includes an annual base salary of $1,500,000 and performance-based variable\nincentive compensation of $37,500,000. $5,000,000 of the variable incentive compensation will be delivered\nin cash and the remaining $32,500,000 will be delivered in the form of at-risk Performance Share Units\n(\"PSUs\"). PSUs tie 100% of Mr. Dimon\u2019s annual equity-based compensation to ongoing performance metrics,\nrepresenting 87% of his total variable incentive compensation. This significant weighting of pay mix to\nequity is designed to align with shareholders\u2019 interests by encouraging continued focus on the long-term\nsuccess of the Firm. The key features of the PSU program are consistent with last year, including the\nfinancial metric (return on tangible common equity 1 - \"ROTCE\") with absolute and relative performance\ngoals, payout levels, vesting and hold requirements, as well as clawback and recovery provisions 2 .\n\nDuring the year, under Mr. Dimon's stewardship, the Firm continued to serve clients and customers against a\ndynamic global macro backdrop characterized by ongoing geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty. The\nFirm generated strong current returns while investing in and executing on long-term strategic initiatives,\nconsistent with its fortress principles. In 2024, the Firm reported record revenue for the seventh\nconsecutive year of $180.6 billion 1 and record net income of $58.5 billion, or $19.75 per share, with ROTCE\nof 22% representing sustained strong relative outperformance compared to peers. The Firm increased its\nquarterly common dividend from $1.05 to $1.25 per share.\n\nThe Firm ended 2024 with a common equity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d) ratio of 15.7%, CET1 capital 3 of $275.5 billion\nand $1.4 trillion of cash and marketable securities 4 , providing it with meaningful capacity to support\nclients and further invest in its business and communities. During 2024, the Firm raised approximately $2.8\ntrillion of credit and capital 5 for its consumer and institutional clients around the world, which include\nindividuals, homeowners, small businesses, larger corporations, schools, hospitals, cities and countries.\nThe Firm continued its investments in technology, people and products, as well as its steadfast commitment\nto corporate responsibility, including helping to create a stronger, more inclusive economy and advance\ncities and neighborhoods, positioning the Firm for future success.\n\nThe Board evaluated Mr. Dimon\u2019s holistic performance across financial and non-financial performance\ndimensions, as well as the competitive environment, in determining his compensation. As part of their\nevaluation and determination, the Board considered Mr. Dimon\u2019s continued development of top executives to\nlead for today and the future, his continued commitment to shareholders and his longstanding exemplary\nleadership of a premier financial services firm. Under the J.P. Morgan and Chase brands, which include\ninvestment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial\ntransaction processing and asset management, the Firm serves millions of customers, predominantly in the\nUnited States, and many of the world\u2019s most prominent corporate, institutional and government clients\nglobally.\n\nSeparately, Mr. Dimon and his family plan to sell approximately 1 million shares of their JPMorgan stock\nholdings for financial diversification and tax-planning purposes. While there is no intention to execute\nfurther sales at this time, they retain the option to do so in the future. After the contemplated sales, Mr.\nDimon will continue to have a significant stake in the company, with he and his family currently holding\napproximately 7.5 million shares. He also continues to have unvested Performance\n\n1 Revenue is on a managed basis. Managed revenue and ROTCE are non-GAAP financial measures.
