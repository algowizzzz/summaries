Burke, Our Lead\nIndependent Director\n                                                                     April 4, 2022\nDear fellow shareholders:\n\nIn connection with the 2022 Annual\nMeeting, we want to share with you some\nof the highlights of the work of the\nBoard. The Firm demonstrated strong\nfinancial performance in 2021, building\nupon its momentum from prior years. We\ngained market share in our businesses,\ndemonstrated strong expense discipline\nwhile continuing to invest into our\nbusinesses, maintained a fortress\nbalance sheet and returned $28.5\nbillion of capital to shareholders.\nThat said, our clients and customers,\nemployees and communities continued to\nface the challenges posed by COVID-19,\nsocietal gaps, including with respect\nto racial equity and access to health\ncare, and climate change. We worked to\nsupport them, while remaining true to\nour fundamental business principles and\ncommitment to building long-term value\nfor our shareholders.\n\nThe Board recognizes that long-term\nstrong performance requires disciplined\nfocus on the factors that drive\nperformance and continued investment in\nproducts, technology and people who\nwill lead the firm in the future. We\nhave continued to prioritize management\ndevelopment and succession, growing\nsenior leaders, and overseeing plans to\ngive them greater responsibility and\nbroader exposure to firmwide issues. We\nhave built a deep bench of potential\nleaders who can execute the firm\u2019s\nstrategy and enhance our strong\nculture. This was illustrated clearly\nas Gordon Smith, co-President and Chief\nOperating Office and CEO of Consumer &\nCommunity Banking (\u201cCCB\u201d) retired,\nDaniel Pinto was appointed sole\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer,\nMarianne Lake and Jennifer Piepszak\nwere appointed co-heads of CCB, Jeremy\nBarnum succeeded Jenn as CFO and the\nFirm expanded the Operating Committee.\nAs part of our long-term executive\nretention and succession planning, we\nalso granted special awards to Mr.\nDimon and Mr. Pinto. These awards\nreflect our desire for them to continue\ntheir outstanding leadership in their\nrespective roles.\n\nMore broadly, we are guided by the\nfirm\u2019s core business principles \u2013\nexceptional client service, a\ncommitment to integrity, fairness and\nresponsibility, operational excellence\nand a great team and winning culture.\nWe hold management accountable for\ndeveloping strategic priorities that\nwill reinforce these principles. In the\npast year, we added a Sustainable\nBusiness Practices tenet to the Firm\u2019s\nstrategic framework, in recognition of\nthe importance of investing in and\nsupporting our communities, integrating\nsustainability into business and\noperating decisions, serving a diverse\ncustomer base and promoting sound\ngovernance. In furtherance of our\ncommitments to sustainable business\npractices, the Firm announced a ten-\nyear target to finance and facilitate\n$1 trillion for climate action, as part\nof a $2.5\n\ntrillion target for sustainable\ndevelopment, and deployed or committed\nmore than $18 billion towards our $30\nbillion goal to advance racial equity\nand promote inclusive growth.\n\nThrough our oversight of the strategic\nplanning process, we also hold\nmanagement accountable to navigate\nchange and drive innovation while\nmaintaining a strong risk and control\nenvironment. In today\u2019s rapidly\nchanging business space, it is critical\nthat we keep pace with innovations in\ntechnology and investments in our\nbusiness offerings.

We also announced our intention to expand to new sectors over time.\n\n\u2022 In October 2021, we announced our support for the goals of the Net Zero Banking\nAlliance (\"NZBA\"), a global network of banks working to align their lending and\ninvestment portfolios with the goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050.

How we think about pay decisions\n\nThe Firm\u2019s How We Do Business Principles (\"Business Principles\") and strategic\nframework form the basis of our Operating Committee (\"OC\") members\u2019 strategic\npriorities. The Compensation & Management Development Committee (\"CMDC\")\nreferences those strategic priorities and the Firm\u2019s compensation philosophy to\nassess OC members\u2019 performance and to determine their respective total\ncompensation levels and pay mix.\n\n2. How we performed against our business strategy\n\nWe continued to deliver strong multi-year financial performance, invest in our\nfuture, strengthen our risk and control environment, and reinforce our culture and\nvalues, including our long-standing commitment to serve our customers, employees\nand communities, and conduct business in a responsible way to drive inclusive\ngrowth.\n\n3. How performance determined pay in 2021\n\nIn determining OC member pay, the CMDC took into account performance across four\nbroad performance dimensions: Business Results; Risk, Controls & Conduct;\nClient/Customer/Stakeholder; and Teamwork & Leadership. CEO pay is strongly\naligned to the Firm\u2019s short-, medium- and long-term performance, with\napproximately 85% of the CEO\u2019s variable pay deferred into equity, of which 100% is\nin at-risk performance share units (\"PSUs\"). Other NEO pay is also strongly\naligned to Firm and line of business (\"LOB\") performance, with a majority of\nvariable pay deferred into equity, of which 50% is in at-risk PSUs.\n                                                 \n  Disciplined performance assessment process to  \n  determine pay                                  \n                                                 \nThe CMDC uses a balanced discretionary approach to determine annual compensation,\nwhich includes a disciplined assessment of performance against the aforementioned\nfour broad dimensions over a sustained period of time. For 2021, compensation\nawarded to the OC members also represents a balance between the outstanding\nefforts and performance of the Firm with the continued impact of the COVID-19\npandemic on the Firm's other stakeholders.\n\nThe table below summarizes the salary and incentive compensation awarded to our\nNEOs for 2021 performance.\n

listing\nstandards and the Firm\u2019s independence\nstandards as set forth in its\nGovernance Principles.\n\nTo be considered independent, a\ndirector must have no disqualifying\nrelationships, as defined by the NYSE,\nand the Board must have affirmatively\ndetermined that he or she has no\nmaterial relationships with JPMorgan\nChase, either directly or as a partner,\nshareholder or officer of another\norganization that has a relationship\nwith the Firm.\n\nIn assessing the materiality of\nrelationships with the Firm, the Board\nconsiders relevant facts and\ncircumstances. Given the nature and\nbroad scope of the products and\nservices provided by the Firm, there\nare from time to time ordinary course\nof business transactions between the\nFirm and a director, his or her\nimmediate family members, or principal\nbusiness affiliations. These may\ninclude, among other relationships:\nextensions of credit; provision of\nother financial and financial advisory\nproducts and services; business\ntransactions for property or services;\nand charitable contributions made by\nthe JPMorgan Chase Foundation or the\nFirm to a nonprofit organization of\nwhich a director is an officer. The\nBoard reviews these relationships to\nassess their materiality and determine\nif any such relationship would impair\nthe independence and judgment of the\nrelevant director.

For further information, see page 109. All candidates recommended to\nthe Governance Committee are evaluated based on the same standards.\n\nRecent Board refreshment\n\nThe Governance Committee is engaged in an ongoing recruitment process enabling the\nBoard to build a strong pipeline of prospective directors for the near-term and\nthe long-term. This includes candidates who are not available for board membership\nimmediately but may become available in the future, such as candidates whose\ncurrent professional commitments preclude board service and emerging leaders who\nrequire more experience. Often the Board works to develop a relationship with\nprospective candidates, becoming familiar with their skills and effectiveness,\nbefore the candidate is formally considered. The Board looks to recruit those who\nwill contribute individually and it seeks to balance skills, experience, personal\nattributes and tenure.\n                                                      \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.    20    2022 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                               \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE |ELECTION OF DIRECTORS  \n                                               \n                                                                                \n  Director nominees    Board governance    Board oversight    Board engagement  \n                                                                                \nDirector re-nomination\n\nThe Governance Committee also oversees the re-nomination process. In determining\nwhether to re-nominate a director for election at our annual meeting, the\nGovernance Committee reviews each director, considering:\n\nRetirement policy\n\nOur Governance Principles require a non-management director to offer not to stand\nfor re-election in each calendar year following a year in which the director will\nbe 72 or older. The Board (other than the affected director) then determines\nwhether to accept the offer. The Board believes that the appropriate mix of\nexperience and fresh perspectives is an important consideration in assessing Board\ncomposition, and the best interests of the Firm are served by taking advantage of\nall available talent, and evaluations as to director candidacy should not be\ndetermined solely on age.\n\nNone of our director nominees will be 72 or older this year.\n\nFor a description of the annual Board and committee self-assessment process, see\npage 27.\n                                                      \n  2022 PROXY STATEMENT    21    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                               \n  ELECTION OF DIRECTORS| CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                                               \n                                                                                \n  Director nominees    Board governance    Board oversight    Board engagement  \n                                                                                \n2.

The Board believes the\npresent structure provides the Firm and\nthe Board with strong leadership,\nappropriate independent oversight of\nmanagement, continuity of experience\nthat complements ongoing Board\nrefreshment, and the ability to\ncommunicate the Firm's business and\nstrategy to shareholders, clients,\nemployees, regulators and the public in\na single voice.\n\nAs required by the Firm\u2019s Governance\nPrinciples when the role of the Chair\nis combined with that of the CEO, the\nindependent directors appointed a Lead\nIndependent Director. Our Lead\nIndependent Director provides a strong\ncounterbalance to the Chair including\nby facilitating independent oversight\nof management, promoting open dialogue\namong the independent directors during\nand in between Board meetings, leading\nexecutive sessions at each regular\nBoard meeting without the presence of\nthe CEO, and focusing on the Board's\npriorities and processes.\n\nIn March 2022, the independent\ndirectors conducted a review of the\nBoard\u2019s leadership structure. This\nreview was conducted first by the\nCorporate Governance & Nominating\nCommittee, which considered the factors\non page 23, the\n\nFirm\u2019s governance practices, which\ninclude executive sessions of\nindependent directors as part of each\nregularly scheduled Board meeting and\nthe directors\u2019 frequent and open\ninteractions with senior management,\nand the effectiveness of the Lead\nIndependent Director role. Following\nits review, the Committee recommended\nthat the Board continue its current\nleadership structure and that Stephen\nB. Burke be re-appointed as Lead\nIndependent Director. The independent\ndirectors of the Board conducted their\nown review, again taking into account\nthe factors on page 23, the Committee\u2019s\nrecommendation and Mr. Burke\u2019s\neffective performance in the Lead\nIndependent Director role over the\ncourse of the prior year, and\ndetermined to maintain the current\nleadership structure with Mr. Burke\nserving as Lead Independent Director.\n\nIn addition, the Board considered the\npotential separation of the Chair and\nCEO positions in the context of\nsuccession planning. The Board has\nadopted a general policy, upon the next\nCEO transition, that the Chair and CEO\npositions shall be separate, subject to\nthe Board's determination of the\nleadership structure that best serves\nthe Firm and its shareholders at that\ntime. This policy is reflected in the\nFirm's Corporate Governance Principles\nand reinforces the Board's longstanding\ncommitment to independent oversight\nwhile also maintaining the Board's\nability to fulfill its fiduciary duty\nto make the ultimate decision regarding\nthe leadership structure that best\nserves shareholders.\n                                                      \n  JPMORGAN CHASE

well-developed\ncommittee structure in adherence to our\nGovernance Principles. The Board has\nestablished practices and processes to\nactively manage its information flow,\nset meeting agendas and promote sound,\nwell-informed decisions.\n\nBoard members have direct access to\nmanagement and regularly receive\ninformation from and engage with\nmanagement during and outside of formal\nBoard meetings.\n\nIn addition, the Board and each\ncommittee has the authority and\nresources to seek legal or other expert\nadvice from sources independent of\nmanagement.\n\nThe full Board met 10 times in 2021.\nFor more information on committees, see\nbelow. Each director attended 75% or\nmore of the total meetings of the Board\nand the committees on which he or she\nserved in 2021.\n\nCommittees of the Board\n\nA significant portion of our Board\u2019s\noversight responsibilities is carried\nout through its five independent,\nprincipal standing committees: Audit\nCommittee, CMDC, Governance Committee,\nPublic Responsibility Committee (\"PRC\")\nand Risk Committee. Allocating\nresponsibilities among committees\nallows more in-depth attention devoted\nto the Board\u2019s oversight of the\nbusiness and affairs of the Firm.\n\nCommittees meet regularly in\nconjunction with scheduled Board\nmeetings and hold additional meetings\nas needed. Each committee reviews\nreports from senior management and\nreports its actions to, and discusses\nits recommendations with, the full\nBoard.\n\nEach principal standing committee\noperates pursuant to a written charter.\nThese charters are available on our\nwebsite at jpmorganchase.com/about/gove\nrnance/board-committees. Each charter\nis reviewed at least annually as part\nof the Board\u2019s and each respective\ncommittee\u2019s self-assessment.\n\nThe Governance Committee annually\nreviews the allocation of\nresponsibility among the committees as\npart of the Board and committee self-\nassessment. For more information about\nthe self-assessment process, see page\n27.\n\nEach committee has oversight of\nspecific areas of business activities\nand risk, and engages with the Firm\u2019s\nsenior management responsible for those\nareas.\n\nAll committee chairs are appointed at\nleast annually by our Board. Committee\nchairs are responsible for:\n\n\u2022 Calling meetings of their committees\n\n\u2022 Approving agendas for their committee\nmeetings\n\n\u2022 Presiding at meetings of their\ncommittees\n\n\u2022 Serving as a liaison between\ncommittee members and the Board, and\nbetween committee members and senior\nmanagement, including the CEO\n\n\u2022 Working directly with the senior\nmanagement responsible for committee\nmandates\n\nThe Board determined each member of the\nAudit Committee in 2021 (Timothy P.\nFlynn, Michael A. Neal and Phebe N.\nNovakovic) to be an audit committee\nfinancial expert in accordance with the\ndefinition established by the SEC, and\nthat Ms. Bammann, the chair of the Risk\nCommittee, has

The Firm\u2019s overall\nobjective is to manage its businesses,\nand the associated risks, in a manner\nthat balances serving the interests of\nits clients, customers and investors\nand protects the safety and soundness\nof the Firm.\n\nThe key risk areas of the Firm are\nmanaged on a Firmwide basis. Certain\nrisks, such as strategic risk, are\noverseen by the full Board.\nCybersecurity risk is overseen by the\nfull Board, with additional oversight\nof the relevant risk framework and\ncontrols provided by the Audit and Risk\nCommittees. Board committees support\nthe Board\u2019s oversight responsibility by\noverseeing the risk categories related\nto such committee\u2019s specific area of\nfocus.\n\nCommittee chairs report significant\nmatters discussed at committee meetings\nto the full Board. Issues escalated to\nthe full Board may be dealt with in\nseveral ways, as appropriate, for\nexample: oversight of risk may remain\nwith the particular principal standing\ncommittee of the Board, the Board may\nestablish or direct a Specific Purpose\nCommittee to oversee such matters, or\nthe Board may ask management to present\nmore frequently to the full Board on\nthe issue.\n                                                      \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.    28    2022 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                               \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE |ELECTION OF DIRECTORS  \n                                               \n                                                                                \n  Director nominees    Board governance    Board oversight    Board engagement  \n                                                                                \nEnvironmental, social and\ngovernance matters\n\nAs noted throughout this Proxy,\noversight of ESG matters is an\nimportant part of the Board's work in\nsetting the policies and principles\nthat govern our business, including:\n\n\u2022 the Firm\u2019s governance-related\npolicies and practices;\n\n\u2022 our systems of risk management and\ncontrols;\n\n\u2022 our investment in our employees;\n\n\u2022 the manner in which we serve our\ncustomers and support our communities;\nand\n\n\u2022 how we advance sustainability in our\nbusiness and operations.\n\nIn particular, the Board\u2019s PRC provides\noversight of the Firm\u2019s positions and\npractices on public responsibility\nmatters such as community investment,\nfair lending, consumer practices,\nsustainability and other public policy\nissues that reflect the Firm\u2019s values\nand impact its reputation among all of\nits stakeholders. Other Board\ncommittees consider ESG matters within\ntheir scope of responsibility. For\ninstance, the CMDC oversees the Firm's\nculture, including reviewing employee\ndiversity, equity and inclusion\nprograms; the Risk Committee considers\nclimate risk; the Governance Committee\nreviews board diversity; and the Audit\nCommittee provides oversight of\ncompliance with the Firm's ethical\nstandards, policies, plans and\nprocedures, and with laws and\nregulations. In the past year, in\naddition to the work of the committees,\nall directors participated in full\nBoard discussion regarding the Firm's\napproach to COVID-19, racial equity and\nclimate change.\n\nThe Firm is committed to being\ntransparent about our approach to and\nperformance on ESG topics. One way we\ndo this is by publishing an annual ESG\nReport, which provides information on\nhow we are addressing the ESG matters\nthat we and our stakeholders view as\nimportant to our business. We monitor\nthe evolving disclosure landscape and\nevaluate which frameworks address our\nstakeholders' interest. As of 2021, our\nESG disclosures are informed by the\nGlobal Reporting Initiative,\nSustainability Accounting Standards\nBoard and the Task Force on Climate-\nrelated Financial Disclosures (\"TCFD\").\nThe ESG information page on our website\nprovides links to numerous JPMorgan\nChase publications, documents, policies\nand other sources of information about\nvarious ESG topics, which are available\nat\njpmorganchase.com/about/governance/esg.\n                                                      \n  2022 PROXY STATEMENT    29    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                               \n  ELECTION OF DIRECTORS| CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                                               \n                                                                                \n  Director nominees    Board governance    Board oversight    Board engagement  \n                                                                                \n4.

\nEmployees\n\nOur Board is committed to maintaining a\nstrong corporate culture that, based on\nour core values of respect, integrity\nand inclusion, instills and enhances a\nsense of personal accountability on the\npart of all of the Firm\u2019s employees.\n\nIn addition to discussions at Board\nmeetings with senior management about\nthese efforts, our directors\nparticipate in events outside of the\nBoardroom including meetings with\nemployees that emphasize this\ncommitment. These meetings include\nemployee town halls, LOB and leadership\nteam events such as our MD Workshop,\nannual senior leaders\u2019 meetings and\ninformal sessions with members of the\nOC and other senior leaders. In 2021,\nmembers of our Board also participated\nin Business Resource Groups' (\"BRG\")\nevents including Women on the Move,\nLeading Women Defined conference,\nAnnual Women Leadership Day, and Asset\nWealth Management and Black\nOrganization for Leadership Development\n(\"BOLD\").\n\nRegulators\n\nOur Board and senior leaders commit\nsignificant time to meeting with\nregulators. These interactions help us\nlearn first-hand from regulators about\nmatters of importance to them and their\nexpectations of us. It also gives the\nBoard and management a forum for\nkeeping our regulators well-informed\nabout the Firm\u2019s performance and\nbusiness practices.\n\nStakeholders\n\nAs we strive to deliver value,\nmanagement engages with our\nstakeholders, including our customers,\nsuppliers and communities in which we\nwork, on a range of issues in a variety\nof ways. These may include\nparticipation in consumer advisory\npanels, town halls and meetings with\npolicy advocacy groups and nonprofit\norganizations. We actively seek\nfeedback on key topics to help us\nbetter understand what is important to\nour stakeholders and find ways to\ndeliver value while also navigating\nfinancial, legal and regulatory\nconsiderations. In recent years, we\nhave engaged in extensive stakeholder\noutreach pertaining to, among other\ntopics, human capital management\nincluding diversity, equity and\ninclusion, climate change risk and ESG-\nrelated disclosures.\n\nManagement shares insights and feedback\nfrom these relationships and\nengagements with the Board, providing\nthe Board with valuable insights. Board\nmembers are also provided opportunities\nto engage with stakeholders through\nclient events, town halls, BRG, and\nshareholder discussions.\n                                                      \n  2022 PROXY STATEMENT    31    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                               \n  DIRECTOR COMPENSATION| CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                                               \nDirector compensation\n\nThe Governance Committee is responsible\nfor reviewing director compensation and\nmaking recommendations to the Board. In\nmaking its recommendations, the\nGovernance Committee annually reviews\nthe Board\u2019s responsibilities and the\ncompensation practices of peer firms,\nwhich include the same group of peer\nfirms referenced with respect to the\ncompensation of our NEOs. For more\ninformation see \u201cEvaluating market\npractices\u201d on page 45. The Board\nbelieves a best practice is to link\ndirector compensation to the Firm\u2019s\nperformance; therefore, a significant\nportion of director compensation is\npaid in common stock. Annual\ncompensation For each calendar year of\nservice on the Board, each non-employee\ndirector receives an annual cash\nretainer of $100,000 and if the non-\nemployee director is on the Board at\nthe time when annual performance year\nequity awards are granted, an annual\ngrant of deferred stock units valued at\n$250,000. Compensation paid during\n2021, including additional cash\ncompensation paid for certain committee\nand other service, is described in the\nfollowing tables. Each deferred stock\nunit included in the annual grant to\ndirectors represents the right to\nreceive one share of the Firm\u2019s common\nstock and dividend equivalents payable\nin deferred stock units for any\ndividends paid. Deferred stock units\nhave no voting rights. In January of\nthe year immediately following a\ndirector\u2019s termination of service,\ndeferred stock units are distributed in\nshares of the Firm\u2019s common stock in\neither a lump sum or in annual\ninstallments for up to 15 years as\nelected by the director.\n\nThe following table summarizes the 2021\nannual compensation for non-employee\ndirectors for service on the Boards of\nthe Firm, the Bank and J.P. Morgan\nSecurities plc. There is no additional\ncompensation paid for service on the\nBoard of IHC.\n                                                               \n  Compensation                                     Amount ($)  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Board retainer                              $       100,000  \n  Lead Independent Director retainer                   30,000  \n  Audit and Risk Committee chair retainer              25,000  \n  Audit and Risk Committee member retainer             15,000  \n  All other committees chair retainer                  15,000  \n  Deferred stock unit grant                           250,000  \n  Bank Board retainer                                  15,000  \n  Bank Board\u2019s chair retainer                          25,000  \n  J.P.

Morgan Securities plc,\nthe Firm\u2019s principal operating\nsubsidiary outside the U.S. and a\nsubsidiary of the Bank.\n\nStock ownership: no sales, no hedging,\nno pledging\n\nAs stated in the Governance Principles\nand further described in \u201cAnti-\nhedging/anti-pledging provisions\u201d on\npage 50, each director agrees to retain\nall shares of the Firm\u2019s common stock\nhe or she purchased on the open market\nor received pursuant to his or her\nservice as a Board member for as long\nas he or she serves on our Board.\n\nShares held personally by a director\nmay not be held in margin accounts or\notherwise pledged as collateral, nor\nmay the economic risk of such shares be\nhedged.\n\nAs detailed on page 83 under \u201cSecurity\nownership of directors and executive\nofficers,\u201d Mr. Crown has ownership of\ncertain shares attributed to him that\narise from the business of Henry Crown\nand Company, an investment company\nwhere Mr. Crown serves as Chairman and\nCEO, and trusts of which Mr. Crown\nserves as trustee (the \u201cAttributed\nShares\u201d). Mr. Crown disclaims\nbeneficial ownership of such Attributed\nShares, except to the extent of his\npecuniary interest. The Attributed\nShares are distinct from shares Mr.\nCrown or his spouse own individually,\nor shares held in trusts for the\nbenefit of his children (the \u201cCrown\nPersonally Held Shares\u201d). The Firm has\nreviewed the potential pledging of the\nAttributed Shares with Mr. Crown,\nrecognizes Mr. Crown\u2019s distinct\nobligations with respect to Henry Crown\nand Company and the trusts, and\nbelieves such Attributed Shares may be\nprudently pledged or held in margin\nloan accounts. Crown Personally Held\nShares are not and may not be held in\nmargin accounts or otherwise pledged as\ncollateral, nor may the economic risk\nof such shares be hedged.\n\nDeferred compensation\n\nEach year, non-employee directors may\nelect to defer all or part of their\ncash compensation. A director\u2019s right\nto receive future payments under any\ndeferred compensation arrangement is an\nunsecured claim against JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s general assets. Cash amounts\nmay be deferred into various investment\nequivalents, including deferred stock\nunits. Upon retirement from the Board,\ncompensation deferred into stock units\nwill be distributed in stock; all other\ndeferred cash compensation will be\ndistributed in cash. Deferred\ncompensation will be distributed in\neither a lump sum or in annual\ninstallments for up to 15 years as\nelected by the director commencing in\nJanuary of the year following the\ndirector\u2019s retirement from the Board.\n\nReimbursements and insurance\n\nThe Firm reimburses directors for their\nexpenses in connection with their Board\nservice or pays such expenses directly.\nThe Firm also pays the premiums on\ndirectors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability\ninsurance policies and on travel\naccident insurance policies covering\ndirectors as well as employees of the\nFirm.\n                                                      \n  2022 PROXY STATEMENT    33    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                                      \n  OTHER CORPORATE GOVERNANCE POLICIES AND PRACTICES|  \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE                                \n                                                      \nOther corporate governance policies and\npractices\n\nShareholder rights\n\nThe Firm\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation\nand By-laws provide shareholders with\nimportant rights, including:\n\n\u2022 Proxy access, which enables eligible\nshareholders to include their nominees\nfor election as directors in the Firm\u2019s\nproxy statement.

In\nreviewing a transaction, the Governance\nCommittee considers facts and\ncircumstances that it deems relevant to\nits determination, such as:\nmanagement\u2019s assessment of the\ncommercial reasonableness of the\ntransaction; the\n\nmateriality of the related person\u2019s\ndirect or indirect interest in the\ntransaction; whether the transaction\nmay involve an actual, or the\nappearance of, a conflict of interest;\nand, if the transaction involves a\ndirector, the impact of the transaction\non the director\u2019s independence.\n\nCertain types of transactions are pre-\napproved in accordance with the terms\nof the Policy.

Following a solicitation and\nreview of proposals from several major\nreal estate developers, a company not\naffiliated with the Firm or its\ndirectors or executive officers was\nselected to lead the project. The\ndevelopment company is expected to make\nthe purchase through an existing legal\nentity as a result of which Director\nJames Crown and members of his\nimmediate family are expected to hold\nindirect equity interests in the\nproperty which in the aggregate would\nexceed 10%. The purchase price will\ndepend upon the development rights\nattained and is anticipated to exceed\n$32 million. The transaction has not\nbeen consummated and closing is subject\nto completion of the development\nentitlements process and satisfaction\nof other contractual conditions\nprecedent.

Resources (\"HR\") about individual\nOC members\u2019 performance, as appropriate.\n\nThis approach (rather than determining pay levels during a single year-end\nprocess) enables the CMDC and the Board to make balanced and informed OC member\npay decisions that are aligned with long-term performance against four broad\ndimensions, which consider short-, medium- and long-term priorities that drive\nsustained shareholder value, while accounting for risk, controls and conduct\nobjectives:\n                                                                                  \n  Business Results

the CMDC periodically\nreviews market data relating to pay\nlevels, pay mix and pay practices.\n\nIn evaluating market data for OC\nmembers, the CMDC benchmarks against\nour primary financial services peer\ngroup, which consists of large\nfinancial services companies with which\nthe Firm directly competes for both\ntalent and business. The following\ncompanies comprise our primary\nfinancial services peer group, which\nremains unchanged from last year:\n\n\u2022 American Express\n\n\u2022 Bank of America\n\n\u2022 Citigroup\n\n\u2022 Goldman Sachs\n\n\u2022 Morgan Stanley\n\n\u2022 Wells Fargo\n\nGiven the diversity of the Firm\u2019s\nbusinesses, the CMDC may also\nperiodically reference the pay plans\nand practices of other financial\nservices companies as well as leading\nlarge, global firms across multiple\nindustries. The CMDC considers the\nsize, presence, brand and reputation of\nthe companies, and the nature and mix\nof their businesses in using this data.\nThese companies include some or all of\nthe following: 3M, Alphabet, Amazon,\nApple, AT&T, Barclays, BlackRock, BNY\nMellon, Boeing, Capital One Financial,\nChevron, Coca-Cola, Comcast, Credit\nSuisse, CVS Health, Deutsche Bank,\nExxonMobil, General Electric, HSBC,\nIBM, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Meta,\nMicrosoft, Oracle, PayPal, PepsiCo,\nPfizer, Procter & Gamble, Raytheon,\nUBS, Verizon, Wal-Mart and Walt Disney.\nAlthough these reference companies are\nnot part of our primary financial\nservices peer group, we believe that\ntheir practices can provide a relevant\npoint of reference for maintaining a\ncompetitive talent and compensation\nprogram.\n\nDISCIPLINED PROCESS TO DETERMINE PAY\n\nPay level\n\nIn determining total compensation\nlevels for individual OC members, the\nCMDC evaluates various pay scenarios in\nlight of the following considerations\nto inform their judgment:\n\n\u2022 Performance, based on the four broad\nassessment dimensions as discussed on\npages 53-64, including risk and control\n\n\u2022 Value of the position to the\norganization and shareholders over time\n(i.e., \u201cvalue of seat\u201d)\n\n\u2022 Leadership and the example they set\nfor others by acting with integrity and\nstrengthening the Firm\u2019s culture,\nincluding diversity, inclusion and\nrespect\n\n\u2022 External talent market (i.e., market\ndata)\n\nWhile market data provides the CMDC\nwith useful information regarding our\ncompetitors, the CMDC does not target\nspecific positioning (e.g., 50 th\npercentile), nor does it use a\nformulaic approach in determining\ncompetitive pay levels. Instead, the\nCMDC uses a range of data as a\nreference, which is considered in the\ncontext of each executive\u2019s performance\nover a multi-year period, and the\nCMDC\u2019s assessment of the value the\nindividual delivers to the Firm.\n\nFor 2021, compensation awarded to the\nOC members also represents a balance\nbetween the outstanding efforts and\nperformance of the Firm with the\ncontinued impact of the COVID-19\npandemic on the Firm's other\nstakeholders, as well as the Board\u2019s\ncontinued focus on executive retention\nand succession planning.\n\nPay mix\n\nOnce the CMDC determines OC members\u2019\ntotal incentive compensation, it then\nestablishes the appropriate pay mix\nbetween an annual cash incentive and\nlong-term equity, including PSUs and\nRSUs.\n\nFor OC members other than the CEO and\nthose located in the U.K., consistent\nwith prior years, the CMDC continued to\napply the Firm\u2019s standard cash/equity\nincentive mix formula to each of their\n2021 incentive compensation awards. For\nthe CEO, also consistent with prior\nyears, the Board continued to override\nthe standard cash/equity formula to\nmaintain a lower cash allocation of $5\nmillion, so that a larger majority of\nhis incentive compensation would be\ncomprised of shareholder-aligned\nequity, with 100% of it in the form of\nperformance-conditioned PSUs. PSUs are\n100% at-risk and will result in no\npayout unless a threshold performance\nlevel is achieved.\n                                                      \n  2022 PROXY STATEMENT    45    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                                   \n  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS| EXECUTIVE  \n  COMPENSATION                                     \n                                                   \n                                                                                  \n  How we think about pay     How we performed           How performance           \n  decisions                  against our business       determined pay in 2021    \n                             strategy                                             \n                                                                                  \nFor OC members other than the CEO, the CMDC determined that a 50%/50% mix of time-\nbased RSUs and at-risk PSUs would continue to provide an appropriate balance to\ntheir equity exposure. Per the Firm\u2019s standard cash/equity incentive mix formula,\nthe OC members were awarded 60% of their incentive compensation in long-term\nequity (30% in PSUs and 30% in RSUs), with the remaining 40% paid in cash.\n\nThe CMDC believes that this significant weighting of pay mix to equity encourages\nOC members to focus on the long-term success of the Firm while mitigating\nexcessive risk-taking, and provides a competitive annual cash incentive\nopportunity. The CMDC has established a different pay mix for OC members in the\nU.K., including Mr. Pinto, due to local E.U. and U.K. regulations for Identified\nStaff under the Capital Requirements Directive. For further details on Mr. Pinto\u2019s\npay mix, see Note 1 below.\n\nSummary of pay elements\n\nOur compensation program provides for an appropriate mix between base salary, cash\nand equity incentives that vest over time.

Due to local\nregulations, Mr. Pinto received a fixed allowance (which is not subject to\nclawback), did not receive a cash incentive, and both his RSUs and PSUs are\nsubject to: (i) extended seven-year vesting period (commencing ratably on the\nthird anniversary of grant, subject to the standard vest date occurring within 10\ndays of the grant date anniversary for RSUs); (ii) additional U.K. clawback/\nrecovery provisions; and (iii) a minimum twelve-month hold after each vesting, and\nare not eligible for payment/accrual of dividend equivalents. In addition, as it\nrelates to Mr. Pinto\u2019s PSUs, the CMDC may use its discretion, as appropriate, to\ndownward adjust payout based on his performance against qualitative criteria and\npriorities during the performance period, including performance against his local\nregulatory responsibilities as a U.K. \u201cSenior Manager\u201d under the Senior Managers &\nCertification Regime. Local regulators review compensation structures for\nIdentified Staff periodically and may require future adjustments.

Similar to RSUs, the value upon vesting of\nPSUs is also directly tied to the Firm\u2019s performance through its stock price. The\nCMDC believes that the PSU design continues to appropriately incentivize strong\nperformance by our OC members, does not encourage excessive risk-taking and is\naligned with long-term shareholder interests. Since PSUs were first introduced in\n2015, we have received positive shareholder support for this aspect of our\nexecutive compensation program.\n\nFor the 2021 PSU awards granted in January 2022, the CMDC maintained the key\nfeatures of our PSU design, including the enhancements it made to the 2019 PSU\nawards in response to feedback from shareholders. These enhancements included:\n\n\u2022 Changing the payout calculation methodology to be based on the Firm\u2019s three-year\naverage ROTCE performance on both an absolute and relative basis. Previously,\npayout was calculated annually for one-third of the awarded units.\n\n\u2022 Increasing the rigor of the relative payout scale to further differentiate\npayout for outperformance, median performance and underperformance, as summarized\nbelow:\n\n\u25e6 Top quartile relative performance no longer pays out at 150% for all three\nranks;\n\n\u25e6 Target (100%) payout requires above median performance;\n\n\u25e6 Below median performance pays out at a maximum of 80%; and\n\n\u25e6 Bottom relative performance pays out at 0%.\n\nThe chart below provides a detailed comparison of the relative performance payout\nlevels for PSU awards that were outstanding as of February 28, 2022:\n                                                                                  \n       R\u2026     1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9    10    11    \u2026  \n       R\u2026                                                                         \n  \u2026    1\u2026    1\u2026    1\u2026    1\u2026    1\u2026    9\u2026    8\u2026    7\u2026    6\u2026    5\u2026    4\u2026    0%       \n  \u2026                                                                               \n  \u2026    1\u2026    1\u2026    1\u2026    1\u2026    1\u2026    1\u2026    1\u2026    8\u2026    7\u2026    5\u2026    4\u2026    2\u2026       \n  \u2026                                                                               \n                         7\u2026                M\u2026                2\u2026                   \n                                                                                  \nAdditionally, for the 2021 PSU awards, the Committee calibrated the upper and\nlower absolute ROTCE thresholds to 18% and 6% respectively, based on the current\nforecast of the Firm's future performance.\n                                                      \n  2022 PROXY STATEMENT    47    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                                   \n  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS| EXECUTIVE  \n  COMPENSATION                                     \n                                                   \n                                                                                  \n  How we think about pay     How we performed           How performance           \n  decisions                  against our business       determined pay in 2021    \n                             strategy                                             \n                                                                                  \nKEY FEATURES OF OUR 2021 PSU PROGRAM\n\nThe key features of our 2021 PSUs are substantially unchanged and are summarized\nbelow:\n                                                                                  \n  Plan Feature                   Performance Year 2021 PSU Award Description      \n                                 \u2022Value of units moves with stock price during    \n  Vehicle                        performance period; units are settled in shares  \n                                 at vesting.                                      \n                                 \u2022Three-year cliff-vesting, plus an additional    \n                                 two-year holding period (for a combined          \n                                 five-year holding period).

For the 2021 PSU awards granted in January 2022, these outcomes were\nconsidered in the context of (among other things) the expected impacts of:\nregulatory capital requirements; annual stress tests; interest rates; COVID-19; as\nwell as the U.S. and global economic and geopolitical environment, all of which\naffect the range of ROTCE outcomes in the medium-term. To this end, the CMDC\nbelieves that it has set upper and lower absolute performance thresholds that are\nsufficiently rigorous compared to the Firm\u2019s current ROTCE outlook over the next 3\nyears.\n\n\u2022 Consistent with the Firm\u2019s pay-for-performance philosophy, in setting the\nrelative ROTCE performance goals for the 2021 PSU awards, the CMDC determined that\npayout above target should be limited to instances in which the Firm outperforms\nthe majority of its competitors on a relative basis, with below target payout\noccurring in instances of underperformance. Achievement of median relative\nperformance results in below-target payout. Outstanding relative performance,\nwhich results in a payout of 150%, is limited to achieving a top ranking.\n\nPSUS AWARDED FOR PERFORMANCE YEARS 2018, 2019, AND 2020\n\n\u2022 The Firm reported ROTCE of 19%, 14%, and 23% in 2019, 2020, and 2021\nrespectively, resulting in first quartile relative performance for each tranche of\nthe 2018 PSU awards referencing those years. On March 25, 2022, the 2018 PSU\nawards vested at 150%. For the 2019 and 2020 PSU awards, the payout will be\ncalculated once the performance period ends on December 31, 2022 and December 31,\n2023 respectively, based on the Firm's absolute and relative three-year average\nROTCE performance.\n                                                      \n  2022 PROXY STATEMENT    49    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                                   \n  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS| EXECUTIVE  \n  COMPENSATION                                     \n                                                   \n                                                                                  \n  How we think about pay     How we performed           How performance           \n  decisions                  against our business       determined pay in 2021    \n                             strategy                                             \n                                                                                  \nStrong ownership & accountability\nprovisions support our compensation\nphilosophy\n\nSTOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINE AND RETENTION\nREQUIREMENTS The CMDC believes it is\nimportant to align the interests of the\nOC members with those of our\nshareholders. To meet this objective,\nOC members are subject to a stock\nownership guideline and retention\npolicy. While on the Operating\nCommittee, each member is required to\naccumulate either: \u2022 A minimum of\nbetween 200,000 and 400,000 shares (1\nmillion shares for the CEO); or \u2022 A\nminimum fixed dollar value of shares of\nbetween $10 million and $30 million\n($75 million for the CEO). Shares\ncredited for purposes of satisfying the\nabove ownership levels include shares\nowned outright, as well as 50% of\nunvested RSUs and PSUs, but do not\ninclude stock appreciation rights\n(\"SARs\") or stock options. The stock\nownership guideline must be met within\nsix years of the later of the effective\ndate of the policy or appointment to\nthe Operating Committee. If the stock\nownership guidelines are subsequently\nincreased, the higher ownership\nguideline must be satisfied within six\nyears of such revision, unless\notherwise determined by the CEO and\nCMDC. Prior to reaching their\ndesignated share ownership guideline,\nOC members are required to retain 75%\nof all net shares received from equity\nawards granted after they join the\nOperating Committee. Once they have met\ntheir ownership guideline, the policy\nrequires OC members to continue\nretaining 50% of all net shares\nreceived from awards (75% for the CEO)\nas summarized below:\n                                                                                  \n  Retention Requirement                                                           \n  Before Guideline Met                After Guideline Met                         \n  75% of net shares until             50% of net shares for theduration of their  \n  stock ownership guideline is met    service\u00a0on\u00a0theOperating Committee(75% for   \n                                      the CEO)                                    \n                                                                                  \nBecause OC members are required to continue accumulating shares even after having\nmet their share ownership guideline, the resulting increase of share ownership\nover time further strengthens their interests with those of our shareholders.\nANTI-HEDGING/ANTI-PLEDGING PROVISIONS All employees are prohibited from hedging or\npledging unvested RSUs and PSUs, and unexercised stock appreciation rights or\nstock options. In addition: \u2022 Hedging any shares owned outright or through\ndeferred compensation by an OC member is prohibited \u2022 Shares held directly by an\nOC or Board member may not be held in margin accounts or otherwise pledged\n\nFor information on the hedging/pledging restrictions applicable to our directors,\nplease see \u201cDirector compensation\u201d on pages 32 and 33. INTEGRATING RISK WITH\nCOMPENSATION The CMDC holds an annual joint session with the Risk Committee to\nreview Firmwide Human Resources and compensation practices, including: \u2022 How we\nintegrate risk, controls and conduct considerations into key HR practices\nincluding performance development, compensation, promotion and succession planning\n\u2022 Compensation features and elements designed to discourage imprudent risk-taking\n(e.g., multi-year vesting, clawbacks, prohibition on hedging, etc.) \u2022 Annual\nincentive pool processes for LOBs and functions \u2022 Regulatory updates which have\nimpacted or may impact HR practices in the future The committees are also provided\nwith information on our performance development process, a summary of risk,\ncontrols and conduct feedback, and updates regarding HR Control Forum issues.\nSTRONG ACCOUNTABILITY AND RECOVERY PROVISIONS Our executive compensation program\nis designed to hold executives accountable, when appropriate, for meaningful\nactions or issues that negatively impact business performance or the Firm\u2019s\nreputation in current or future years. Issues that may warrant recovery\ndeterminations can be raised at any time, including in HR Control Forums, annual\nassessments of employee performance and when Designated Employees resign or their\nemployment is terminated by the Firm. Under the Firm\u2019s process to govern these\ndeterminations: \u2022 We have established a process for reviewing compensation or\nother employee actions following a determination that the cause and materiality of\na risk-related loss, issue or other set of facts and circumstances warrants such a\nreview of accountability \u2022 The CMDC is responsible for determinations involving OC\nmembers (determinations involving the CEO are subject to ratification by\nindependent members of the Board). The Firm has a framework that identifies and\nassesses employee risk and drives consistent management decisions and discipline.\nFor more material risk and control issues, the HR Control Forum process described\non the following page explains how issues are reviewed and impacts are\nrecommended.\n                                                      \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.    50    2022 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                                   \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION |COMPENSATION DISCUSSION  \n  AND ANALYSIS                                     \n                                                   \n                                                                                  \n  How we think about pay     How we performed           How performance           \n  decisions                  against our business       determined pay in 2021    \n                             strategy                                             \n                                                                                  \nHOLDING INDIVIDUALS ACCOUNTABLE\n\nTo hold individuals responsible for\ntaking risks inconsistent with the\nFirm\u2019s risk appetite and to discourage\nfuture imprudent behavior, the Firm has\npolicies and procedures that enable it\nto take timely and proportionate\nactions with respect to accountable\nindividuals, including:\n\nI.

The JPM DFI\nassists corporates and sovereigns to\nmeasure, manage, and communicate their\nimpact towards advancing the SDGs in\ndeveloping economies, while identifying\nsources of capital interested in\nfinancing opportunities with measurable\ndevelopment impact.

One\nof our signature programs is the\nService Corps, through which teams\naddress specific organizational\nchallenges and opportunities for\nnonprofits.\n\nApproximately 275 employees from around\nthe world volunteered their skills and\nexpertise to help nonprofits expand\ntheir impact in 2021. Our employees\nalso use their skills to mentor\nminority-led small businesses through\nthe Founders Forward program. In\naddition, our career mentorship\nprograms have allowed us to connect\nmore than 1,200 employees with youth,\nhelping to set them on a path toward\ntheir future career endeavors.

Our Youth Program and\nSocial Good Hackathons harness the\nskills of external talent to support\nthe social good sector, while also\nexposing participants to the Firm's\nculture. Last year, we engaged\napproximately 28,000 youths in our\ncommunities and connected over 3,000\nstudents with social impact projects\nand initiatives to promote their\ninterest in FinTech, and the Firm went\non to directly hire over 1,500\nindividuals. Similarly, the Emerging\nTalent program, which focuses on\nindividuals who are often overlooked in\ntraditional talent pipelines and\nprograms, provided career opportunities\nfor more than 1,400 individuals,\nincluding 300 youths.\n\n\u2022 Mentoring students and young\nprofessionals \u2013 Globally, employees\nhave dedicated their time to help young\npeople develop the skills necessary for\nfuture success through programs such as\nThe Fellowship Initiative and Advancing\nYoung Professionals. For example,\nthrough The Schools Challenge,\napproximately 600 employees in nine\ncities across the globe have\nvolunteered their time as mentors in\nthe program to support the students as\nthey gain employability skills that\nwill help them to pursue promising\ncareers in the future. In delivering\nall of these programs virtually during\nthe COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, we were\nable to establish a culture of\ncontinuous learning and development\nwhile giving back to the community.\n\nReporting on our efforts\n\nEach spring we publish a dedicated ESG\nReport, which summarizes our efforts\nand performance on ESG matters that we\nand our stakeholders view as important\nto our business.

We have implemented a disciplined executive\ntalent management and succession planning process that includes LOBs and Functions\nholding talent review discussions within their management teams and identifying\nsuccessors for key leadership roles.\n\nThe CMDC reviews the succession plan for the CEO followed by discussion with the\nnon-executive directors of the Board led by the Lead Independent Director. The\nCMDC also reviews the succession plan for members of the Operating Committee other\nthan the CEO, which is discussed by the full Board of Directors. Moreover,\nindividual OC members are provided with opportunities on a recurring basis to\ndiscuss top and diverse talent within their respective teams with the CMDC. These\nprocesses enable the Board to address both short-term unexpected events and long-\nterm planned occurrences, such as retirement or changes in roles. For example, in\nJanuary 2022, Daniel Pinto became the Firm's sole President and Chief Operating\nOfficer, following the retirement of Gordon Smith as Co-President, Co-Chief\nOperating Officer and Chief Executive Officer of Consumer & Community Banking in\nDecember 2021. In addition, the Firm announced in 2021 that Jennifer Piepszak,\nChief Financial Officer, and Marianne Lake, CEO of Consumer Lending, would succeed\nMr. Smith as Co-Chief Executive Officers of Consumer & Community Banking; and that\nJeremy Barnum, head of Global Research for the Corporate & Investment Bank, would\nsucceed Ms. Piepszak as Chief Financial Officer.\n\nWe continue to focus on our leadership pipeline through enhanced data and\nreporting capabilities to drive manager engagement and accountability in\nprocesses, including our mobility and promotion pipeline from Executive Director\nto Managing Director.\n\nDIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION\n\nPromoting diversity, equity and inclusion is important to the work we do. We are\ncommitted to maintaining a culture of respect and inclusion and believe that all\nindividuals should have the opportunity to succeed. We believe a diverse and\ninclusive environment fosters innovation, creativity and productivity, which is\ncritical to our long-term success. We are committed to hiring and retaining\nemployees from all races, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, abilities,\nbackgrounds, experiences and locations.\n\nWe are focused on being an employer of choice for all talent, where employees feel\nlike they belong. As a firm, we strive to embed diversity, inclusion and\naccessibility into the way we do business every day.

It differs from how compensation is reported in the\n\u201cSummary Compensation Table\u201d (\u201cSCT\u201d) on page 74, which is required by the SEC, and\nis not intended as a substitute for the SCT. There are two principal differences\nbetween the SCT and the table above:\n\n1. The Firm grants both cash and equity incentive compensation after a performance\nyear is completed. In both the table above and the SCT, cash incentive\ncompensation paid in 2022 for 2021 performance is shown as 2021 compensation. In\nthe table above, the equity awards (RSUs and PSUs) granted in 2022 for 2021\nperformance are shown as 2021 compensation. In contrast, the SCT reports the value\nof equity awards in the year in which they are granted. As a result, awards\ngranted in 2021 for 2020 performance are shown in the SCT as 2021 compensation.\n\n2.

DIMON AND MR. PINTO\n\nAs part of the Firm's long-term executive retention and succession planning, the\nBoard and CMDC granted special awards of 1,500,000 options to Mr. Dimon on July\n20, 2021 and 750,000 options to Mr. Pinto on December 14, 2021, respectively, in\nthe form of stock appreciation rights.\n\nThe special award granted to Mr. Dimon reflects the Board's desire for him to\ncontinue to lead the Firm for a further significant number of years. In making the\nspecial award, the Board considered the importance of Mr. Dimon's continuing,\nlong-term stewardship of the Firm, leadership continuity, and management\nsuccession planning amidst a highly competitive landscape for executive leadership\ntalent. The Board also took into account other factors, including the Firm's\nstrong performance under Mr. Dimon\u2019s stewardship since 2005, his exemplary\nleadership, and his significant contributions to the Firm\u2019s success during his\ntenure. The nature of this special award reflects the unique inflection point in\nMr. Dimon\u2019s tenure and the importance of his continued leadership and support of\nthe Firm's longer-term succession plans.\n\nThe CMDC made the special award to Mr. Pinto for prospective purposes, with\nrespect to his promotion to the Firm\u2019s sole President and Chief Operating Officer,\nwhich became effective January 1, 2022 following the retirement of Mr. Smith. The\nspecial award reflects the CMDC\u2019s desire for Mr. Pinto to continue his outstanding\nleadership in this new role for a further significant number of years. Mr. Pinto\nmoved from the United Kingdom to the United States in early 2022.\n\nThe options are not part of Mr. Dimon's and Mr. Pinto's regular annual\ncompensation and will not be awarded on a recurring basis.\n\nThe terms of the grants are distinct from, and are generally more restrictive\nthan, other equity grants regularly awarded by the Firm. The options have an\nexercise price equal to the average of the high and low prices of JPMorgan Chase &\nCo. common stock on the dates of each of the respective grants (the \u201cEffective\nDates\u201d).\n\nThe options have ten-year terms, will become exercisable no earlier than July 20,\n2026 and December 14, 2026 respectively, or five years after the Effective Dates,\nand are subject to protection-based vesting, clawback and recovery provisions 2 .\nApart from certain limited exceptions, vesting is subject to Mr. Dimon's and Mr.\nPinto's respective continuous leadership of, or employment with, the Firm.\n\nMoreover, net shares delivered from the exercise of the options must be held until\nJuly 20, 2031 and December 14, 2031 respectively, which coincides with the end of\nthe ten-year terms of each of the special awards. Net shares received from\nexercise of the options are also subject to the Firm\u2019s stock ownership guideline\nand retention requirements applicable to the Firm\u2019s OC members.\n\n1 Total compensation is comprised of base salary, cash bonus paid and long-term\nincentive compensation (target value) in connection with the performance year,\nwhich may be different from amounts reported in the SCT. The most recently used\npeer compensation data is from 2020 since not all our financial services peers\nwill have filed proxy statements containing 2021 compensation data before the\npreparation of this proxy statement. The percentage of profits paid is equal to\nthree-year average CEO compensation divided by three-year average net income.\nSource: 2019-2021 proxy statements; 2018-2020 Form 10-K filings.\n\n2 Equity incentives are subject to the JPMorgan Chase Bonus Recoupment Policy\nwhich applies in the event of a material restatement of the Firm's financial\nresults. In addition, all equity awards granted in 2021 contain recapture\nprovisions that enable the Firm to cancel outstanding awards and/or recover the\nvalue of certain stock distributed under the award in specified circumstances. In\naddition to recapture provisions, portions of equity awards awarded to Mr. Dimon\nand Mr. Pinto are also subject to performance conditions as part of the Firm's\nprotection-based vesting provisions, under which awards may be cancelled as\ndetermined by the CMDC and, in the case of Mr. Dimon, ratified by the Board of\nDirectors.

Cash incentive compensation\nreflects compensation earned in connection with the performance year shown, which\nwas awarded in January of the following year.\n\n3 Includes amounts awarded during the year shown. Amounts are the fair value on\nthe grant date in accordance with applicable accounting guidance (i.e., at target\nfor PSUs awarded in 2021). At the maximum level of performance, the value of PSUs\nawarded in 2021 would be: $37,500,000 for Mr. Dimon; $12,194,783 for Mr. Pinto;\n$9,787,500 for Mr. Smith; $9,112,500 for Ms. Erdoes; and $5,062,500 for Ms.\nPiepszak. Mr. Barnum did not receive a PSU award in 2021. The Firm\u2019s accounting\nfor employee stock-based incentives is described in Note 9 to the Firm\u2019s\nConsolidated Financial Statements in the 2021 Annual Report on pages 218-219,\nwhich may be accessed on our website at jpmorganchase.com, under Investor\nRelations.\n\n4 In 2021, Mr. Dimon and Mr. Pinto were granted special option awards in the form\nof SARs that are not part of their regular annual compensation and will not be\nawarded on a recurring basis. Refer to page 66 for further information. The\nspecial options were awarded at the fair value on the respective grant dates of\neach award. The Firm\u2019s accounting for employee stock-based incentives (including\nassumptions used to value employee stock options and SARs) is described in Note 9\nto the Firm\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2021 Annual Report on pages\n218-219.\n\n5 Amounts for years 2021, 2020, and 2019 are the aggregate change in the actuarial\npresent value of the accumulated benefits under all defined benefit pension plans\n(including supplemental plans). No NEOs had earnings in excess of 120% of the\napplicable federal rate on deferred compensation balances where the rate of return\nis not calculated in the same or in a similar manner as earnings on hypothetical\ninvestments under the Firm's qualified plans. The amount of earnings in excess of\n120% of the applicable federal rate included in this column is $0 for each of\n2021, 2020 and, 2019. The Change in Pension Value is -$8,126 for Ms. Erdoes,\n-$9,166 for Ms. Piepszak, and -$9,653 for Mr. Barnum.\n\n6 \u201cAll other compensation\u201d includes the cost, if any, for a named executive\nofficer\u2019s spouse to attend business-related events where spousal attendance is\nexpected or customary. This did not exceed the greater of $25,000 or 10% of the\nnamed executive officer\u2019s total perquisites and personal benefits except as\nspecifically noted in the footnotes that follow.\n\n7 The \u201cAll other compensation\u201d column for Mr. Dimon includes: $5,000 in employer\nnon-matching contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plan, which replaces\nthe employer benefit to the Firm's qualified noncontributory U.S. defined benefit\npension plan that was frozen effective January 1, 2020; $146,847 for personal use\nof corporate aircraft; $30,099 for personal use of corporate cars; and $100,713\nfor the cost of residential, personal travel, and related security paid by the\nFirm, of which a portion was for periodic security equipment maintenance. Mr.\nDimon\u2019s personal use of corporate aircraft and cars, and certain related security,\nis required pursuant to security measures approved by the Board. Incremental costs\nare determined as follows:\n\n\u25e6 Aircraft: operating cost per flight hour for the aircraft type used, developed\nby an independent reference source, including fuel, fuel additives and lubricants;\nlanding and parking fees; crew expenses; small supplies and catering; maintenance,\nlabor and parts; engine restoration costs; and a maintenance service plan.\n\n\u25e6 Cars: annual lease valuation of the assigned cars; annual insurance premiums;\nfuel expense; estimated annual maintenance; other miscellaneous expense; and\nannual drivers\u2019 compensation, including salary, overtime, benefits and bonus. The\nresulting total is allocated between personal and business use based on mileage.\n\n8 Since Mr. Pinto is located in the U.K., the terms and composition of his\ncompensation reflect the requirements of local regulations, including changes that\ncame into effect in 2014 and 2021 to comply with the Capital Requirements\nDirective IV and V respectively. These requirements include that at least 60% of\nhis incentive compensation is deferred, and that his incentive compensation is not\nmore than twice his fixed compensation in respect of any given performance year.\nMr. Pinto\u2019s fixed compensation is comprised of salary and an annual cash fixed\nallowance, which from June 2017, has been payable in equal monthly installments.\nMr. Pinto\u2019s fixed allowance, which is paid in British pound sterling, increased to\n$8,400,000 in 2021 from $7,635,000 in 2020 and 2019. His salary of \u00a3475,000 has\nremained unchanged since 2016.

Grants made as part of the annual incentive\ncompensation process are generally awarded in January after fourth quarter\nearnings are released. RSUs and PSUs carry no voting rights. On January 18, 2022,\nthe Firm awarded RSU and PSU awards as part of the 2021 annual incentive\ncompensation. Because these awards were granted in 2022, they do not appear in\nthis table, which is required to include only equity awards actually granted\nduring 2021. These 2022 awards are however reflected in the \u201cNEO Compensation\u201d\ntable on page 65. In 2021, Mr. Dimon and Mr. Pinto were granted special option\nawards in the form of SARs that are not part of their regular annual compensation\nand will not be awarded on a recurring basis. Refer to page 66 for further\ninformation.\n\n2 For NEOs other than Mr. Pinto, PSUs vest on March 25, 2024, and are subject to a\ntwo-year holding period post-vesting. In accordance with U.K. regulations, for Mr.\nPinto, PSUs vest in five equal installments on March 25, 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027\nand 2028 and are subject to: (i) a twelve-month holding period for all\ninstallments post-vesting, (ii) a two-year holding period for the installment\nvesting on March 25, 2024, with the holding periods associated with (i) and (ii)\nabove running concurrently. Each PSU represents the right to receive one share of\ncommon stock on the vesting date. The ultimate number of PSUs that will vest will\nbe determined by the Firm\u2019s performance over the three-year performance period,\nand for NEOs other than Mr. Pinto, will include any accumulated reinvested\ndividend equivalent shares. The dividend equivalent shares, if any, will be based\non: (1) the number of PSUs earned at vesting; and (2) on dividends that would have\nbeen paid on the Firm\u2019s common stock during the vesting period as of each dividend\npayment date, if any. Under rules applicable in the U.K., for Mr. Pinto, the PSUs\nare not eligible for reinvested dividend equivalent shares and an assessment is\nalso made of his qualitative performance in determining the ultimate number of\nPSUs that will vest.\n\n3 For NEOs other than Mr. Pinto, RSUs vest in two equal installments on January\n13, 2023 and 2024. Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of common\nstock on the vesting date and non-preferential dividend equivalents, payable in\ncash, equal to any dividends paid on the Firm\u2019s common stock during the vesting\nperiod. Under rules applicable in the U.K., for Mr. Pinto, RSUs vest in five equal\ninstallments on January 13, 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028 are subject to a\ntwelve-month holding period post-vesting. Mr. Pinto\u2019s RSUs are not eligible for\ndividend equivalents.\n\n4 SARs cliff vest on the fifth anniversary of the Grant Date, and will become\nexercisable no earlier than the vest date. Net shares delivered from the exercise\nmust be held until the tenth anniversary of the Grant Date.\n\n5 For NEOs other than Mr. Pinto, the grant date fair value for RSUs and PSUs is\nbased on the average of the high and the low prices of JPMorgan Chase common stock\non the grant date multiplied by the number of shares granted (for RSUs) or target\nnumber of PSUs.

The Plan was\nfrozen with respect to pay credit contributions, effective January 1, 2020, and\nfrozen with respect to new entrants into the Plan, effective January 1, 2019.\nEmployees became fully vested in the value of their Plan benefits as a result of\nthis change. The years of service listed above are as of the freeze date. The Plan\nemployed a cash balance formula (in the form of pay and interest credits) to\ndetermine amounts at retirement. Pay credits ceased effective with the plan\nfreeze. Interest credits, which generally equal the yield on one-year U.S.\nTreasury bills plus 1% (subject to a minimum of 4.5%), continue to accrue. Account\nbalances include the value of benefits earned under prior heritage company plans,\nif any. Benefits are payable as an actuarially equivalent lifetime annuity with\nsurvivorship rights (if married) or optionally under a variety of other payment\nforms, including a single-sum distribution.\n                                                                                  \n  Excess Retirement Plan \u2014                                                        \n                                                                                  \nBenefits were determined under the same terms and conditions as the Retirement\nPlan, but reflecting base salary in excess of IRS limits up to $1 million and\nbenefit amounts in excess of IRS limits. Benefits are generally payable in a lump\nsum in the year following termination. The plan is closed to new participants and\naccruals under the plan were discontinued as of May 1, 2009.\n                                                      \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.    78    2022 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                                  \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION |EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n  TABLES                                          \n                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Present value of accumulated benefits \u2014                                         \n                                                                                  \nThe valuation method and all material assumptions used to calculate the amounts\nabove are consistent with those reflected in Note 8 to the Firm\u2019s Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in the 2021 Form 10-K on pages 215-217. Key assumptions\ninclude the discount rate (2.85%); interest rates (4.75% crediting to project cash\nbalances; 2.00% to convert annuities to lump sums and lump sums to annuities) and\nmortality rates (for the present value of annuities, the Pri-2012 (white-collar)\nprojected generational mortality table with projection scale MP2021; for lump\nsums, the UP94 mortality table projected to 2002, with 50%/50% male/female\nweighting). We assumed benefits would commence at normal retirement date or\nunreduced retirement date, if earlier. Benefits paid from the Retirement Plan were\nassumed to be paid either as single-sum distributions (with probability of 85%) or\nlife annuities (with probability of 15%).

In addition, there are balances in\ndeemed investment choices from heritage company plans that are no longer open to\nnew deferrals.\n\nInvestment returns in 2021 for the following investment choices were: Short-Term\nFixed Income, 0.21%; Interest Income, 2.98%; Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond\nIndex, (1.82)%; High-Yield, 3.68%; Balanced Portfolio, 12.63%; S&P 500 Index,\n28.66%; Mid-Cap Index, 24.36%; Russell 2000 Index, 14.69%; REIT Index, 40.21%;\nInternational, (1.54)%; and JPMorgan Chase common stock, including dividend\nequivalents, 27.73)%.\n\nBeginning with deferrals credited January 2005 under the Deferred Compensation\nPlan, participants were required to elect to receive distribution of the deferral\nbalance beginning either following retirement or termination or in a specific year\nbut no earlier than the second anniversary of the date the deferral would\notherwise have been paid. If retirement or termination were elected, payments will\ncommence during the calendar year following retirement or termination.\nParticipants may elect the distribution to be lump sum or annual installments for\na maximum of 15 years. With respect to deferrals made after December 31, 2004,\nunder the Deferred Compensation Plan, account balances are automatically paid as a\nlump sum in the year following termination if employment terminates prior to the\nparticipant attaining 15 years of service. With respect to deferrals made after\nDecember 31, 2017, account balances are automatically paid as a lump sum in the\nyear following termination if employment terminates prior to the participant\nattaining 5 years of service.\n\nThe Supplemental Savings and Investment Plan (\u201cSSIP\u201d) is a heritage plan\napplicable to former Bank One employees which is closed to new participants and\ndoes not permit new deferrals. It functions similarly to the Deferred Compensation\nPlan. The investment return in 2021 for the following investment choice was:\nShort-Term Fixed Income, 0.14%. With respect to the SSIP, account balances are\nautomatically paid as a lump sum in the year following termination unless an\ninstallment option is elected prior to termination of employment.\n                                                      \n  2022 PROXY STATEMENT    79    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                            \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES| EXECUTIVE  \n  COMPENSATION                              \n                                            \nVII. 2021 POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL\n\nWe believe our pay practices relating to termination events, summarized below,\nillustrate our commitment to sound corporate governance, are consistent with best\npractices and are aligned with the interests of shareholders.\n                                                                                  \n   TERMINATION POLICIES ALIGNED WITH SHAREHOLDER INTERESTS                        \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                    \u2022NEOs are not entitled to any accelerated     \n  No golden parachute agreements    cash/equity payments or special benefits      \n                                    upon a change in control                      \n                                    \u2022All of the U.S. based NEOs are \u201cat will\u201d     \n                                    employees and are not covered by employment   \n  No employment agreements          agreements                                    \n                                    \u2022Mr. Pinto's terms of employment reflect      \n                                    applicable U.K. legal standards               \n                                    \u2022Severance amounts for NEOs are capped at     \n  No special cash severance         one-year salary, not to exceed $400,000 (or   \n                                    \u00a3275,000 in the case of Mr. Pinto)            \n  No special executive benefits     \u2022NEOs are not entitled to any special         \n                                    benefits upon termination                     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Standard, broad-based severance                                                 \n                                                                                  \nMr. Dimon, Mr. Smith, Ms. Erdoes, Ms. Piepszak and Mr. Barnum are covered under\nthe Firm\u2019s broad-based U.S. Severance Pay Plan.

Employees remain eligible for coverage at active\nemployee rates under certain of the Firm\u2019s employee welfare plans (such as medical\nand dental) for up to six months after their employment terminates. Mr. Pinto is\ncovered under the Firm\u2019s U.K. Discretionary Redundancy Policy, which provides for\na lump sum payment on termination based on base salary and length of service and\nsubject to a cap of \u00a3275,000. In addition, in the event of termination by the Firm\nfor reasons other than cause, employees may be considered, at the discretion of\nthe Firm, for a cash payment in lieu of an annual incentive compensation award,\ntaking into consideration all circumstances the Firm deems relevant, including the\ncircumstances of the employee\u2019s leaving and the employee\u2019s contributions to the\nFirm over his or her career. Severance benefits and any such discretionary payment\nare subject to execution of a release in favor of the Firm and certain post-\ntermination restrictions.\n\nThe table on the following page sets forth the benefits and compensation which the\nNamed Executive Officers would have received if their employment had terminated on\nDecember 31, 2021. The amounts shown in the table on the following page do not\ninclude other payments and benefits available generally to salaried employees upon\ntermination of employment, such as accrued vacation pay, distributions from the\n401(k) Savings Plan, pension and deferred compensation plans, or any death,\ndisability or post retirement welfare benefits available under broad-based\nemployee plans. For information on the pension and deferred compensation plans,\nsee \u201cTable V: 2021 Pension benefits\u201d on page 78 and \u201cTable VI: 2021 Non-qualified\ndeferred compensation\u201d on page 79.

Rather, under certain termination scenarios including\ndisability, death, termination without cause, or resignation (if full-career\neligible), NEOs\u2019 outstanding equity awards continue to vest in accordance with\ntheir terms (or accelerate in the event of death). The table on the following page\nshows the value of these unvested RSUs, PSUs and SARs based on the closing price\nof our common stock on December 31, 2021 (for SARs it is the closing price of our\ncommon stock price on December 31, 2021, minus the applicable exercise price of\nthe SARs).\n                                                                                  \n  Government Office provision                                                     \n                                                                                  \nEmployees with applicable awards, including NEOs, are covered under the Firm\u2019s\nGovernment Office provision which allows for continued vesting of equity awards if\nthe employee resigns to accept a covered government office. For such employees who\nare full-career eligible, outstanding performance year awards continue to vest in\naccordance with their terms whether they leave the Firm to enter government\nservice or otherwise, so, for these awards, the Government Office provision does\nnot provide any benefit to employees who are full-career eligible. All NEOs meet\nthe full-career eligibility provision of their applicable awards. 1\n\nFor employees who are not full-career eligible, and for awards that do not have\nfull career eligibility provisions, the value of awards that would continue to\nvest as a result of the Government Office provision of our equity plan would equal\na percentage of the unvested stock awards ranging from 0% prior to three years of\nemployment by the Firm to 50% after three years of employment increasing to 100%\nafter five years.\n\n1 Refer to Notes 3 and 6 on page 81.\n

share units\u201d refer to\npreviously granted, outstanding equity awards. NEOs are not entitled to any\nadditional equity awards in connection with a potential termination.\n\n2 Involuntary terminations without cause include involuntary terminations due to\nredundancies and involuntary terminations without alternative employment. For\n\u201cSeverance and other\u201d, amounts shown represent severance under the Firm\u2019s broad-\nbased U.S. Severance Pay Plan, or the U.K. Discretionary Redundancy Policy in the\ncase of Mr. Pinto. Base salary greater than $400,000 per year, or \u00a3275,000 in the\ncase of Mr. Pinto, is disregarded for purposes of determining severance amounts.\nThe rate used to convert Mr. Pinto\u2019s eligible severance to U.S. dollars was the\nblended spot rate for the month of December 2021, which was $1.33202 U.S. dollars\nper British pound sterling.\n\n3 For employees in good standing who have resigned and have met full-career\neligibility or other acceptable criteria, awards continue to vest over time on\ntheir original schedule, provided that the employees, for the remainder of the\nvesting period, do not perform services for a financial services company or work\nin their profession (whether or not for a financial services company); provided\nthat employees may work for a government, education or not-for-profit\norganization. The awards shown represent RSUs and PSUs that would continue to vest\nbecause the Named Executive Officers have met the full-career eligibility\ncriteria. The awards are subject to continuing post-employment obligations to the\nFirm during this period.\n\n4 In the case of disability, stock awards continue to vest pursuant to their\noriginal vesting schedule.\n\n5 Vesting restrictions on stock awards and PSU awards lapse immediately upon\ndeath.\n\n6 The Government Office provision of an award does not provide any benefit to\nemployees who have met the full-career eligibility provision of that same award.\nTherefore, under the terms of the Government Office provision, Named Executive\nOfficers would generally not receive any benefit upon termination since they meet\nthe full-career eligibility provision entitling them to continued vesting of their\nequity awards (see preceding Note 3). For awards that do not have the full career\neligibility provision, the amount reported is based on the December 31, 2021 value\nof the award in which the NEO is eligible to continue to vest.\n\n7 For death, represents the value of PSUs granted on January 15, 2019, January 21,\n2020 and January 19, 2021, assuming: (a) maximum payout related to 2019, 2020 and\n2021 performance years; (b) target payout related to 2022 and 2023 performance\nyears; and (c) accumulated reinvested dividend equivalent shares as of December\n31, 2021. For involuntary without cause, full career eligibility provision and\ndisability, target payout is assumed for the PSUs granted on January 21, 2020 and\nJanuary 29, 2021.\n                                                      \n  2022 PROXY STATEMENT    81    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                                    \n  CEO PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE| EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                                                    \nCEO pay ratio disclosure\n\nWe are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual\ntotal compensation of our estimated median employee and the annual total\ncompensation of Mr. Dimon, our Chairman and CEO.\n\nCEO PAY RATIO\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021:\n\n\u2022 The annual total compensation of Mr. Dimon was $84,435,729 1 including Firm-paid\nemployee benefits, or $31,815,729 excluding the one-time special award described\non page 66\n\n\u2022 The annual total compensation of our estimated median employee was $92,112,\nincluding Firm-paid employee benefits 2 and change in pension value\n\n\u2022 This represents a ratio of 917 to 1, or 346 to 1 excluding the one-time special\naward\n\nIDENTIFYING OUR MEDIAN EMPLOYEE\n\nFor our disclosure in the 2021 proxy statement, we identified our estimated median\nemployee using annual total compensation for performance year 2020 based on data\nfrom the Firm's global compensation system as of February 28, 2021. Annual total\ncompensation included salary as of December 31, 2020, as well as overtime pay,\nfixed allowance and incentive compensation, if applicable. We annualized the\nsalary portion of the compensation for employees who were hired during 2020;\nhowever, we did not make any full-time equivalent adjustments to part-time,\ntemporary and seasonal employees. We did not apply any cost-of-living adjustments\nas part of the calculation. In determining the scope of our employees (other than\nour CEO), we included our global workforce of full-time, part-time, temporary and\nseasonal employees who were employed as of December 31, 2020.\n\nWe believe there were no material changes in our employee population or employee\ncompensation arrangements in 2021 that would have necessitated a change to our CEO\npay ratio calculation methodology. Therefore, as permitted under SEC rules, for\nthis year\u2019s disclosure we have used the 2021 annual total compensation of the same\nestimated median employee that we identified for last year's disclosure.\n\nCOMPARABILITY\n\nWe believe the ratio above is a reasonable estimate, based on the methodology we\nhave described. Given the different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and\nassumptions other companies may use to calculate their respective CEO pay ratios,\nas well as differences in employment and compensation practices between companies,\nthe estimated ratio reported above may not be comparable to that reported by other\ncompanies.\n\n1 For purposes of the CEO pay ratio disclosure, Mr. Dimon\u2019s annual total\ncompensation includes the amount reported in the \u201cTotal\u201d column of the 2021\nSummary Compensation Table on page 74, plus the value of Firm-paid healthcare\nbenefits applicable to Mr. Dimon.\n\n2 The estimated median employee\u2019s Firm-paid employee benefits include healthcare\nbenefits and 401(k) retirement plan contributions.\n                                                      \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.    82    2022 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                                 \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION |SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF  \n  DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS               \n                                                 \nSecurity ownership of directors and\nexecutive officers\n\nOur share retention policies require\nshare ownership for directors and\nexecutive officers, as described on\npages 33 and 50, respectively.\n\nThe following table shows the number of\nshares of common stock and common stock\nequivalents beneficially owned by each\ndirector, the current executive\nofficers named in the SCT, and all\ndirectors and executive officers as a\ngroup as of February 28, 2022.

For information on the factors\nreviewed by the Audit Committee, see\nthe Audit Committee Report on pages\n89-90.\n\nThe members of the Audit Committee and\nthe Board believe that continued\nretention of PwC as the Firm\u2019s\nindependent external auditor is in the\nbest interests of JPMorgan Chase and\nits shareholders. PwC and its\npredecessors have acted as our\nindependent registered public\naccounting firm since 1965. The Board\nbelieves the Firm receives significant\nbenefits from the extensive history PwC\nhas with the Firm. These benefits\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 the high quality of their audit work\nand accounting advice, as a result of\ntheir institutional knowledge of our\nbusinesses, global operations, key\nrisks, accounting policies, financial\nsystems and internal control framework;\n\n\u2022 their audit efficiency and\neffectiveness, which results in a lower\nfee structure due to their history and\nfamiliarity with our businesses;\n\n\u2022 the time and expense that would be\navoided by management and staff in\norder to onboard a new auditor; and\n\n\u2022 their commitment to maintaining their\nindependence from the Firm.\n\nA member of PwC will be present at the\nannual meeting and will have the\nopportunity to make a statement and\nrespond to appropriate questions from\nshareholders.\n\nBoard oversight of PwC\n\nThe Audit Committee held eight private\nsessions with PwC during 2021.\n\nThe Audit Committee assesses PwC\u2019s\nindependence throughout the year. This\nincludes reviewing with PwC its\npractices for maintaining its\nindependence. The Audit Committee has\nalso established policies and\nprocedures for approving services\nprovided by PwC. It is JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\npolicy to use PwC only for audit and\naudit-related services, and tax\nservices in certain circumstances. For\nmore information see Audit Committee\nApproval Policies and Procedures on\npage 88.\n\nNo member of PwC\u2019s audit team may be\nhired by the Firm for a period of one\nyear after such person transferred from\nthe Firm\u2019s audit engagement to another\nrole at PwC, or has terminated\nemployment with PwC. Further, no former\nPwC employee who was a manager or\npartner may be hired by the Firm as the\nCFO, Principal Accounting Officer,\nGeneral Auditor, Treasurer, Director of\nTax or CFO or Controller of a LOB or\nCorporate function for a period of two\nyears following his or her termination\nof employment with PwC.\n\nIn accordance with SEC rules and PwC\npolicies, audit partners are subject to\nrotation requirements to limit the\nnumber of consecutive years of service\nan individual partner may provide audit\nservices to our Firm. The lead audit\npartner and quality review partner may\nprovide services to our Firm for a\nmaximum of five consecutive years. As a\nresult of the rotation requirements, a\nnew lead audit partner was selected\nlast year for the 2021 audit\nengagement. The Audit Committee was\ndirectly involved in the selection of\nthe new lead audit partner.\n                                                      \n  2022 PROXY STATEMENT    87    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                                 \n  RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC  \n  ACCOUNTING FIRM| AUDIT MATTERS                 \n                                                 \nFees paid to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for\nnegotiating the terms and fees\nassociated with the Firm\u2019s retention of\nPwC, including the annual integrated\naudit of the Firm\u2019s Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.

Audit fees For the years ended December 31, 2021 and\n2020, fees for the annual integrated audit of the Firm\u2019s Consolidated Financial\nStatements and of the Firm\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, and\nquarterly reviews of the Firm\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements, were $41.8\nmillion and $40.3 million, respectively. Fees for services related to\nstatutory/subsidiary audits, attestation reports required by statute or\nregulation, and comfort letters and consents related to SEC filings and other\nsimilar filings with non-U.S. authorities were $22.1 million and $34.8 million,\nrespectively. The reduction in Audit fees with PwC is primarily driven by\nmandatory audit firm rotations as required by regulators in Europe.\n\nAudit-related fees Audit-related fees comprise assurance and related services that\nare traditionally performed by the independent registered public accounting firm.\nThese services include attestation and agreed-upon procedures which address\naccounting, reporting and control matters relating to fiduciary, transaction\nprocessing, investment management and servicing activities; reviews related to\ninvestment and lending processes, and technology systems; and due diligence\nreviews related to acquisitions and divestitures. These services are normally\nprovided in connection with the recurring audit engagement. Tax fees Fees for the\nyears ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, for tax compliance and tax return\npreparation services were $3.8 million and $2.5 million, respectively. Fees for\nother tax services, including tax advisory and consultation on tax matters, were\n$0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively. Audit Committee approval policies and\nprocedures The Audit Committee\u2019s policies and procedures require the Audit\nCommittee to pre-approve a list of specified audit, audit-related and tax\nservices, and review and approve the terms and fees for the annual integrated\naudit of the Consolidated Financial Statements. All requests for audit, audit-\nrelated and tax services that are not on the pre-approved list of specified\nservices must be approved by the Audit Committee. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s pre-approval\npolicy does not provide for a de minimis exception under which the pre-approval\nrequirement may be waived. Pre-approved services to be performed by PwC with\nestimated costs in excess of $250,000 are approved by the Chair of the Audit\nCommittee; and pre-approved services with estimated costs less than or equal to\n$250,000 are delegated to the Firmwide Controller\u2019s office for approval.\n                                                      \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.    88    2022 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                                         \n  AUDIT MATTERS |AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT  \n                                         \nAudit Committee report\n\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of\nDirectors of JPMorgan Chase is\ncomprised of three non-management\ndirectors. The Board has determined\nthat each member of our committee has\nno material relationship with the Firm\nunder the Board\u2019s director independence\nstandards and that each member is\nindependent under the listing standards\nof the NYSE, where the Firm\u2019s\nsecurities are listed, and under the\nSEC\u2019s standards relating to the\nindependence of audit committees. The\nBoard has also determined that each\nmember is financially literate and is\nan audit committee financial expert as\ndefined by the SEC.\n\nCharter\n\nThe Audit Committee operates under a\nwritten charter adopted by the Board,\nwhich is available on our website at jp\nmorganchase.com/about/governance/board-\ncommittees/audit-committee, under the\nheading \u201cAudit Committee\u201d located under\nBoard Committees, which is in the\nGovernance section of the Who We Are\ntab. We annually review our charter and\nour practices. We have determined that\nour charter and practices are\nconsistent with the listing standards\nof the NYSE and the provisions of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The purpose\nof the Audit Committee is to assist the\nBoard in its oversight of:\n\n\u2022 the independent registered public\naccounting firm\u2019s qualifications and\nindependence,\n\n\u2022 the performance of the Firm's\ninternal audit function and the\nindependent registered public\naccounting firm, and\n\n\u2022 management\u2019s responsibilities to\nassure that there is in place an\neffective system of controls reasonably\ndesigned to safeguard the assets and\nincome of the Firm; assure the\nintegrity of the Firm\u2019s financial\nstatements; and maintain compliance\nwith the Firm\u2019s ethical standards,\npolicies, plans and procedures, and\nwith laws and regulations.\n\nAudit communications and fees\n\nWe discussed with PwC the matters\nrequired to be discussed by Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board\n(\u201cPCAOB\u201d) Auditing Standard No. 1301,\nCommunications with Audit Committees,\nincluding PwC\u2019s overall audit scope and\naudit approach as set forth in the\nterms of their engagement letter; PwC\u2019s\noverall audit strategy for significant\naudit risks identified by them; and the\nnature and extent of the specialized\nskills necessary to perform the planned\naudit. We have established procedures\nto receive and track the handling of\nissues regarding accounting and\nreporting, internal control and\nauditing matters. In addition, we\nmonitor the audit, audit-related and\ntax services provided by PwC. The Audit\nCommittee has also evaluated and\nconcluded that audit-related and tax\nservices provided by PwC do not impair\nPwC\u2019s independence.\n\nDetails of the fees paid to PwC for its\nservices, as well as the Audit\nCommittee\u2019s \u201cpre-approval policy\u201d for\nsuch services, can be found on page 88.\n\nAssessment of PwC\n\nThe Audit Committee annually reviews\nPwC\u2019s qualifications, performance and\nindependence in connection with its\ndetermination as to whether to retain\nPwC.

The Firm\u2019s\nInternal Audit function, under the\ndirection of the General Auditor, is\nindependent of the Firm\u2019s businesses\nand the Independent Risk Management\nfunction. Internal Audit reports\ndirectly to the Audit Committee (and\nadministratively to the Firm\u2019s CEO) and\nis responsible for preparing an annual\naudit plan and conducting internal\naudits intended to independently test\nand evaluate the Firm\u2019s governance,\nrisk management and internal controls.\nThe members of the Audit Committee are\nnot professionally engaged in the\npractice of accounting or auditing; as\nnoted above, the Audit Committee\u2019s\nresponsibility is to monitor and\noversee these processes.\n\nThe Audit Committee regularly meets and\nholds discussions with the Firm\u2019s\nmanagement, internal auditors and with\nPwC, and also holds private sessions\nwith the General Auditor and with PwC\nwithout members of\n\nmanagement present. These discussions\ninclude issues encountered during the\naudit, the Firm\u2019s quarterly earnings\nmaterials, and Quarterly and Annual\nReports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K,\nrespectively, prior to filing with the\nSEC; as well as actions the Audit\nCommittee has taken during the prior\nyear.\n\nManagement represented to us that\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s Consolidated Financial\nStatements were prepared in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of\nAmerica (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). We reviewed and\ndiscussed JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Consolidated\nFinancial Statements with management,\nthe General Auditor and PwC. We also\nreviewed and discussed with PwC the\nquality of the Firm\u2019s significant\naccounting principles, the\nreasonableness of critical accounting\nestimates and judgments, critical audit\nmatters PwC identified during the\naudit, and the disclosures in JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s Consolidated Financial\nStatements, including disclosures\nrelating to significant accounting\npolicies.

Supporting\nStatement While JPMC has asserted that\nit is taking \"comprehensive steps\" 1 to\nalign with the climate goals of the\nParis Agreement\", the company's\nposition as a leading financier of\nfossil fuel conflicts with a scenario\nin which global warming does not exceed\n1.5\u00b0C. For instance, in May 2021, the\nInternational Energy Agency (IEA) found\nthat for the world to limit warming to\n1.5 degrees Celsius by 2050, effective\nimmediately \"there is no need for\ninvestment in new fossil fuel supply.\"\n2 The IEA's 1.5 degree scenario does\nnot contemplate new fossil fuel\ndevelopment, but the Company continues\nto finance it. Exceeding a 1.5\u00b0\nscenario jeopardizes the global\neconomy. Under current emission\ntrajectories, 10% of total global\neconomic value has been estimated to be\nlost by 2050. 3 Limiting warming to 1.5\nversus 2 degrees could save $20\ntrillion globally by 2100; exceeding 2\ndegrees could lead to climate damages\nin the hundreds of trillions. To\ndiversified investors, continued\nsupport for fossil fuel development\nthreatens long-term portfolio value;\nfor banks, it means increased credit,\nmarket, and operational risks. 4 Even\nshort-term fossil fuel financing\ncontributes to long-term risk: the\nIPCC's 2021 report confirmed that\nhistoric and current emissions have\nlocked in warming for the next two\ndecades. 5 In May 2021, JPMC released\n2030 targets for oil and gas, electric\npower and autos as part of its \"Paris-\naligned financing commitment\". The\nbank's 2030 targets specify reductions\nin carbon intensity \u2014 that is,\ngreenhouse gas emissions per unit of\noutput. These targets are compatible\nwith expansion of fossil fuels. The\nintensity targets do not meet the\nidentified need, over the next decade,\nto cut global absolute emissions by\n45%. JPMC has been identified as the\nlargest funder of companies expanding\noil and gas production. 6 Some of these\noil and gas companies have set\nintensity reduction targets meeting or\nexceeding what JPMC is calling for,\neven as they plan continued oil and gas\nexpansion.\n\nPublic calls for an end to fossil fuel\nfinance have grown and threaten JPMC's\nreputation. For example, in September\n2021, JPMC and other large banks were\nnamed in an op-ed by youth climate\nactivists calling on the banks to stop\nfinancing expansion of fossil fuels. 7\nWe urge shareholders to vote in favor\nof this proposal, to encourage JPMorgan\nChase align with global efforts to\ncontain climate change. Board Response\nto Proposal 4 The Board of Directors\nrecommends that shareholders vote\nAGAINST this proposal for the following\nreasons:\n                                                                                  \n  \u2022JPMorgan Chase is actively addressing climate change-related risks and         \n  opportunities, including by operationalizing Paris-aligned targets for          \n  financed emissions in the Oil & Gas, Electric Power and Automotive              \n  Manufacturing sectors and targeting $2.5 trillion for sustainable development   \n  including $1 trillion in financing and facilitating climate action.             \n  \u2022The Firm's targets for both emission reductions and financing encompass both   \n  energy supply and demand, consistent with the challenges and opportunities of   \n  the low carbon transition.                                                      \n  \u2022The Firm works with traditional energy clients to help develop their           \n  long-term business strategies to improve their carbon disclosures and reduce    \n  their carbon emissions.                                                         \n  \u2022An abrupt withdrawal from financing new oil and natural gas projects could     \n  trigger unintended, negative consequences, including increasing energy price    \n  volatility without decarbonizing demand which is important to address climate   \n  change. Energy insecurity exacerbated by geopolitical turmoil further           \n  underscores the need for pragmatic efforts to support energy producers on       \n  decarbonizing reliable sources of supply.                                       \n  \u2022We have engaged extensively with our shareholders regarding the Firm's         \n  approach to climate change-related risks and opportunities, and shareholders    \n  have been largely supportive, including with respect to our use of              \n  Paris-aligned emission intensity targets.                                       \n  \u2022Management is best positioned to make decisions on which types of economic     \n  activity to finance, as a fundamental part of day-to-day operations of our      \n  core business in the interests of our shareholders and stakeholders.            \n                                                                                  \n1 https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210213005492/en/JPMorgan-Chase-\nReleases-Carbon-Reduction-Targets-for-Paris-Aligned-Financing-Commitment\n\n2 https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050 p 21\n\n3 https://www.swissre.com/institute/research/topics-and-risk-dialogues/climate-\nand-natural-catastrophe-risk/expertise-publication-economics-of-climate-\nchange.html\n\n4 https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/banking/climate-change-risk-banks\n\n5 https://nytimes.com/2021/08/09/climate/climate-change-report-ipcc-un.html\n\n6 https://www.bankingonclimatechaos.org/\n\n7 https://www.teenvogue.com/story/banks-fund-fossil-fuels\n                                                      \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.    92    2022 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                         \n  SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                         \nIn 2021, JPMorgan Chase announced our\napproach to align key sectors of our\nfinancing portfolio with the goals of\nthe Paris Agreement and later in the\nyear announced our support for the\ngoals of the Net Zero Banking Alliance.\nWe have initially developed\nintermediate Paris-aligned targets to\nreduce the carbon intensity in our Oil\n& Gas, Electric Power and Automotive\nManufacturing portfolios by 2030,\npursuing Paris-aligned emission targets\non a sector-by-sector basis. We are\nbeginning to operationalize these\ntargets across the Firm and have\nannounced that we will provide details\nof our progress in our next climate\nreport, which we plan to publish in\nfall 2022. A core principle of our\nstrategy is to work with traditional\nenergy clients to help develop their\nlong-term business strategies to reduce\ntheir carbon emissions and improve\ntheir carbon disclosures. Our Center\nfor Carbon Transition, founded in 2020,\nprovides clients with financing,\nresearch and advisory solutions to\nsupport them in their transition to a\nlow-carbon future. Moreover, as part of\na $2.5 trillion sustainable development\ntarget, we are targeting $1 trillion\nthrough 2030 to finance and facilitate\nclimate action, and are increasingly\nadvancing net zero solutions such as\nrenewable energy, energy efficiency and\nvehicle electrification. We will share\ninformation on our progress in our ESG\nReport this spring. The International\nEnergy Agency's (IEA) net zero\nscenario, which is cited by the\nproposal, is in fact based on \"an\nunwavering policy focus on climate\nchange\" driving a decline in fossil\nfuel demand that is supported by \"huge\nleaps in clean energy innovation\" and\nresulting in a \"complete\ntransformation\" of the energy system. 8\nJPMorgan Chase's approach to helping to\naddress climate change is consistent\nwith this holistic view of the changes\nrequired. There must be a wide range of\nsimultaneous decarbonization policies\nand actions across the supply and\ndemand sides of the energy system.\nHowever, a number of requirements for\nthis systemic transformation are not\ncurrently in place, and abrupt\nfinancing shocks on the supply side are\nnot the solution. In contrast to this\nholistic approach, the proposal\nrequests that the Firm adopt a policy\nin 2022 to cease financing of new\nfossil fuel supplies. The proposal\nfails to consider the significant risks\nassociated with such a policy.\nAccording to IEA, \"if the supply side\nmoves away from oil and gas before the\nworld's consumers do, then the world\ncould face periods of market tightness\nand volatility.\" 9 Energy insecurity\nexacerbated by geopolitical turmoil\nfurther underscores the need for\npragmatic efforts to support energy\nproducers on decarbonizing reliable\nsources of supply. In addition, even as\nthe world transitions away from fossil\nfuels in the coming decades, there will\ncontinue to be hydrocarbon demand.\nCurrently there are not adequate,\ncommercially available low carbon\nenergy solutions for all of the world's\nneeds, such as in harder-to-abate\nsectors such as industrial,\nmanufacturing and heavy transportation.\nWe believe that decarbonizing demand is\nimportant and that\n\nclimate objectives must be pursued\nalongside social and economic ones to\nfacilitate a just transition. The Firm\nreceived feedback on its approach to\naddressing climate change-related risks\nand opportunities in extensive\nengagements with shareholders, which in\n2021, included reaching out to more\nthan 150 shareholders, together\nrepresenting over 50% of the Firm's\noutstanding common stock. The Firm's\napproach was largely supported by\nshareholders in these engagements,\nincluding with respect to our use of\nParis-aligned emission intensity\ntargets. We also share information\nabout our approach to and performance\non ESG topics, including climate\nchange, on the Sustainability page of\nour website which includes the Firm's\nannual ESG Report. As a diversified\nfinancial institution, JPMorgan Chase\nconducts many business activities, and\nit is management's responsibility to\ndetermine whether and how to provide\nfinancing to specific sectors,\ncompanies and projects. These decisions\nare fundamental to the Firm's day-to-\nday operations and require complex\nbusiness judgments that the Firm's\nmanagement is best positioned to make,\nwith the oversight of the Board. The\nBoard opposes this proposal given the\nFirm's existing efforts to help address\nclimate change and the significant\nmarket and energy insecurity risks\nassociated with a complete and imminent\nwithdrawal from financing for new\nfossil fuel supply.\n                                       \n  The Board of Directors recommends a  \n  voteAGAINSTthis proposal.            \n                                       \n8 IEA (2021), Net Zero by 2050 , IEA, Paris, https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-\nby-2050\n\n9 IEA (2021), World Energy Outlook 202 1, IEA, Paris,\nhttps://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2021\n                                                      \n  2022 PROXY STATEMENT    93    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                         \n  SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                         \nProposal 5 \u2014 Special shareholder\nmeeting improvement\n\nJohn Chevedden has advised us that he\nintends to introduce the following\nresolution: Shareholders ask our board\nto take the steps necessary to amend\nthe appropriate company governing\ndocuments to give the owners of a\ncombined 10% of our outstanding common\nstock the power to call a special\nshareholder meeting. Currently there is\na face value of 20% of shares that can\ncall a special shareholder meeting and\nit then goes downhill. 20% of shares\nequal 26% of shares that vote at the\nannual meeting. It would be hopeless to\nthink that the shares that do not have\nthe time to votes at the annual meeting\nwould have the time to take the special\nprocedural steps to call for a special\nshareholder meeting. Then all shares\nare owned, but not owned long, are 100%\nexcluded. Thus the shareholders who own\n20% of stock could determine that they\nown 26% of the shares that vote and\nmore than 30% of shares when their\nshares not owned long are included. A\nrealistic 30% stock ownership threshold\nto call a special shareholder meeting\nis not much for management to brag\nabout especially when we have a useless\nright to act by written consent.\nManagement made a rule that it is\nmandatory to have the backing of 20% of\nall shares in existence to do so little\nas to ask for record date for written\nconsent. Why would any group of\nshareholders, who own 20% of our\ncompany, find it attractive to do so\nlittle as to obtain a date on a\ncalendar from management when these\nsame owners of 20% of our company could\ncompel management to hold a special\nshareholder meeting. JPM shareholders\ngave 47%-support to a 2021 shareholder\nproposal to reform our useless right to\nact by written consent in spite of\nover-zealous JPM management opposition.\nThis 47%-support likely well-exceeded\n51%-support from the share that have\naccess to independent proxy voting\nadvice and are not forced to rely on\nthe biased opinion of management. We\nneed a more useful right to call a\nspecial shareholder meeting due to the\nrecent onslaught of online annual\nmeeting which gives management more\ncontrol. The vast majority of 2021\nonline shareholder meetings dictated\nthat no shareholders could speak. A\nreasonable shareholder right to call\nfor a special shareholder meeting to\nelect a new director can make\nshareholder engagement meaningful. If\nmanagement tends to lack good faith in\nits shareholder engagement, a right for\nshareholders to call for a special\nmeeting in our bylaws can make\nmanagement think twice. We have no\nprotection in our\n\nbylaws that any sort of shareholder\nengagement will be continued. To make\nup for our lack of a real right to act\nby written consent we need the right of\n10% of shares to call for a special\nshareholder meeting. Please vote yes:\nSpecial Shareholder Meeting Improvement\n\u2014 Proposal 5 Board Response to Proposal\n5 The Board of Directors recommends\nthat shareholders vote AGAINST this\nproposal for the following reasons:\n                                                                                  \n  \u2022JPMorgan Chase already provides for shareholders\u2019 rights to call a special     \n  meeting and to act by written consent.                                          \n  \u2022The provisions governing these rights strike a thoughtful balance between      \n  protecting the interests of all of our shareholders and avoiding a waste of     \n  resources to address narrowly supported interests, and are consistent with      \n  industry best practices.                                                        \n  \u2022The Firm's current 20% ownership threshold required to call a special          \n  meeting, which the proposal seeks to significantly destabilize, provides        \n  important protections for the benefit of all shareholders. The current          \n  ownership threshold mitigates the risk of the right being monopolized by a few  \n  large shareholders and provides smaller shareholders with aligned interests an  \n  opportunity to join in the call for a special meeting on topics that are        \n  important to them.                                                              \n  \u2022Our approach to these important shareholder rights is part of the Firm's       \n  strong corporate governance practices which include providing shareholders      \n  with opportunities to engage with the Board.                                    \n                                                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase has strong corporate\ngovernance practices for the benefit of\nall shareholders, large and small.\nShareholders already have opportunities\nto engage with the Board, as described\nbelow in more detail. The Firm's\ncurrent right to call a special meeting\nprovides one such opportunity while\nthoughtfully balancing the protection\nof the interests of all of our\nshareholders and avoiding actions\nintended to address only narrowly\nsupported interests. JPMorgan Chase\nalready provides shareholders with the\nright to call special meetings, whereas\n40% of S&P 500 companies do not. Of the\nS&P 500 companies that provide for this\nright at all, more than 60% require a\nhigher ownership threshold than\nJPMorgan Chase. Said differently, by\nallowing shareholders that hold in the\naggregate 20% or more of our\noutstanding shares of common stock to\ncall a special meeting, the Firm\nalready provides shareholders with a\nspecial meeting right that is\nconsistent with industry best\npractices. In addition, JPMorgan Chase\nshareholders holding the same 20% also\nhave the right to act by written\nconsent, and the\n                                                      \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.    94    2022 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                         \n  SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                         \nFirm is one of less than a quarter of\nS&P 500 companies that provide\nshareholders with both special meeting\nand written consent rights. The Firm's\ncurrent threshold provides shareholders\nwith an opportunity to join in the call\nfor a special meeting on topics that\nare important to them, enhancing their\nability to drive corporate action\nthrough the special meeting right.\nHowever, by maintaining the 20%\nownership threshold, we also provide\nimportant protections for the benefit\nof all shareholders by mitigating the\nrisk of the special meeting right being\nmonopolized by a very small number of\nshareholders that together meet a lower\nownership threshold. The Firm's\napproach strikes the right balance\nbetween enabling our shareholders and\nprotecting against the unnecessary\nexpense or disruption that can be\nassociated with a special meeting that\nis only relevant to a relatively narrow\nconstituency. Importantly,\nshareholders\u2019 right to call a special\nmeeting is just one aspect of the\nFirm's ongoing commitment to strong\ncorporate governance that promotes\nlong-term shareholder value. Our\ncorporate governance practices include\nthe shareholder rights available under\nthe Firm\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation\nand By-Laws, including the right to act\nby written consent, proxy access and to\nannually elect directors by majority\nvote. More information about\nshareholder rights can be found on page\n34. The Firm\u2019s corporate governance\npractices also allow shareholders to\nengage directly with our Board and hold\nthe Board accountable. The Firm\nactively engages with shareholders on a\nwide variety of topics throughout the\nyear. Each year, the Firm conducts a\ncomprehensive formal shareholder\noutreach program. In 2021, through this\nprogram, we reached out to more than\n150 shareholders, together representing\nover 50% of the Firm\u2019s outstanding\ncommon stock, with the Lead Independent\nDirector participating in calls with\nshareholders representing approximately\n30%. The information gained from these\nengagements was shared with the Firm\u2019s\nsenior management and the Board and is\nconsidered in setting the strategic\ndirection of the Firm. Also in 2021,\nsenior management engaged with\ninvestors across approximately 25\ninvestor meetings and approximately 15\ninvestor conferences. More information\nabout our shareholder engagement\nefforts can be found on page 30. The\nFirm's existing special meeting\nprovisions provide a meaningful right\nto shareholders with appropriate\nsafeguards as part of the Firm's\nongoing commitment to strong corporate\ngovernance practices that promote long-\nterm shareholder value. The Board\nbelieves this proposal will not further\nshareholder interests.\n                                       \n  The Board of Directors recommends a  \n  voteAGAINSTthis proposal.            \n                                       \n                                                      \n  2022 PROXY STATEMENT    95    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                         \n  SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                         \nProposal 6 \u2014 Independent board chairman\n\nKenneth Steiner has advised us that he\nintends to introduce the following\nresolution: The shareholders request\nthat the Board of Directors adopt an\nenduring policy, and amend the\ngoverning documents as necessary in\norder that 2 separate people hold the\noffice of the Chairman and the office\nof the CEO as follows: Selection of the\nChairman of the Board The Board\nrequires the separation of the offices\nof the Chairman of the Board and the\nChief Executive Officer. Whenever\npossible, the Chairman of the Board\nshall be an Independent Director. The\nBoard has the discretion to select a\nTemporary Chairman of the Board who is\nnot an Independent Director to serve\nwhile the Board is seeking an\nIndependent Chairman of the Board. The\nChairman shall not be a former CEO of\nthe company. This policy could be\nphased in when there is a contract\nrenewal for our current CEO or for the\nnext CEO transition. This proposal\ntopic won 52% support at Boeing and 54%\nsupport at Baxter International in\n2020. Boeing then adopted this proposal\ntopic in 2020. The roles of Chairman\nand CEO are fundamentally different and\nshould be held by 2 directors, a CEO\nand a Chairman who is completely\nindependent of the CEO and our company.\nThis proposal topic won our 47% support\nat the 2021 JPM annual meeting. There\nare at least 2 ways this can be\nconsidered a majority vote. This 47%\nsupport likely represented a majority\nvote from the shares that have access\nto independent proxy voting advice and\nare not forced to rely too much on the\nbiased management voting\nrecommendations. This 47% support\nlikely represented a majority vote had\nJPM management not gone to the\ncorporate war chest and distributed red\nletter messages shortly before the\nannual meeting against shareholder\nproposals \u2014 drilling into shareholders\nthe message to vote the according to\nthe management party lines in every\ninstance. With the current CEO serving\nas Chair this means giving up a\nsubstantial check and balance safeguard\nthat can only occur with an independent\nBoard Chairman. A lead director is no\nsubstitute for an independent board\nchairman. A lead director cannot call a\nspecial shareholder meeting and cannot\neven call a special meeting of the\nboard. A lead director can delegate\nmost of the lead director duties to the\nCEO office and then simply rubber-stamp\nit. There is no way shareholders can be\nsure of what goes on.\n\nThe lack of an independent Board\nChairman is an unfortunate way to\ndiscourage new outside ideas and an\nunfortunate way to encourage the CEO to\npursue pet projects that would not\nstand up to the effective oversight.\nPlease vote yes: Proposal 6 \u2014\nIndependent Board Chairman Board\nResponse to Proposal 6 The Board of\nDirectors recommends that shareholders\nvote AGAINST this proposal for the\nfollowing reasons:\n                                                                                  \n  \u2022The Board has adopted a new general policy, upon the next CEO transition,      \n  that the Chair and CEO positions shall be separate, subject to the Board\u2019s      \n  determination of the leadership structure that best serves the Firm and its     \n  shareholders at the time. This policy was adopted this year with consideration  \n  of shareholder input.                                                           \n  \u2022The Board believes that the determination of its leadership structure is a     \n  core Board function and a key part of fulfilling its fiduciary duty to          \n  shareholders. Thus, it is important that the Board retain the ability to        \n  determine the leadership structure that best serves the Firm\u2019s shareholders.    \n  \u2022The new policy is reflected in the Firm\u2019s Corporate Governance Principles and  \n  provides for the Board\u2019s independent oversight of management while also         \n  maintaining the Board\u2019s ability to fulfill its fiduciary duty to determine the  \n  leadership structure that best serves shareholders.                             \n  \u2022The proposal\u2019s criticisms of the Lead Independent Director role are not        \n  applicable to JPMorgan Chase as the Lead Independent Director has the power to  \n  call special shareholder meetings and special meetings of the Board.            \n                                                                                  \nEach year, our Board of Directors gives\ncareful consideration to the Firm\u2019s\nleadership structure. The Board\nassesses what is in the best interests\nof the Firm and its shareholders given\nthe facts and circumstances. Our Board\ndoes not have a restrictive policy pre-\ndetermining the outcome of its\nassessment. Rather, the Board\ndetermines the appropriate leadership\nstructure for the current circumstance,\nwhich may include separating the roles\nof Chair and CEO as it did during the\nlast CEO transition. We believe that\nshareholders, customers, communities\nand others benefit most when our Board\nhas the ability to determine what is in\nthe best interests of the Firm.\n                                                      \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.    96    2022 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                         \n  SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                         \nCurrently, the Board has determined\nthat the Firm is best served by a\ncombined CEO and Chair, and a strong\nLead Independent Director with clearly\ndefined duties, as described on pages\n22-23. The Board believes that based on\ncurrent circumstances, its current\nstructure with a combined Chair and CEO\ncounterbalanced by a Lead Independent\nDirector allows for the most effective\nexecution on strategic priorities and\nthe most effective form of independent\noversight. This is evidenced by the\nFirm\u2019s sustained outstanding financial\nperformance and significant progress on\nkey initiatives, as described on pages\n53-64, under the leadership of the\ncurrent Chair and CEO. Our Corporate\nGovernance Principles provide that when\nthe position of Chair is not filled by\nan independent director, the\nindependent directors annually appoint\nan independent director to serve as\nLead Independent Director. The\nauthority of the Lead Independent\nDirector role and structural committee\nand meeting requirements facilitate the\nBoard\u2019s strong independent oversight of\nthe Firm and its management. The Lead\nIndependent Director role includes the\nauthority to call Board and independent\ndirector meetings and to approve Board\nagendas. The Lead Independent Director\nalso guides discussions regarding the\nCEO\u2019s performance and compensation and\nCEO succession. In addition, each of\nthe Committees of the Board are chaired\nand constituted by independent\ndirectors. Committee chairs shape the\nagenda and information presented to\ntheir committees. Our independent\ndirectors meet regularly. An executive\nsession of the Board, chaired by the\nLead Independent Director, is held as\npart of each regularly scheduled Board\nmeeting and allows additional time for\nthe independent directors to fulfill\ntheir duty to provide oversight of the\nFirm and its management. As part of the\nannual review of its leadership\nstructure, this year, the Board again\nconsidered how shareholders may best be\nserved upon the next management\ntransition. The Board recognizes the\nsupport received by a shareholder\nproposal at the Firm\u2019s 2021 Annual\nMeeting requesting separation of the\nChair and CEO roles at the next change\nin leadership. Following that meeting,\nthe Board asked the Firm to broaden its\nusual scope of shareholder outreach,\nwith a heightened focus on obtaining\nfeedback on the potential separation of\nthe Chair and CEO roles in the context\nof CEO succession planning. Ultimately,\nthe Firm received feedback from\nshareholders across more than 50\nengagements, representing approximately\nhalf of the Firm\u2019s outstanding common\nstock, and presented the results of the\nengagements to the Board. While our\nshareholders recognized the importance\nof the Board\u2019s ability to determine its\nleadership structure in the context of\nthe current structure, many expressed a\ngeneral preference for separate Chair\nand CEO positions. Notably, a\nsubstantial majority of those with whom\nwe engaged, including most of our top\nholders, indicated support for a policy\nthat would enable our current CEO to\nserve as non-executive Chair at the\nnext leadership transition.\n\nIn consideration of this feedback, the\nBoard has adopted a new policy\nreflected in its Corporate Governance\nPrinciples that, upon the next CEO\ntransition, the Chair and CEO positions\nwill be separate, subject to the\nBoard's determination of the leadership\nstructure that best serves the Firm and\nits shareholders at that time. This\npolicy is reflected in the Firm\u2019s\nCorporate Governance Principles,\nproviding important recognition that\nthe best interests of the Firm and its\nshareholders may be best served at that\ntime by separating the roles, while\nallowing the Board the discretion to\nrespond to the circumstances at the\ntime if required. Most important, this\nallows the Board the discretion to\ndetermine at the next CEO succession\nthat the interests of the Firm and its\nshareholders may be best served by\nretaining the current Chair, along with\na Lead Independent Director, in order\nto provide continuity of experience\nwhile also providing appropriate\nindependent oversight of management.\nThis policy reinforces the Board's\nlongstanding commitment to independent\noversight and maintaining governance\nbest practices. Contrary to the claims\nin the shareholder proposal, and as\nexplained in more detail on page 23,\nthe Lead Independent Director has the\npower to call special shareholder\nmeetings and special meetings of the\nBoard. The proposal's criticisms of the\nlead independent director role are not\napplicable to JPMorgan Chase, which\nmaintains best practices for\nfacilitating effective, independent\noversight. Moreover, the proposal's\nbroad claim that only an independent\nchair can meaningfully counterbalance a\nCEO is only true where the independent\nchair has a robust role and is\neffective in that role, lending further\nsupport to the Board's belief that its\nleadership structure should be\ndetermined by context, not by rule.\nRecent studies have not factually\ndemonstrated a significant relationship\nbetween having separate Chair and CEO\nroles and company performance. The\nBoard recommends a vote against this\nproposal because it is unnecessarily\nrigid and not in the best interest of\nthe Firm or its shareholders. The\npolicy requested by the shareholder\nproposal would restrict the Board\u2019s\ndiscretion to use its experience,\njudgment, boardroom insight and ongoing\nshareholder feedback to make the best-\ninformed decision on its leadership\nstructure and in some cases may prevent\nthe Board from naming a Chair who is\nbest suited for the role. The Board\nbelieves that its new policy on the\nseparation of the Chair and CEO roles\nupon the next CEO transition, and its\nstrong governance practices in\nconnection with the determination of\nits leadership structure and the role\nof the Lead Independent Director, best\nserve the Firm and its shareholders.\n                                       \n  The Board of Directors recommends a  \n  voteAGAINSTthis proposal.            \n                                       \n                                                      \n  2022 PROXY STATEMENT    97    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                         \n  SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                         \nProposal 7 \u2014 Board diversity resolution\n\nNational Legal and Policy Center has\nadvised us that it intends to introduce\nthe following resolution: RESOLVED: The\nshareholders request the Board of\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (the \"Company\") to\nadopt a policy (the \"Policy\") to\nencourage greater diversity for the\nBoard of Directors. This would be\naccomplished by requiring that the\ninitial lists of candidates from which\nnew management-supported director\nnominees, recruited from outside the\ncompany, that are chosen by the board\nor relevant committee (each, an\n\"Initial List\"), should include\nqualified diverse candidates. The\nPolicy should provide that any third-\nparty consultant asked to furnish an\nInitial List will be requested to\ninclude such candidates. Each nominee's\nskills, experience and intellectual\nstrengths shall be presented in a chart\nor matrix form, and shall be presented\nto the shareholders through the annual\nproxy statement and on the Company's\nwebsite within six months of the date\nof the annual meeting and updated on an\nannual basis. SUPPORTING STATEMENT: We\nbelieve boards that incorporate diverse\nperspectives can think more critically\nand oversee corporate managers more\neffectively. While the Board currently\nboasts strong representation with\nexperience from the upper echelons of\ncorporate and financial decision-\nmaking, it could additionally benefit\nfrom individuals whose life experience\nand perspectives are diverse. We urge\nshareholders to vote FOR this Proposal.\n\nBoard Response to Proposal 7 The Board\nof Directors recommends that\nshareholders vote AGAINST this proposal\nfor the following reasons:\n                                                                                  \n  \u2022The Board of Directors has a robust director recruitment process in place      \n  that provides for ongoing evaluation of candidates for Board membership and     \n  the candidate nomination process.                                               \n  \u2022In evaluating prospective directors, among other items, the Corporate          \n  Governance & Nominating Committee (\"Governance Committee\") considers: the       \n  Firm\u2019s Corporate Governance Principles, the Firm\u2019s strategy and risk profile,   \n  current Board composition, candidates\u2019 specific skills and experiences based    \n  on the needs of the Firm, and candidate diversity, including diversity with     \n  respect to gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, perspectives and viewpoints.   \n  \u2022The Board recruitment process, including its commitment to diversity, is       \n  transparent, as it is described on page 20 and in the Firm\u2019s Corporate          \n  Governance Principles and the Governance Committee charter.                     \n  \u2022The Board's recruitment process has resulted in the election of three women    \n  directors in the past four years, one of whom is a person of color. Our Board   \n  is comprised of individuals with diverse experiences, skills and backgrounds,   \n  as described on page 13.                                                        \n  \u2022Candidates are nominated based on the skills, experience, personal attributes  \n  and tenure needed to guide the Firm's strategy, and to effectively oversee the  \n  Firm's risk management and internal control framework, and management's         \n  execution of its responsibilities.                                              \n  \u2022In addition, this proxy statement includes expanded disclosures for each       \n  director nominee in a matrix format, which lists the experience of each         \n  director, along with gender, race, ethnicity and other characteristics,         \n  enabling investors to further evaluate the skills, experience, intellectual     \n  strengths and perspectives of each director nominee.                            \n                                                                                  \nThe Board of Directors has in place a\nrobust director recruitment process\nthat provides for ongoing evaluation of\ncandidates for Board membership and the\ncandidate nomination process. The\nGovernance Committee solicits candidate\nrecommendations from shareholders,\ndirectors, and management, and from\ntime to time, has been assisted by a\nthird-party advisor in identifying\nqualified candidates. In addition, the\nFirm\u2019s By-Laws provide for proxy\naccess, by which a group of up to 20\nshareholders who have continuously\nowned at least 3% of the Firm\u2019s\noutstanding shares for at least three\nyears may nominate up to 20% of the\nBoard (but in any event at least two\ndirectors).\n                                                      \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.    98    2022 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                                      \nTable of Contents\n                         \n  SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                         \nIn evaluating prospective directors,\namong other items, the Governance\nCommittee considers: the Firm\u2019s\nCorporate Governance Principles, the\nFirm\u2019s strategy and risk profile,\ncurrent Board composition, candidates\u2019\nspecific skills and experiences based\non the needs of the Firm, and candidate\ndiversity, including diversity with\nrespect to gender, race, ethnicity,\nnationality, perspectives and\nviewpoints. The Firm\u2019s Corporate\nGovernance Principles provide that the\nBoard considers diversity in evaluating\nnominees. Specifically, the Board aims\n\u201cto balance the needs for professional\nknowledge, business expertise, varied\nindustry knowledge, financial\nexpertise, and CEO-level business\nmanagement experience, while striving\nto ensure diversity of representation\namong its members, including diversity\nwith respect to gender, race, ethnicity\nand nationality. Following these\nprinciples, the Board seeks to select\nnominees who combine leadership and\nbusiness management experience,\nexperience in disciplines relevant to\nthe Firm and its businesses, and\npersonal qualities reflecting\nintegrity, judgment, achievement,\neffectiveness and willingness to\nappropriately challenge management.\u201d\nCandidates are nominated based on the\nskills, experience, personal attributes\nand tenure needed to guide the Firm\u2019s\nstrategy, and to effectively oversee\nthe Firm\u2019s risk management and internal\ncontrol framework, and management\u2019s\nexecution of its responsibilities. As a\nresult, the Board represents a diverse\nmix of viewpoints and maintains fresh\nperspectives. The Board's recruitment\nprocess has resulted in the election of\nthree female directors in the past four\nyears, one of whom is a person of\ncolor, and two of whom have experience\nin technology, which is an important\ncomponent of the Firm\u2019s business\nstrategy. Overall, our Board is\ncomprised of people with diverse\nexperiences, skills and backgrounds\nthat collectively facilitate effective\noversight.\n\nThe Board recruitment process,\nincluding its commitment to diversity,\nis transparent, and is described on\npage 20, in the Firm\u2019s Corporate\nGovernance Principles and the\nGovernance Committee charter. Our\ndirector nominees reflect diversity\nacross age, tenure, gender and race, as\nwell as skills, experience,\nperspectives and viewpoints. In\naddition, this proxy statement includes\nexpanded disclosures for each director\nnominee in a matrix format, which lists\nthe experience and skills of each\ndirector, along with gender, race,\nethnicity and other characteristics,\nenabling shareholders to further\nevaluate the skills, experience,\nintellectual strengths and perspectives\nof each director nominee. The Board\nalready has a robust director\nrecruitment process that is transparent\nand considers diversity. In addition,\nwe provide detailed disclosure of our\ndirector nominees\u2019 experience and\ndiversity.

We commit to deliver value to all of\nthem, for the future success of our\ncompanies, our communities and our\ncountry.\" 11 However, the Company is a\nconventional Delaware corporation, so\nthat directors' fiduciary duties\nemphasize the company and its\nshareholders, but not stakeholders\n(except to the extent that stakeholder-\nregarding decisions create value for\nshareholders over time). Accordingly,\nwhen the interests of shareholders and\nstakeholders such as workers or\ncustomers clash, the Company's legal\nduty runs to shareholders. As one\nDelaware law firm reported to another\nsignatory considering conversion,\ndirectors may consider stakeholder\ninterests only if \"any decisions made\nwith respect to such stakeholders are\nin the best interests of the\ncorporation and its stockholders.\" 12\nThat contradicts the commitment made in\nthe Statement. In contrast, directors\nof a PBC must \"balance\" the interests\nof shareholders, stakeholders and a\nspecified public benefit, 13 giving\nlegal status to the Statement's\notherwise empty promise. A company\nrequired to balance stakeholder\ninterests could prioritize stakeholder\ninterests, even if doing so sacrificed\nhigher returns for shareholders. A\ncompany that opposes conversion to the\npublic-benefit corporation form, on the\nother hand, thereby recognizes that the\nStatement is simply a recital of well-\nunderstood old principles that changed\nnothing, and that leaves the overriding\nduty to shareholders fully in place.\nSuch a company would reduce\nreputational and legal risks by\nwithdrawing from a Statement that was\naggressively sold to the public as\nmaking significant new commitments that\ncannot be achieved under the Delaware\nbusiness-corporation form. 14\n\nBoard Response to Proposal 8 The Board\nof Directors recommends that\nshareholders vote AGAINST this proposal\nfor the following reasons:\n                                                                                  \n  \u2022JPMorgan Chase is committed to putting our business to work for the benefit    \n  of our customers, employees, suppliers, and the communities in which we work,   \n  as well as our shareholders.

Tangible\nevidence of our commitment includes:\nour $30 billion Racial Equity\nCommitment; expansion of our commitment\nto the Second Chance program which\nprovides individuals with criminal\nbackgrounds a second chance by\nsupporting their reentry into the\nworkforce, community and local\neconomies; and our commitment to align\nkey sectors of our financing portfolio\nwith the goals of the Paris Agreement.\nWe communicate regularly about these\ncommitments and our progress on them\nthrough a number of channels including\nour Annual Report, Proxy Statement,\nannual ESG Report, and direct\nengagement with stakeholders. Our\nwebsite features a dedicated ESG\nInformation page, as well as an \u201cOur\nImpact\u201d page that contains information\non our approach to an equitable and\ninclusive economy. In 2021, the Board\nengaged a third party to conduct an\nassessment and publish a report (the\n\u201cReport\u201d) on issues associated with the\nFirm\u2019s potential conversion to a PBC.\nThe Report and the Board\u2019s\ndetermination regarding a potential\nconversion are published on the\nGovernance page of our website. As\nexplained in the Report, converting to\na PBC would require the Board to\ndetermine that such a conversion would\nbe more beneficial to the Firm and our\nshareholders in the long run than\ncontinuing to operate as a conventional\ncorporation.

In the U.S.\nalone, this includes, among others, the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency, the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation,\nthe Consumer Financial Protection\nBureau, the Securities and Exchange\nCommission, and the Commodity Futures\nTrading Commission. Compliance with the\nrules and regulations of these\nauthorities allows the Firm to continue\nto do business as a financial\ninstitution. The views of such\nauthorities, as well as the Firm\u2019s\nability to comply with the applicable\nrules and regulations of such\nauthorities, could impact the Firm\u2019s\nability to convert to a PBC and,\nfollowing conversion, its ability to\ntake certain actions needed to achieve\nits purpose as a PBC. \u2022 Operational and\nmarket uncertainty: Due to the limited\nprecedent for a publicly traded company\nconverting to a PBC, it is difficult to\npredict the impact such a conversion\nwould have on the Firm\u2019s stock price,\nmarket capitalization and overall\noperational and financial performance.\nAny negative impacts may in turn make\nit difficult for the Firm to attract,\nretain, and compete for employees. The\nlack of precedent and uncertainty\nregarding decision-making for a PBC may\nalso impede the Firm\u2019s ability to\nattract experienced and qualified\ndirectors. Additionally, the Firm\noperates in more than 60 jurisdictions\noutside of the U.S. The impact of\nconverting to a PBC in each of these\njurisdictions is uncertain. \u2022 Costly\nand uncertain implementation: Fees and\ncosts, including those related to\nsoliciting shareholder approval for the\nconversion (which approval is\nuncertain), satisfying filing\nrequirements, potential shareholder\nlitigation, and preparing the biennial\nstatement to shareholders required of\nDelaware PBCs, may be significant.\n\nThe Board continues to believe these\nfactors pose significant and\nunnecessary risks and cost to the Firm\nwhile delivering, at best, minimal\nbenefit to its shareholders or other\nstakeholders. A conversion to a PBC\ncould distract the Board and management\nfrom executing the Firm\u2019s strategy\nincluding the many initiatives the Firm\nis already supporting. Our Board\nalready considers the interests of not\nonly shareholders, but also employees,\ncustomers, suppliers and communities in\nwhich we work, consistent with our\nbelief that long-term shareholder value\nis best achieved by putting our\nbusiness to work for all our\nstakeholders. We continue to\ndemonstrate a deep commitment to our\nshareholders, employees, customers,\nclients and communities. We believe\nconversion to a PBC would be an\nunnecessary, costly process that would\nintroduce risk and uncertainty, without\nproviding meaningful benefits.\n                                       \n  The Board of Directors recommends a  \n  voteAGAINSTthis proposal.            \n                                       \n                                                       \n  2022 PROXY STATEMENT    101    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.  \n                                                       \nTable of Contents\n                         \n  SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                         \nProposal 9 \u2013 Report on setting absolute\ncontraction targets\n\nThe Sierra Club Foundation has advised\nus that it intends to introduce the\nfollowing resolution: RESOLVED:\nShareholders request that the Board of\nDirectors issue a report that sets\nabsolute contraction targets for the\nCompany's financed greenhouse gas\nemissions, in accordance with United\nNations Environmental Program Finance\nInitiative (UNEP FI) recommendations to\nthe G20 Sustainable Finance Working\nGroup, for credible net zero\ncommitments. Proponents request that,\nin the discretion of board and\nmanagement, the report address the lack\nof need for new fossil fuel development\nbeyond projects already committed as of\n2021, as set forth in the UNEP FI\nrecommendations SUPPORTING STATEMENT\nOur company notes that \"[c]limate\nchange manifesting as physical or\ntransition risks could have a material\nadverse impact on JPMorgan Chase's\nbusiness operations, clients and\ncustomers.\" 15 JPMorgan is a member of\nthe Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA).\nIt has committed to align with pathways\nconsistent with a maximum temperature\nrise of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-\nindustrial levels and to use\ndecarbonization scenarios from\n\"credible and well-recognized sources.\"\n16 However, JPMorgan's current\ndecarbonization plan is not aligned\nwith a credible net zero pathway. The\nUNEP FI, which convenes the NZBA,\npublished an Input Paper to the G20\nSustainable Finance Working Group which\ndefines credible net zero commitments\nof financial institutions. 17 UNEP FI\ncontrasts two decarbonization\napproaches: \"absolute contraction,\" or\n\"[r]educing the absolute amount of\ncarbon in the portfolio,\" versus an\n\"[e]conomic intensity-based\" approach,\nor \"[a]chieving a greater carbon\nefficiency per dollar invested.\" While\nJPMorgan publishes decarbonization\ntargets based on carbon efficiency,\nUNEP FI emphasizes \" it is most\nconvincing for investors to use an\nabsolute contraction approach (original\nemphasis)...\" 18 Targeting portfolio\ncarbon efficiency by itself, without\nadopting absolute greenhouse gas\nemission reduction standards for its\nfinancing, allows for an increase in\nthe Company's total fossil fuel\nfinancing. For example, focusing on\nonly lower carbon intensity fuels, such\nas fracked gas, decreases overall\nportfolio intensity while potentially\nincreasing its overall financed\nemissions. This is a red flag for\nJPMorgan, the world's top financier of\ncompanies expanding fossil fuels. 19\nThe UNEP FI recommendations also\nadmonish: \"A financial institution\nestablishing a net-zero commitment\nshould begin aligning with the required\nassumptions and implications of IPCC\n1.5\u00b0C no/low overshoot pathways as soon\nas possible....All no/low\n\novershoot scenarios indicate an\nimmediate reduction in fossil fuels,\nsignaling that investment in new fossil\nfuel development is not aligned with\n1.5\u00b0C.\" 20 JPMorgan has no policy to\nhalt financing new oil and gas\nexploration and development. JPMorgan's\nassertions of climate leadership fly in\nthe face of its actions, creating\nreputational risk from greenwashing\naccusations. By underwriting or lending\nto projects which are unneeded under\nthe UNEP FI recommendations, JPMorgan\nis also knowingly loading potentially\nstranded assets onto its clients'\nbalance sheets, or its own, creating\nfinancial and litigation risk. 21 In\nthis regard, investors need to know\nthat JPMorgan's emissions reduction\ntargets, and its lending and\nunderwriting policies, are consistent\nwith its own net zero commitment. Board\nResponse to Proposal 9 The Board of\nDirectors recommends that shareholders\nvote AGAINST this proposal for the\nfollowing reasons:\n                                                                                  \n  \u2022JPMorgan Chase is actively addressing climate change-related risks and         \n  opportunities, including by operationalizing Paris-aligned targets for          \n  financed emissions in the Oil & Gas, Electric Power and Automotive              \n  Manufacturing sectors, and pursuing a $1 trillion target for financing and      \n  facilitating climate action through 2030.                                       \n  \u2022The Firm's targets for both emission reductions and financing encompass both   \n  energy supply and demand, consistent with the challenges and opportunities of   \n  the low carbon transition.                                                      \n  \u2022JPMorgan Chase uses carbon intensity targets for the Firm's Paris-aligned      \n  approach to financing activities in key sectors, based on a thoughtful          \n  consideration of strategic and practical benefits.                              \n  \u2022We have engaged extensively with our shareholders regarding the Firm's         \n  approach to climate change-related risks and opportunities, and shareholders    \n  have been largely supportive, including with respect to our use of emission     \n  intensity.                                                                      \n  \u2022Management is best positioned to decide the details of the Firm's              \n  Paris-aligned initiatives, such as the optimal format of emission reduction     \n  targets, as a fundamental part of conducting our core business in the           \n  interests of our shareholders and stakeholders.                                 \n                                                                                  \n15 JPMorgan Chase 2020 Form 10-K, at 28\n\n16 https://www.unepfi.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/UNEP-FI-NZBA-\nCommitment-Statement.pdf\n\n17 https://g20sfwg.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2021-UNEP-FL-Recommendations-\nfor-Credible-Net-Zero-Commitments.pdf\n\n18 Id.

Later in the year,\nwe announced our support for the goals\nof the Net Zero Banking Alliance and\nshared our intent to begin reporting\nabsolute emissions. We have initially\ndeveloped intermediate Paris-aligned\ntargets to reduce the carbon intensity\nin our Oil & Gas, Electric Power and\nAutomotive Manufacturing portfolios by\n2030. We are beginning to\noperationalize these targets across the\nFirm and have announced that we will\nprovide details on our progress in our\nnext climate report, which we plan to\npublish in fall 2022. A core principle\nof our strategy is to work with\ntraditional energy clients to help\ndevelop their long-term business\nstrategies to reduce their carbon\nemissions and improve their carbon\ndisclosures. Our Center for Carbon\nTransition, founded in 2020, provides\nfinancing, research and advisory\nsolutions to support clients in their\ntransition to a low-carbon future.\nMoreover, as part of a $2.5 trillion\nsustainable development target, we are\ntargeting $1 trillion through 2030 to\nfinance and facilitate climate action,\nand are increasingly advancing net zero\nsolutions such as renewable energy,\nenergy efficiency and vehicle\nelectrification. We will share\ninformation on our progress in our ESG\nReport this spring. In setting\ngreenhouse gas emission targets for\nfinanced emissions, JPMorgan Chase\nmanagement considered a broad range of\npossibilities and selected carbon\nintensity targets for important\nstrategic and practical reasons. Carbon\nintensity targets enable us to\nmeaningfully engage with clients and\nprovide capital to transition\nsolutions, while reflecting progress\nthat high-emitting companies and\nsectors are making in transitioning to\nlower carbon production and products.\nIn contrast, selecting absolute targets\ncould create incentives to reduce or\neliminate relationships which may have\na disproportionate impact on reported\nfinanced emissions, while simply\ntransferring emissions elsewhere,\nrather than reducing them in the real\neconomy. In addition, carbon intensity\nis less affected by year-to-year\nemissions volatility than absolute\nemissions, enabling the Firm to make\neasier comparisons across a portfolio\nof companies within a sector and\nbetween companies of different sizes.\nIn light of the benefits of carbon\nintensity targets, their use has become\ncommonplace among companies setting\nvoluntary goals for greenhouse gas\nemission reductions. The United Nations\nEnvironment Programme Finance\nInitiative (UNEP FI) -- in a paper\ncited repeatedly in the proposal --\nrecognized the prominence of intensity-\nbased approaches, noting that such\ntargets support \"achieving a greater\ncarbon efficiency per dollar invested.\"\nUNEP FI also observes that \"there is\nnot clear evidence that this [absolute\ncontraction approach] \u2014 as a standalone\napproach \u2014 contributes to financing the\nglobal economic transition as well as\nothers might.\" 22\n\nThe Firm received feedback on its\napproach to addressing climate change-\nrelated risks and opportunities in\nextensive engagements with\nshareholders, which in 2021, included\nreaching out to more than 150\nshareholders, together representing\nover 50% of the Firm\u2019s outstanding\ncommon stock. The Firm\u2019s approach,\nincluding with respect to our use of\nemissions intensity, was largely\nsupported by shareholders in these\nengagements. We also share information\nabout our approach to and performance\non ESG topics, including climate\nchange, on the Sustainability page of\nour website which includes the Firm's\nannual ESG Report. As a diversified\nfinancial institution, JPMorgan Chase\nconducts many business activities, and\nit is management's responsibility to\ndetermine the optimal approach to\nvoluntary greenhouse gas reduction\ntargets, a complex and evolving topic.\nThese detailed decisions are\nfundamental to the Firm's day-to-day\noperations and require complex business\njudgements that the Firm's management\nis best positioned to make, with the\noversight of the Board. The Board\nopposes this proposal given the Firm's\nexisting efforts to help address\nclimate change and the strategic\ndecision, based on management's\njudgment, to use carbon intensity\ntargets in our pursuit of net zero\nemissions.\n                                       \n  The Board of Directors recommends a  \n  voteAGAINSTthis proposal.            \n                                       \n22 UNEP FI, High-Level Recommendations for Credible Net-Zero Commitments from\nFinancial Institutions, at p. 11.\n                                                       \n  2022 PROXY STATEMENT    103    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.  \n                                                       \nTable of Contents\n                                                    \n  INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL SHAREHOLDER MEETING  \n                                                    \nInformation about the annual\nshareholder meeting\n\nGeneral\n\nWhy am I receiving these materials?

In\nthat case, you will have received these\nproxy materials, as well as a voting\ninstruction form, from the organization\nholding your shares and, as a\nbeneficial owner, you have the right to\ndirect the organization as to how to\nvote them.

On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law. The Firm\u2019s results for the\nyear ended December 31, 2017, included a $2.4 billion decrease to net income, as a\nresult of the enactment of the TCJA, as well as a legal benefit of $406 million\n(after-tax) related to a settlement with the FDIC receivership for Washington\nMutual and with Deutsche Bank as trustee to certain Washington Mutual trusts.\nAdjusted net income, adjusted ROTCE and adjusted earnings per share, which exclude\nthe impact of these significant items, are each non-GAAP financial measures.\nManagement believes these measures help investors understand the effect of these\nitems on reported results.\n                                                       \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.    110    2022 PROXY STATEMENT  \n                                                       \nTable of Contents\n                                        \n  NOTES ON NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  \n                                        \nAdditional notes\n\n1. The Firm reviews the results of the lines of business on a \u201cmanaged\u201d basis. The\nFirm\u2019s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S.\nGAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue\nfor the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on a fully taxable-\nequivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits\nand tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis\ncomparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow\nmanagement to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from\nboth taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related\nto tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have\nno impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of\nbusiness.\n\n2. The Basel III common equity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d) ratio is used by management, bank\nregulators, investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Firm\u2019s capital\nposition.
