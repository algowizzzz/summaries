NII excluding Markets\nwas $23.2 billion, up 37%.\n\n\u2013 Noninterest revenue (\"NIR\") was $17.1 billion, up\n13%, driven by higher Markets noninterest revenue,\nthe impact of First Republic, higher asset\nmanagement fees and lower net investment securities\nlosses in Treasury and CIO, partially offset by\nimpairment losses on equity investments in CIB.\n\n\u2013 Total Markets revenue declined reflecting lower\nMarkets NII, predominantly offset by higher NIR.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense was $21.8 billion, up 13%,\npredominantly driven by the impact of First\nRepublic, higher compensation expense, including\ngrowth in front office and technology headcount as\nwell as wage inflation, and higher legal expense.\n                                                     5                                                      \n\u2022 The provision for credit losses was $1.4 billion,\nreflecting $1.5 billion of net charge-offs and a\nnet reduction in the allowance for credit losses of\n$113 million.

This was partially offset\nby higher issuance activity in high-yield bonds\ndriven by higher industry-wide issuance, and\n\n\u2022 lower advisory fees due to a lower number of\ncompleted transactions, reflecting the lower level\nof announced deals in prior periods amid a\nchallenging environment.\n\nPrincipal transactions revenue increased,\nreflecting in CIB:\n\n\u2022 higher Equity Markets net revenue in principal\ntransactions, primarily in Prime Finance and Equity\nDerivatives,\n\n\u2022 higher Fixed Income Markets net revenue in\nprincipal transactions, primarily in Securitized\nProducts and Fixed Income Financing, largely offset\nby lower revenue in Rates and Currencies & Emerging\nMarkets,\n\n\u2013 the increase in Markets principal transactions\nrevenue was more than offset by a decline in\nMarkets net interest income, primarily due to\nhigher funding costs\n\n\u2022 losses of $178 million in Credit Adjustments &\nOther, largely driven by losses on certain\ncomponents of fair value option elected\nliabilities, compared with losses of $773 million\nin the prior year.\n\nThe increase in principal transactions revenue also\nincluded the impact of higher short-term cash\ndeployment activities in Treasury and CIO as a\nresult of the current interest rate environment .\n\nLending- and deposit-related fees was relatively\nflat, reflecting :\n\n\u2022 higher lending-related revenue driven by the\namortization of the fair value discount on certain\nacquired lending-related commitments associated\nwith First Republic, predominantly in AWM and CB,\n\npredominantly offset by\n\n\u2022 lower cash management fees in CIB and CB driven\nby the higher level of credits earned by clients\nthat reduce such fees.\n                                                     11                                                     \nAsset management fees in creased driven by the\nimpact of First Republic, higher average market\nlevels and strong net inflows in CCB, and in AWM\nstrong net inflows as well as the removal of most\nmoney market fund fee waivers.\n\nCommissions and other fees increased driven by\nhigher commissions on travel-related services and\nannuity sales in CCB.\n\nInvestment securities losses reflected higher net\nlosses on sales of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and\ngovernment agency MBS, associated with\nrepositioning the investment securities portfolio\nin both periods in Treasury and CIO.\n\nMortgage fees and related income decreased in Home\nLending, reflecting:\n\n\u2022 lower production revenue due to a decline in\nvolume, and\n\n\u2022 lower net mortgage servicing revenue due to lower\nnet gains in MSR risk management and lower\noperating revenue.\n\nCard income increased in CIB and CB, reflecting\ngrowth in merchant processing volume and Commercial\nCard transactions in J.P. Morgan Payments .\n\nCard income increased in CCB, reflecting\n\n\u2022 higher net interchange from the impact of an\nincrease in debit and credit card sales volume, and\na reduction in rewards costs and partner payments\nin the first quarter of 2023 related to a periodic\ntax refund on airline miles redeemed, largely\noffset by an increase to the rewards liability due\nto adjustments to certain reward program terms in\nthe second quarter of 2023, and\n\n\u2022 lower other card income driven by higher\namortization related to new account origination\ncosts, predominantly offset by higher annual fees.\n\nOther income in creased, reflecting:\n\n\u2022 the $2.8 billion estimated bargain purchase gain\nassociated with the First Republic acquisition in\nCorporate,\n\n\u2022 the impact of net investment hedges, primarily in\nthe first half of 2023, in Treasury and CIO, and\n\n\u2022 a gain of $339 million recognized in the first\nquarter of 2023 in AWM on the original minority\ninterest in CIFM upon the Firm's acquisition of the\nremaining 51% interest in the entity,\n\npartially offset by\n\n\u2022 lower auto operating lease income in CCB due to a\ndecline in volume,\n\n\u2022 the net impact of equity investments in CIB,\nincluding impairment losses in the third quarter of\n2023,\n\n\u2022 the absence of proceeds from an insurance\nsettlement in the prior year,\n\n\u2022 the absence of a gain in the prior year on an\nequity-method investment received in partial\nsatisfaction of a loan in CB, and\n\n\u2022 lower net gains related to certain other\nCorporate investments .\n\nNet interest income increased driven by higher\nrates, higher revolving balances in Card Services,\nand the impact of First Republic, partially offset\nby lower Markets net interest income and lower\naverage deposit balances.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s average interest-earning assets were\n$3.3 trillion, down $80 billion, and the yield was\n5.01%, up 263 bps.

impact of the repayment of\ndeposits provided to First Republic Bank in March\n2023 by the consortium of large U.S. banks and\namounts paid to the FDIC, as well as loan growth.\nDeposits with banks reflect the Firm\u2019s placement of\nits excess cash with various central banks,\nincluding the Federal Reserve Banks.\n\nFederal funds sold and securities purchased under\nresale agreements increased driven by Markets,\nreflecting higher demand for securities to cover\nshort positions and higher collateral requirements,\npartially offset by a decrease in client-driven\nmarket-making activities, net of the lower level of\nnetting.\n\nRefer to Note 11 for additional information on\nsecurities purchased under resale agreements and\nsecurities borrowed .\n\nTrading assets increased predominantly driven by\nCIB due to higher levels of debt and equity\ninstruments in Markets, in response to demand from\nclient-driven market-making activities, and when\ncompared with the seasonally lower levels at year-\nend. The increase was also attributable to the\nimpact of higher short-term cash deployment\nactivities in Treasury and CIO as a result of the\ncurrent interest rate environment. Refer to Notes 2\nand 5 for additional information.\n\nInvestment securities decreased due to:\n\n\u2022 lower available-for-sale (\"AFS\") securities\ndriven by maturities and paydowns, partially offset\nby net purchases, the impact of First Republic, and\nthe transfer of securities from held-to-maturity\n(\u201cHTM\u201d) in the first quarter of 2023, and\n\n\u2022 lower HTM securities driven by maturities and\npaydowns, and the transfer of securities to AFS.\n\nRefer to Corporate segment results on pages 45-46,\n\nInvestment Portfolio Risk Management on page 83,\nand Notes 2 and 10 for additional information.\n\nLoans increased, reflecting :\n\n\u2022 $147 billion of loans associated with First\nRepublic, primarily reflected in CCB, CB and AWM.\n\nThe increase also included:\n\n\u2022 growth in new accounts and revolving balances in\nCard Services, as the portfolio continues to\nnormalize to pre-pandemic levels,\n\n\u2022 higher revolver utilization and originations in\nCB, and\n\n\u2022 growth in Auto loans.\n\nThe allowance for loan losses increased,\nreflecting:\n\n\u2022 a net addition to the allowance for loan losses\nof $1.7 billion, c onsisting of:\n\n\u2013 $1.0 billion in wholesale, driven by net\ndowngrade activity and the net effect of changes in\nthe Firm's weighted average macroeconomic outlook,\nincluding deterioration in the outlook for\ncommercial real estate in CB, partially offset by\nthe impact of changes in the loan portfolio in CIB\nin the third quarter of 2023, and\n\n\u2013 $725 million in consumer , predominantly driven\nby CCB, comprised of $801 million in Card Services,\npartially offset by a $200 million net reduction in\nHome Lending. The net addition in Card Services was\ndriven by loan growth, including an increase in\nrevolving balances, partially offset by reduced\nborrower uncertainty and the net effect of changes\nin the Firm's weighted average macroeconomic\noutlook. The net reduction in Home Lending was\nlargely driven by improvements in the outlook for\nhome prices, and\n\n\u2022 $1.1 billion to establish the allowance for the\nFirst Republic loans in the second quarter of 2023\n.\n\nThe allowance for loan losses also reflected a\nreduction of\n                                                     16                                                     \n$587 million, on January 1, 2023, as a result of\nthe adoption of the Financial Instruments - Credit\nLosses: Troubled Debt Restructurings accounting\nguidance. References in this Form 10-Q to \"changes\nto the TDR accounting guidance\" pertain to the\nFirm's adoption of this guidance.\n\nThere was also a $308 million net reduction in the\nallowance for lending-related commitments\nrecognized in other liabilities on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets.\n\nRefer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on\npages 62-83, and Notes 2, 3, 12 and 13 for\nadditional information on loans and the total\nallowance for credit losses; and Business Segment\nResults on page 23 and Note 28 for additional\ninformation on the First Republic acquisition.\n\nAccrued interest and accounts receivable increased\nas a result of receivables associated with U.S.\nTreasuries that matured in Treasury and CIO, and\nhigher receivables related\n\nto unsettled trades, predominantly offset by lower\nclient receivables related to client-driven\nactivities in Markets.\n\nGoodwill, MSRs and other intangible assets\nincreased predominantly due to:\n\n\u2022 the other intangibles and goodwill related to the\nFirm's acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in\nCIFM,\n\n\u2022 core deposit intangibles associated with the\nFirst Republic acquisition, and\n\n\u2022 higher MSRs as a result of net additions\nprimarily from purchases, and the impact of higher\ninterest rates, partially offset by the realization\nof expected cash flows.\n\nRefer to Note 15 and 28 for additional information.\n\nOther assets decreased reflecting the impact of the\nchange in the type of collateral placed with\ncentral counterparties (\"CCPs\") from cash to\nsecurities.\n                                                                                                            \n  Selected Consolidated balance

There are four\nmajor reportable business segments \u2013 Consumer &\nCommunity Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank,\nCommercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management.\nIn addition, there is a Corporate segment.\n\nThe business segments are determined based on the\nproducts and services provided, or the type of\ncustomer served, and they reflect the manner in\nwhich financial information is currently evaluated\nby the Firm\u2019s Operating Committee. Segment results\nare presented on a managed basis. Refer to\nExplanation and Reconciliation of the Firm\u2019s use of\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 19-20 for a\ndefinition of managed basis.\n\nDescription of business segment reporting\nmethodology\n\nResults of the business segments are intended to\npresent each segment as if it were a stand-alone\nbusiness. The management reporting process that\nderives business segment results includes the\nallocation of certain income and expense items. The\nFirm periodically assesses the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications used\nfor segment reporting, and further refinements may\nbe implemented in future periods. The Firm also\nassesses the level of capital required for each LOB\non at least an annual basis. The Firm\u2019s LOBs also\nprovide various business metrics which are utilized\nby the Firm and its investors and analysts in\nassessing performance.\n\nRevenue sharing\n\nWhen business segments join efforts to sell\nproducts and services to the Firm\u2019s clients and\ncustomers, the participating business segments may\nagree to share revenue from those transactions.\nRevenue is generally recognized in the segment\nresponsible for the related product or service,\nwith allocations to the other segment(s) involved\nin the transaction. The segment results reflect\nthese revenue-sharing agreements.\n\nFunds transfer pricing\n\nFunds transfer pricing (\u201cFTP\u201d) is the process by\nwhich the Firm allocates interest income and\nexpense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and\ntransfers the primary interest rate risk and\nliquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.\n\nThe funds transfer pricing process considers the\ninterest rate risk and liquidity risk\ncharacteristics of assets and liabilities and off-\nbalance sheet products. Periodically the\nmethodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP\nprocess are adjusted to reflect economic conditions\nand other factors, which may impact the allocation\nof net interest income to the segments.\n\nForeign exchange risk\n\nForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs\nand Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain\nrevenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages\nthese risks centrally and reports the impact of\nforeign exchange rate movements related to the\ntransferred risk in its results. Refer to Market\nRisk Management on pages 84-89 for additional\ninformation.\n\nCapital allocation\n\nThe amount of capital assigned to each business\nsegment is referred to as equity. At least\nannually, the assumptions, judgments and\nmethodologies used to allocate capital are\nreassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated\nto the LOBs may change. Refer to Line of business\nequity on page 51, and page 93 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n2022 Form 10-K for additional information on\ncapital allocation.\n\nRefer to Business Segment Results \u2013 Description of\nbusiness segment reporting methodology on pages\n61-62 and Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form\n10-K for a further discussion of those\nmethodologies.\n

The\nincrease in noncompensation expense also reflects\nadditional investments in technology and marketing,\nas well as the FDIC assessment increase announced\nin the prior year, largely offset by lower auto\nlease depreciation on lower auto lease assets.\n\nThe provision for credit losses was $1.4 billion,\nreflecting:\n\n\u2022 net charge-offs of $1.4 billion, up $720 million,\npredominantly driven by Card Services, as the\nportfolio continues to normalize to pre-pandemic\nlevels, and\n\n\u2022 a $47 million net addition to the allowance for\ncredit losses driven by $301 million in Card\nServices, predominantly offset by a $250 million\nnet reduction in Home Lending. The net addition in\nCard Services was driven by loan growth, including\nan increase in revolving balances, largely offset\nby changes in the Firm's\n\nmacroeconomic outlook including a lower forecasted\nunemployment rate and reduced borrower uncertainty.\nThe net reduction in Home Lending was driven by\nimprovements in the outlook for home prices.\n\nThe prior year included a $150 million reduction in\nthe allowance for credit losses across CCB.\n\nRefer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on\npages 62-83 and Allowance for Credit Losses on\npages 80-82 for a further discussion of the credit\nportfolios and the allowance for credit losses.\n\nYear-to-date results\n\nNet income was $16.4 billion, up 59%.\n\nNet revenue was $52.1 billion, up 33%.\n\nNet interest income was $40.9 billion, up 48%,\ndriven by:\n\n\u2022 deposit margin expansion on higher rates,\npartially offset by lower average deposits and the\nimpact of lower PPP loan forgiveness in BWM, and\n\n\u2022 higher NII driven by increased revolving balances\nin Card Services, as well as the impact of First\nRepublic in Home Lending.\n\nNoninterest revenue was $11.1 billion, down 2%,\ndriven by:\n\n\u2022 lower auto operating lease income as a result of\na decline in volume, and\n\n\u2022 in Home Lending, lower production revenue from a\ndecline in volume and lower net mortgage servicing\nrevenue driven by lower net gains on MSR risk\nmanagement and lower operating revenue,\n\nlargely offset by\n\n\u2022 the impact of First Republic in BWM, largely\nasset management fees, and\n\n\u2022 higher travel-related commissions in Card\nServices.\n\nCard income was up 4%, reflecting\n\n\u2022 higher net interchange from the impact of an\nincrease in debit and credit card sales volume, and\na reduction in rewards costs and partner payments\nin the first quarter of 2023 related to a periodic\ntax refund on airline miles redeemed, largely\noffset by an increase to the rewards liability due\nto adjustments to certain reward program terms in\nthe second quarter of 2023, and\n\n\u2022 lower other card income driven by higher\namortization related to new account origination\ncosts, predominantly offset by higher annual fees.\n\nNoninterest expense was $25.5 billion, up 9%,\nreflecting:\n\n\u2022 higher compensation expense, driven by an\nincrease in headcount and wage inflation, including\nthe impact of First Republic in the third quarter\nof 2023, and higher revenue-related compensation,\nand\n\n\u2022 higher noncompensation expense, driven by the\nimpact of First Republic, investments in marketing\nand technology, as well as the FDIC assessment\nincrease announced in the prior year, largely\noffset by lower auto lease depreciation on lower\nauto lease assets.\n                                                     25                                                     \nThe provision for credit losses was $4.7 billion,\nreflecting:\n\n\u2022 net charge-offs of $3.7 billion, up $1.9 billion,\npredominantly driven by Card Services, as the\nportfolio continues to normalize to pre-pandemic\nlevels, and\n\n\u2022 a $1.0 billion net addition to the allowance for\ncredit losses, which included $801 million in Card\nServices, partially offset by a $200 million net\nreduction in Home Lending. The net addition in Card\nServices was driven by loan growth, including an\nincrease in revolving balances, partially offset by\nreduced borrower uncertainty, and the net effect of\nchanges in the Firm's weighted average\nmacroeconomic outlook, including the updates to the\n\ncentral scenario in the third quarter of 2023 and\nthe impact of additional weight placed on the\nadverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023.

At September 30, 2023 and 2022, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and\ninsured by U.S. government agencies of $123 million and $219 million, respectively. These amounts have been\nexcluded based upon the government guarantee. In addition, the Firm\u2019s policy is generally to exempt credit\ncard loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance.\n\n(b) At September 30, 2023 and 2022, generally excludes loans that were under payment deferral programs\noffered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to Credit Portfolio on pages 108-109 of JPMorgan Chase's\n2022 Form 10-K for further information on consumer assistance.\n\n(c) At September 30, 2023 and 2022, included $129 million and $791 million of loans, respectively, in\nBusiness Banking under the PPP. The Firm does not expect to realize material credit losses on PPP loans\nbecause the loans are guaranteed by the SBA. Refer to Credit Portfolio on pages 108-109 of JPMorgan Chase's\n2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the PPP.\n\n(d) At September 30, 2023 and 2022, the principal balance of loans under payment deferral programs offered\nin response to the COVID-19 pandemic was $89 million and $454 million in Home Lending, respectively. Loans\nthat are performing according to their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent. Refer to\nCredit Portfolio on pages 108-109 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for further information on consumer\nassistance.\n\n(e) At September 30, 2023 and 2022, excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $175\nmillion and $284 million, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded\nbased upon the government guarantee.\n\n(f) At September 30, 2023, included $396 million allowance associated with First Republic.\n\n(g) On January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted changes to the TDR accounting guidance. The adoption of this\nguidance resulted in a net decrease in the allowance for loan losses of $591 million, driven by residential\nreal estate and credit card.

Markets revenue was $22.0\nbillion, down 6%.\n\n\u2022 Fixed Income Markets revenue was $14.8 billion,\ndown 1%, reflecting lower revenue in Currencies &\nEmerging Markets and Commodities, largely offset by\nhigher revenue in the Securitized Products Group,\nCredit Trading and Rates.\n\n\u2022 Equity Markets revenue was $7.2 billion, down\n15%, driven by lower revenue in Equity Derivatives\nand Cash Equities.\n                                                     30                                                     \n\u2022 Securities Services revenue was $3.6 billion, up\n8%, driven by deposit margin expansion on higher\nrates, largely offset by lower fees and lower\naverage depos its.\n\n\u2022 Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $178\nmillion, largely driven by losses on certain\ncomponents of fair value option elected\nliabilities, compared with a loss of $773 million\nin the prior year.\n\nNoninterest expense was $21.8 billion, up 5%,\npredominantly driven by higher legal expense,\nindirect tax expense and compensation expense,\nincluding wage inflation.\n\nThe provision for credit losses was a net benefit\nof $89 million, reflecting a $240 million net\nreduction in the allowance for credit losses,\ndriven by the impact of changes in the loan and\nlending-related commitment portfolios and the net\neffect of changes in the Firm's weighted average\nmacroeconomic outlook, partially offset by net\ndowngrade activity. Net charge-offs were $151\nmillion.\n\nThe prior year provision was $1.0 billion ,\npredominantly driven by a net addition to the\nallowance for credit losses .\n

When the Firm extends a\nconsumer or wholesale loan, advises customers and\nclients on their investment decisions, makes\nmarkets in securities, or offers other products or\nservices, the Firm takes on some degree of risk.\nThe Firm\u2019s overall objective is to manage its\nbusiness, and the associated risks, in a manner\nthat balances serving the interests of its clients,\ncustomers and investors, and protecting the safety\nand soundness of the Firm. The Firm believes that\neffective risk management requires, among other\nthings: \u2022 Acceptance of responsibility, including\nidentification and escalation of risks by all\nindividuals within the Firm; \u2022 Ownership of risk\nidentification, assessment, data and management\nwithin each of the LOBs and Corporate; and \u2022 A\nFirmwide risk governance and oversight structure.\nThe Firm follows a disciplined and balanced\ncompensation framework with strong internal\ngovernance and independent oversight by the Board\nof Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d). The impact of risk and\ncontrol issues is carefully considered in the\nFirm\u2019s performance evaluation and incentive\ncompensation processes. Risk governance framework\nThe Firm\u2019s risk governance framework involves\nunderstanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and\nimpacts of risks.

The minimum amount of\nregulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and\nbanks is determined by calculating risk-weighted\nassets (\"RWA\"), which are on-balance sheet assets\nand off-balance sheet exposures, weighted according\nto risk. Two comprehensive approaches are\nprescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized\napproach (\u201cBasel III Standardized\u201d), and an\nadvanced approach (\u201cBasel III Advanced\u201d). For each\nof the risk-based capital ratios, the capital\nadequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower\nof the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared\nto their respective regulatory capital ratio\nrequirements. The Firm\u2019s Basel III Standardized\nrisk-based ratios are currently more binding than\nthe Basel III Advanced risk-based ratios.\n\nBasel III also includes a requirement for Advanced\nApproaches banking organizations, including the\nFirm, to calculate its SLR. Refer to SLR on page 51\nfor additional information.\n\nKey Regulatory Developments\n\nCECL Regulatory Capital Transition\n\nBeginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9 billion CECL\ncapital benefit, provided by the Federal Reserve in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic, is being phased\nout at 25% per year over a three-year period. As of\nSeptember 30, 2023, the Firm's CET1 capital\nreflected the remaining $1.4 billion benefit\nassociated with the CECL capital transition\nprovisions.\n\nSimilarly, as of January 1, 2023, the Firm has\nphased out 50% of the other CECL capital transition\nprovisions which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted\naverage assets, total leverage exposure and RWA, as\napplicable.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 and\nNote 1 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for\nfurther information on CECL capital transition\nprovisions and the CECL accounting guidance.\n\nU.S. Basel III Finalization\n\nIn July 2023, the Federal Reserve, the Office of\nthe Comptroller of the Currency (\"OCC\") and the\nFDIC released a proposal to amend the risk-based\ncapital framework, entitled \"Regulatory capital\nrule: Amendments applicable to large banking\norganizations and to banking organizations with\nsignificant trading activity\". Under the proposal,\nchanges would include replacement of the advanced\napproach with an expanded risk-based approach,\nwhich would not permit the use of internal models\nfor the calculation of risk-weighted assets, other\nthan for Market risk. In addition, the stress\ncapital buffer requirement would be applicable to\nboth the expanded risk-based approach and the\nstandardized approach. The proposal would\nsignificantly revise risk-based capital\nrequirements for all banks with assets of $100\nbillion or more, including the Firm and other U.S.\nglobal systemically important banks (\"GSIBs\"). The\nproposed effective date is July 1, 2025 with a\nthree-year transition period applicable to the\nexpanded risk-based approach. Based on the Firm's\nunderstanding of the proposal, as applied to its\nConsolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2023,\nthe estimated impact at the end of the transition\nperiod would be an increase to RWA of approximately\n30% which results in an approximately 25% increase\nto CET1 capital necessary to meet its CET1 ratio\nrequirement, all else equal. These estimates do not\nreflect any actions that the Firm may take to\nmitigate the impact of the rule as currently\nproposed.\n\nPending the finalization of the U.S. Basel III\nproposal, the Firm expects that it will continue to\nbuild capital above the current levels, and\ntherefore the CET1 target of 13.5% previously set\nby the Firm (which was with respect to the current\nStandardized RWA measure) is no longer meaningful.\nThe Firm's quarterly capital ratios may vary\ndependent on market conditions and other factors.\n\nGSIB Surcharge\n\nIn July 2023, the Federal Reserve also released a\nproposal to amend the calculation of the GSIB\nsurcharge. If adopted as proposed, these amendments\nwould require the Firm to assess its GSIB surcharge\non an annual basis, using the average of the\nquarterly surcharge calculations throughout the\ncalendar year, with daily averaging required for\ncertain measures within the surcharge calculation.\nSurcharge increments would be reduced from 50bp to\n10bp and there would also be other technical\namendments to the Method 2 calculation. The\nproposed amendments would revise risk-based capital\nrequirements for the Firm and other U.S. GSIBs, and\nwould become effective on two calendar quarters\nafter the adoption of the final rule. Refer to\nRisk-based Capital Regulatory Requirements on pages\n89-90 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for\nfurther information on the GSIB surcharge.\n                                                     48                                                     \nTLAC and Eligible LTD Requirements\n\nIn August 2023, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and\nthe OCC released a proposal to expand the eligible\nlong-term debt (\"eligible LTD\") and clean holding\ncompany requirements under the existing total loss-\nabsorbing capacity (\"TLAC\") rule to apply to non-\nGSIB banks with $100 billion or more in total\nconsolidated assets. While U.S. GSIBs are already\nsubject to these requirements, the proposal would\nreduce\n\nthe amount of LTD with remaining maturities of less\nthan two years that count towards a U.S. GSIB's\nTLAC requirement. The proposal would also expand\nthe existing capital deduction framework for LTD\nissued by GSIBs to include LTD issued by non-GSIB\nbanks subject to the LTD requirements.\n                                                                                                            \n  Selected capital and RWA data                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \nThe following tables present the Firm\u2019s risk-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and\nAdvanced approaches and leverage-based capital metrics. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of these capital metrics.

LCR and HQLA The LCR rule\nrequires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is\nsufficient to meet their respective estimated total\nnet cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-\nday period of significant stress. Under the LCR\nrule, the amount of eligible HQLA held by JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand-\nalone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not\ntransferable to non-bank affiliates, must be\nexcluded from the Firm\u2019s reported eligible HQLA.\nThe LCR for both the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. is required to be a minimum of 100%.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s\nHQLA was further impacted by a reduction in cash primarily driven by a decline in average deposits and\nhigher average loans, predominantly offset by CIB market activities. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s average LCR\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2023 decreased when compared with the same period in the prior\nyear, reflecting a decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s HQLA as a result of a reduction in cash from a\ndecline in average deposits and loan growth, as well as the impact of First Republic and lower market values\nof HQLA-eligible investment securities. Refer to Note 10 and Note 28 for additional information on the\nFirm's investment securities portfolio and the First Republic acquisition. Actions by the Federal Reserve\nhave impacted depositor behavior, resulting in reductions to system-wide deposits, including those held by\nthe Firm. Each of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR may fluctuate from period to period\ndue to changes in their respective eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing\nbusiness activity and from the continued impacts of Federal Reserve actions as well as other factors.

Internal stress testing The Firm conducts internal liquidity\nstress testing that is intended to ensure that the Firm and its material legal entities have sufficient\nliquidity under a variety of adverse scenarios, including scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm\u2019s\nresolution and recovery planning. Internal Stress scenarios are produced on a regular basis, and other\nstress tests are performed in response to specific market events or concerns. Results of stress tests are\nconsidered in the formulation of the Firm\u2019s funding plan and assessment of its liquidity position. The Firm\nmaintains liquidity at the Parent Company, the Intermediate Holding Company (\u201cIHC\u201d), and operating\nsubsidiaries at levels sufficient to comply with liquidity risk tolerances and minimum liquidity\nrequirements, and to manage through periods of stress when access to normal funding sources may be\ndisrupted.\n                                                     54                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n   Other liquidity sources                                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \nIn addition to the assets reported in the Firm\u2019s\neligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had\nunencumbered marketable securities, such as equity\nand debt securities, that the Firm believes would\nbe available to raise liquidity. This includes\nexcess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank\naffiliates. The fair value of these securities was\napproximately $590 billion and $694 billion as of\nSeptember 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nrespectively, although the amount of liquidity that\ncould be raised at any particular time would be\ndependent on prevailing market conditions. The\ndecrease compared to December 31, 2022, was driven\nby a reduction in excess eligible HQLA securities\nat JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., partially offset by\nan increase in CIB trading assets.\n\nThe Firm also had available borrowing capacity at\nthe Federal Home Loan Banks (\u201cFHLBs\u201d) and the\ndiscount window at the Federal Reserve Banks as a\nresult of collateral pledged by the Firm to such\nbanks of approximately $347 billion and $323\nbillion as of September 30, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, respectively. This borrowing capacity\nexcludes the benefit of cash and securities\nreported in the Firm\u2019s eligible HQLA or other\nunencumbered securities that are currently pledged\nat the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and\nother central banks. Available borrowing capacity\nincreased from December 31, 2022 primarily due to\nincreased commercial loans and credit card\nreceivables pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks.\nAlthough available, the Firm does not view this\nborrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Banks\ndiscount window and the other central banks as a\nprimary source of liquidity.\n                                                                                                            \n  NSFR                                                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nThe net stable funding ratio (\u201cNSFR\u201d) is a\nliquidity requirement for large banking\norganizations that is intended to measure the\nadequacy of \u201cavailable\u201d stable funding that is\nsufficient to meet their \u201crequired\u201d amounts of\nstable funding over a one-year horizon.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, both the Firm and\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were compliant with the\n100% minimum NSFR requirement, based on the Firm's\ninterpretation of the final rule.

A significant\nportion of the Firm\u2019s deposits are consumer\ndeposits and wholesale operating deposits, which\nare both considered to be stable sources of\nliquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are\ngenerally considered to be stable sources of\nliquidity because they are generated from customers\nthat maintain operating service relationships with\nthe Firm.\n\nThe Firm believes that average deposit balances are\ngenerally more representative of deposit trends\nthan period-end deposit balances. However, during\nperiods of market disruption those trends could be\naffected.\n\nAverage deposits were lower for the three months\nended September 30, 2023 compared to the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2022. The net decrease\nreflected:\n\n\u2022 continued migration in AWM into higher-yielding\ninvestments as a result of the rising interest rate\nenvironment, partially offset by growth from new\nand existing customers resulting from new\nofferings,\n\n\u2022 a net decline in CCB reflecting higher customer\nspending in existing accounts, largely offset by\nthe impact of First Republic,\n\n\u2022 continued deposit attrition in CB as clients seek\nhigher yielding alternatives, partially offset by\nthe retention of inflows associated with\ndisruptions in the market in the first quarter of\n2023,\n\n\u2022 an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's\ninternational consumer initiatives, and\n\n\u2022 an increase in CIB due to net issuances of\nstructured notes as a result of client demand,\npredominantly offset by continued deposit\nattrition, including actions to reduce certain\ndeposits.\n\nAverage deposits were lower for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023 compared to the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2022. The net decrease\nreflected:\n\n\u2022 continued migration in AWM into higher-yielding\ninvestments as a result of the rising interest rate\nenvironment, partially offset by growth from new\nand existing customers resulting from new\nofferings,\n\n\u2022 continued deposit attrition in CIB, including\nactions to reduce certain deposits, largely offset\nby net issuances of structured notes as a result of\nclient demand,\n\n\u2022 continued deposit attrition in CB as clients seek\nhigher yielding alternatives, partially offset by\nthe retention of inflows associated with\ndisruptions in the market in the first quarter of\n2023,\n\n\u2022 a net decline in CCB reflecting higher customer\nspending in existing accounts, largely offset by\nthe impact of First Republic, and\n\n\u2022 an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's\ninternational consumer initiatives.\n                                                     56                                                     \nPeriod-end deposits increased when compared to\nDecember 31, 2022. The net increase reflected: \u2022\nnet issuances of structured notes in CIB as a\nresult of client demand, as well as deposit inflows\nrelated to client-driven activities in Securities\nServices and Payments, \u2022 an increase in Corporate\nrelated to the Firm's international consumer\ninitiatives, \u2022 a net increase in CCB due to $64\nbillion of deposits associated with First Republic,\npredominantly offset by a net reduction reflecting\nhigher customer spending in existing accounts, \u2022 a\nnet decrease in AWM from continued migration into\nhigher-yielding investments as a result of the\nrising interest rate environment, partially offset\nby growth from new and existing customers resulting\nfrom new offerings, and \u2022 continued deposit\nattrition in CB driven by higher rates and seasonal\noutflows, partially offset by the retention of\ninflows associated with disruptions in the market\nin the first quarter of 2023. Refer to the Firm\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheets Analysis and the\nBusiness Segment Results on pages 16-18 and pages\n21-46, respectively, for further information on\ndeposit and liability balance trends. Refer to Note\n3 for further information on structured notes.\n\nCertain deposits are covered by insurance\nprotection that provides additional funding\nstability and results in a benefit to the LCR.\nDeposit insurance protection may be available to\ndepositors in the countries in which the deposits\nare placed. For example, the FDIC provides deposit\ninsurance protection for deposits placed in a U.S.\ndepository institution. At September 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022 (a) , the Firmwide estimated\nuninsured deposits were $1,332.4 billion and\n$1,353.1 billion, respectively, primarily\nreflecting wholesale operating deposits.

These instruments\nare secured predominantly by high-quality\nsecurities collateral, including government-issued\ndebt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS.\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase\nincreased at September 30, 2023, compared with\nDecember 31, 2022, due to higher secured financing\nof trading assets and the impact of a lower level\nof netting on client-driven market-making\nactivities in Markets.\n\nThe balances associated with securities loaned or\nsold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over\ntime due to investment and financing activities of\nclients, the Firm\u2019s demand for financing, the\nongoing management of the mix of the Firm\u2019s\nliabilities, including its secured and unsecured\nfinancing (for both the investment securities and\nmarket-making portfolios), and other market and\nportfolio factors.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s sources of short-term unsecured funding\nprimarily consist of issuances of wholesale\ncommercial paper and other borrowed funds.\n\nThe decrease in commercial paper for the average\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2023\ncompared to the prior year periods, and the\nincrease in commercial paper at September 30, 2023,\nfrom December 31, 2022, were due to changes in net\nissuance levels primarily for short-term liquidity\nmanagement.\n\nThe decrease in average unsecured other borrowed\nfunds for the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2023 compared to the prior year periods was\nprimarily due to a lower level of overdrafts.\n                                                     59                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Long-term funding and issuance                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \nLong-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm\u2019s\nlong-term funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations and\nregulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification,\nmaximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors\nand currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan.\n\nThe significant majority of the Firm\u2019s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to\nprovide flexibility in support of the funding needs of both bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The Parent\nCompany advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue\ndebt to external counterparties.

The following tables do not include loans\nwhich the Firm accounts for at fair value and classifies as trading assets; refer to Notes 2 and 3 for\nfurther information regarding these loans. Refer to Notes 12, 24 and 5 for additional information on the\nFirm\u2019s loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables. Refer to Note 10 for information\nregarding the credit risk inherent in the Firm\u2019s investment securities portfolio; and refer to Note 11 for\ninformation regarding the credit risk inherent in the securities financing portfolio. Refer to Consumer\nCredit Portfolio on pages 65-69 and Note 12 for further discussions of the consumer credit environment and\nconsumer loans. Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 70-79 and Note 12 for further discussions of\nthe wholesale credit environment and wholesale loans. On January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted changes to the\nTDR accounting guidance, which eliminated the accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs including the\nrequirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession. The new\nguidance requires disclosure for loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty\nconsisting of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, other-than-insignificant payment delay, term\nextension or a combination of these modifications. The Firm has defined these types of modifications as\nfinancial difficulty modifications (\"FDMs\"). As a result of the elimination of the requirement to assess\nwhether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession, the population of loans considered\nFDMs differs from the population previously considered TDRs. Refer to Note 1 and Note 12 for further\ninformation.\n                                                                                                            \n  Total

\nPortfolio analysis Loans increased compared to\nDecember 31, 2022 driven by residential real estate\nloans associated with First Republic and higher\nauto loans. Residential real estate: The\nresidential real estate portfolio, including loans\nheld-for-sale and loans at fair value,\npredominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and\nhome equity lines of credit. Retained loans\nincreased compared to December 31, 2022, driven by\nresidential real estate loans associated with First\nRepublic. Retained nonaccrual loans decreased\ncompared to December 31, 2022. Net recoveries were\nlower for the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2023 compared to the same periods in the prior\nyear driven by lower prepayments due to higher\ninterest rates. Loans at fair value decreased from\nDecember 31, 2022, driven by a decrease in CIB due\nto sales outpacing purchases predominantly offset\nby an increase in Home Lending as originations\noutpaced warehouse loan sales. Nonaccrual loans at\nfair value decreased compared to December 31, 2022,\npredominantly driven by CIB. At September 30, 2023\nand December 31, 2022, the carrying value of\ninterest-only residential mortgage loans was $90.9\nbillion and $36.3 billion, respectively. The\nincrease was driven by First Republic. These loans\nhave an interest-only payment period generally\nfollowed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully\namortizing payment period to maturity and are\ntypically originated as higher-balance loans to\nhigher-income borrowers. The credit performance of\nthis portfolio is comparable with the performance\nof the broader prime mortgage portfolio and there\nwere no charge-offs associated with First Republic\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2023. The carrying value of home equity lines of\ncredit outstanding was $16.4 billion at September\n30, 2023, which included $2.6 billion associated\nwith First Republic. The carrying value of home\nequity lines of credit outstanding included $4.5\nbillion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-\nonly to fully amortizing payments or have been\nmodified and $4.5 billion of interest-only balloon\nHELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm\nmanages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving\nperiod by closing or reducing the undrawn line to\nthe extent permitted by law when borrowers are\nexhibiting a material deterioration in their credit\nrisk profile.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the\nFirm\u2019s residential mortgage portfolio insured\nand/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies,\npredominantly loans held-for-sale and loans at fair\nvalue. The Firm monitors its exposure to certain\npotential unrecoverable claim payments related to\ngovernment-insured loans and considers this\nexposure in estimating the allowance for loan\nlosses.\n                                                                                      \n                                               September 30,            December 31,  \n  (in millions)                                2023                     2022          \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Current                              $  632                 $    659                \n  30-89 days past due                     103                      136                \n  90 or more days past due                188                      302                \n  Total government guaranteed loans    $  923                 $  1,097                \n                                                                                      \nGeographic composition and current estimated loan-\nto-value ratio of residential real estate loans At\nSeptember 30, 2023, $229.3 billion, or 70% of the\ntotal retained residential real estate loan\nportfolio, was concentrated in California, New\nYork, Florida, Texas and Massachusetts, compared\nwith $147.8 billion, or 62% at December 31, 2022.\nRefer to Note 12 for information on the geographic\ncomposition and current estimated LTVs of the\nFirm\u2019s residential real estate loans. Modified\nresidential real estate loans For the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2023, residential\nreal estate FDMs were $43 million and $110 million,\nrespectively. In addition to FDMs, the Firm also\nhad $27 million and $59 million of loans subject to\ntrial modification where the terms of the loans\nhave not been permanently modified, as well as $3\nmillion and $7 million of loans subject to\ndischarge under Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings\n(\"Chapter 7 loans\") for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2023, respectively. The changes\nto the TDR accounting guidance eliminated the TDR\nreasonably expected and concession assessment\ncriteria. Accordingly, trial modifications and\nChapter 7 loans were considered TDRs, but not FDMs.\nRefer to Note 1 and Note 12 for further\ninformation. For the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022, residential real estate TDRs\nwere $80 million and $313 million, respectively.\nRefer to Note 12 for further information on TDRs in\nprior periods.\n                                                     67                                                     \nAuto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio,\nincluding loans at fair value, consists of prime-\nquality scored auto and business banking loans,\nother consumer unsecured loans, and overdrafts. The\nportfolio increased when compared to December 31,\n2022 due to originations of scored Auto loans and\nan increase in other consumer unsecured fair value\noption loans associated with First Republic,\npredominantly offset by paydowns. Net charge-offs\nincreased for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in\nthe prior year due to higher charge-offs of scored\nAuto loans as delinquency levels increased and\nvehicle valuations declined. The net charge-off\nrates for scored Auto loans were 0.61% and 0.27%\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2023 and\n2022, respectively, and 0.50% and 0.19% for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.

Net charge-offs increased\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2023 compared to the same periods in the prior year\nas delinquencies have normalized.\n\nConsistent with the Firm\u2019s policy, all credit card\nloans typically remain on accrual status until\ncharged off. However, the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan\nlosses includes the estimated uncollectible portion\nof accrued and billed interest and fee income.\nRefer to Note 12 for further information about this\nportfolio, including information about\ndelinquencies.\n\nGeographic and FICO composition of credit card\nloans\n\nRefer to Note 12 for information on the geographic\nand FICO composition of the Firm\u2019s credit card\nloans.\n                                                                                                            \n  Modifications of credit card loans                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \nFor the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2023, credit card FDMs were $197 million and $489\nmillion, respectively. FDMs increased for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared\nto credit card TDRs in the same periods in the\nprior year, as delinquencies have normalized. In\naddition to FDMs, the Firm also had $29 million of\nloans subject to trial modification where the terms\nof the loans have not been permanently modified for\nboth the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2023. The changes to the TDR accounting guidance\neliminated the TDR reasonably expected and\nconcession assessment criteria. Accordingly, trial\nmodifications were considered TDRs, but not FDMs.\n\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2022, credit card TDRs were $111 million and $274\nmillion, respectively.\n\nRefer to Note 1 and Note 12 for further\ninformation.\n                                                     69                                                     \n                              \n  WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO  \n                              \nIn its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending,\nmarket-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various\noperating services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and\ncash placed with banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm\u2019s wholesale businesses is\ngenerally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it\noriginates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations\nand credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth\nreviews of client credit quality and transaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of\nindustry, product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 72-75 for further\ninformation. The Firm\u2019s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as\nwell as risk-rated BWM and auto dealer exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied\nwhen determining the allowance for loan losses. The Firm continues to convert certain operations, and to\nintegrate clients, products and services, associated with First Republic to align with the Firm\u2019s businesses\nand operations. Accordingly, reporting classifications and internal risk rating profiles in the wholesale\nportfolio may change in future periods. Refer to Business Developments on page 9 for additional information.\nAs of September 30, 2023, retained loans increased $68.3 billion predominantly driven by the impact of First\nRepublic. Lending-related commitments increased $59.6 billion driven by the impact of First Republic, and\nnet portfolio activity in CIB and CB. As of September 30, 2023, the increase in nonperforming exposure was\ndriven by loans, including a single name in Banks & Finance Companies and client-specific downgrades in Real\nEstate and Healthcare, partially offset by a client-specific upgrade in civic organizations. For the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, wholesale charge-offs remained low, despite increased charge-offs in Office\nreal estate.\n

financial\ninstruments, such as commitments (including\nrevolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to\naddress the financing needs of its clients. The\ncontractual amounts of these financial instruments\nrepresent the maximum possible credit risk should\nthe clients draw down on these commitments or when\nthe Firm fulfills its obligations under these\nguarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to\nperform according to the terms of these contracts.\nMost of these commitments and guarantees have\nhistorically been refinanced, extended, cancelled,\nor expired without being drawn upon or a default\noccurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe\nthat the total contractual amount of these\nwholesale lending-related commitments is\nrepresentative of the Firm\u2019s expected future credit\nexposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 24\nfor further information on wholesale lending-\nrelated commitments.\n                                                                                                            \n  Receivables from customers                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nReceivables from customers reflect held-for-\ninvestment margin loans to brokerage clients in\nCIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets\nmaintained in the clients\u2019 brokerage accounts\n(e.g., cash on deposit, and liquid and readily\nmarketable debt or equity securities). Because of\nthis collateralization, no allowance for credit\nlosses is generally held against these receivables.\nTo manage its credit risk the Firm establishes\nmargin requirements and monitors the required\nmargin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires\nclients to deposit additional cash or other\ncollateral, or to reduce positions, when\nappropriate. These receivables are reported within\naccrued interest and accounts receivable on the\nFirm\u2019s Consolidated balance sheets.\n                                                                                                            \n  Derivative contracts                                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to\nmanage risk including credit risk and risks arising\nfrom fluctuations in interest rates, foreign\nexchange and equities and commodities prices. The\nFirm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet\nthese needs and uses derivatives to manage certain\nrisks associated with net open risk positions from\nits market-making activities, including the\ncounterparty credit risk arising from derivative\nreceivables. The Firm also uses derivative\ninstruments to manage its own credit risk and other\nmarket risk exposure. The nature of the\ncounterparty and the settlement mechanism of the\nderivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm\nis exposed. For over-the-counter (\"OTC\")\nderivatives the Firm is exposed to the credit risk\nof the derivative counterparty. For exchange-traded\nderivatives (\u201cETD\u201d), such as futures and options,\nand cleared over-the-counter (\u201cOTC-cleared\u201d)\nderivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the\ncredit risk of the relevant central counterparty\nclearing house (\u201cCCP\u201d). Where possible, the Firm\nseeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising\nfrom derivative contracts through the use of\nlegally enforceable master netting arrangements and\ncollateral agreements.\n\nThe percentage of the Firm\u2019s over-the-counter\nderivative transactions subject to collateral\nagreements \u2014 excluding foreign exchange spot\ntrades, which are not typically covered by\ncollateral agreements due to their short maturity,\nand centrally cleared trades that are settled daily\n\u2014 was approximately 88% and 87% at September 30,\n2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Refer to\nNote 5 for additional information on the Firm\u2019s use\nof collateral agreements and for a further\ndiscussion of derivative contracts, counterparties\nand settlement types.\n\nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported\non the Consolidated balance sheets was $67.1\nbillion and $70.9 billion at September 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively. The decrease was\nprimarily driven by market movements. Derivative\nreceivables represent the fair value of the\nderivative contracts after giving effect to legally\nenforceable master netting agreements and the\nrelated cash collateral held by the Firm.\n\nIn addition, the Firm held liquid securities and\nother cash collateral that may be used as security\nwhen the fair value of the client\u2019s exposure is in\nthe Firm\u2019s favor. For these purposes, the\ndefinition of liquid securities is consistent with\nthe definition of high quality liquid assets as\ndefined in the LCR rule.\n\nIn management\u2019s view, the appropriate measure of\ncurrent credit risk should also take into\nconsideration other collateral, which generally\nrepresents securities that do not qualify as high\nquality liquid assets under the LCR rule.

The allowance for credit losses\ngenerally consists of : \u2022 the allowance for loan\nlosses, which covers the Firm\u2019s retained loan\nportfolios (scored and risk-rated), \u2022 the allowance\nfor lending-related commitments, which is reflected\nin accounts payable and other liabilities on the\nConsolidated balance sheets, and \u2022 the allowance\nfor credit losses on investment securities, which\nis reflected in investment securities on the\nConsolidated balance sheets. Discussion of changes\nin the allowance The allowance for credit losses as\nof September 30, 2023 was $24.2 billion, reflecting\na net addition of $2.5 billion from December 31,\n2022. The net addition to the allowance for credit\nlosses included $1.4 billion, consisting of: \u2022 $707\nmillion in consumer , predominantly driven by CCB,\ncomprised of $801 million in Card Services,\npartially offset by a $200 million net reduction in\nHome Lending. The net addition in Card Services was\ndriven by loan growth, including an increase in\nrevolving balances, partially offset by reduced\nborrower uncertainty and the net effect of changes\nin the Firm's weighted average macroeconomic\noutlook. The net reduction in Home Lending was\nlargely driven by improvements in the outlook for\nhome prices, and \u2022 $623 million in wholesale ,\ndriven by net downgrade activity, the net effect of\nchanges in the Firm's weighted average\nmacroeconomic outlook, including deterioration in\nthe outlook for commercial real estate in CB,\npartially offset by the impact of changes in the\nloan and lending-related commitment portfolios in\nCIB in the third quarter of 2023. The net addition\nalso included $1.2 billion to establish the\nallowance for the First Republic loans and lending-\nrelated commitments in the second quarter of 2023.\nThe changes in the Firm's weighted average\nmacroeconomic outlook included updates to the\ncentral scenario in the third quarter of 2023 to\nreflect a lower forecasted unemployment rate\nconsistent with a higher growth rate in GDP. The\nFirm's weighted average macroeconomic outlook also\nreflects the impact of the additional weight placed\non the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of\n2023, reflecting elevated recession risks due to\nhigh inflation and tightening financial conditions.\nThe allowance for credit losses also reflected a\nreduction of $587 million as a result of the\nadoption of changes to the TDR accounting guidance\non January 1, 2023.

The adverse\nscenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic\nfactors than the central case assumptions provided\nin the table below, resulting in a weighted average\nU.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.5% in the\nfourth quarter of 2024, and a 1.8% lower U.S. real\nGDP exiting the fourth quarter of 2024.

1, 2023. The adoption of this guidance eliminated the existing accounting and\ndisclosure requirements for TDRs, including the requirement to measure the allowance using a discounted cash\nflow (\"DCF\") methodology. The Firm elected to change from an asset-specific allowance approach to its non-\nDCF, portfolio-based allowance approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers for all portfolios except\ncollateral-dependent loans and nonaccrual risk-rated loans, for which the asset-specific allowance approach\nwill continue to apply. Refer to Note 1 for further information.\n\n(b) Includes collateral-dependent loans, including those for which foreclosure is deemed probable, and\nnonaccrual risk-rated loans for all periods presented. Prior periods also include non collateral-dependent\nTDRs or reasonably expected TDRs and modified purchased credit deteriorated (\"PCD\") loans.\n\n(c) At September 30, 2023 and 2022, in addition to the allowance for credit losses in the table above, the\nFirm also had an allowance for credit losses of $17 million and $30 million, respectively, associated with\ncertain accounts receivable in CIB.\n\n(d) As of September 30, 2023 included $1.2 billion allowance for credit losses associated with First\nRepublic.\n\n(e) The Firm\u2019s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as\npermitted by regulatory guidance.\n                                                     81                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Allocation of allowance for loan losses                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \nThe table below presents a breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan class.

The investment securities portfolio is\npredominantly held by Treasury and CIO in\nconnection with the Firm\u2019s balance sheet and asset-\nliability management objectives. Principal\ninvestments are predominantly privately-held\nfinancial instruments and are managed in the LOBs\nand Corporate. Investments are typically intended\nto be held over extended periods and, accordingly,\nthe Firm has no expectation for short-term realized\ngains with respect to these investments. Investment\nsecurities risk Investment securities risk includes\nthe exposure associated with a default in the\npayment of principal and interest. This risk is\nmitigated given that the investment securities\nportfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly\nconsists of high-quality securities. At September\n30, 2023, the Treasury and CIO investment\nsecurities portfolio, net of the allowance for\ncredit losses, was $583.5 billion, and the average\ncredit rating of the securities comprising the\nportfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings\nwhere available, and where not available, based\nprimarily upon internal risk ratings). Refer to\nCorporate segment results on pages 45-46 and Note\n10 for further information on the investment\nsecurities portfolio and internal risk ratings.\nRefer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 54-61\nfor further information on related liquidity risk.\nRefer to Market Risk Management on pages 84-89 for\nfurther information on the market risk inherent in\nthe portfolio.\n\nPrincipal investment risk Principal investments are\ntypically privately-held financial instruments\nrepresenting ownership interests or other forms of\njunior capital. In general, principal investments\ninclude tax-oriented investments and investments\nmade to enhance or accelerate the Firm\u2019s business\nstrategies and exclude those that are consolidated\non the Firm's balance sheets. These investments are\nmade by dedicated investing businesses or as part\nof a broader business strategy.

The Firm has a single VaR\nframework used as a basis for calculating Risk\nManagement VaR and Regulatory VaR.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR is calculated\nassuming a one-day holding period and an expected\ntail-loss methodology which approximates a 95%\nconfidence level. For risk management purposes, the\nFirm believes this methodology provides a daily\nmeasure of risk that is closely aligned to risk\nmanagement decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate\nand, along with other market risk measures,\nprovides the appropriate information needed to\nrespond to risk events. The Firm calculates\nseparately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance\nwith regulatory rules (\u201cRegulatory VaR\u201d), which is\nused to derive the Firm\u2019s regulatory VaR-based\ncapital requirements under Basel III.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s VaR model calculations are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in response to changes in\nthe composition of the Firm\u2019s portfolios, changes\nin market conditions, improvements in the Firm\u2019s\nmodeling techniques and measurements, and other\nfactors. Such changes may affect historical\ncomparisons of VaR results.

This VaR does not include the retained loan\nportfolio, which is not reported at fair value. In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's\ninternal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed\nfrom Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated\nlevels.

The gains and losses depicted in the\nchart below do not reflect the Firm\u2019s reported revenue as they exclude certain components of total net\nrevenue, such as those associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven\ntrading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, other valuation adjustments and net\ninterest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or\nloss on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the\nrequirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.\n\nA backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the\nprior day. Under the Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are\nconsistent with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR\nbacktesting exceptions five times every 100 trading days on average. The number of VaR backtesting\nexceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the\ncurrent level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility during the 12\nmonths of historical data used in the VaR calculation.\n\nFor the 12 months ended September 30, 2023, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 137 of the 258 days, and\nobserved nine VaR backtesting exceptions. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Firm posted\nbacktesting gains on 36 of the 65 days, and observed one VaR backtesting exception.\n\nThe following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the\ntrailing 12 months and three months ended September 30, 2023. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as\na percentage of the corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are\nshown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the\nintervals that are greater than one hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the results\nof backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm\u2019s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital\nDisclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm\u2019s covered positions.\n                             Distribution of Daily Backtesting Gains and Losses                             \n                                                                                                            \n                                                     86                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Structural interest rate risk management                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \nThe effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm\u2019s\nreported net income is important as interest rate\nrisk represents one of the Firm\u2019s significant\nmarket risks. Interest rate risk arises not only\nfrom trading activities but also from the Firm\u2019s\ntraditional banking activities, which include\nextension of loans and credit facilities, taking\ndeposits, issuing debt and the investment\nsecurities portfolio. One way that the Firm\nevaluates its structural interest rate risk is\nthrough earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk\nestimates the Firm\u2019s interest rate exposure for a\ngiven interest rate scenario. It is presented as a\nsensitivity to a baseline, which includes net\ninterest income and certain interest rate sensitive\nfees. The baseline uses market interest rates and\nin the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The\nFirm conducts simulations of changes to this\nbaseline for interest rate-sensitive assets and\nliabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other\ncurrencies (\u201cnon-U.S. dollar\u201d currencies). These\nsimulations primarily include retained loans,\ndeposits, deposits with banks, investment\nsecurities, long-term debt and any related interest\nrate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of other\npositions in risk management VaR and other\nsensitivity-based measures as described on page 132\nof JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K. Earnings-at-\nrisk scenarios estimate the potential change to a\nnet interest income baseline, over the following 12\nmonths utilizing multiple assumptions. These\nscenarios include a parallel shift involving\nchanges to both short-term and long-term rates by\nan equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving\nholding short-term rates constant and increasing\nlong-term rates; and a flatter yield curve\ninvolving increasing short-term rates and holding\nlong-term rates constant or holding short-term\nrates constant and decreasing long-term rates.\nThese scenarios consider many different factors,\nincluding: \u2022 The impact on exposures as a result of\ninstantaneous changes in interest rates from\nbaseline rates. \u2022 Forecasted balance sheet, as well\nas modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior,\nbut excluding assumptions about actions that could\nbe taken by the Firm or its clients and customers\nin response to instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage\nprepayment assumptions are based on the interest\nrates used in the scenarios compared with\nunderlying contractual rates, the time since\norigination, and other factors which are updated\nperiodically based on historical experience.\nDeposit forecasts are a key assumption in the\nFirm's earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects\ncertain assumptions relating to the reversal of\nQuantitative Easing that are highly uncertain and\nrequire management judgment. Therefore, the actual\namount of deposits held by the Firm, at any\nparticular time, could be impacted by actions the\nFederal Reserve may take as part of monetary\npolicy, including through the use of the Reverse\nRepurchase Facility. In addition, there are other\nfactors that impact the amount of deposits held at\nthe Firm such\n\nas the level of loans across the industry and\ncompetition for deposits. \u2022 The pricing sensitivity\nof deposits, known as deposit betas, represent the\namount by which deposit rates paid could change\nupon a given change in market interest rates. As\npart of the Firm's continuous evaluation and\nperiodic enhancements to its earnings-at-risk\ncalculations, the Firm updated its model in the\nsecond quarter of 2023 to incorporate deposit\nrepricing lags impacting both consumer and\nwholesale deposits. The model change incorporated\nobserved pricing and customer behavior in both\nrising and falling interest rate environments.\nActual deposit rates paid may differ from the\nmodeled assumptions, primarily due to customer\nbehavior and competition for deposits. The Firm\u2019s\nearnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in response to changes in\nthe composition of the Firm\u2019s balance sheet,\nchanges in market conditions, improvements in the\nFirm\u2019s simulation and other factors.

The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various\nportfolios which may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the Firm\u2019s exposures\nare diversified given the Firm\u2019s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country. Refer to pages 139-140\nof JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm\u2019s country risk management. Risk\nReporting The following table presents the Firm\u2019s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of\nSeptember 30, 2023 and their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2022. The selection of countries\nrepresents the Firm\u2019s largest total exposures by individual country, based on the Firm\u2019s internal country\nrisk management approach, and does not represent the Firm\u2019s view of any existing or potentially adverse\ncredit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to client activity and market\nflows. The decrease in exposure to Japan when compared to December 31, 2022, was driven by a reduction in\ncash placed with the central bank of Japan as a result of liquidity management activities undertaken by the\nFirm and client-driven activities. The decrease in exposure to Australia when compared to December 31, 2022,\nwas driven by a reduction in cash placed with the central bank of Australia in the first quarter of 2023 due\nto client-driven activities resulting from changes in interest rates. . In addition, in the third quarter of\n2023, the exposures to Germany and the United Kingdom decreased by $18.6 billion and $13.6 billion,\nrespectively, when compared to June 30, 2023 primarily driven by decreases in cash placed with the central\nbanks of those countries as a result of liquidity management activities undertaken by the Firm and client-\ndriven activities. The Firm continues to monitor its exposure to Russia which was approximately $400 million\nas of September 30, 2023 based on the Firm's internal country risk measurement framework. This amount\nexcludes certain deposits placed on behalf of clients at the Depository Insurance Agency of Russia.\n

The Firm\u2019s most complex\naccounting estimates require management\u2019s judgment\nto ascertain the appropriate carrying value of\nassets and liabilities. The Firm has established\npolicies and control procedures intended to ensure\nthat estimation methods, including any judgments\nmade as part of such methods, are well-controlled,\nindependently reviewed and applied consistently\nfrom period to period. The methods used and\njudgments made reflect, among other factors, the\nnature of the assets or liabilities and the related\nbusiness and risk management strategies, which may\nvary across the Firm\u2019s businesses and portfolios.\nIn addition, the policies and procedures are\nintended to ensure that the process for changing\nmethodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The\nFirm believes its estimates for determining the\ncarrying value of its assets and liabilities are\nappropriate. The following is a brief description\nof the Firm\u2019s critical accounting estimates\ninvolving significant judgments.\n                                                                                                            \n  Allowance for credit losses                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement\u2019s estimate of expected credit losses\nover the remaining expected life of the Firm\u2019s\nfinancial assets measured at amortized cost and\ncertain off-balance sheet lending-related\ncommitments. The allowance for credit losses\ngenerally consists of:\n\n\u2022 The allowance for loan losses, which covers the\nFirm\u2019s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-\nrated).\n\n\u2022 The allowance for lending-related commitments,\nwhich is reflected in accounts payable and other\nliabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, and\n\n\u2022 The allowance for credit losses on investment\nsecurities, which is reflected in investment\nsecurities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses involves\nsignificant judgment on a number of matters\nincluding development and weighting of\nmacroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of\nhistorical loss experience, assessment of risk\ncharacteristics, assignment of risk ratings,\nvaluation of collateral, and the determination of\nremaining expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note\n13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for further\ninformation on these judgments as well as the\nFirm\u2019s policies and methodologies used to determine\nthe Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses; and refer\nto Allowance for credit losses on pages 80-82 and\nNote 13 of this Form 10-Q for further information.\n\nOne of the most significant judgments involved in\nestimating the Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses\nrelates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to\nestimate credit losses over the eight-quarter\nforecast period within the Firm\u2019s methodology. The\neight-quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of\nmacroeconomic variables (\"MEVs\") that are relevant\nfor exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit\nlosses being driven primarily by a subset of less\nthan twenty\n\nvariables. The specific variables that have the\ngreatest effect on the modeled losses of each\nportfolio vary by portfolio and geography.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include\nregional U.S. unemployment and HPI.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S.\nunemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices,\nU.S. interest rates, corporate credit spreads, oil\nprices, commercial real estate prices and HPI.\n\nChanges in the Firm\u2019s assumptions and forecasts of\neconomic conditions could significantly affect its\nestimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio\nat the balance sheet date or lead to significant\nchanges in the estimate from one reporting period\nto the next.\n\nAs a result of the First Republic acquisition, the\nFirm recorded an allowance for credit losses for\nthe loans acquired and lending-related commitments\nassumed as of May 1, 2023. Given the differences in\nrisk rating methodologies for the First Republic\nportfolio, and the ongoing integration of products\nand systems, the allowance for credit losses for\nthe acquired wholesale portfolio was measured based\non other facilities underwritten by the Firm with\nsimilar risk characteristics and not based on\nmodeled estimates. As such, the First Republic\nwholesale portfolio is excluded from the modeled\nestimates sensitivity analysis below. The allowance\nfor credit losses for predominantly all of the\nconsumer portfolio was measured using the Firm\u2019s\nmodeled approach, as the consumer portfolio is\npredominantly residential real estate that has more\ncommonly defined risk characteristics including\nloan to value ratio and credit score, and therefore\nis reflected in the sensitivity analysis below.\nRefer to Note 28 for additional information on the\nFirst Republic acquisition.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes\nin any one factor or input might affect the overall\nallowance for credit losses because management\nconsiders a wide variety of factors and inputs in\nestimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes\nin the factors and inputs considered may not occur\nat the same rate and may not be consistent across\nall geographies or product types, and changes in\nfactors and inputs may be directionally\ninconsistent, such that improvement in one factor\nor input may offset deterioration in others.\n\nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate\nmacroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the\nmodeled credit losses determined using its central\nand relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which\nare two of the five scenarios considered in\nestimating the allowances for loan losses and\nlending-related commitments. The central and\nrelative adverse scenarios each included a full\nsuite of MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths\nand peaks/troughs of those variables over the\neight-quarter forecast period.\n\nFor example, compared to the Firm\u2019s central\nscenario shown on page 80 and in Note 13, the\nFirm\u2019s relative\n                                                     91                                                     \nadverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S.\nunemployment rate, averaging approximately 1.9%\nhigher over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak\ndifference of 2.7% in the third quarter of 2024;\nlower U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery,\nremaining approximately 3.7% lower at the end of\nthe eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference\nof approximately 4.5% in the third quarter of 2024;\nand lower national HPI with a peak difference of\napproximately 16.2% in the second quarter of 2025.\nThis analysis is not intended to estimate expected\nfuture changes in the allowance for credit losses,\nfor a number of reasons, including: \u2022 The allowance\nas of September 30, 2023, reflects credit losses\nbeyond those estimated under the central scenario\ndue to the weight placed on the adverse scenarios.\n\u2022 The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both\ninterrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this\nanalysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more\nsevere changes in macroeconomic variables. \u2022\nExpectations of future changes in portfolio\ncomposition and borrower behavior can significantly\naffect the allowance for credit losses. To\ndemonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss\nestimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of\nSeptember 30, 2023, the Firm compared the modeled\nestimates under its relative adverse scenario to\nits central scenario. Without considering\noffsetting or correlated effects in other\nqualitative components of the Firm\u2019s allowance for\ncredit losses, the comparison between these two\nscenarios for the exposures below reflect the\nfollowing differences: \u2022 An increase of\napproximately $950 million for residential real\nestate loans and lending-related commitments,\nincluding the First Republic portfolios \u2022 An\nincrease of approximately $3.1 billion for credit\ncard loans \u25aa An increase of approximately $4.1\nbillion for wholesale loans and lending-related\ncommitments, excluding the First Republic\nportfolios. This analysis relates only to the\nmodeled credit loss estimates and is not intended\nto estimate changes in the overall allowance for\ncredit losses as it does not reflect any potential\nchanges in other adjustments to the quantitative\ncalculation, which would also be influenced by the\njudgment management applies to the modeled lifetime\nloss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and\nimprecision of these modeled lifetime loss\nestimates based on then-current circumstances and\nconditions. Recognizing that forecasts of\nmacroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain,\nparticularly in light of the recent economic\nconditions, the Firm believes that its process to\nconsider the available information and associated\nrisks and uncertainties is appropriately governed\nand that its estimates of expected credit losses\nwere reasonable and appropriate for the period\nended September 30, 2023.\n\nFair value JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its\nassets and liabilities at fair value. The majority\nof such assets and liabilities are measured at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis, including derivatives,\nstructured note products and certain securities\nfinancing agreements.

The level 3 balances would be reduced if\nnetting were applied, including the netting benefit\nassociated with cash collateral.\n                                                     92                                                     \nValuation\nEstimating fair value requires the application of\njudgment. The type and level of judgment required\nis largely dependent on the amount of observable\nmarket information available to the Firm. For\ninstruments valued using internally developed\nvaluation models and other valuation techniques\nthat use significant unobservable inputs and are\ntherefore classified within level 3 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair\nvalue are more significant than those required when\nestimating the fair value of instruments classified\nwithin levels 1 and 2.\n\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an\ninstrument within level 3, management must first\ndetermine the appropriate valuation model or other\nvaluation technique to use. Second, the lack of\nobservability of certain significant inputs\nrequires management to assess relevant empirical\ndata in deriving valuation inputs including, for\nexample, transaction details, yield curves,\ninterest rates, prepayment speeds, default rates,\nvolatilities, correlations, prices (such as\ncommodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of\ncomparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and\ncredit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further\ndiscussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments,\nincluding unobservable inputs used.\n\nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3,\nmanagement judgment must be applied to assess the\nappropriate level of valuation adjustments to\nreflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm\u2019s\ncreditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity\nconsiderations, unobservable parameters, and for\nportfolios that meet specified criteria, the size\nof the net open risk position. The judgments made\nare typically affected by the type of product and\nits specific contractual terms, and the level of\nliquidity for the product or within the market as a\nwhole. In periods of heightened market volatility\nand uncertainty judgments are further affected by\nthe wider variation of reasonable valuation\nestimates, particularly for positions that are less\nliquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of\nvaluation adjustments applied by the Firm.\n\nImprecision in estimating unobservable market\ninputs or other factors can affect the amount of\ngain or loss recorded for a particular position.\nFurthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation\nmethods are appropriate and consistent with those\nof other market participants, the methods and\nassumptions used reflect management judgment and\nmay vary across the Firm\u2019s businesses and\nportfolios.\n\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions\nin the determination of fair value. The use of\nmethodologies or assumptions different than those\nused by the Firm could result in a different\nestimate of fair value at the reporting date. Refer\nto Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm\u2019s\nvaluation process and hierarchy, and its\ndetermination of fair value for individual\nfinancial instruments.\n                                                                                                            \n  Credit card rewards liability                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \nThe credit card rewards liability was $12.9 billion\nand $11.3 billion at September 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively, and is recorded in\naccounts payable and other liabilities on the\nConsolidated balance sheets. The increase in the\nliability was predominantly driven by continued\ngrowth in rewards points earned on higher spend and\npromotional offers outpacing redemptions throughout\n2023, and, to a lesser extent, adjustments to\ncertain reward program terms in the second quarter\nof 2023.

Co. (\u201cJPMorgan Chase\u201d or the \u201cFirm\u201d), a financial holding company incorporated under\nDelaware law in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The\nFirm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial\nbanking, financial transaction processing and asset management. On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired\ncertain assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank (the \u201cFirst Republic acquisition\u201d)\nfrom the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d). The Firm continues to convert certain operations,\nand to integrate clients, products and services associated with the First Republic acquisition, to align\nwith the Firm\u2019s businesses and operations. The Firm also continues to evaluate to which segments certain\nclients, products and services, primarily deposits, should be allocated. Accordingly, reporting\nclassifications and allocations may change in future periods, including across the Firm's segments. Refer to\nNote 27 for a further discussion of the Firm\u2019s business segments and Note 28 for additional information on\nthe First Republic acquisition. The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its\nsubsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting\nand reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. The unaudited Consolidated Financial\nStatements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent\nassets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion of\nmanagement, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included such that this interim financial\ninformation is fairly stated. These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in\nconjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K. Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been revised to conform with\nthe current presentation. Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of\nJPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material\nintercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Assets held for clients in an agency or\nfiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets. The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first\nevaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity. Refer to Notes 1\nand 14 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for a further description of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s accounting policies\nregarding consolidation. Offsetting assets and liabilities U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative\nreceivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables\nand payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting\nagreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities financing balances to be presented on a net basis when\nspecified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The\nFirm has elected to net such balances where it has determined that the specified conditions are met. Refer\nto Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for further information on offsetting assets and liabilities.\nAccounting standards adopted January 1, 2023 Derivatives and Hedging: Fair Value Hedging \u2013 Portfolio Layer\nMethod The adoption of this guidance expanded the ability to hedge a portfolio of prepayable assets to allow\nmore of the portfolio to be hedged. Non-prepayable assets can also be included in the same portfolio, thus\nincreasing the size of the portfolio and the amount available to be hedged. This guidance also clarified the\ntypes of derivatives that can be used as hedges, and the balance sheet presentation and disclosure\nrequirements for the hedge accounting adjustments. As permitted by the guidance, the Firm elected to\ntransfer HTM securities to AFS and designate those securities in a portfolio layer method hedge upon\nadoption. The adoption impact of the transfer on retained earnings was not material. Refer to Note 5 and\nNote 10 for additional information. Financial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings and\nVintage Disclosures The adoption of this guidance eliminated the accounting and disclosure requirements for\nTDRs, including the requirement to measure the allowance using a discounted cash flow (\u201cDCF\u201d) methodology,\nand allowed the option of a non-DCF portfolio-based approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers. If a\nDCF methodology is still applied for these modified loans, the discount rate must be the post-\n                                                    101                                                     \nmodification effective interest rate, instead of\nthe pre-modification effective interest rate. The\nFirm elected to apply its non-DCF, portfolio-based\nallowance approach for modified loans to troubled\nborrowers for all portfolios except collateral-\ndependent loans and nonaccrual risk-rated loans\nwhich the Firm elected to continue applying a DCF\nmethodology. Refer to Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n2022 Form 10-K for a description of the portfolio-\nbased allowance approach and the asset-specific\nallowance approach. This guidance was adopted under\nthe modified retrospective method which resulted in\na net decrease to the allowance for credit losses\nof $ 587million and an increase to retained\nearnings of $ 446million, after-tax, predominantly\ndriven by residential real estate and credit card.\nThe adoption of this guidance eliminated the\ndisclosure requirements for TDRs including the\nrequirement to assess whether a modification is\nreasonably expected or involves a concession. The\nnew guidance requires disclosure for loan\nmodifications to borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty consisting of principal forgiveness,\ninterest rate reduction, other-than-insignificant\npayment delay, term extension or a combination of\nthese modifications. The Firm has defined these\ntypes of modifications as financial difficulty\nmodifications (\"FDMs\"). As a result of the\nelimination of the requirement to assess whether a\nmodification is reasonably expected or involves a\nconcession, the population of loans considered FDMs\ndiffers from the population previously considered\nTDRs. This guidance also requires disclosure of\ncurrent period gross charge-offs by vintage\norigination year. Refer to Note 12 for further\ninformation.\n                                                    102                                                     \n

$ 90.8billion and $\n73.8billion, respectively, which were mortgage-related.\n\n(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable\nvalue. \u201cNet realizable value\u201d is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell\n(\u201ctransaction costs\u201d). Transaction costs for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories are either not\napplicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair\nvalue for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net\nrealizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because\nunder fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 5 for\na further discussion of the Firm\u2019s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value\ndisclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.\n                                                    105                                                     \n(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical\nsecurities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).\n\n(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its\nequivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At\nSeptember 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge\nfunds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $ 1.0billion and $ 950million, respectively.\nIncluded in these balances at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, were trading assets of $ 42million\nand $ 43million, respectively, and other assets of $ 997million and $ 907million, respectively.\n\n(e) At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, included $ 9.4billion and $ 9.7billion, respectively, of\nresidential first-lien mortgages, and $ 6.2billion and $ 6.8billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien\nmortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell\nto U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $ 3.7billion and $ 2.4billion, respectively.\n\n(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables\nand the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement\nexists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit\nassociated with cash collateral.\n\nLevel 3 valuations\n\nRefer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm\u2019s valuation process\nand a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. The\nfollowing table presents the Firm\u2019s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to\nmeasure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of\nvalues for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to\nclassify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall\nfair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is,\ncomponents that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the\nunobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the\nFirm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and\nderivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of\nvalues presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the\nsignificant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted\naverages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the\ninstruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm\u2019s view, the input range, weighted and\narithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the\nreasonableness of the Firm\u2019s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the\nvarious instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of\ncharacteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and\nvaluation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option\ncontracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted average values\nwill therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the\ninstruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.\n                                                    106                                                     \n

been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ\nfrom their classification on the Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each\nvaluation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the\ntechnique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ.\n\n(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $ 779million, nonagency securities of $ 5million\nand non-trading loans of $ 880million.\n\n(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $ 13million, trading loans of $ 72million and non-trading loans of $\n2.2billion.\n\n(d) Comprises trading loans of $ 976million and non-trading loans of $ 633million.\n\n(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are\nfinancial instruments that typically contain embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of\nstructured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant\nunobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.\n\n(f) Includes equity securities of $ 830million including $ 680million in Other assets, for which quoted\nprices are not readily available and the fair value is generally based on internal valuation techniques such\nas EBITDA multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant both\nindividually and in aggregate.\n\n(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not\nreadily available, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal valuation techniques. The price\ninput is expressed assuming a par value of $ 100.\n\n(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.\n\n(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are\nused.\n                                                    107                                                     \nChanges in and ranges of unobservable inputs Refer\nto Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for a\ndiscussion of the impact on fair value of changes\nin unobservable inputs and the relationships\nbetween unobservable inputs as well as a\ndescription of attributes of the underlying\ninstruments and external market factors that affect\nthe range of inputs used in the valuation of the\nFirm\u2019s positions. Changes in level 3 recurring fair\nvalue measurements The following tables include a\nrollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets\namounts (including changes in fair value) for\nfinancial instruments classified by the Firm within\nlevel 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. When a\ndetermination is made to classify a financial\ninstrument within level 3, the determination is\nbased on the significance of the unobservable\ninputs to the overall fair value measurement.\nHowever, level 3 financial instruments typically\ninclude, in addition to the unobservable or level 3\ncomponents, observable components (that is,\ncomponents that are actively quoted and can be\nvalidated to external sources); accordingly, the\ngains and losses in the table below include changes\nin fair value due in part to observable factors\nthat are part of the valuation methodology. Also,\nthe Firm risk-manages the observable components of\nlevel 3 financial instruments using securities and\nderivative positions that are classified within\nlevel 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these\nlevel 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are\nnot included below, the gains or losses in the\nfollowing tables do not reflect the effect of the\nFirm\u2019s risk management activities related to such\nlevel 3 instruments.\n                                                    108                                                     \n

The period-end carrying values reflect\ncumulative purchases and sales in addition to upward and downward carrying value changes.\n(b) The cumulative upward carrying value changes between January 1, 2018 and September 30, 2023 were $\n1.3billion.\n(c) The cumulative downward carrying value changes/impairment between January 1, 2018 and September 30, 2023\nwere $( 1.1) billion.\nIncluded in other assets above is the Firm\u2019s interest in approximately 37million Visa Class B common shares\n(\u201cVisa B shares\u201d). These shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa\nClass A common shares (\u201cVisa A shares\u201d) at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain\nlitigation matters involving Visa. On October 2, 2023, Visa filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC\nindicating that the conversion rate of Visa B shares to Visa A shares decreased from 1.5902to\n1.5875effective September 28, 2023. The conversion rate may be further adjusted by Visa depending on\ndevelopments related to the litigation matters. The outcome of those litigation matters, and the effect that\nthe resolution of those matters may have on the conversion rate, is unknown. Accordingly, as of September\n30, 2023, there is significant uncertainty regarding when the transfer restrictions on Visa B shares may be\nterminated and what the final conversion rate for the Visa B shares will be. As a result of these\nconsiderations, as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B shares are not considered to be similar to\nVisa A shares, and they continue to be held at their nominal carrying value.\n\nIn connection with prior sales of Visa B shares, the Firm has entered into derivative instruments with the\npurchasers of the shares under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the conversion\nrate. Under the terms of the derivative instruments, the Firm will (a) make or receive payments based on\nsubsequent changes in the conversion rate and (b) make periodic interest payments to the purchasers of the\nVisa B shares. The payments under the derivative instruments will continue as long as the Visa B shares\nremain subject to transfer restrictions. The derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value using a\ndiscounted cash flow methodology based upon the Firm\u2019s estimate of the timing and magnitude of final\nresolution of the litigation matters. The derivative instruments are recorded in trading liabilities, and\nchanges in fair value are recognized in other income. As of September 30, 2023, the Firm held derivative\ninstruments associated with 23million Visa B shares that the Firm had previously sold, which are all subject\nto similar terms and conditions.\n\nOn September 13, 2023, Visa filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC announcing that Visa is engaging\nwith its common stockholders on potential amendments to its Certificate of Incorporation that would\nauthorize Visa to conduct an exchange offer program (\"the Program\") and have the effect of releasing\ntransfer restrictions on portions of Visa's Class B common stock. The amendments would become effective only\nif approved by a majority of the outstanding shares of Visa's Class A, Class B and Class C common stock,\neach voting as a separate class. The Program, if approved as proposed, would entitle the Firm to sell up to\n50% of the Firm's Visa B shares through an initial exchange offer and would also provide for the potential\nof future exchange offers.\n                                                    116                                                     \nAdditional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments

underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual\nfees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and\nprimary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the\nvalue of the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan\u2019s allowance for\nloan losses, which represents the loan\u2019s expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The\ndifference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to\nchanges in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that\naffect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value.\n(b) Includes FHLB advances in level 2 of Long-term debt and Short-term borrowings and the Purchase Money\nNote in level 3 of Long-term debt associated with First Republic. Refer to Notes 18 and 28 for additional\ninformation.\nThe majority of the Firm\u2019s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets.

more past due as of September 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022.\n(c) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-\nterm beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests,\nfor which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-protected\nstructured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of\nprincipal at maturity, but for structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an\nunderlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit\nrisk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.\n(d) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the\ncontractual principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm\u2019s\nnext call date.\nAt September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which\nthe fair value option was elected was $ 13.0billion and $ 7.6billion, respectively, with a corresponding\nfair value of $ 247million and $ 24million, respectively.

JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit portfolios to\nassess potential credit risk concentrations and to obtain additional collateral when deemed necessary and\npermitted under the Firm\u2019s agreements. Senior management is significantly involved in the credit approval\nand review process, and risk levels are adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm\u2019s risk appetite. In the\nFirm\u2019s consumer portfolio, concentrations are managed primarily by product and by U.S. geographic region,\nwith a key focus on trends and concentrations at the portfolio level, where potential credit risk\nconcentrations can be remedied through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. Refer to\nNote 12 for additional information on the geographic composition of the Firm\u2019s consumer loan portfolios. In\nthe wholesale portfolio, credit risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by industry and monitored\nregularly on both an aggregate portfolio level and on an individual client or counterparty basis. The Firm\u2019s\nwholesale exposure is managed through loan syndications and participations, loan sales, securitizations,\ncredit derivatives, master netting agreements, collateral and other risk-reduction techniques. Refer to Note\n12 for additional information on loans. The Firm does not believe that its exposure to any particular loan\nproduct or industry segment results in a significant concentration of credit risk. Terms of loan products\nand collateral coverage are included in the Firm\u2019s assessment when extending credit and establishing its\nallowance for loan losses.\n                                                    122                                                     \nThe table below presents both on\u2013balance sheet and off\u2013balance sheet consumer and wholesale credit exposure\nby the Firm\u2019s three credit portfolio segments as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Derivatives contracts\ngenerally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined\nrating threshold is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower\nthan a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in\nadditional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a\nratings downgrade), nor in termination payment requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated\nbased upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative\ncontract.\n                                                                                                            \n  Liquidity                                                                                                 \n  impact of                                                                                                 \n  downgrade                                                                                                 \n  triggers                                                                                                  \n  on OTC and                                                                                                \n  OTC-cleared            September 30,                                 December 31,                         \n  derivatives                     2023                                         2022                         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (in millions)           Single-notch              Two-notch          Single-notch              Two-notch  \n                             downgrade              downgrade             downgrade              downgrade  \n  Amount of                                                                                                 \n  additional                                                                                                \n  collateral to     $              111    $             1,335    $              128    $             1,293  \n  be                                                                                                        \n  posted upon                                                                                               \n  downgrade(a)                                                                                              \n  Amount                                                                                                    \n  required to                                                                                               \n  settle                                                                                                    \n  contracts with                    98                    725                    88                    925  \n  termination                                                                                               \n  triggers upon                                                                                             \n  downgrade(b)                                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \n(a) Includes the additional collateral to be posted for initial margin.\n(b) Amounts represent fair values of derivative payables, and do not reflect collateral posted.\nDerivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset\n\nIn certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains\nthe economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in\ncontemplation of the initial transfer.

Excluded components may impact earnings either through amortization of the\ninitial amount over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current\nperiod.\n(f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the\namortization approach, predominantly cross-currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the\nhedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative.\n                                                    130                                                     \nAs of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets related to certain cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that are expected to reverse\nthrough the income statement in future periods as an adjustment to yield.\n                                                                                                            \n                                                                     Cumulative                             \n                                                                 amount of fair                             \n                                                                  value hedging                             \n                                                                    adjustments                             \n                                                                included in the                             \n                                                                carrying amount                             \n                                                                      of hedged                             \n                       Carrying amount                                   items:                             \n  September 30,                 of the                             Discontinued                             \n  2023                          hedged    Active hedging                hedging                             \n  (in millions)            items(a)(b)    relationships(\u2026       relationships(\u2026        Total                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Assets                                                                                                    \n  Investment                                                                                                \n  securities -

As a result\nof the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing\nunrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is\nno incremental impact to net income in future periods.\n(b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis\nadjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future\nperiods.

Effective January 1,\n2023, the Firm adopted the new portfolio layer method hedge accounting guidance which expanded the ability\nto hedge a portfolio of prepayable assets to allow more of the portfolio to be hedged. At September 30,\n2023, the amortized cost of the portfolio layer method closed portfolios was $ 64.9billion, of which $\n63.5billion was designated as hedged. The cumulative amount of basis adjustments was $( 3.1) billion,\nreflecting $( 2.9) billion and $( 207) million for active and discontinued hedging relationships,\nrespectively. Refer to Note 1 and Note 10 for additional information.\n(d) Positive (negative) amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments\nthat will reduce (increase) net interest income in future periods. Positive (negative) amounts related to\nliabilities represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will increase (reduce) net interest\nincome in future periods.\n(e) Represents basis adjustments existing on the balance sheet date associated with hedged items that have\nbeen de-designated from qualifying fair value hedging relationships.\n                                                    131                                                     \nCash flow hedge gains and losses\nThe following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting\nrelationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which\nforecasted transactions are hedged is approximately seven years. The Firm\u2019s longer-dated forecasted\ntransactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities.\n                                                    132                                                     \nNet investment hedge gains and losses\nThe following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge\naccounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.\n                                                                                                            \n                 Gains/(losse\u2026                                                                              \n                   recorded in                                                                              \n                    income and                                                                              \n  Three                  other                                                                              \n  months         comprehensive                                                                              \n  ended          income/(loss)                                                                              \n  September               2023                                          2022                                \n  30,                  Amounts                      Amounts          Amounts                       Amounts  \n  (in              recorded in                  recorded in      recorded in                   recorded in  \n  millions)       income(a)(b)                          OCI     income(a)(b)                           OCI  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Foreign                                                                                                   \n  exchange                        $   26    $         1,650                     $    26    $         2,992  \n  derivatives                                                                                               \n                 Gains/(losse\u2026                                                                              \n                   recorded in                                                                              \n                    income and                                                                              \n                         other                                                                              \n                 comprehensive                                                                              \n                 income/(loss)                                                                              \n                          2023                                          2022                                \n  Nine months                                                                                               \n  ended                Amounts                      Amounts          Amounts                       Amounts  \n  September        recorded in                  recorded in      recorded in                   recorded in  \n  30,             income(a)(b)                          OCI     income(a)(b)                           OCI  \n  (in                                                                                                       \n  millions)                                                                                                 \n  Foreign                                                                                                   \n  exchange                        $  231    $           558                     $  -221    $         6,850  \n  derivatives                                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n(a) Certain components of hedging derivatives are permitted to be excluded from the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness, such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts.

The Firm transferred obligations of U.S.\nstates and municipalities with a carrying value of $ 7.1billion resulting in the recognition of $ 38million\nnet pre-tax unrealized losses in AOCI. This transfer was a noncash transaction. Refer to Note 1 and Note 21\nfor additional information. During 2022, the Firm transferred $ 78.3billion of investment securities from\nAFS to HTM for capital management purposes. AOCI included pretax unrealized losses of $ 4.8billion on the\nsecurities at the date of transfer.

yield of each security owned at the end of the period,\nweighted based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon,\namortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives,\nincluding closed portfolio hedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield\nexcludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from\ntheir contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable\ndebt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.\n(b) For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the allowance\nfor credit losses of $( 30) million and the portfolio layer fair value hedge basis adjustments of $( 2.9)\nbillion at September 30, 2023.

Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding securities financing\nagreements for which the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 25 for further information\nregarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements. The table below\nsummarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm\u2019s securities financing agreements as of September 30, 2023\nand December 31, 2022. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master\nnetting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the\nFirm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing\nagreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral\nwith its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not\neligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal\nopinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with securities\nfinancing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the\ntable below as \u201cAmounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,\u201d and reduces the \u201cNet amounts\u201d\npresented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances\nare presented gross in the \u201cNet amounts\u201d below. In transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a\nsecurities-for-securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as\ncollateral, the Firm recognizes the securities received at fair value within other assets and the obligation\nto return those securities within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n

a\nsale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing\ntransactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding\nliabilities are recorded primarily in short-term borrowings and long-term debt on the Consolidated balance\nsheets.\n                                                    146                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Note 12 \u2013 Loans                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \nLoan accounting framework\n\nThe accounting for a loan depends on management\u2019s strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based\non the following categories:\n\n\u2022 Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., \u201cretained\u201d)\n\n\u2022 Loans held-for-sale\n\n\u2022 Loans at fair value\n\nRefer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting\npolicies. Refer to Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value\naccounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 of this Form 10-Q for information on loans carried\nat fair value and classified as trading assets.\n\nOn January 1, 2023 the Firm adopted the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings\nand Vintage Disclosures accounting guidance as discussed in Note 1. The adoption of this guidance eliminated\nthe existing accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs, and implemented additional disclosure\nrequirements for FDMs. The disclosure requirements for FDMs are effective for periods beginning on or after\nJanuary 1, 2023. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion on loan\nmodifications prior to January 1, 2023, which were accounted for and reported as TDRs. This new guidance\nalso requires disclosure of current period gross charge-offs by vintage origination year, effective for\nperiods beginning on or after January 1, 2023.\n\nLoan portfolio\nThe Firm\u2019s loan portfolio is divided into threeportfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the\nFirm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and\nWholesale. Within each portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following\nclasses of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class.\n                                                                                      \n  Consumer, excluding             Credit card            Wholesale(c)(d)              \n  credit card                                                                         \n  \u2022 Residential real estate(a)                           \u2022 Secured by real estate     \n  \u2022 Auto and other(b)             \u2022 Credit card loans    \u2022 Commercial and industrial  \n                                                         \u2022 Other(e)                   \n                                                                                      \n(a) Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored mortgage loans held in\nCIB.\n(b) Includes scored auto, business banking loans and overdrafts in BWM and other consumer unsecured loans in\nCIB.\n(c) Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM, Corporate as well as risk-rated BWM and auto dealer loans held in\nCCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses.\n(d) The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the bank\nregulatory agencies, based on the loan's collateral, purpose, and type of borrower.\n(e) Includes loans to financial institutions, states and political subdivisions, SPEs, nonprofits, personal\ninvestment companies and trusts, as well as loans to individuals and individual entities (predominantly\nGlobal Private Bank clients within AWM and J.P.

September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. These amounts have been excluded based upon the\ngovernment guarantee.\n\n(e) Included $ 165million of 30+ days past due loans associated with First Republic.\n\n(f) Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated.\n\nApproximately 37% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien\nloans. The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses. Revolving\nloans that have been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within\nthe revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for\nthose products is higher than the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving\nperiod.\n                                                    150                                                     \nNonaccrual loans and other credit quality indicators\n\nThe following

residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of\nthe underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance,\nresidential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the\nborrower (\u201cChapter 7 loans\u201d) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual loans, regardless of their delinquency\nstatus. At September 30, 2023, approximately 10% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or\nmore past due.\n\n(b) Mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies excluded from nonaccrual loans were not material at\nSeptember 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\n(c) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance,\ncertain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of\namortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the\nunderlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.\n\n(d) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $ 44million and $ 42million and $\n133million and $ 132million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n(e) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n(f) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property\nvalue. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using\nnationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available\nand forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home\nequity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.\n\n(g) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower\u2019s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm\non at least a quarterly basis.\n\n(h) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO\nscore. These loans have been included in a FICO band based on management\u2019s estimation of the borrower\u2019s\ncredit quality.\n\n(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.\n\n(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding\nloan balances at September 30, 2023.\n\n(k) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.\n\n(l) Included $ 2.6billion in equal to or greater than 660 FICO scores within 80% to 100% LTV ratio, and $\n86.3billion and $ 1.7billion in equal to or greater than 660 and less than 660 FICO scores, respectively,\nwithin less than 80% LTV ratio associated with First Republic.\n\n(m) Included $ 91.2billion of loans associated with First Republic.\n\n(n) Included $ 55.2billion, $ 15.0billion, $ 3.6billion and $ 7.9billion in California, New York, Florida\nand Massachusetts, respectively, associated with First Republic.\n                                                    151                                                     \nLoan modifications\n\nThe Firm grants certain modifications of residential real estate loans to borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty, which effective January 1, 2023, are reported as FDMs. The Firm's proprietary modification\nprograms as well as government programs, including U.S. GSE programs, that generally provide various\nmodifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty including, but not limited to, interest rate\nreductions, term extensions, other-than-insignificant payment delay and principal forgiveness that would\notherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement, are considered FDMs. Financial\neffects of FDMs For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, residential real estate FDMs were $\n43million and $ 110million, respectively. The financial effects of the FDMs, which were predominantly in the\nform of term extensions and interest rate reductions, included extending the weighted-average life of the\nloans by 22years and 19years, and reducing the weighted-average contractual interest rate from 7.22% to\n4.63% and 7.04% to 4.24% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. For the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were noadditional commitments to lend to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty whose loans have been modified as FDMs. In addition to FDMs, the Firm also\nhad $ 27million and $ 59million of loans subject to a trial modification, and $ 3million and $ 7million of\nChapter 7 loans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The changes to the TDR\naccounting guidance eliminated the TDR reasonably expected and concession assessment criteria. Accordingly,\ntrial modifications and Chapter 7 loans were considered TDRs, but not FDMs. Payment status of FDMs and\nredefaults For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, residential real estate FDMs of $\n6million and $ 20million, respectively, were 30 or more days past due. For both the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2023, FDMs that re-defaulted were not material. Nature and extent of TDRs For periods\nending prior to January 1, 2023, modifications of residential real estate loans where the Firm granted\nconcessions to borrowers who were experiencing financial difficulty were generally accounted for and\nreported as TDRs. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, new TDRs were $ 80million and $\n313million, respectively. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real\nestate loans have been modified in TDRs.

effective January 1, 2023, are reported as FDMs. These modifications involve placing the customer on a\nfixed payment plan, generally for 60months, and typically include reducing the interest rate on the credit\ncard under long-term programs. If the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the\ncredit card loan continues to age and will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with the Firm's standard\ncharge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm does not reinstate the borrower's line of credit.\n\nFinancial effects of FDMs\nThe following tables provide information on credit card loan modifications considered FDMs.\n                                                                                                            \n  Three months ended                            % of loan modifications to                                  \n  September 30, 2023               Amortized                         total       Financial effect of loan   \n  (in millions)                   cost basis    retained credit card loans       modification               \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Loan modification                                                                                         \n                                                                                 Term extension with a      \n  Term extension and                                                             reduction in the weighted  \n  interest rate                $         197                          0.10  %    average contractual        \n  reduction(a)(b)                                                                interest rate from23.48%   \n                                                                                 to3.67%                    \n  Total                        $         197                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Nine months ended                             % of loan modifications to                                  \n  September 30, 2023               Amortized                         total       Financial effect of loan   \n  (in millions)                   cost basis    retained credit card loans       modification               \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Loan modification                                                                                         \n                                                                                 Term extension with a      \n  Term extension and                                                             reduction in the weighted  \n  interest rate                $         489                          0.25  %    average contractual        \n  reduction(a)(b)                                                                interest rate from23.15%   \n                                                                                 to3.58%                    \n  Total                        $         489                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n(a) Term extension includes credit card loans whose terms have been modified under long-term programs by\nplacing the customer on a fixed payment plan.\n(b) The interest rates represent weighted average at enrollment.\nFor both the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2023, the Firm also had $ 29million of credit\ncard loans subject to trial modifications.

and\nindustrial loans have been modified as FDMs were $ 363million and $ 1.5billion for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2023, and additional unfunded commitments to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty\nwhose Secured by real estate and Other loans have been modified as FDMs were $ 1million for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2023. Nature and extent of TDRs Prior to January 1, 2023, certain loan\nmodifications were considered TDRs. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, new TDRs were $\n108million and $ 587million, respectively. New TDRs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022\nreflected extended maturity dates and covenant waivers primarily in the Commercial and Industrial loan\nclass. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, the impact of these modifications were not\nmaterial to the Firm. As a result of the elimination of the requirement to assess whether a modification is\nreasonably expected or involves a concession, the population of loans considered FDMs is greater than the\npopulation previously considered TDRs.\n                                                    161                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Note 13 \u2013 Allowance for credit losses                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement's estimate of expected credit losses\nover the remaining expected life of the Firm's\nfinancial assets measured at amortized cost and\ncertain off-balance sheet lending-related\ncommitments. On January 1, 2023 the Firm adopted\nthe Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled\nDebt Restructurings accounting guidance as\ndescribed in Note 1. The adoption of this guidance\neliminated the requirement to measure the allowance\nfor TDRs using a DCF methodology and allowed the\noption of a non-DCF portfolio-based approach for\nmodified loans to borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty. If a DCF methodology is still applied\nfor these modified loans, the discount rate must be\nthe post-modification effective interest rate,\ninstead of the pre-modification effective interest\nrate. The Firm elected to change from an asset-\nspecific allowance approach to its non-DCF,\nportfolio-based allowance approach for modified\nloans to troubled borrowers for all portfolios\nexcept collateral-dependent loans and nonaccrual\nrisk-rated loans, for which the asset-specific\nallowance approach will continue to apply. This\nguidance was adopted under the modified\nretrospective method which resulted in a net\ndecrease to the allowance for credit losses of $\n587million and an increase to retained earnings of\n$ 446million, after-tax predominantly driven by\nresidential real estate and credit card. Refer to\nNote 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for a\ndetailed discussion of the allowance for credit\nlosses and the related accounting policies.\n                                                    162                                                     \nAllowance for credit losses and related information\nThe table below summarizes information about the allowances for credit losses and includes a breakdown of\nloans and lending-related commitments by impairment methodology.

2023 and 2022, in addition to the allowance for credit losses in the table above, the\nFirm also had an allowance for credit losses of $ 17million and $ 30million, respectively, associated with\ncertain accounts receivable in CIB.\n(c) As of September 30, 2023 included $ 1.2billion allowance for credit losses associated with First\nRepublic.\n(d) Includes collateral-dependent loans, including those for which foreclosure is deemed probable, and\nnonaccrual risk-rated loans for all periods presented. Prior periods also include non collateral-dependent\nTDRs or reasonably expected TDRs and modified PCD loans.\n(e) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets.\n(f) At September 30, 2023 and 2022, lending-related commitments excluded $ 18.1billion and $ 12.6billion,\nrespectively, for the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment; $ 898.9billion and $ 798.9billion,\nrespectively, for the credit card portfolio segment; and $ 16.2billion and $ 20.0billion, respectively, for\nthe wholesale portfolio segment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-related commitments.\nPrior period amount for wholesale lending-related commitments, including the amount not subject to\nallowance, has been revised to conform with the current presentation.\n                                                    163                                                     \nDiscussion of changes in the allowance\n\nThe allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2023 was $ 24.2billion, reflecting a net addition of $\n2.5billion from December 31, 2022. The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included $\n1.4billion, consisting of: \u2022 $ 707million in consumer , predominantly driven by CCB, comprised of $\n801million in Card Services, partially offset by a $ 200million net reduction in Home Lending. The net\naddition in Card Services was driven by loan growth, including an increase in revolving balances, partially\noffset by reduced borrower uncertainty and the net effect of changes in the Firm's weighted average\nmacroeconomic outlook. The net reduction in Home Lending was largely driven by improvements in the outlook\nfor home prices, and \u2022 $ 623million in wholesale , driven by net downgrade activity, the net effect of\nchanges in the Firm's weighted average macroeconomic outlook, including deterioration in the outlook for\ncommercial real estate in CB, partially offset by the impact of changes in the loan and lending-related\ncommitment portfolios in CIB in the third quarter of 2023. The net addition also included $ 1.2billion to\nestablish the allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related commitments in the second quarter\nof 2023. The changes in the Firm's weighted average macroeconomic outlook included updates to the central\nscenario in the third quarter of 2023 to reflect a lower forecasted unemployment rate consistent with a\nhigher growth rate in GDP. The Firm's weighted average macroeconomic outlook also reflects the impact of the\nadditional weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting elevated\nrecession risks due to high inflation and tightening financial conditions. The allowance for credit losses\nalso reflected a reduction of $ 587million as a result of the adoption of changes to the TDR accounting\nguidance on January 1, 2023. Refer to Note 1 for further information. The Firm's allowance for credit losses\nis estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse\nscenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the\ntable below, resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.5% in the fourth quarter of\n2024, and a 1.8% lower U.S. real GDP exiting the fourth quarter of 2024.\nThe Firm\u2019s central case assumptions reflected U.S.\nunemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:\n                                                                                                \n                                    Assumptions at September 30, 2023                           \n                                                                 4Q23       2Q24       4Q24     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. unemployment rate(a)                                       3.9  %     4.2  %     4.6  %  \n  YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                                  2.1  %     1.2  %     0.7  %  \n                                     Assumptions at December 31, 2022                           \n                                                                 2Q23       4Q23       2Q24     \n  U.S. unemployment rate(a)                                       3.8  %     4.3  %     5.0  %  \n  YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                                  1.5  %     0.4  %       \u2014  %  \n                                                                                                \n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S.\nunemployment rate.\n(b) The year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in\nthe forecast horizon of the central scenario is\ncalculated as the percentage change in U.S. real\nGDP levels from the prior year.

The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the\nliabilities of those entities. The assets and liabilities include third-party assets and liabilities of\nconsolidated VIEs and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.\n(d) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified on the\nConsolidated balance sheets as \u201cBeneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs\u201d. The holders of these\nbeneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. Included in\nbeneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $ 3.2billion and $ 2.1billion at\nSeptember 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\n(e) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance\nsheets.\n(f) Primarily includes purchased supply chain finance receivables and purchased auto loan securitizations in\nCIB.\nVIEs sponsored by third parties\n\nThe Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting\nas a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent,\ntrustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm\u2019s-length, and individual credit decisions are\nbased on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets.\nWhere the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact\nthe VIE\u2019s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm\ngenerally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated\nbalance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party\ntransaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are\nlimited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other\nprojects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or\nmanaging member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly\nthe Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a\nlimited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects.\nThe maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $ 32.5billion and\n$ 30.2billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, of which $ 12.7billion and $ 10.6billion was\nunfunded at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to\nreduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies\nfor tax credits. Refer to Note 25 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for further information on affordable\nhousing tax credits and Note 24 of this Form 10-Q for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related\ncommitments.\n                                                    168                                                     \nCustomer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts,\nincluding remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the\nFirm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those\ntransactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders\nfor any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on\nany of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm\ndoes not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the\nmunicipal bond vehicle. The Firm\u2019s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at\nSeptember 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $ 5.5billion and $ 5.8billion, respectively. The fair value of\nassets held by such VIEs at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $ 7.2billion and $ 8.2billion,\nrespectively. Loan securitizations The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including\nresidential mortgages, credit card receivables, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans.\n\nSecuritization activity\nThe following table provides information related to the Firm\u2019s securitization activities for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization\nentities that were not consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the\nsecuritization.\n

These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the\npurpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit\nenhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae\nguidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does\nnot consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary\nbeneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk\nassociated with the sold loans with the purchaser.

Refer to\nNote 15 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for a\nfurther discussion of the Firm\u2019s goodwill\nimpairment testing. Unanticipated declines in\nbusiness performance, increases in credit losses,\nincreases in capital requirements, as well as\ndeterioration in economic or market conditions,\nadverse regulatory or legislative changes or\nincreases in the estimated market cost of equity,\ncould cause the estimated fair values of the Firm\u2019s\nreporting units to decline in the future, which\ncould result in a material impairment charge to\nearnings in a future period related to some portion\nof the associated goodwill. As of September 30,\n2023, the Firm reviewed current economic\nconditions, estimated market cost of equity, as\nwell as actual business results and projections of\nbusiness performance. Based on such reviews, the\nFirm has concluded that goodwill was not impaired\nas of September 30, 2023, or December 31, 2022, nor\nwas goodwill written off due to impairment during\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023 or 2022.\n                                                    171                                                     \nMortgage servicing rights\n\nMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others.\nThe fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to\nservice the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively\namortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased\nfrom third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained.\nRefer to Notes 2 and 15 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for

adjustments associated with MSRs purchased in the prior quarter, primarily as a\nresult of loans that prepaid within 90 days of settlement, allowing the Firm to recover the purchase price.\n(b) Includes excess MSRs transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage-backed\nsecurities (\u201cSMBS\u201d). In each transaction, a portion of the SMBS was acquired by third parties at the\ntransaction date; the Firm acquired the remaining balance of those SMBS as trading securities.\n(c) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest\nrates, and the difference between actual and expected prepayments.\n(d) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates.\n(e) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and\ninsurance), which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future\ncash flows from the trust or the underlying loans. The Firm\u2019s credit risk associated with these servicer\nadvances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to\ninvestors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is\ninsufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if\nthey were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.\n                                                    172

In order to modify exposure to\ninterest rate and currency exchange rate movements,\nJPMorgan Chase utilizes derivative instruments,\nprimarily interest rate and cross-currency interest\nrate swaps, in conjunction with some of its debt\nissuances. The use of these instruments modifies\nthe Firm\u2019s interest expense on the associated debt.\nThe modified weighted-average interest rates for\ntotal long-term debt, including the effects of\nrelated derivative instruments, were 5.15% and\n4.89% as of September 30, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, respectively. JPMorgan Chase & Co. has\nguaranteed certain long-term debt of its\nsubsidiaries, including structured notes. These\nguarantees rank pari passu with the Firm\u2019s other\nunsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The\namount of such guaranteed long-term debt and\nstructured notes was $ 36.9billion and $\n28.2billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, respectively.

The contractual amount of these financial instruments\nrepresents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the\ncommitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or\nclient subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and\nguarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a\ndefault occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm\u2019s\nview, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and\nthe Firm\u2019s related accounting policies. To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain\nconsumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is\nmaintained. Refer to Note 13 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-\nrelated commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-\nbalance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at September 30, 2023\nand December 31, 2022. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain scored\nbusiness banking lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The\nFirm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products\nwill be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business\nbanking lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without\nnotice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60days or more past\ndue. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying\nproperty, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.\n                                                    184                                                     \n

If a dispute is resolved in the\ncardholder\u2019s favor, the Firm will (through the cardholder\u2019s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the\ncardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If the Firm is unable to collect the amount\nfrom the merchant, the Firm will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. The\nFirm mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining\nother collateral. In addition, the Firm recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or\nperformance risk related to charge-backs.\n                                                    186                                                     \nLoan sales and securitization-related\nindemnifications In connection with the Firm\u2019s\nmortgage loan sale and securitization activities\nwith GSEs the Firm has made representations and\nwarranties that the loans sold meet certain\nrequirements, and that may require the Firm to\nrepurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan\npurchaser if such representations and warranties\nare breached by the Firm. The liability related to\nrepurchase demands associated with private label\nsecuritizations is separately evaluated by the Firm\nin establishing its litigation reserves. Refer to\nNote 26 of this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information\nregarding litigation. Sponsored member repo program\nThe Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear\neligible overnight and term resale and repurchase\nagreements through the Government Securities\nDivision of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation\n(\u201cFICC\u201d) on behalf of clients that become sponsored\nmembers under the FICC\u2019s rules. The Firm also\nguarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment\nand performance of its sponsored member clients\u2019\nrespective obligations under the FICC\u2019s rules. The\nFirm minimizes its liability under these guarantees\nby obtaining a security interest in the cash or\nhigh-quality securities collateral that the clients\nplace with the clearing house therefore the Firm\nexpects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm\u2019s\nmaximum possible exposure, without taking into\nconsideration the associated collateral, is\nincluded in the Exchange & clearing house\nguarantees and commitments line on page 185.

The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class\naction lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement\nmatters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory\norganizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation,\nand involve each of the Firm\u2019s lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims\n(including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection\nclaims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range\nof reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $ 0to\napproximately $ 1.3billion at September 30, 2023. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible\nlosses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes\nthat an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe\nthat such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm\u2019s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably\npossible losses involves significant judgment, given: \u2022 the number, variety and varying stages of the\nproceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages, \u2022 the existence in many such\nproceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be\ndetermined, \u2022 the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding\nclass certification and the scope of many of the claims, and \u2022 the uncertainty of the various potential\noutcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the\ncourt or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory\nauthorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular\nproceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had\ndeemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm\u2019s estimate of the aggregate range\nof reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly. Set\nforth below are descriptions of the Firm\u2019s material legal proceedings. 1MDB Litigation . J.P. Morgan\n(Suisse) SA was named as a defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by 1Malaysia\nDevelopment Berhad (\u201c1MDB\u201d), a Malaysian state-owned and controlled investment fund. The claim alleges\n\u201cdishonest assistance\u201d against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in relation to payments of $ 300million and $\n500million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan\nSuisse (SA) held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited , a joint venture company between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings\n(Cayman) Limited. In September 2022, the Firm filed an application challenging the validity of service and\nthe Malaysian Court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear the claim. In April 2023, 1MDB requested Court permission to\ndiscontinue its claim and re-file a new claim in the future. In August 2023, the Court denied those requests\nand reinstated the claim. 1MDB and the Firm each filed separate appeals of that decision in September 2023.\nIn its appeal, the Firm seeks to prevent any claim from continuing. The Firm\u2019s challenge to service and\njurisdiction is scheduled for hearing in December 2023. Amrapali . India\u2019s Enforcement Directorate (\u201cED\u201d) is\ninvestigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by\ntwooffshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects developed by\nthe Amrapali Group (\u201cAmrapali\u201d). In 2017, numerous creditors filed civil claims against Amrapali, including\npetitions brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units.\nThe home buyers\u2019 petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India and are ongoing. In August 2021,\nthe ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $ 31.5million. The Firm is\nappealing the order and the fine. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making\npreliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the\noffshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain currency control and money laundering\nprovisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry under India\u2019s Prevention of Money Laundering\nAct (\u201cPMLA\u201d) and Foreign Exchange Management Act (\u201cFEMA\u201d). In May 2020, the ED attached approximately $\n25million from J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with the criminal PMLA investigation. The\nFirm is responding to and cooperating with the PMLA investigation. Foreign Exchange Investigations and\nLitigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its\nforeign exchange (\u201cFX\u201d) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. Among those\nresolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The\n                                                    188                                                     \nDepartment of Labor (\"DOL\") granted the Firm exemptions that permit the Firm and its affiliates to continue\nto rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security\nAct (\u201cERISA\u201d) through the ten-yeardisqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only remaining\nFX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter which is currently pending\nbefore the South Africa Competition Tribunal. With respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval to the Firm\u2019s\nsettlement of a consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged\nviolations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and\nalso sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures and options on futures. Although\ncertain members of the settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, an\nagreement to resolve their claims was reached in December 2022. In a separate putative class action filed\nagainst the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain parties who purchased foreign\ncurrencies at allegedly inflated rates, the District Court denied certification of a class and granted\nsummary judgment against the named plaintiffs in March 2023. An appeal by those plaintiffs of the District\nCourt's decision is pending. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative class actions based on\nsimilar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the\nNetherlands, Brazil and Australia. An agreement to resolve one of the UK actions was reached in December\n2022. In July 2023, the U.K. Court of Appeal overturned the Competition Appeal Tribunal's earlier denial of\na request for class certification on an opt-out basis. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached\nin the putative class action, which remains subject to court approval. Interchange Litigation. Groups of\nmerchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and\nMastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees\nand enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases\nfor a cash payment, but that settlement was reversed on appeal and remanded to the United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of New York. The original class action was divided into twoseparate actions,\none seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018,\nthe parties to the monetary class action finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior\nsettlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an additional $\n900million to the approximately $ 5.3billion previously held in escrow from the original settlement. In\nDecember 2019, the amended settlement agreement was approved by the District Court. In March 2023, the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the District Court\u2019s approval of the\nsettlement, and that settlement is now final. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the\namended class settlement, $ 700million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow in\naccordance with the settlement agreement. The injunctive class action continues separately, and in September\n2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion\nin part. Of the merchants who opted out of the amended damages class settlement, certain merchants filed\nindividual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and\nother banks. While some of those actions remain pending, the defendants have reached settlements with the\nmerchants who opted out representing approximately 65% of the combined Mastercard-branded and Visa-branded\npayment card sales volume. Jeffrey Epstein Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was named as a defendant in\ntwolawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. knowingly facilitated Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s sex trafficking and other unlawful conduct\nby providing banking services to Epstein until 2013. One case, which was filed in November 2022, was a\nputative class action filed by an alleged sex-trafficking victim of Epstein, and the other case, which was\nfiled in December 2022, was brought on behalf of the government of the United States Virgin Islands. In\nMarch 2023, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. filed third-party complaints impleading the Firm\u2019s former employee,\nJames Edward Staley, into the twolawsuits, asserting claims for indemnification, contribution, breach of\nfiduciary duty and violation of the faithless servant doctrine. In June 2023, the Court granted the putative\nclass\u2019s motion for class certification and granted a preliminary approval of a settlement between the class\nand JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., pursuant to which JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid $ 290million to a fund for\nEpstein survivors. The final settlement approval hearing is scheduled for November 9, 2023, and in\nconnection with the hearing, certain state Attorneys General have sought to object to the victims\u2019 releases.\nIn September 2023, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. reached a settlement totaling $ 75million with the government\nof the United States Virgin Islands and separately reached an agreement with Staley to resolve JPMorgan\nChase Bank N.A.\u2019s affirmative claims against him, the terms of which are confidential. LIBOR and Other\nBenchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various\ngovernmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association\u2019s\n(\u201cBBA\u201d) London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) for various currencies and the European Banking Federation\u2019s\nEuro Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cEURIBOR\u201d). The Swiss Competition Commission\u2019s investigation relating to\nEURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain subject, continues. In December 2016, the European\n                                                    189                                                     \nCommission issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust\nrules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision with the European General Court,\nand that appeal is pending. In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in\nvarious individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In\nactions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has\nobtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other actions, and others are in various stages\nof litigation. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York has granted class\ncertification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants,\nincluding the Firm. A consolidated putative class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was\nadministered by ICE Benchmark Administration has been dismissed. In addition, a lawsuit filed by a group of\nindividual plaintiffs asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged\nin an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based\nconsumer loans and credit cards was dismissed in October 2023. The Firm\u2019s settlements of putative class\nactions related to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the\nAustralian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate received final court approval in November 2022, and the settlement\nrelated to Swiss franc LIBOR received final court approval in September 2023. SEC Inquiries . The Firm is\nresponding to requests from the SEC regarding aspects of certain advisory programs within J.P. Morgan\nSecurities LLC, including aggregation of accounts for billing, discounting advisory fees, and selecting\nportfolio managers. Separately, the Firm is responding to requests from the SEC in connection with the\ntiming of the Firm\u2019s liquidation of shares distributed in-kind to certain investment vehicles that invest in\nthird-party managed private funds. The Firm is cooperating with the SEC in regard to both inquires.\nSecurities Lending Antitrust Litigation . JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan\nPrime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class\naction filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint\nasserts violations of federal antitrust law and New York State common law in connection with an alleged\nconspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange trading for securities lending transactions. The\nsettlement of this action by the parties has been preliminarily approved, and is subject to final court\napproval. Shareholder Litigation . Several shareholder putative class actions, as well as shareholder\nderivative actions purporting to act on behalf of the Firm, have been filed against the Firm, its Board of\nDirectors and certain of its current and former officers. Certain of these shareholder suits relate to\nhistorical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and\nrelated conduct which were the subject of the Firm\u2019s resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September\n2020, and fiduciary activities that were separately the subject of a resolution between JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. and the OCC in November 2020. One of these shareholder derivative suits was filed in the Supreme Court\nof the State of New York in May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims\nrelating to the historical trading practices and related conduct and fiduciary activities which were the\nsubject of the resolutions described above. In December 2022, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion to\ndismiss this action in full, and in July 2023, the plaintiff filed an appeal, which remains pending. A\nsecond shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District\nof New York in December 2022 relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct, which asserts\nbreach of fiduciary duty and contribution claims and alleges that the shareholder is excused from making a\ndemand to commence litigation because such a demand would have been futile. Defendants have moved to dismiss\nthe complaint. In addition, a consolidated putative class action is pending in the United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of New York on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares of JPMorgan Chase\ncommon stock during the putative class period, alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially\nfalse or misleading because they did not disclose certain information relating to the historical trading\npractices and conduct. Defendants have moved to dismiss the amended complaint in this action. A separate\nshareholder derivative suit was filed in March 2022 in the United States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of New York asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of federal securities laws based on\nthe alleged failure of the Board of Directors to exercise adequate oversight over the Firm\u2019s compliance with\nrecords preservation requirements which were the subject of resolutions between certain of the Firm\u2019s\nsubsidiaries and the SEC and the CFTC. Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the amended complaint is pending.\nTwoshareholder derivative suits were filed in May and June 2023, respectively, in the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of New York asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment based\non the alleged failure of the Board of Directors and James Dimon to exercise adequate oversight with respect\nto the Firm\u2019s provision of banking services to Jeffrey Epstein. These actions allege that the shareholders\nare excused from making a demand to commence litigation because such a demand would have been futile. These\nactions were consolidated, and in August 2023, the Court dismissed the consolidated action.\n                                                    190                                                     \nTrading Venues Investigations . The Firm has been responding to government inquiries regarding its processes\nto inventory trading venues and confirm the completeness of certain data fed to trade surveillance\nplatforms. The Firm is cooperating with these inquiries, has undertaken corrective actions and is committed\nto taking appropriate steps to remedy the deficiencies identified. Certain U.S. regulators have proposed\nresolving their inquiries through, among other things, the payment of a civil money penalty. The Firm is\ncurrently engaged in resolution discussions with those U.S. regulators and is considering potential\nimplications of those resolutions. There is no assurance that such discussions will result in a resolution.\n* * * In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are\nnamed as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm\nbelieves it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal\nproceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from\ntime to time in the future. The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently\noutstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm\naccrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and\nthe amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings\neach quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upward or downward,\nas appropriate, based on management\u2019s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm\u2019s legal\nexpense was $ 665million and $ 47million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. There is no assurance that the Firm\u2019s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the\nfuture. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly\nwhere the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal\ntheories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with\nconfidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate\nresolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase\nbelieves, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the\nmaterial legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and\nits estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against\nit should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm\u2019s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes,\nhowever, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the\nultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or\nthat a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular\nmatter may be material to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among\nother factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s income for that\nperiod.\n                                                    191                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Note 27 \u2013 Business segments                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are fourmajor reportable business segments - Consumer & Community\nBanking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there\nis a Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or\nthe type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently\nevaluated by the Firm\u2019s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to\nSegment results below, and Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s business segments. Segment results The following table provides a summary of the Firm\u2019s segment\nresults as of or for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, on a managed basis. The\nFirm\u2019s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain\nreclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments)\non an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is\npresented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. Refer to Note\n32 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm\u2019s managed basis. Capital\nallocation The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is referred to as equity. At least\nannually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a\nresult, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. In the second quarter of 2023, the Firm updated its\nline of business capital allocations to reflect the impact of the First Republic acquisition. Refer to Note\n28 of this Form 10-Q for additional information on the First Republic acquisition and Note 32 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on capital

The Firm believes that the\nFirst Republic acquisition is complementary to the\nFirm's existing franchises. The acquisition\nresulted in an estimated bargain purchase gain,\nwhich represents the excess of the estimated fair\nvalue of the net assets acquired above the purchase\nprice. The Firm has determined that this\nacquisition constitutes a business combination\nunder U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the initial\nrecognition of the assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed were generally measured at their estimated\nfair values as of May 1, 2023. The determination of\nthose fair values required management to make\ncertain market-based assumptions about expected\nfuture cash flows, discount rates and other\nvaluation inputs at the time of the acquisition.\nThe Firm believes that the fair value estimates of\nthe assets acquired and liabilities assumed provide\na reasonable basis for determining the estimated\nbargain purchase gain. The Firm and the FDIC have\nnot yet completed the settlement process under\nwhich the purchase price, and the identification of\nthe assets acquired and liabilities assumed, will\nbe finalized. The finalization of this settlement\nprocess may impact the amount of the estimated\nbargain purchase gain. The purchase and assumption\nagreement entered into with the FDIC allows for\nfinal settlement to occur up to a year after the\nacquisition date. In addition, the purchase price\nand the estimated bargain purchase gain could\nchange pending management's finalization of its\nacquisition date fair value estimates for certain\nof the assets acquired and liabilities assumed\n(such as loans and commitments, intangible assets\nand leases), which may take place up to one year\nfrom the acquisition date, as permitted by U.S.\nGAAP. The First Republic acquisition resulted in a\npreliminary estimated bargain purchase gain of $\n2.7billion. The Firm continues to progress in the\nsettlement process with the FDIC and refine its\nacquisition-date fair value estimates. As a result,\nduring the three months ended September 30, 2023 ,\nadjustments were made to the fair value of the net\nassets acquired, increasing the estimated bargain\npurchase gain by $ 100million to $ 2.8billion for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023 . In\nconnection with the First Republic acquisition, the\nFirm and the FDIC entered into twoshared-loss\nagreements with respect to certain loans and\nlending-related commitments (the \"shared-loss\nassets\"): the Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement\n(\"CSLA\") and the Single-Family Shared-Loss\nAgreement (\u201cSFSLA\u201d). The CSLA covers 80% of credit\nlosses, on a pari passu basis, over 5years with a\nsubsequent 3-yearrecovery period for certain\nacquired commercial loans and other real estate\nexposure. The SFSLA covers 80% of credit losses, on\na pari passu basis,\n\nfor 7years for certain acquired loans secured by\nmortgages on real property or shares in cooperative\nproperty constituting a primary residence. The\nindemnification assets, which represent the fair\nvalue of the CSLA and SFSLA on the acquisition\ndate, are reflected in the total assets acquired.\nAs part of the consideration paid, JPMorgan Chase\nissued a five-year, $ 50billion secured note to the\nFDIC (the \"Purchase Money Note\"). The Purchase\nMoney Note bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.4%\nand is secured by certain of the acquired loans.\nThe Purchase Money Note is prepayable upon notice\nto the holder.

Refer to Note 14 and Note 17 for additional information.\nThe issuance of the $ 50billion Purchase Money Note, the effective settlement of the Firm's $ 5billion\ndeposit and $ 447million of securities financing with First Republic Bank, and the $ 3.6billion payable to\nthe FDIC as part of the purchase price consideration are considered non-cash transactions.\n\nThe following describes the accounting policies and fair value methodologies generally used by the Firm for\nthe following assets acquired and liabilities assumed: core deposit and customer relationship intangibles,\nshared-loss agreements and the related indemnification assets, Purchase Money Note, and FHLB advances.\n\nRefer to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm\u2019s accounting policies and valuation\nmethodologies for securities, loans, deposits, and lending-related commitments.\n\nCore deposit and customer relationship intangibles Core deposit and certain wealth management customer\nrelationship intangibles were acquired as part of the First Republic acquisition. The core deposit\nintangible of $ 1.3billion was valued by discounting estimated after-tax cost savings over the remaining\nuseful life of the deposits using the favorable source of funds method. The after-tax cost savings were\nestimated based on the difference between the cost of maintaining the core deposit base relative to the cost\nof next best alternative funding sources available to market participants. The customer relationship\nintangibles of $ 180million were valued by discounting estimated after-tax earnings over their remaining\nuseful lives using the multi-period excess earnings method. Both intangible asset valuations utilized\nassumptions that the Firm believes a market participant would use to estimate fair values, such as growth\nand attrition rates, projected fee income as well as related costs to service the relationships, and\ndiscount rates. The core deposit and customer relationship intangibles will be amortized over a projected\nperiod of future cash flows of approximately 7years. As of September 30, 2023, the carrying values of the\ncore deposit and customer relationship intangibles were $ 1.2billion and $ 169million, respectively,\nreflecting accumulated amortization of approximately $ 76million and $ 11million, respectively.\nIndemnification assets - Shared-loss agreements The indemnification assets represent forecasted recoveries\nfrom the FDIC associated with the shared-loss assets over the respective shared-loss recovery periods. The\nindemnification assets were recorded at fair value in other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets on the\n                                                    195                                                     \nacquisition date. The fair values of the indemnification assets were estimated based on the timing of the\nforecasted losses underlying the related allowance for credit losses. The subsequent quarterly remeasurement\nof the indemnification assets is based on changes in the amount and timing of forecasted losses in the\nallowance for credit losses associated with the shared-loss assets and is recorded in other income. Under\ncertain circumstances, the Firm may be required to make a payment to the FDIC upon termination of the\nshared-loss agreements based on the level of actual losses and recoveries on the shared-loss assets. The\nestimated potential future payment is reflected as contingent consideration as part of the purchase price\nconsideration. Purchase Money Note and FHLB advances The Purchase Money Note is recorded in long-term debt\non the Consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the Purchase Money Note was estimated based on a\ndiscounted cash flow methodology and incorporated estimated market discount rates. The FHLB advances assumed\nin the acquisition are recorded in short-term borrowings and in long-term debt. The fair values of the FHLB\nadvances were based on a discounted cash flow methodology and considered the observed FHLB advance issuance\nrates.\n\nLoans\n\nThe following table presents the unpaid principal balance (\"UPB\") and estimated fair values of the loans\nacquired as of May 1, 2023, and reflects adjustments made during the three months ended September 30, 2023\nto the acquisition-date fair value of the loans acquired.\n                                                              \n                                May 1, 2023                   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (in millions)                         UPB       Fair value  \n  Residential real estate    $      106,240    $      92,053  \n  Auto and other                      3,093            2,032  \n  Total consumer                    109,333           94,085  \n  Secured by real estate             37,117           33,602  \n  Commercial & industrial             4,332            3,932  \n  Other                              22,599           20,863  \n  Total wholesale                    64,048           58,397  \n  Total loans                $      173,381    $     152,482  \n                                                              \nUnaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information\n\nIncluded in the Firm's Consolidated statements of income are noninterest revenue, net interest income and\nnet income contributed by First Republic of $ 761million, $ 1.5billion and $ 1.1billion, respectively, for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023 and $ 3.9billion, $ 2.4billion and $ 3.5billion, respectively, for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe following table presents certain unaudited pro forma financial information for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2023 and 2022 as if the First Republic acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2022,\nincluding recognition of the estimated bargain purchase gain of $ 2.8billion and the provision for credit\nlosses of $ 1.2billion.

The\nminimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on\nthe interest rate charged during the introductory\nperiod. This introductory rate is usually\nsignificantly below the fully indexed rate. The\nfully indexed rate is calculated using an index\nrate plus a margin. Once the introductory period\nends, the contractual interest rate charged on the\nloan increases to the fully indexed rate and\nadjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index.\nThe minimum payment is typically insufficient to\ncover interest\n                                                    202                                                     \naccrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest\nis deferred and added to the principal balance of\nthe loan.

Collateral-\ndependent loans are typically maintained on\nnonaccrual status.\n\nNonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include\nnonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and\ncertain assets acquired in loan satisfactions,\npredominantly real estate owned and other\ncommercial and personal property.\n\nNSFR: Net Stable Funding Ratio\n\nOCC : Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\n\nOCI : Other comprehensive income/(loss)\n\nOPEB : Other postretirement employee benefit\n\nOTC : \u201cOver-the-counter derivatives\u201d: Derivative\ncontracts that are negotiated, executed and settled\nbilaterally between two derivative counterparties,\nwhere one or both counterparties is a derivatives\ndealer.\n\nOTC cleared : \u201cOver-the-counter cleared\nderivatives\u201d: Derivative contracts that are\nnegotiated and executed bilaterally, but\nsubsequently settled via a central clearing house,\nsuch that each derivative counterparty is only\nexposed to the default of that clearing house.\n\nOverhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage\nof total net revenue.\n\nParent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nParticipating securities: represents unvested\nshare-based compensation awards containing\nnonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend\nequivalents (collectively, \u201cdividends\u201d), which are\nincluded in the earnings per share calculation\nusing the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase grants\nrestricted stock and RSUs to certain employees\nunder its share-based compensation programs, which\nentitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable\ndividends during the vesting period on a basis\nequivalent to the dividends paid to holders of\ncommon stock.

The Firm believes\nthat this financial measure is useful in assessing\nthe ability of a lending institution to generate\nincome in excess of its provision for credit\nlosses.\n\nPrincipal transactions revenue : Principal\ntransactions revenue is driven by many factors,\nincluding the bid-offer spread, which is the\ndifference between the price at which the Firm is\nwilling to buy a financial or other instrument and\nthe price at which the Firm is willing to sell that\ninstrument. It also consists of realized (as a\nresult of closing out or termination of\ntransactions, or interim cash payments) and\nunrealized (as a result of changes in valuation)\ngains and losses on financial and other instruments\n(including those accounted for under the fair value\noption) primarily used in client-driven market-\nmaking activities and on private equity\ninvestments. In connection with its client-driven\nmarket-making activities, the Firm transacts in\ndebt and equity instruments, derivatives and\ncommodities (including physical commodities\ninventories and financial instruments that\nreference commodities).

Key differences in the\ncalculation of credit risk RWA between the\nStandardized and Advanced approaches are that for\nBasel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on\nrisk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the\nuse of internal credit models and parameters,\nwhereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA\nis generally based on supervisory risk-weightings\nwhich vary primarily by counterparty type and asset\nclass.

There can be no assurance that the First Republic acquisition will have the anticipated  \u2502\n\u2502  positive results, including with respect to:\u2022the total cost of integration\u2022the time required to         \u2502\n\u2502  complete the integration\u2022the amount of longer-term cost savings\u2022the overall performance of the assets   \u2502\n\u2502  and liabilities acquired in the First Republic acquisition, or\u2022an improved price for JPMorgan Chase\u2019s   \u2502\n\u2502  common stock.Integration of an acquired business can be complex and costly, and typically will involve  \u2502\n\u2502  the combination of relevant accounting and data processing systems and management controls, as well as  \u2502\n\u2502  managing relevant relationships with employees, clients, suppliers and other business partners.         \u2502\n\u2502  Integration efforts could divert management attention and resources, which could adversely affect       \u2502\n\u2502  JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations or results.
