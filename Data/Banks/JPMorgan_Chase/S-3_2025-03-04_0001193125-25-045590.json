This covenant would not prevent us\nfrom completing a merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all of our assets. In addition, this\ncovenant would not prevent the merger\nor consolidation of the Bank into another domestic bank if JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries would own at\nleast 80% of the voting stock of the successor entity after the merger or consolidation.\n\n4\n\nIf we satisfy certain conditions in the senior indenture, we may discharge that indenture at any\ntime by depositing with the trustee sufficient funds or government obligations to pay the senior debt\nsecurities when due.\n\nEvents of Default.

We will determine the dividend, voting, conversion and other rights of the\nseries being offered, and the\nterms and conditions relating to the offering and sale of the series, at the time of the offer and sale. We\nmay also issue preferred stock that will be represented by depositary shares.\n\nCommon Stock\n\nWe may use this prospectus\nand an applicable prospectus supplement to offer our common stock, par value $1 per share. Subject to the\nrights of holders of our preferred stock, holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends when\ndeclared by our board of directors\n(which may also refer to a board committee).

In addition, we are obligated to contribute to\nthe IHC substantially all the\nnet proceeds that we receive from the issuance of securities (including any securities offered by use of\nthis prospectus), and the ability of the Bank and the IHC to make payments to us is limited. As a result of\nthese arrangements, our ability to\nmake various payments is dependent on our receiving dividends from the Bank and dividends and extensions of\ncredit from the IHC. These limitations could affect our ability to pay interest on our debt securities, pay\ndividends on our preferred stock\nand common stock, redeem or repurchase outstanding securities, and fulfill our other payment obligations.\n\nConflicts of Interest\n\nWe own directly or indirectly all the outstanding equity securities of J.P.

The subordinated debt\nsecurities will be unsecured and will be\nsubordinated and junior to all Senior Indebtedness as defined below under \u0093\u0097 Subordinated Debt Securities \u0097\nSubordination.\u0094\n\nWe are a holding company that holds the stock of the Bank and the IHC. We conduct substantially all of our\noperations through subsidiaries,\nincluding the Bank and the IHC. As a result, claims of the holders of our securities will generally have a\njunior position to claims of creditors of our subsidiaries. Claims of our subsidiaries\u0092 creditors other than\nJPMorganChase include\nsubstantial amounts of deposit liabilities, long-term debt and other liabilities. In addition, we are\nobligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds that we receive from the issuance of\nsecurities (including any securities\noffered by use of this prospectus), and the ability of the Bank and the IHC to make payments to us is\nlimited. As a result of these arrangements, our ability to make various payments is dependent on our\nreceiving dividends from the Bank and\ndividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. These limitations could affect our ability to pay interest\non our debt securities, pay dividends on our preferred stock and common stock, redeem or repurchase\noutstanding securities, and fulfill our\nother payment obligations.\n\nWe may issue the debt securities in one or more separate series of senior debt securities and/or\nsubordinated\ndebt securities. We will specify in the prospectus supplement relating to the particular series of debt\nsecurities being offered the particular amounts, prices and terms of those debt securities. These terms may\ninclude:\n                                                  \n      the title and type of the debt securities;  \n                                                  \n                                                                                                            \n      any limit on the aggregate principal amount or aggregate initial offering price of the debt           \n      securities;                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                  \n      the purchase price of the debt securities;  \n                                                  \n                                                                                                            \n      the dates on which the principal of the debt securities will be payable and the amount payable upon   \n      acceleration;                                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n      the interest rates of the debt securities, including the interest rates, if any, applicable to        \n      overdue payments,                                                                                     \n      or the method for determining those rates;                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n                                                           \n      the interest payment dates for the debt securities;  \n                                                           \n                                                                     \n      the places where payments may be made on the debt securities;  \n                                                                     \n                                                                                          \n      any mandatory or optional redemption provisions applicable to the debt securities;  \n                                                                                          \n                                                                                 \n      any sinking fund or similar provisions applicable to the debt securities;  \n                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \n      the authorized denominations of the debt securities, if other than $1,000 and integral multiples of   \n      $1,000;                                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n11\n                                                                                                            \n      if denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, the currency or currencies, including           \n      composite currencies,                                                                                 \n      in which payments on the debt securities will be payable (which currencies may be different for       \n      principal, premium and interest payments);                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                \n      any conversion or exchange provisions applicable to the debt securities;  \n                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n      any addition to, deletion from or change in the events of default applicable to the debt securities;  \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                        \n      any addition to, deletion from or change in the covenants applicable to the debt securities; and  \n                                                                                                        \n                                                        \n      any other specific terms of the debt securities.  \n                                                        \nWe may issue some of the debt securities as original issue discount debt securities. Original issue discount\ndebt securities will bear no\ninterest or will bear interest at a below-market rate and will be sold at a discount below their stated\nprincipal amount. The prospectus supplement will contain any special tax, accounting or other information\nrelating to original issue discount\ndebt securities. If we offer other kinds of debt securities, including debt securities linked to an index or\npayable in currencies other than U.S. dollars, the prospectus supplement relating to those debt securities\nwill also contain any special\ntax, accounting or other information relating to those debt securities.\n\nWe will issue the debt securities only in registered form without\ncoupons. The indentures permit us to issue debt securities of a series in certificated form or in permanent\nglobal form. You will not be required to pay a service charge for any transfer or exchange of debt\nsecurities, but we may require payment of\nany taxes or other governmental charges.\n\nWe will pay principal of, and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the debt securities at\nthe corporate trust office in New York City of our paying agent, The Bank of New York Mellon, or any\nsuccessor paying agent that we may designate. You may also make transfers or exchanges of debt securities at\nthat location. We also have the right\nto pay interest on any debt securities by check mailed to the registered holders of the debt securities at\ntheir registered addresses. In connection with any payment on a debt security, we may require the holder to\ncertify information to us. In the\nabsence of that certification, we may rely on any legal presumption to enable us to determine our\nresponsibilities, if any, to deduct or withhold taxes, assessments or governmental charges from the payment.\n\nThe indentures do not limit our ability to enter into a highly leveraged transaction or provide you with any\nspecial protection in the event\nof such a transaction. In addition, neither of the indentures provides special protection in the event of a\nsudden or dramatic decline in our credit quality resulting from a takeover, recapitalization or similar\nrestructuring of JPMorganChase.\n\nWe may issue debt securities upon the exercise of warrants or upon exchange or conversion of exchangeable or\nconvertible debt securities. The\nprospectus supplement will describe the specific terms of any of those warrants or exchangeable or\nconvertible securities. It will also describe the specific terms of the debt securities or other securities\nissuable upon the exercise, exchange or\nconversion of those securities. See \u0093Description of Warrants\u0094 below.\n\nEach of the indentures contains a provision that, if made\napplicable to any series of senior or subordinated debt securities, respectively, permits us to elect:\n                                                                                                            \n      defeasance, which would discharge us from all of our obligations (subject to limited exceptions)      \n      with respect to                                                                                       \n      any debt securities of that series then outstanding, and/or                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n      covenant defeasance, which would release us from our obligations under specified covenants,           \n      including, with                                                                                       \n      respect to any series of senior securities, the covenant described under \u0093Senior Debt                  \n      Securities\u0097Limitation on Disposition of Stock of the Bank\u0094.                                             \n                                                                                                            \n12\n\nTo make either of the above elections, we must deposit in trust with the respective trustee money\nand/or U.S. government obligations (as defined below) which, through the payment of principal and interest\nin accordance with their terms, will provide sufficient money, without reinvestment, to repay in full those\nsenior or subordinated debt\nsecurities, as the case may be. As used in the indentures, \u0093U.S. government obligations\u0094 are: (1) direct\nobligations of the United States or of an agency or instrumentality of the United States, in either case\nthat are, or are guaranteed\nas, full faith and credit obligations of the United States and that are not redeemable by the issuer; and\n(2) certain depositary receipts with respect to an obligation referred to in clause (1).\n\nAs a condition to defeasance or covenant defeasance, we must deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel\nthat the holders of the senior or\nsubordinated debt securities, as the case may be, will not recognize income, gain, or loss for federal\nincome tax purposes as a result of the defeasance or covenant defeasance and will be subject to federal\nincome tax on the same amounts, in the\nsame manner and at the same times as would have been the case if defeasance or covenant defeasance had not\noccurred. That opinion, in the case of defeasance but not covenant defeasance, must refer to and be based\nupon a ruling received by us from,\nor published by, the Internal Revenue Service or be based upon a change in applicable federal income tax\nlaw.\n\nIf we exercise our covenant\ndefeasance option with respect to a particular series of debt securities, then even if there were a default\nunder the defeased covenant, payment of those debt securities could not be accelerated. We may exercise our\ndefeasance option with respect to\na particular series of debt securities even if we previously had exercised our covenant defeasance option.\nIf we exercise our defeasance option, payment of those debt securities may not be accelerated because of any\nevent of default. If we exercise\nour covenant defeasance option and an acceleration were to occur, the realizable value at the acceleration\ndate of the money and U.S. government obligations in the defeasance trust could be less than the principal\nand interest then due on those debt\nsecurities. This is because the required deposit of money and/or U.S. government obligations in the\ndefeasance trust is based upon scheduled cash flows rather than market value, which will vary depending upon\ninterest rates and other factors.\n\nWe and the trustee under each indenture may modify that indenture with the consent of the holders of not\nless than a majority in principal\namount of outstanding debt securities of any series issued under that indenture affected by the\nmodification. However, without the consent of each affected holder, no such modification may:\n                                                        \n      change the stated maturity of any debt security;  \n                                                        \n                                                                                  \n      reduce the principal amount of, or premium, if any, on, any debt security;

For a definition of \u0093Senior Indebtedness,\u0094 see \u0093\u0097 Subordinated Debt Securities \u0097\nSubordination\u0094 below.\n\nLimitation on Disposition of Stock of the Bank. Unless otherwise specified in the prospectus supplement\nrelating to a particular series\nof debt securities, the senior indenture contains a covenant by us that, so long as any of the senior debt\nsecurities are outstanding, neither we nor any Intermediate Subsidiary (as defined below) will sell, assign,\ngrant a security interest in or\notherwise dispose of any shares of voting stock of the Bank, or any securities convertible into, or options,\nwarrants or rights to purchase shares of voting stock of the Bank, except to JPMorganChase or an\nIntermediate Subsidiary. In addition, the\ncovenant provides that neither we nor any\n\n14\n\nIntermediate Subsidiary will permit the Bank to issue any shares of its voting stock, or securities\nconvertible into, or options, warrants or rights to purchase shares of its voting stock, nor\nwill we permit any Intermediate Subsidiary that owns any shares of voting stock of the Bank, or securities\nconvertible into, or options, warrants or rights to purchase shares of the Bank\u0092s voting stock, to cease to\nbe an Intermediate\nSubsidiary.\n\nThe above covenant is subject to our rights in connection with a consolidation or merger of JPMorganChase\nwith another entity\nor a conveyance, transfer or lease of all or substantially all of our assets to another entity. The covenant\nalso will not apply if both:\n\n(1) the disposition in question is made for fair market value, as determined by the board of directors of\nJPMorganChase or the\nIntermediate Subsidiary; and\n\n(2) after giving effect to the disposition, we and any one or more of our Intermediate\nSubsidiaries will collectively own at least 80% of the issued and outstanding voting stock of the Bank or\nany successor to the Bank, free and clear of any security interest.\n\nThe above covenant also does not restrict the Bank from being consolidated with or merged into another\ndomestic banking institution if, after\nthe merger or consolidation, (A) JPMorganChase, or its successor, and any one or more Intermediate\nSubsidiaries own at least 80% of the voting stock of the resulting bank and (B) treating for purposes of the\nsenior indenture the resulting bank as\nthe Bank, no covenant breach, event of default or event which, after notice or lapse of time or both, would\nbecome a covenant breach or event of default, shall have happened and be continuing.\n\nThe senior indenture defines an \u0093Intermediate Subsidiary\u0094 as a subsidiary (1) that is organized under the\nlaws of any domestic\njurisdiction and (2) of which all the shares of capital stock, and all securities convertible into, and\noptions, warrants and rights to purchase shares of capital stock, are owned directly by JPMorganChase, free\nand clear of any security interest.\nAs used above, \u0093voting stock\u0094 means a class of stock having general voting power under ordinary\ncircumstances to elect at least a majority of the board of directors, managers or trustees irrespective of\nthe happening of a contingency.\n\nDefaults andWaivers. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, under the senior\nindenture, any one of\nthe following events will be an event of default with respect to the senior debt securities of any series:\n\n(1) default in\nthe payment of principal of (or premium, if any, on) any senior debt securities of that series and\ncontinuance of that default for 30 days;\n\n(2) default in the payment of interest on any senior debt securities of that series and continuance of that\ndefault for 30\ndays;\n\n(3) specified events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of JPMorganChase; and\n\n(4) any other event of default specified with respect to senior debt securities of that series.\n\nSenior debt securities issued by us prior to December 31, 2016 (the \u0093Pre-2017 Senior Debt\u0094) contain events\nof default that are\ndifferent from those set forth above.

In addition, holders of the\nsenior debt securities will not have the benefit of the additional events of default described above that\nare applicable to the Pre-2017 Senior\nDebt.\n\nUnder the senior indenture, if any event of default with respect to the senior debt securities of any series\noccurs and is\ncontinuing, either the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding\nsenior debt securities of that series may declare the principal amount (or, if the senior debt securities of\nthat series are original issue\ndiscount senior debt securities, a specified portion of the principal amount) of all senior debt securities\nof that series to be due and payable immediately. No such declaration is required upon certain specified\nevents of bankruptcy, insolvency or\nreorganization. Subject to the conditions set forth in the senior indenture, the holders of a majority in\nprincipal amount of the outstanding senior debt securities of that series may annul the declaration and\nwaive past defaults, except uncured\npayment defaults and other specified defaults.\n\nWe will describe in the prospectus supplement any particular provisions relating to the\nacceleration of the maturity of a portion of the principal amount of original issue discount senior debt\nsecurities upon an event of default.\n\nSubordinated Debt Securities\n\nThe\nsubordinated debt securities will be direct, unsecured general obligations of JPMorganChase. The\nsubordinated debt securities will be subordinate and junior in right of payment to all Senior Indebtedness.\n\nUnless otherwise provided in the prospectus supplement relating to a particular series of subordinated debt\nsecurities, holders of the\nsubordinated debt securities may not accelerate the maturity of the subordinated debt securities, except in\nthe event of our bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency, and may not accelerate the subordinated debt\nsecurities if we fail to pay\nprincipal or interest or fail to perform any other agreement in the subordinated debt securities or the\nsubordinated indenture. See \u0093\u0097 Defaults and Waivers\u0094 below.\n\nSubordination. The subordinated debt securities will be subordinate and junior in right of payment to all\nSenior Indebtedness whether\noutstanding on the date the subordinated indenture became effective or created, assumed or incurred after\nthat date.\n\nThe subordinated\nindenture defines \u0093Senior Indebtedness\u0094 to mean the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on all\nof our indebtedness for money borrowed, including all indebtedness for money borrowed by another person that\nwe guarantee; similar\nobligations arising from off-balance sheet guarantees and direct credit substitutes; all obligations for\nclaims in respect of derivative products such as interest rate and foreign exchange contracts, commodity\ncontracts and similar arrangements; and\nany deferrals, renewals or extensions of any of the foregoing. However, Senior Indebtedness does not include\nindebtedness that is stated not to be senior to or to have the same rank as the subordinated debt securities\nor other securities having the\nsame rank as or that are subordinated to the subordinated debt securities. In particular, Senior\nIndebtedness does not include (A) the subordinated debt securities issued under the subordinated indenture,\n(B) the subordinated indebtedness issued\nunder the indenture, dated as of October 21, 2010, between us and U.S. Bank Trust National Association, as\ntrustee, and (C) other debt of JPMorganChase that is expressly stated to have the same rank as or not to\nrank senior to the subordinated debt\nsecurities or other securities having the same rank as or that are subordinated to the subordinated debt\nsecurities.\n\n16\n\nUnder the subordinated indenture, we may not make any payment on the subordinated debt securities\nin the event:\n                                                                                                            \n      we have failed to make full payment of all amounts of principal, and premium, if any, and interest,   \n      if any, due                                                                                           \n      on all Senior Indebtedness; or                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n      there shall exist any event of default on any Senior Indebtedness permitting the holders thereof to   \n      accelerate                                                                                            \n      the maturity thereof or any event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become such an   \n      event of default.                                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \nIn addition, upon our dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization (whether in bankruptcy,\ninsolvency or receivership proceedings or\notherwise) we must pay to the holders of Senior Indebtedness the full amounts of principal of, and premium,\nif any, and interest, if any, on the Senior Indebtedness before any payment or distribution is made on the\nsubordinated debt securities.\n\nNo series of our subordinated debt securities (other than our outstanding junior subordinated indebtedness)\nis subordinated to any other\nseries of subordinated debt securities or to any other subordinated indebtedness of JPMorganChase referred\nto above. However, due to the subordination provisions of the various series of subordinated indebtedness\nissued by us and our predecessor\ninstitutions, in the event of our dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization or insolvency,\nholders of the subordinated debt securities that may be offered by use of this prospectus and an applicable\nprospectus supplement may recover less,\nratably, than holders of some of our other series of outstanding subordinated indebtedness and more,\nratably, than holders of other series of our outstanding subordinated indebtedness. In addition, holders of\nthe subordinated debt securities\nmay be fully subordinated to interests held by the U.S. government in the event that we enter into a\nreceivership, insolvency, liquidation or similar proceeding.\n\nNo Limitation on Disposition of Voting Stock of the Bank. The subordinated indenture does not contain a\ncovenant prohibiting us from\nselling or otherwise disposing of any shares of voting stock of the Bank, or securities convertible into, or\noptions, warrants or rights to purchase shares of voting stock of the Bank. The subordinated indenture also\ndoes not prohibit the Bank from\nissuing any shares of its voting stock or securities convertible into, or options, warrants or rights to\npurchase shares of its voting stock.\n\nDefaults and Waivers. Unless otherwise specified in the prospectus supplement relating to a particular\nseries of subordinated debt\nsecurities, the subordinated indenture defines an event of default with respect to any series of\nsubordinated debt securities as follows:\n                                                                                          \n      specified events of bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency of JPMorganChase; and  \n                                                                                          \n                                                                                              \n      any other event specified with respect to subordinated debt securities of that series.  \n                                                                                              \nIf any event of default with respect to subordinated debt securities of any series occurs and is continuing,\neither the trustee or the holders\nof not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding subordinated debt securities of that series may\ndeclare the principal amount (or, if the subordinated debt securities of that series are original issue\ndiscount subordinated debt\nsecurities, a specified portion of the principal amount) of all subordinated debt securities of that series\nto be due and payable immediately. No such declaration is required upon certain specified events of\nbankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency.\nSubject to the conditions set forth in the subordinated indenture, the holders of a majority in principal\namount of the outstanding subordinated debt securities of that series may annul the declaration and waive\npast defaults, except uncured payment\ndefaults.\n\nWe will describe in the prospectus supplement any particular provisions relating to the acceleration of the\nmaturity of a\nportion of the principal amount of original issue discount subordinated debt securities upon an event of\ndefault. In the event of the bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or insolvency of JPMorganChase, any\nright to enforce that payment in cash\nwould be subject to the broad equity powers of a federal bankruptcy court and to its determination of the\nnature and status of the payment claims of the holders of the subordinated debt securities.\n\n17\n\nUnless otherwise provided in the prospectus supplement relating to a particular series of\nsubordinated debt securities, there will be no right of acceleration of the payment of principal of the\nsubordinated debt securities of that series upon a default in the payment of principal or interest or a\ndefault in the performance of any\ncovenant or agreement in the subordinated debt securities or the subordinated indenture. In the event of a\ndefault in the payment of principal or interest or a default in the performance of any covenant or agreement\nin the subordinated debt\nsecurities or the subordinated indenture, the trustee may, subject to specified limitations and conditions,\nseek to enforce that payment or the performance of that covenant or agreement.\n\nCovenant Breach\n\nUnder each indenture, a\n\u0093covenant breach\u0094 would occur with respect to the debt securities of any series issued under that indenture\nif we fail to perform or breach any of the covenants contained in that indenture (in the case of the senior\nindenture, other than a\nfailure to pay principal of or interest on the senior debt securities) and that failure or breach continues\nfor 90 days after the trustee under that indenture or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount\nof the outstanding debt securities\nof that series give written notice of that failure or breach. Under each indenture, neither the trustee nor\nthe holders of the debt securities will be entitled to accelerate the maturity of the debt securities as a\nresult of any covenant breach.\n\nIf a covenant breach or event of default with respect to the debt securities of any series occurs and is\ncontinuing, the relevant trustee\nmay in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the holders of those debt\nsecurities by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the trustee deems most effectual to protect and\nenforce any such rights, whether for\nthe specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in the relevant indenture, in aid of the exercise of\nany power granted in that indenture, or to enforce any other proper remedy.\n\nLimitation of Suits\n\nUnder each\nindenture, a holder of the debt securities of any series issued under that indenture will not have the right\nto institute any proceeding with respect to that indenture or those debt securities unless:\n                                                                                                            \n      the holder has given the trustee written notice of a continuing covenant breach or event of default   \n      with respect                                                                                          \n      to those debt securities;                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n      the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of those debt securities at the time             \n      outstanding have made a                                                                               \n      written request to the trustee to institute proceedings in respect of the covenant breach or event    \n      of default, and offered the trustee indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it; and                      \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n      the trustee has not received from the holders of a majority in principal amount of those debt         \n      securities at the                                                                                     \n      time outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and has failed to institute any such     \n      proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity.                 \n                                                                                                            \nThe foregoing limitations will not apply to any suit instituted by holders of the debt securities for the\nenforcement of any payment of\nprincipal or interest on or after the date when due.\n\nOther Provisions of the Indentures\n\nEach of the indentures requires the relevant trustee, within 90 days after the occurrence of a default known\nto it with respect to the debt\nsecurities of any series issued under that indenture, to give the holders of those debt securities notice of\nthe default if uncured or not waived. The trustee may withhold the notice if it determines in good faith\nthat the withholding of the notice\nis in the interest of those holders. However, the trustee may not withhold the notice in the case of a\ndefault in the payment of principal or interest. The trustee may not give the above notice until at least 60\ndays after the occurrence of a\ndefault in the performance of a covenant in the indenture, other than, in the case of the senior indenture,\na covenant to pay principal of or interest on the senior debt securities. The term \u0093default\u0094 for the purpose\nof this provision\nmeans any event that is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, a covenant breach or event\nof default with respect to the debt securities.\n\n18\n\nOther than the duty to act with the required standard of care during a default, the trustee under\neach of the indentures is not obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers under that indenture at the\nrequest or direction of any of the holders of the debt securities issued under that indenture, unless the\nholders have offered to the trustee\nreasonable security or indemnity. Each of the indentures provides that the holders of a majority in\nprincipal amount of the debt securities issued under that indenture may direct the time, method and place of\nconducting any proceeding for any remedy\navailable to the trustee, or exercising any trust or other power conferred on the trustee. However, the\ntrustee may decline to act if the direction is contrary to law or the indenture, and the trustee may take\nany other action deemed proper by the\ntrustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.\n\nEach of the indentures includes a covenant requiring us to file annually with the\nrelevant trustee a certificate stating that there exists no covenant breach, event of default or event that\nis, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, a covenant breach or event of default under the\nrelevant indenture, or if any such\ndefault exists, specifying such default.\n\nInformation Concerning The Trustees\n\nWe and our subsidiaries may maintain deposits or conduct other banking transactions with the trustees under\nthe senior indenture and the\nsubordinated indenture in the ordinary course of business. Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas is a trustee\nunder certain of our existing indentures pursuant to which we have issued and outstanding series of senior\ndebt securities. U.S. Bank\nTrust National Association is a trustee under certain of our existing indentures pursuant to which we have\nissued and outstanding series of subordinated debt securities.\n\nInsolvency and Resolution Considerations\n\nThe debt securities offered by use of this prospectus constitute \u0093loss-absorbing capacity\u0094 within the\nmeaning of the rules issued by\nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the \u0093Federal Reserve\u0094). Federal Reserve rules require\nthat JPMorgan Chase & Co. (the \u0093Parent Company\u0094) maintain minimum levels of unsecured external long-term\ndebt and\nother loss-absorbing capacity with specific terms for purposes of recapitalizing JPMorganChase\u0092s operating\nsubsidiaries if the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution either:\n                                                                                   \n      in a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or  \n                                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n      in a receivership administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u0093FDIC\u0094) under Title II of  \n      the Dodd-Frank Act (\u0093Title II\u0094).                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \nIf the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution, holders of the debt\nsecurities offered by use of this prospectus and other debt and equity securities of the Parent Company will\nabsorb the losses of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe preferred \u0093single point of entry\u0094 strategy under JPMorganChase\u0092s resolution plan contemplates that only\nthe Parent Company\nwould enter bankruptcy proceedings. JPMorganChase\u0092s subsidiaries would be recapitalized, as needed, so that\nthey could continue normal operations or subsequently be divested or wound down in an orderly manner. As a\nresult, the Parent\nCompany\u0092s losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of the Parent\nCompany\u0092s equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured creditors, including holders of the debt\nsecurities offered by use of\nthis prospectus and other debt securities. Claims of holders of those securities would have a junior\nposition to the claims of creditors of JPMorganChase\u0092s subsidiaries and to the claims of priority (as\ndetermined by statute) and secured\ncreditors of the Parent Company.\n\nAccordingly, in a resolution of the Parent Company in bankruptcy, holders of the debt securities offered\nby use of this prospectus and other debt securities of the Parent Company would realize value only to the\nextent available to the Parent Company as a shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its other\nsubsidiaries, and only after any claims of\npriority and secured creditors of the Parent Company have been fully repaid.\n\n19\n\nThe FDIC has similarly indicated that a single-point-of-entry recapitalization model would be its\nexpected strategy to resolve a systemically important financial institution, such as the Parent Company,\nunder Title II. However, the FDIC has not formally adopted or committed to any specific resolution strategy.\n\nIf the Parent Company were to approach, or enter into, a resolution, none of the Parent Company, the Federal\nReserve or the FDIC is obligated\nto follow JPMorganChase\u0092s preferred resolution strategy, and losses to holders of the debt securities\noffered by use of this prospectus and other debt and equity securities of the Parent Company, under whatever\nstrategy is ultimately followed,\ncould be greater than they might have been under JPMorganChase\u0092s preferred strategy.\n\n20\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED STOCK\n\nGeneral\n\nUnder our certificate of\nincorporation, our board of directors is authorized, without further stockholder action, to issue up to\n200,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $1 par value per share, in one or more series, and to determine the\nvoting powers and the designations,\npreferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations\nor restrictions of each series.

The following summary is not complete. You should also refer to our certificate of\nincorporation and to the certificate of\ndesignations relating to the series of the preferred stock being offered for the complete terms of that\nseries of preferred stock. A form of certificate of designations is filed as an exhibit to the registration\nstatement. We will file the\ncertificate of designations with respect to the particular series of preferred stock being offered with the\nSEC promptly after the offering of that series of preferred stock.\n\nThe preferred stock will, when issued against full payment of the purchase price relating to a series of\npreferred stock, be fully paid and\nnonassessable. Unless otherwise specified in the prospectus supplement, in the event we liquidate, dissolve\nor wind-up our business, each series of preferred stock being offered will have the same rank as to\ndividends and distributions as our\ncurrently outstanding preferred stock and each other series of preferred stock we may offer in the future by\nuse of this prospectus and an applicable prospectus supplement. The preferred stock will have no preemptive\nrights.\n\nDividend Rights\n\nHolders of the preferred\nstock offered by use of this prospectus and an applicable prospectus supplement will be entitled to receive,\nwhen, as and if declared by our board of directors or any duly authorized committee of our board, cash\ndividends at the rates and on the\ndates set forth in the prospectus supplement. Dividend rates may be fixed or variable or both. Different\nseries of preferred stock may be entitled to dividends at different dividend rates or based upon different\nmethods of determination. We will pay\neach dividend to the holders of record as they appear on our stock register (or, if applicable, the records\nof the depositary referred to under \u0093Description of Depositary Shares\u0094) on record dates determined by our\nboard of directors or a\nduly authorized committee of our board. Dividends on any series of preferred stock may be cumulative or\nnoncumulative, as specified in the prospectus supplement. If a dividend is not declared on any series of\npreferred stock for which dividends are\nnoncumulative, then the right of holders of that preferred stock to receive that dividend will be lost, and\nwe will have no obligation to pay the dividend for that dividend period, whether or not dividends are\ndeclared for any future dividend\nperiod.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, each series of preferred stock that we\noffer by use of this\nprospectus and an applicable prospectus supplement will provide that we may not declare or pay or set aside\nfor payment full dividends on any series of preferred stock ranking, as to dividends, equally with or junior\nto the series of preferred stock\nwe are offering unless we have previously declared and paid or set aside for payment, or we\ncontemporaneously declare and pay or set aside for payment, full dividends (including cumulative dividends\nstill owing, if any) on the series of preferred\nstock we are offering for, in the case of a series of noncumulative preferred stock, the most recently\ncompleted dividend period, or, in the case of a series of cumulative preferred stock, all past dividend\nperiods. If we fail to pay dividends in\nfull as stated above, we may only declare dividends on equally ranking series of preferred stock pro rata so\nthat the amount of dividends declared per share on the series of preferred stock we are offering and the\nequally ranking series bear to each\nother the same ratio that accumulated and unpaid dividends per share on the series being offered and the\nother series bear to each other. We will not pay interest or any sum of money instead of interest in respect\nof any dividend that is not\ndeclared, or if declared is not paid, on any series of preferred stock we are offering.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable\nprospectus supplement, the preferred stock we offer by use of this prospectus and an applicable prospectus\nsupplement will also provide that, unless we have paid or declared and set aside a sum sufficient for the\npayment thereof, in the case\nof a series of noncumulative preferred stock, full dividends on all outstanding shares of that preferred\nstock in respect of the most recently completed dividend period, or, in the case of a series of cumulative\npreferred stock, full dividends,\nincluding cumulative dividends, if any, owing on that preferred stock for all past dividend periods:\n                                                                                                            \n      no dividend (other than a dividend in common stock or in any junior or equally ranking stock as to    \n      dividends and                                                                                         \n      upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up) will be declared or paid or a sum sufficient for the     \n      payment thereof set aside for such payment or other distribution declared or made upon our            \n                                                                                                            \n22\n                                                      \n  common stock or upon any junior or equally ranking  \n  stock as to dividends or upon liquidation,          \n  dissolution or winding-up, and                      \n                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n      no common stock or other capital stock ranking junior or equally as to dividends or upon              \n      liquidation, dissolution                                                                              \n      or winding-up will be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any moneys  \n      be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares of any such capital  \n      stock) by us, except:                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  (1)  by conversion into or exchange for capital stock ranking junior to the preferred stock being         \n       offered;

Subject to the conditions described above, and not otherwise,\ndividends (payable in cash, capital\nstock, or otherwise), as may be determined by our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of our\nboard, may be declared and paid on our common stock and any other capital stock ranking junior to or on a\nparity with the preferred stock\nbeing offered from time to time out of any assets legally available for such payment, and the holders of the\npreferred stock being offered will not be entitled to participate in those dividends.\n\nAs used in this prospectus, \u0093junior to the preferred stock being offered\u0094 and like terms refer to our common\nstock and any other\nclass or series of our capital stock over which the preferred stock being offered has preference or\npriority, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or both, as the context may\nrequire; \u0093parity preferred\nstock\u0094 and \u0093on a parity with the preferred stock being offered\u0094 and like terms refer to any class or series\nof our capital stock that ranks on a parity with the shares of the preferred stock being offered, either as\nto dividends or\nupon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or both, as the context may require; and \u0093senior to the\npreferred stock being offered\u0094 and like terms refer to any class or series of our capital stock that ranks\nsenior to the preferred stock\nbeing offered, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or both, as the\ncontext may require.\n\nUnless\notherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, we will compute the amount of dividends payable\nby annualizing the applicable dividend rate and dividing by the number of dividend periods in a year, except\nthat the amount of dividends\npayable for any period greater or less than a full dividend period, other than the initial dividend period,\nwill be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months and, for any\nperiod less than a full month, the actual number of days elapsed in the period. Dollar amounts resulting\nfrom that calculation will be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upward.\n\n23\n\nRights Upon Liquidation\n\nIn the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, holders of each series\nof preferred stock that we offer by\nuse of this prospectus and an applicable prospectus supplement will be entitled to receive and to be paid\nout of our assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders the amount set forth in the\nprospectus supplement plus, in the case of\na series of noncumulative preferred stock, an amount equal to any declared and unpaid dividends, without\naccumulation of undeclared dividends, if any, from the day following the immediately preceding dividend\npayment date, to, but not including, the\ndate of the liquidating distribution, but without accumulation of any unpaid dividends for prior dividend\nperiods, or, in the case of a series of cumulative preferred stock, an amount equal to any accumulated and\nunpaid dividends, whether or not\ndeclared, before we make any payment or distribution on our common stock or on any other capital stock\nranking junior to the preferred stock offered by use of this prospectus and an applicable prospectus\nsupplement, and any stock having the same\nrank as that series of preferred stock upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up. After the payment to\nsuch holders of the full preferential amounts to which they are entitled, such holders will have no right or\nclaim to any of our remaining\nassets.\n\nIf, upon our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, we fail to pay in full the\namounts payable with\nrespect to preferred stock offered by use of this prospectus and an applicable prospectus supplement, and\nany stock having the same rank as that series of preferred stock, the holders of the preferred stock and of\nthat other stock will share ratably\nin any such distribution of our assets in proportion to the full respective distributions to which they are\nentitled. For any series of preferred stock offered by use of this prospectus and an applicable prospectus\nsupplement, neither the sale of\nall or substantially all of our property or business, nor our merger or consolidation into or with any other\nentity will be considered a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up.\n\nRedemption\n\nThe applicable prospectus\nsupplement will indicate whether the series of preferred stock offered by use of this prospectus and the\napplicable prospectus supplement is subject to redemption, in whole or in part, whether at our option or\nmandatorily and whether or not pursuant\nto a sinking fund. The redemption provisions that may apply to a series of preferred stock offered,\nincluding the redemption dates, the redemption prices for that series and whether those redemption prices\nwill be paid in cash, stock or a\ncombination of cash and stock, will be set forth in the prospectus supplement. If the redemption price is to\nbe paid only from the proceeds of the sale of our capital stock, the terms of the series of preferred stock\nmay also provide that, if our\ncapital stock is not sold or if the amount of cash received is insufficient to pay in full the redemption\nprice then due, the series of preferred stock will automatically be converted into shares of the applicable\ncapital stock pursuant to\nconversion provisions specified in the prospectus supplement.\n\nIf we are redeeming fewer than all the outstanding shares of preferred\nstock of any series, whether by mandatory or optional redemption, our board of directors or any duly\nauthorized committee of our board will determine the method for selecting the shares to be redeemed, which\n(unless otherwise specified in the\napplicable prospectus supplement) may be by lot or pro rata or in such other manner as the board of\ndirectors or any duly authorized committee of our board determines to be equitable. From and after the\nredemption date, dividends will cease to\naccumulate on the shares of preferred stock called for redemption up to the redemption date and all rights\nof the holders of those shares, except the right to receive the redemption price, will cease.\n\nIn the event that we fail to pay full dividends, including accumulated but unpaid dividends, if any, on any\nseries of preferred stock offered,\nwe may not redeem that series in part and we may not purchase or acquire any shares of that series of\npreferred stock, except by a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to all holders of that series\nof preferred stock.\n\n24\n\nConversion Rights\n\nThe prospectus supplement will state the terms, if any, on which shares of the series of preferred stock\noffered by use of this prospectus and\nan applicable prospectus supplement are convertible into shares of our common stock or other securities. As\ndescribed under \u0093\u0097 Redemption\u0094 above, under certain circumstances, preferred stock may be mandatorily\nconvertible into our\ncommon stock or another series of our preferred stock.\n\nVoting Rights\n\nExcept as indicated below or in the applicable prospectus supplement, or except as expressly required by\napplicable law, the holders of the\npreferred stock offered by use of this prospectus and an applicable prospectus supplement will not be\nentitled to vote. Unless otherwise indicated in the prospectus supplement, each share of preferred stock of\neach series will be entitled to one\nvote on matters on which holders of that series of preferred stock are entitled to vote. However, as more\nfully described under \u0093Description of Depositary Shares,\u0094 if we use this prospectus and an applicable\nprospectus supplement to offer\ndepositary shares representing a fractional interest in a share of a series of preferred stock, each\ndepositary share, in effect, will be entitled to that fraction of a vote, rather than a full vote. If\n(unless otherwise indicated in the prospectus\nsupplement) each full share of any series of preferred stock offered is entitled to one vote, the voting\npower of that series will depend on the number of shares in that series, and not on the aggregate\nliquidation preference or initial offering\nprice of the shares of that series of preferred stock.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement, if, at any time or times,\nthe equivalent of an aggregate of six quarterly dividends, whether or not consecutive, for any series of\npreferred stock being offered has not been paid, the number of directors constituting our board of directors\nwill be automatically increased by\ntwo and the holders of each outstanding series of preferred stock with such voting rights, together with\nholders of such other shares of any other class or series of parity preferred stock outstanding at the time\nupon which like voting rights have\nbeen conferred and are exercisable, which we refer to as \u0093voting parity stock,\u0094 voting together as a class,\nwill be entitled to elect those additional two directors, which we refer to as \u0093preferred directors,\u0094 at\nthat annual\nmeeting and at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders until full dividends have been paid for at\nleast four quarterly consecutive dividend periods. At that time such right will terminate, except as\nexpressly provided in the applicable\ncertificate of designations or by law, subject to revesting. Upon any termination of the right of the\nholders of shares of preferred stock being offered and voting parity stock as a class to vote for directors\nas provided above, the preferred\ndirectors will cease to be qualified as directors, the term of office of all preferred directors then in\noffice will terminate immediately and the authorized number of directors will be reduced by the number of\npreferred directors elected. Any\npreferred director may be removed and replaced at any time, with cause as provided by law or without cause\nby the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of preferred stock voting together as a class with the\nholders of shares of voting parity\nstock, to the extent the voting rights of such holders described above are then exercisable. Any vacancy\ncreated by removal with or without cause may be filled only as described in the preceding sentence. If the\noffice of any preferred director\nbecomes vacant for any reason other than removal, the remaining preferred director may choose a successor\nwho will hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred.\n\nSo long as any shares of the preferred stock being offered remain outstanding, we will not, without the\naffirmative vote of the holders of at\nleast 66 2/3% in voting power of the preferred stock being offered and any voting parity stock, voting\ntogether as a class, authorize, create or issue any capital stock ranking senior to the preferred stock\nbeing offered as to dividends or upon\nliquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or reclassify any authorized capital stock into any such shares of\nsuch capital stock or issue any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase\nany such shares of capital stock.\nSo long as any shares of the preferred stock being offered remain outstanding, we will not, without the\naffirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of the preferred stock being offered,\namend, alter or repeal any provision of\nthe applicable certificate of designations or our certificate of incorporation, including by merger,\nconsolidation or otherwise, so as to adversely affect the powers, preferences or special rights of the\npreferred stock being offered.\n\n25\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, none of the following will be deemed to adversely affect the\npowers, preferences or special rights of the preferred stock being offered:\n                                                                                                            \n      any increase in the amount of authorized common stock or authorized preferred stock, or any increase  \n      or decrease                                                                                           \n      in the number of shares of any series of preferred stock, or the authorization, creation and          \n      issuance of other classes or series of capital stock, in each case ranking on a parity with or        \n      junior to the preferred stock being offered as to dividends                                           \n      or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up;                                                       \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n      a merger or consolidation of JPMorganChase with or into another entity in which the shares of the     \n      preferred stock                                                                                       \n      being offered remain outstanding; and                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n      a merger or consolidation of JPMorganChase with or into another entity in which the shares of the     \n      preferred stock                                                                                       \n      being offered are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving entity or    \n      any entity, directly or indirectly, controlling such surviving entity and such new preference         \n      securities have powers, preferences and special rights                                                \n      that are not materially less favorable than the preferred stock being offered;                        \n                                                                                                            \nprovided that if the amendment would adversely affect\nsuch series but not any other series of outstanding preferred stock, then the amendment will only need to be\napproved by holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of the series of preferred stock adversely\naffected.\n\nUnder regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve Board, if the holders of any series of our preferred stock\nbecome entitled to vote for the\nelection of directors because dividends on that series are in arrears, that series may then be deemed a\n\u0093class of voting securities.\u0094 In such a case, a holder of 25% or more of the series, or a holder of 5% or\nmore if that holder would\nalso be considered to exercise a \u0093controlling influence\u0094 over JPMorganChase, may then be subject to\nregulation as a bank holding company in accordance with the Bank Holding Company Act. In addition, (1) any\nother bank holding company may\nbe required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire or retain 5% or more of\nthat series, and (2) any person other than a bank holding company may be required to provide notice to the\nFederal Reserve Board prior to\nacquiring or retaining 10% or more of that series.\n\nOutstanding Series of Preferred Stock\n\nRanking. Each of our Series CC Preferred Stock, Series DD Preferred Stock, Series EE Preferred Stock, Series\nGG Preferred Stock, Series\nII Preferred Stock, Series JJ Preferred Stock, Series KK Preferred Stock, Series LL Preferred Stock, Series\nMM Preferred Stock, Series NN Preferred Stock and Series OO Preferred Stock (each as defined below, and\ncollectively, the \u0093Outstanding\nPreferred Stock\u0094) ranks senior to our common stock as well as any of our other stock that states it is\nexpressly made junior to such series of Outstanding Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and\ndistribution of assets upon our\nliquidation, dissolution, or winding up.\n\nDividends. We may not declare or pay or set apart for payment full dividends on any\nseries of preferred stock ranking, as to dividends, equally with or junior to the Outstanding Preferred\nStock unless we have previously declared and paid or set apart for payment full dividends on the Outstanding\nPreferred Stock for the most\nrecently completed dividend period. When dividends are not paid in full on the Outstanding Preferred Stock\nand any series of preferred stock ranking equally as to dividends, all dividends upon the Outstanding\nPreferred Stock and such equally ranking\nseries will be declared and paid pro rata.\n\nWith certain exceptions, unless we have paid or declared and set aside for payment full\ndividends on the Outstanding Preferred Stock for the most recently completed dividend period, we will not:\n                                                                                                            \n      declare or make any dividend payment or distribution on any junior ranking stock, other than a        \n      dividend paid in                                                                                      \n      junior ranking stock, or                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \n26\n                                                                                                            \n      redeem, purchase, otherwise acquire or set apart money for a sinking fund for the redemption of any   \n      junior or                                                                                             \n      equally ranking stock, except by conversion into or exchange for junior ranking stock.                \n                                                                                                            \nRights Upon Liquidation.\nIn the event we liquidate, dissolve or wind-up our business and affairs, either voluntarily or\ninvoluntarily, holders of the Outstanding Preferred Stock of each series will be entitled to receive\nliquidating distributions equal to the liquidation\npreference per share for such series, plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of\nundeclared dividends, before we make any distribution of assets to the holders of our common stock or any\nother class or series of shares ranking\njunior to the Outstanding Preferred Stock of such series.\n\nRedemption.

Those rights\ninclude dividend, voting, redemption, conversion and liquidation rights.\n\nThe depositary shares offered by use of this prospectus and an applicable prospectus supplement will be\nevidenced by depositary receipts\nissued under the deposit agreement.

Forms of those documents will be filed as exhibits to or incorporated by\nreference in the registration\nstatement.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, each unit will be issued so that the\nholder of the unit is\nalso the holder of each security included in the unit. Thus, the holder of a unit will have the rights and\nobligations of a holder of each included security. The unit agreement under which a unit is issued may\nprovide that the securities included in\nthe unit may not be held or transferred separately, at any time or at any time before a specified date. We\nwill describe the particular terms of any series of units being offered in the prospectus supplement\nrelating to that series of units.

The\nfollowing is a summary of the depositary arrangements applicable to securities issued in permanent global\nform and for which The Depository\nTrust Company (\u0093DTC\u0094) will act as depositary (the \u0093global securities\u0094).\n\nEach global security will be deposited with,\nor on behalf of, DTC, as depositary, or its nominee and registered in the name of a nominee of DTC. Except\nunder the limited circumstances described below, global securities will not be exchangeable for certificated\nsecurities.\n\nOnly institutions that have accounts with DTC or its nominee (\u0093DTC participants\u0094) or persons that may hold\ninterests through DTC\nparticipants may own beneficial interests in a global security. DTC will maintain records evidencing\nownership of beneficial interests by DTC participants in the global securities and transfers of those\nownership interests. DTC participants will\nmaintain records evidencing ownership of beneficial interests in the global securities by persons that hold\nthrough those DTC participants and transfers of those ownership interests within those DTC participants. DTC\nhas no knowledge of the actual\nbeneficial owners of the securities. You will not receive written confirmation from DTC of your purchase,\nbut we do expect that you will receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well\nas periodic statements of your\nholdings, from the DTC participant through which you entered the transaction. The laws of some jurisdictions\nrequire that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those securities in certificated\nform. Those laws may impair your\nability to transfer beneficial interests in a global security.\n\nDTC has advised us that upon the issuance of a global security and the\ndeposit of that global security with DTC, DTC will immediately credit, on its book-entry registration and\ntransfer system, the respective principal amounts or number of shares represented by that global security to\nthe accounts of DTC participants.\n\nWe will make payments on securities represented by a global security to DTC or its nominee, as the case may\nbe, as the registered owner\nand holder of the global security representing those securities. DTC has advised us that upon receipt of any\npayment on a global security, DTC will immediately credit accounts of DTC participants with payments in\namounts proportionate to their\nrespective beneficial interests in that security, as shown in the records of DTC. Standing instructions and\ncustomary practices will govern payments by DTC participants to owners of beneficial interests in a global\nsecurity held through those DTC\nparticipants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or\nregistered in \u0093street name.\u0094 Those payments will be the sole responsibility of those DTC participants,\nsubject to any statutory or\nregulatory requirements in effect from time to time.\n\nNone of JPMorganChase, the trustees, the depositary or any of our respective agents\nwill have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records of DTC, any nominee or any DTC\nparticipant relating to, or payments made on account of, beneficial interests in a global security or for\nmaintaining, supervising or reviewing\nany of the records of DTC, any nominee or any DTC participant relating to those beneficial interests.\n\nA global security is exchangeable\nfor certificated securities registered in the name of a person other than DTC or its nominee only if:\n                                                                                                            \n      DTC notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for that global security or  \n      DTC ceases                                                                                            \n      to be registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n      we determine in our discretion that the global security will be exchangeable for certificated         \n      securities in                                                                                         \n      registered form; or                                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n      if applicable to the particular type of security, there shall have occurred and be continuing an      \n      event of default                                                                                      \n      or an event which, with notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute an event of default     \n      under the securities.                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \n36\n\nAny global security that is exchangeable as described in the preceding sentence will be\nexchangeable in whole for certificated securities in registered form, and, in the case of global debt\nsecurities, of like tenor and of an equal aggregate principal amount as the global security, in\ndenominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of\n$1,000 (or in denominations and integral multiples as otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus\nsupplement). The registrar for the securities will register the certificated securities in the name or names\ninstructed by DTC. We expect that\nthose instructions may be based upon directions received by DTC from DTC participants with respect to\nownership of beneficial interests in the global security. In the case of global debt securities, we will\nmake payment of any principal and interest\non the certificated securities and will register transfers and exchanges of those certificated securities at\nthe corporate trust office of The Bank of New York Mellon or any successor paying agent that we may\ndesignate. However, we may elect to pay\ninterest by check mailed to the address of the person entitled to that interest payment as of the record\ndate, as shown on the register for the securities.\n\nExcept as provided above, as an owner of a beneficial interest in a global security, you will not be\nentitled to receive physical delivery of\nsecurities in certificated form and will not be considered a holder of securities for any purpose under\neither of the indentures. No global security will be exchangeable except for another global security of like\ndenomination and tenor to be\nregistered in the name of DTC or its nominee. Accordingly, you must rely on the procedures of DTC and the\nDTC participant through which you own your interest to exercise any rights of a holder under the global\nsecurity or the applicable indenture.\n\nWe understand that, under existing industry practices, in the event that we request any action of holders,\nor an owner of a beneficial\ninterest in a global security desires to take any action that a holder is entitled to take under the\nsecurities or the indentures, DTC would authorize the DTC participants holding the relevant beneficial\ninterests to take that action, and those DTC\nparticipants would authorize beneficial owners owning through those DTC participants to take that action or\nwould otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners owning through them.\n\nDTC has advised us that DTC is a limited purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a\n\u0093banking organization\u0094\nwithin the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a \u0093clearing\ncorporation\u0094 within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a \u0093clearing agency\u0094 registered\nunder the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934.\n\nIf specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, investors may elect to hold interests in the global\nsecurities deposited with DTC outside the United States through Clearstream Banking, S.A. (\u0093Clearstream\u0094) or\nEuroclear Bank SA/NV, as operator of the Euroclear System (\u0093Euroclear\u0094), if they are participants in those\nsystems, or\nindirectly through organizations that are participants in those systems. Clearstream and Euroclear will hold\ninterests on behalf of their participants through customers\u0092 securities accounts in Clearstream\u0092s and\nEuroclear\u0092s names on\nthe books of their respective depositaries. Those depositaries in turn hold those interests in customers\u0092\nsecurities accounts in the depositaries\u0092 names on the books of DTC. Unless otherwise specified in the\nprospectus supplement, The Bank\nof New York Mellon will act as depositary for each of Clearstream and Euroclear in the case of global debt\nsecurities.\n\nClearstream has\nadvised us that it is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg as a professional depositary. Clearstream\nholds securities for its participants and facilitates the clearance and settlement of securities\ntransactions between its participants through\nelectronic book-entry transfers between their accounts. Clearstream provides its participants with, among\nother things, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally traded\nsecurities and securities lending\nand borrowing. Clearstream interfaces with domestic securities markets in several countries through\nestablished depository and custodial relationships. As a professional depositary, Clearstream is subject to\nregulation by the Luxembourg Commission\nfor the Supervision of the Financial Sector, also known as the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur\nFinancier. Clearstream participants are recognized financial institutions around the world, including\nunderwriters, securities brokers and\ndealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and other organizations. Clearstream\u0092s participants\nin the United States are limited to securities brokers and dealers and banks. Indirect access to Clearstream\nis also available to other\ninstitutions such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial\nrelationship with Clearstream participants.\n\n37\n\nDistributions with respect to interests in global securities held through Clearstream will be\ncredited to cash accounts of its customers in accordance with its rules and procedures, to the extent\nreceived by the U.S. depositary for Clearstream.\n\nEuroclear has advised us that it was created in 1968 to hold securities for its participants and to clear\nand settle transactions between\nEuroclear participants through simultaneous electronic book-entry delivery against payment, thereby\neliminating the need for physical movement of certificates and any risk from lack of simultaneous transfers\nof securities and cash. Euroclear\nprovides various other services, including securities lending and borrowing, and interfaces with domestic\nmarkets in several countries. Euroclear is operated by Euroclear Bank SA/NV under contract with Euroclear\nplc, a U.K. corporation. Euroclear\nparticipants include banks, including central banks, securities brokers and dealers and other professional\nfinancial intermediaries. Indirect access to Euroclear is also available to other firms that clear through\nor maintain a custodial\nrelationship with a Euroclear participant, either directly or indirectly.\n\nDistributions with respect to interests in global securities\nheld beneficially through Euroclear will be credited to the cash accounts of Euroclear participants in\naccordance with Euroclear\u0092s terms and conditions and operating procedures and applicable Belgian law, to the\nextent received by the U.S.\ndepositary for Euroclear.\n\nGlobal Clearance and Settlement Procedures\n\nUnless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement with respect to a particular series of global\nsecurities, initial settlement for global\nsecurities will be made in immediately available funds. DTC participants will conduct secondary market\ntrading with other DTC participants in the ordinary way in accordance with DTC rules. Thereafter, secondary\nmarket trades will settle in\nimmediately available funds using DTC\u0092s same day funds settlement system.\n\nIf the prospectus supplement specifies that interests in\nthe global securities may be held through Clearstream or Euroclear, Clearstream customers and/or Euroclear\nparticipants will conduct secondary market trading with other Clearstream customers and/or Euroclear\nparticipants in the ordinary way in\naccordance with the applicable rules and operating procedures of Clearstream and Euroclear. Thereafter,\nsecondary market trades will settle in immediately available funds.\n\nCross-market transfers between persons holding directly or indirectly through DTC on the one hand, and\ndirectly or indirectly through\nClearstream customers or Euroclear participants, on the other, will be effected in DTC in accordance with\nDTC\u0092s rules on behalf of the relevant European international clearing system by the U.S. depositary for that\nsystem; however, those\ncross-market transactions will require delivery by the counterparty in the relevant European international\nclearing system of instructions to that system in accordance with its rules and procedures and within its\nestablished deadlines (European\ntime). The relevant European international clearing system will, if the transaction meets its settlement\nrequirements, deliver instructions to the U.S. depositary for that system to take action to effect final\nsettlement on its behalf by delivering\nor receiving interests in global securities in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with\nnormal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Clearstream customers and Euroclear\nparticipants may not deliver instructions\ndirectly to DTC.\n\nBecause of time-zone differences, credits of interests in global securities received in Clearstream or\nEuroclear as a\nresult of a transaction with a DTC participant will be made during subsequent securities settlement\nprocessing and will be credited the business day following the DTC settlement date. Those credits or any\ntransactions in global securities settled\nduring that processing will be reported to the relevant Euroclear participants or Clearstream customers on\nthat business day. Cash received in Clearstream or Euroclear as a result of sales of interests in global\nsecurities by or through a\nClearstream customer or a Euroclear participant to a DTC participant will be received with value on the DTC\nsettlement date but will be available in the relevant Clearstream or Euroclear cash account only as of the\nbusiness day following settlement\nin DTC.\n\nAlthough DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear have agreed to the procedures described above in order to facilitate\ntransfers of\ninterests in global securities among DTC participants, Clearstream and Euroclear, they are under no\nobligation to perform those procedures and those procedures may be discontinued at any time.\n\n38\n\nSpecial Provisions Relating to Certain Foreign Currency Securities\n\nIf specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, book-entry securities denominated in currencies other\nthan U.S. dollars may be held\ndirectly through participants in the systems of Clearstream or Euroclear, or indirectly through\norganizations that are participants in such systems.

(\u0093JPMorganChase\u0094) provides that, to the fullest\nextent that the\nDGCL as from time to time in effect permits the limitation or elimination of the liability of directors, no\ndirector of JPMorganChase shall be personally liable to JPMorganChase or its stockholders for monetary\ndamages for breach of fiduciary duty\nas a director.\n\nJPMorganChase\u0092s certificate of incorporation empowers JPMorganChase to indemnify any director, officer,\nemployee or\nagent of JPMorganChase or any other person who is serving at JPMorganChase\u0092s request in any such capacity\nwith another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including, without\nlimitation, any employee benefit plan)\nto the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL as from time to time in effect, and any such indemnification\nmay continue as to any person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and may inure to\nthe benefit of the heirs,\nexecutors and administrators of such a person.\n\nJPMorganChase\u0092s certificate of incorporation also empowers JPMorganChase by action of\nits board of directors, notwithstanding any interest of the directors in the action, to purchase and\nmaintain insurance in such amounts as the Board of Directors deems appropriate to protect any director,\nofficer, employee or agent of JPMorganChase\nor any other person who is serving at JPMorganChase\u0092s request in any such capacity with another corporation,\npartnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including, without limitation, any employee benefit\nplan) against any liability\nasserted against him or her or incurred by him or her in any such capacity or arising out of his or her\nstatus as such (including, without limitation, expenses, judgments, fines (including any excise taxes\nassessed on a person with respect to any\nemployee benefit plan) and amounts paid in settlement) to the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL as\nfrom time to time in effect, whether or not JPMorganChase would have the power or be required to indemnify\nany such person under the terms of\nany agreement or by-law or the DGCL.\n\nIn addition, JPMorganChase\u0092s by-laws require JPMorganChase to indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted\nunder applicable law, as from time to time in effect, any person who was or is involved in any manner\n(including, without limitation, as a\nparty or witness), or is threatened to be made so involved, in any threatened, pending or completed\ninvestigation, claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative\n(including without limitation, any\naction, suit or proceeding by or in the right of JPMorganChase to procure a judgment in its favor, but\nexcluding any action, suit, or proceeding, or part thereof, brought by such person against JPMorganChase or\nany of its affiliates unless consented\nto by JPMorganChase) (a \u0093Proceeding\u0094) by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, or\nemployee of JPMorganChase, or is or was serving at the request of JPMorganChase as a director, officer or\nemployee of another\ncorporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against all expenses (including\nattorneys\u0092 fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or\nher in connection with such\nProceeding (or part thereof). The by-laws specify that the right to indemnification so provided is a\ncontract right, set forth certain procedural and evidentiary standards applicable to the enforcement of a\nclaim under the by-laws and entitle the persons to be indemnified to receive payment in advance of any\nexpenses incurred in connection with such Proceeding, consistent with the provisions of applicable law, as\nfrom time to time in effect. Such provisions, however, are intended to be in furtherance and not in\nlimitation of the general right to indemnification provided in the by-laws, which right of indemnification\nand of advancement of expenses is not exclusive of any other rights to which a person seeking\nindemnification may otherwise be entitled, under any statute, by-law, agreement, vote or otherwise.\n\nJPMorganChase\u0092s by-laws also provide that JPMorganChase may enter into contracts with any\ndirector, officer or employee of JPMorganChase in furtherance of the indemnification provisions in the by-\nlaws, as well as create a trust fund, grant a security interest or use other means (including, without\nlimitation, a letter of credit) to ensure payment of amounts indemnified.\n\nII-2\n\nLastly, JPMorganChase\u0092s by-laws also provide that\nany repeal or modification of the indemnification rights provided in the by-laws shall not adversely affect\nany right or protection thereunder of any person in respect of any act or omission occurring\nprior to the time of such repeal or modification.\n\nThe foregoing statements are subject to the detailed provisions of Section 145 of\nthe DGCL and the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of JPMorganChase.\n                      \n  ITEM\u200916.

Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, any increase or decrease in volume of\nsecurities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was\nregistered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be\nreflected in the form of prospectus filed with\nthe Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no\nmore than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the \u0093Calculation of Registration\nFee\u0094 table in the\neffective registration statement; and\n\n(iii) To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution\nnot previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the\nregistration statement;\n\nprovided,\nhowever, that paragraphs (1)(i), (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) do not apply if the information required to be\nincluded in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs is contained in reports filed with or furnished\nto the Commission by the\nRegistrant pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are\nincorporated by reference in the registration statement, or is contained in a form of prospectus filed\npursuant to Rule 424(b) that is part of the\nregistration statement.\n\n(2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such\npost-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities\noffered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona\nfide offering thereof.\n\n(3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being\nregistered which remain\nunsold at the termination of the offering.\n\n(4) That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of\n1933 to any purchaser:\n\n(i) Each prospectus filed by the Registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part\nof the registration statement as of the date the filed prospectus was deemed part of and included in the\nregistration statement; and\n\n(ii) Each prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5), or (b)(7) as part of a\nregistration statement in\nreliance on Rule 430B relating to an offering made pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i), (vii), or (x) for the\npurpose of providing the information required by Section 10(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 shall be deemed\nto be part of and included\nin the registration statement as of the earlier of the date such form of prospectus is first used after\neffectiveness or the date of the first contract of sale of securities\n\nII-3\n\nin the offering described in the prospectus. As provided in Rule 430B, for liability purposes of the issuer\nand any person that is at that date an underwriter, such date shall be deemed to be a\nnew effective date of the registration statement relating to the securities in the registration statement to\nwhich that prospectus relates, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the\ninitial bona fide offering\nthereof. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of\nthe registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the\nregistration statement or\nprospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of\nsale prior to such effective date, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration\nstatement or prospectus that was part of\nthe registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such effective date.\n\n(5) That, for the\npurpose of determining liability of the Registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the\ninitial distribution of the securities, the undersigned Registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of\nsecurities of the undersigned\nRegistrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the\nsecurities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the\nfollowing communications, the\nundersigned Registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such\nsecurities to such purchaser:\n\n(i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned Registrant relating to the offering required\nto be filed\npursuant to Rule 424;\n\n(ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the\nundersigned Registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned Registrant;\n\n(iii) The portion of any other free writing\nprospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned Registrant or its\nsecurities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned Registrant; and\n\n(iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned Registrant to the\npurchaser.\n\nThe undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of determining any liability under the\nSecurities Act of 1933 each filing of\nthe Registrant\u0092s annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934 (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plan\u0092s annual report pursuant to Section\n15(d) of\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that is incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall\nbe deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of\nsuch securities at that time\nshall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act\nof 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the\nforegoing provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities\nand Exchange Commission such\nindemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.
