In 2023, the Firm further\nenhanced its health and wellness benefits for U.S.\nemployees, including updates to the U.S. medical\nplan, as well as expedited access to an expanded\nnetwork of professionals for free mental health\ncounseling and coaching.\n     \n  3  \n     \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                                                  \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\n                                                                                                            \n  Supervision and regulation                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm is subject to extensive and comprehensive\nregulation under U.S. federal and state laws, as\nwell as the applicable laws of the jurisdictions\noutside the U.S. in which the Firm does business.\n\nFinancial holding company:\n\nConsolidated supervision . JPMorgan Chase & Co. is\na bank holding company (\u201cBHC\u201d) and a financial\nholding company (\u201cFHC\u201d) under U.S. federal law, and\nis subject to comprehensive consolidated\nsupervision, regulation and examination by the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n(the \u201cFederal Reserve\u201d). The Federal Reserve acts\nas the supervisor of the consolidated operations of\nBHCs. Certain of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s subsidiaries are\nalso regulated directly by additional authorities\nbased on the activities or licenses of those\nsubsidiaries.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s national bank subsidiary, JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A., is supervised and regulated by\nthe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\n(\u201cOCC\u201d) and, with respect to certain matters, by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the\n\u201cFDIC\u201d).\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s U.S. broker-dealers are supervised\nand regulated by the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and the Financial Industry\nRegulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d). Subsidiaries of the\nFirm that engage in certain futures-related and\nswaps-related activities are supervised and\nregulated by the Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission (\u201cCFTC\u201d). J.P. Morgan Securities plc\nholds a banking license in the U.K. and is\nregulated by the U.K. Prudential Regulation\nAuthority (the \u201cPRA\u201d) and the U.K. Financial\nConduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d).\n\nJPMSE is a Germany-based credit institution\nregulated by the European Central Bank (\u201cECB\u201d) as\nwell as the local regulators in each of the\ncountries in which it operates. The Firm\u2019s other\nnon-U.S. subsidiaries are regulated by the banking,\nsecurities, prudential, payments and conduct\nregulatory authorities, as applicable, in the\ncountries in which they operate.\n\nPermissible business activities . The Bank Holding\nCompany Act restricts BHCs from engaging in\nbusiness activities other than the business of\nbanking and certain closely-related activities.\nFHCs are permitted to engage in a broader range of\nfinancial activities. The Federal Reserve has the\nauthority to limit an FHC\u2019s ability to conduct\notherwise permissible activities if the FHC or any\nof its depository institution subsidiaries ceases\nto meet applicable eligibility requirements. The\nFederal Reserve may also impose corrective capital\nand/or managerial requirements on the FHC, and if\ndeficiencies are persistent, may require\ndivestiture of the FHC\u2019s depository institutions.\nIf any depository institution controlled by an FHC\nfails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the\nCommunity Reinvestment Act, the Federal Reserve\nmust prohibit the FHC and its subsidiaries from\nengaging in any new activities other than\n\nthose permissible for BHCs, or acquiring a company\nengaged in such activities.\n\nCapital and liquidity requirements . The Federal\nReserve establishes capital, liquidity and leverage\nrequirements for JPMorgan Chase that are generally\nconsistent with the international Basel III capital\nand liquidity framework and evaluates the Firm\u2019s\ncompliance with those requirements. The OCC\nestablishes similar requirements for JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. Certain of the Firm\u2019s non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries and branches are also subject to local\ncapital and liquidity requirements.\n\nBanking supervisors globally continue to refine and\nenhance the Basel III capital framework for\nfinancial institutions. In July 2023, U.S. banking\nregulators released a proposal to amend the U.S.\nrisk-based capital framework to incorporate certain\nelements of the revised international Basel III\ncapital framework. The proposal would significantly\nrevise risk-based capital requirements for banks\nwith assets of $100 billion or more, including the\nFirm and other U.S. global systemically important\nbanks (\"GSIBs\"). The proposed effective date is\nJuly 1, 2025 with a three-year transition period.\n\nIn addition to the release of the U.S. proposal,\nthe EU and U.K. regulators have also largely\nfinalized the rules implementing their Basel III\nframeworks. The proposed effective dates are\nJanuary 1, 2025, in the EU and July 1, 2025, in the\nU.K., with certain transitional arrangements\napplicable until 2030 and 2032, respectively.\n\nStress tests . As a large BHC, JPMorgan Chase is\nsubject to supervisory stress testing administered\nby the Federal Reserve as part of the Federal\nReserve\u2019s annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and\nReview (\u201cCCAR\u201d) framework. The Firm must conduct\nannual company-run stress tests and must also\nsubmit an annual capital plan to the Federal\nReserve, taking into account the results of\nseparate stress tests designed by each of the Firm\nand the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve uses\nthe results under the severely adverse scenario\nfrom its supervisory stress test to determine the\nFirm\u2019s Stress Capital Buffer (\u201cSCB\u201d) requirement\nfor the coming year, which forms part of the Firm\u2019s\napplicable capital buffers. The Firm is required to\nfile its annual CCAR submission on April 5, 2024.\nThe Federal Reserve will notify the Firm of its\nindicative SCB requirement by June 30, 2024 and\nfinal SCB requirement by August 31, 2024. The\nFirm\u2019s final SCB requirement will become effective\non October 1, 2024. The OCC requires JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. to perform separate, similar stress\ntests annually. The Firm publishes each year the\nresults of the annual stress tests for the Firm and\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. under the supervisory\n\u201cseverely adverse\u201d scenarios provided by the\nFederal Reserve and the OCC.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101\nand Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102\u2013109 for\nmore information.\n     \n  4  \n     \nEnhanced prudential standards . As part of its\nmandate to identify and monitor risks to the\nfinancial stability of the U.S. posed by large\nbanking organizations, the Financial Stability\nOversight Council (\u201cFSOC\u201d) recommends prudential\nstandards and reporting requirements to the Federal\nReserve for systemically important financial\ninstitutions (\u201cSIFIs\u201d), such as JPMorgan Chase. The\nFederal Reserve has adopted several rules to\nimplement those heightened prudential standards,\nincluding rules relating to risk management and\ncorporate governance of subject BHCs. JPMorgan\nChase is required under these rules to comply with\nenhanced liquidity and overall risk management\nstandards, including oversight by the board of\ndirectors of risk management activities.\n\nResolution and recovery . The Firm is required to\nmaintain a comprehensive recovery plan, which is\nupdated annually and which summarizes the actions\nthat it would take to remain well-capitalized and\nwell-funded in order to avoid failure in the case\nof an adverse event. In addition, JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. is required to prepare and submit a\nrecovery plan as directed by the OCC. Under the\nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), the Firm is\nrequired to submit periodically to the Federal\nReserve and the FDIC a plan for resolution (a\n\u201cresolution plan\u201d) under the Bankruptcy Code in the\nevent of material distress or failure. Under rules\nadopted by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve, the\nFirm\u2019s resolution plan submissions under the Dodd-\nFrank Act alternate between \u201ctargeted\u201d and \u201cfull\u201d\nplans. The Firm\u2019s most recent \u201cfull\u201d resolution\nplan was filed on June 30, 2023, and the Firm's\nnext \"targeted\" resolution plan is due to be filed\non or before July 1, 2025. JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. is also required to prepare and submit a\nseparate resolution plan pursuant to a separate\nFDIC regulation that requires FDIC-insured\ndepository institutions over a certain asset\nthreshold to prepare a resolution plan to\nfacilitate their resolution by the FDIC under the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Act (the \u201cIDI Resolution\nRule\u201d). JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. most recently\nfiled a resolution plan pursuant to the IDI\nResolution Rule on December 1, 2023.\n\nIn August 2023, the FDIC released a proposal to\nrevise the IDI Resolution Rule. For FDIC-insured\ndepository institutions with $100 billion or more\nin total assets, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,\nthe proposal would revise the content requirements\nfor resolution plan submissions, increase the\nfrequency of resolution plan submissions to every\ntwo years (instead of the current three-year cycle)\nand require the filing of interim supplements in\nnon-submission years. The proposal would also\nenhance how the FDIC assesses the credibility of\nresolution plan submissions, expand the FDIC\u2019s\nexpectations regarding bank engagement with FDIC\nstaff and capabilities testing, and outline\nexpectations regarding the FDIC\u2019s review and\nenforcement of compliance with the IDI Rule.\n\nCertain of the Firm\u2019s non-U.S. subsidiaries and\nbranches are also subject to local resolution and\nrecovery planning requirements.\n\nOrderly liquidation authority . Certain financial\ncompanies, including JPMorgan Chase and certain of\nits subsidiaries, can also be subjected to\nresolution under the \u201corderly liquidation\nauthority\u201d rather than under the Bankruptcy Code.\nIn order to invoke the orderly liquidation\nauthority, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, in\nconsultation with the President of the United\nStates, must first make certain determinations\nconcerning extraordinary financial distress and\nsystemic risk, and action must be recommended by\nthe FDIC and the Federal Reserve. Absent such\nactions, the Firm, as a BHC, would remain subject\nto resolution under the Bankruptcy Code. The FDIC\nhas issued a draft policy statement describing its\n\u201csingle point of entry\u201d strategy for resolution of\nSIFIs under the orderly liquidation authority,\nwhich seeks to keep operating subsidiaries of a BHC\nopen and impose losses on shareholders and\ncreditors of the BHC in receivership according to\ntheir statutory order of priority.\n\nHolding company as a source of strength. JPMorgan\nChase & Co. is required to serve as a source of\nfinancial strength for its depository institution\nsubsidiaries and to commit resources to support\nthose subsidiaries, including when directed to do\nso by the Federal Reserve.\n\nRegulation of acquisitions . Acquisitions by BHCs\nand their banks are subject to requirements,\nlimitations and prohibitions established by law and\nby the Federal Reserve and the OCC. For example,\nFHCs and BHCs are required to obtain the approval\nof the Federal Reserve before they acquire more\nthan 5% of the voting shares of an unaffiliated\nbank. In addition, acquisitions by financial\ncompanies are generally prohibited if, as a result\nof the acquisition, the total liabilities of the\nfinancial company would exceed 10% of the total\nliabilities of all financial companies, as\ndetermined under Federal Reserve regulations.\nFurthermore, for certain acquisitions, the Firm\nmust provide written notice to the Federal Reserve\nprior to acquiring direct or indirect ownership or\ncontrol of any voting shares of any company with\nover $10 billion in assets that is engaged in\nactivities that are \u201cfinancial in nature.\u201d\nMoreover, while FHCs may engage in a broader range\nof activities (including acquisitions) than BHCs,\nthe Federal Reserve has the authority to limit an\nFHC\u2019s ability to conduct otherwise permissible\nacquisitions if the FHC or any of its depository\ninstitution subsidiaries ceases to meet applicable\neligibility requirements.\n\nOngoing obligations . The Firm is subject to a\nDeferred Prosecution Agreement entered into with\nthe Department of Justice on September 29, 2020,\nrelating to precious metals and U.S. Treasuries\nmarkets investigations, as well as a cooperation\nobligation under a related order issued by the\nCFTC.\n\nSubsidiary banks:\n\nThe activities of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the\nFirm\u2019s principal subsidiary bank, are limited to\nthose specifically authorized under the National\nBank Act and related interpretations of the OCC.\nThe OCC has authority to bring an enforcement\naction against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\n     \n  5  \n     \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                                                  \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\nfor unsafe or unsound banking practices, which\ncould include limiting JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s\nability to conduct otherwise permissible\nactivities, or imposing corrective capital or\nmanagerial requirements on the bank.\n\nFDIC deposit insurance. The FDIC deposit insurance\nfund provides insurance coverage for certain\ndeposits and is funded through assessments on\nbanks, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The FDIC\nis required to maintain a minimum reserve ratio,\nwhich measures the balance of reserves in the\ndeposit insurance fund against an estimate of FDIC-\ninsured deposits, of 1.35%. The reserve ratio is\ncurrently below the statutory minimum and, in\nOctober 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule to\nraise bank assessments and accelerate the time by\nwhich the reserve ratio would meet the statutory\nminimum. As a result, the FDIC has adopted a\nrestoration plan to bring the reserve ratio up to\nthe required 1.35% by September 30, 2028, with a\nlonger-term target of maintaining a reserve ratio\nof 2%.\n\nFDIC powers upon a bank insolvency. Upon any\ninsolvency of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the FDIC\ncould be appointed as conservator or receiver under\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The FDIC has\nbroad powers to transfer assets and liabilities\nwithout the approval of the institution\u2019s\ncreditors.\n\nPrompt corrective action. The Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991\nrequires the relevant federal banking regulator to\ntake \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d with respect to a\ndepository institution if that institution does not\nmeet certain capital adequacy standards. The\nFederal Reserve is also authorized to take\nappropriate action against the parent BHC, such as\nJPMorgan Chase & Co., based on the undercapitalized\nstatus of any bank subsidiary. In certain\ninstances, the BHC would be required to guarantee\nthe performance of the capital restoration plan for\nits undercapitalized subsidiary.\n\nHeightened Supervisory Standards. In the U.S., the\nOCC has established guidelines setting forth\nheightened standards for large banks, including\nminimum standards for the design and implementation\nof a risk governance framework for banks. Under\nthese standards, a bank\u2019s risk governance framework\nmust ensure that the bank\u2019s risk profile is easily\ndistinguished and separate from that of its parent\nBHC for risk management purposes.

JPMorgan Chase must comply\nwith the laws, rules and regulations that apply to\nits operations in all of the jurisdictions around\nthe world in which it does business, and financial\nservices firms such as JPMorgan Chase are subject\nto extensive and constantly-evolving regulation and\nsupervision.\n\nThe regulation and supervision of JPMorgan Chase\nsignificantly affects the way that it conducts its\nbusiness and structures its operations, and\nJPMorgan Chase could be required to make changes to\nits business and operations in response to\nsupervisory expectations or decisions or to new or\nchanged laws, rules and regulations. These types of\ndevelopments could result in JPMorgan Chase\nincurring additional costs or experiencing a\nreduction in revenues to comply with applicable\nlaws, rules and regulations, which could reduce its\nprofitability. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s entry\ninto or acquisition of a new business or an\nincrease in its principal investments may require\nJPMorgan Chase to comply with additional laws,\nrules, and regulations.\n\nIn response to new and existing laws, rules and\nregulations and expanded supervision, JPMorgan\nChase has in the past been and could in the future\nbe, required to:\n\n\u2022 limit the products and services that it offers\n\n\u2022 reduce the liquidity that it can provide through\nits market-making activities\n\n\u2022 refrain from engaging in business opportunities\nthat it might otherwise pursue\n\n\u2022 pay higher taxes (including as part of any\nminimum global tax regime), assessments, levies or\nother governmental charges, including in connection\nwith the resolution of tax examinations\n\n\u2022 incur losses, including with respect to\nfraudulent transactions perpetrated against its\ncustomers\n\n\u2022 dispose of certain assets, and do so at times or\nprices that are disadvantageous\n\n\u2022 impose restrictions on certain business\nactivities, or\n\n\u2022 increase the prices that it charges for products\nand services, which could reduce the demand for\nthem.\n\nAny failure by JPMorgan Chase to comply with the\nlaws, rules and regulations to which it is subject\ncould result in:\n\n\u2022 increased regulatory and supervisory scrutiny\n\n\u2022 regulatory and governmental enforcement actions\n\n\u2022 the imposition of fines, penalties or other\nsanctions\n\n\u2022 increased exposure to litigation, or\n\n\u2022 harm to its reputation.\n\nDifferences and inconsistencies in financial\nservices regulation and supervision can negatively\nimpact JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses, operations and\nfinancial results.\n\nThe content and application of laws, rules and\nregulations affecting financial services firms can\nvary according to factors such as the size of the\nfirm, the jurisdiction in which it is organized or\noperates, and other criteria. For example:\n\n\u2022 larger firms such as JPMorgan Chase are often\nsubject to more stringent supervision, regulation\nand regulatory scrutiny\n\n\u2022 financial technology companies and other non-\ntraditional competitors may not be subject to\nbanking regulation, or may be supervised by a\nnational or state regulatory agency that does not\nhave the same resources or regulatory priorities as\nthe regulatory agencies which supervise more\ndiversified financial services firms, or\n\n\u2022 the financial services regulatory and supervisory\nframework in a particular jurisdiction may favor\nfinancial institutions that are based in that\njurisdiction.\n\nThese types of differences in the regulatory and\nsupervisory framework can result in JPMorgan Chase\nlosing market share to competitors that are less\nregulated or not subject to regulation, especially\nwith respect to unregulated financial products.\n      \n  10  \n      \nThere can also be significant differences in the\nways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting\nthe financial services industry are implemented in\nthe U.S. and in other countries and regions in\nwhich JPMorgan Chase does business. For example,\nwhen adopting rules that are intended to implement\na global regulatory or supervisory standard, a\nnational regulator may introduce additional or more\nrestrictive requirements, which can create\ncompetitive disadvantages for financial services\nfirms, such as JPMorgan Chase, that may be subject\nto those enhanced regulations.\n\nIn addition, certain national and multi-national\nbodies and governmental agencies outside the U.S.\nhave adopted laws, rules or regulations that may\nconflict with or prohibit JPMorgan Chase from\ncomplying with laws, rules and regulations to which\nit is otherwise subject, creating conflict of law\nissues that also increase its risk of non-\ncompliance in those jurisdictions.\n\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives outside the\nU.S. could require JPMorgan Chase to make\nsignificant modifications to its operations and\nlegal entity structure in the relevant countries or\nregions in order to comply with those requirements.\nThese include laws, rules and regulations that have\nbeen adopted or proposed, as well as regulatory\nexpectations, relating to:\n\n\u2022 the establishment of locally-based intermediate\nholding companies or operating subsidiaries\n\n\u2022 requirements to maintain minimum amounts of\ncapital or liquidity in locally-based subsidiaries\n\n\u2022 the implementation of processes within locally-\nbased subsidiaries to comply with local regulatory\nrequirements or expectations\n\n\u2022 the separation (or \u201cring fencing\u201d) of core\nbanking products and services from markets\nactivities\n\n\u2022 requirements for the orderly resolution of\nfinancial institutions\n\n\u2022 requirements for executing or settling\ntransactions on exchanges or through central\ncounterparties (\u201cCCPs\u201d), or for depositing funds\nwith other financial institutions or clearing and\nsettlement systems\n\n\u2022 position limits and reporting rules for\nderivatives\n\n\u2022 governance and accountability regimes\n\n\u2022 conduct of business and control requirements, and\n\n\u2022 restrictions on compensation.\n\nThese types of differences, inconsistencies and\nconflicts in financial services regulation have\nrequired and could in the future require JPMorgan\nChase to:\n\n\u2022 divest assets or restructure its operations\n\n\u2022 maintain higher levels of capital and liquidity,\nor absorb increased capital and liquidity costs\n\n\u2022 incur higher operational and compliance costs\n\n\u2022 change the prices that it charges for its\nproducts and services\n\n\u2022 curtail the products and services that it offers\nto its customers and clients\n\n\u2022 curtail other business opportunities, including\nacquisitions or principal investments, that it\notherwise would have pursued\n\n\u2022 become subject to regulatory fines, penalties or\nother sanctions, or\n\n\u2022 incur higher costs for complying with different\nlegal and regulatory frameworks.\n\nAny or all of these factors could harm JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s ability to compete against other firms that\nare not subject to the same laws, rules and\nregulations or supervisory oversight, or harm\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses, results of operations\nand profitability.\n\nResolving regulatory investigations can subject\nJPMorgan Chase to significant penalties and\ncollateral consequences, and could result in higher\ncompliance costs or restrictions on its operations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase is subject to heightened oversight\nand scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many\njurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase has paid significant\nfines, provided other monetary relief, incurred\nother penalties and experienced other repercussions\nin connection with resolving investigations and\nenforcement actions by governmental agencies.\nJPMorgan Chase could become subject to similar\nregulatory or governmental resolutions or other\nactions in the future, and addressing the\nrequirements of any such resolutions or actions\ncould result in JPMorgan Chase incurring higher\noperational and compliance costs, including\ndevoting substantial resources to the required\nremediation or needing to comply with other\nrestrictions.\n\nIn connection with resolving specific regulatory\ninvestigations or enforcement actions, certain\nregulators have required JPMorgan Chase and other\nfinancial institutions to admit wrongdoing with\nrespect to the activities that gave rise to the\nresolution. These types of admissions can lead to:\n\n\u2022 greater exposure in litigation\n\n\u2022 damage to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation\n\n\u2022 disqualification from doing business with certain\nclients or customers, or in specific jurisdictions,\nor\n\n\u2022 other direct and indirect adverse effects.\n\nFurthermore, government officials in the U.S. and\nother countries have demonstrated a willingness to\nbring criminal actions against financial\ninstitutions and have required that institutions\nplead guilty to criminal offenses or admit other\nwrongdoing in connection with resolving regulatory\ninvestigations or enforcement actions. Resolutions\nof this type can have significant collateral\nconsequences for the subject financial institution,\nincluding:\n      \n  11  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                                                  \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\n\u2022 loss of clients, customers and business\n\n\u2022 restrictions on offering certain products or\nservices, and\n\n\u2022 losing permission to operate certain businesses,\neither temporarily or permanently.\n\nJPMorgan Chase expects that:\n\n\u2022 it and other financial services firms will\ncontinue to be subject to heightened regulatory\nscrutiny and governmental investigations and\nenforcement actions\n\n\u2022 governmental authorities will continue to require\nthat financial institutions be penalized for actual\nor deemed violations of law with formal and\npunitive enforcement actions, including the\nimposition of significant monetary and other\nsanctions, rather than resolving these matters\nthrough informal supervisory actions; and\n\n\u2022 governmental authorities will be more likely to\npursue formal enforcement actions and resolutions\nagainst JPMorgan Chase to the extent that it has\npreviously been subject to other governmental\ninvestigations or enforcement actions.\n\nIf JPMorgan Chase fails to meet the requirements of\nany resolution of a governmental investigation or\nenforcement action, or to maintain risk and control\nprocesses that meet the heightened standards and\nexpectations of its regulators, it could be\nrequired to, among other things:\n\n\u2022 enter into further resolutions of investigations\nor enforcement actions\n\n\u2022 pay additional regulatory penalties or enter into\njudgments, or\n\n\u2022 accept material regulatory restrictions on, or\nchanges in the management of, its businesses.\n\nIn these circumstances, JPMorgan Chase could also\nbecome subject to other sanctions, or to\nprosecution or civil litigation with respect to the\nconduct that gave rise to an investigation or\nenforcement action. In addition, JPMorgan Chase can\nbe subject to higher costs or requests for\nadditional capital in connection with the\nresolution of governmental investigations and\nenforcement actions involving newly-acquired\nbusinesses, companies in which JPMorgan Chase has\nmade principal investments, parties to joint\nventures with JPMorgan Chase, and vendors with\nwhich JPMorgan Chase does business.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations and financial results\ncan be negatively impacted in jurisdictions with\nless predictable legal and regulatory frameworks .\n\nJPMorgan Chase conducts existing and new business\nin certain countries, states, municipalities,\nterritories and other jurisdictions in which the\napplication of the rule of law is inconsistent or\nless predictable, including with respect to:\n\n\u2022 the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or\nguidance for engaging in specific types of business\nor transactions\n\n\u2022 conflicting or ambiguous laws, rules and\nregulations, or the inconsistent application or\ninterpretation of existing laws, rules and\nregulations\n\n\u2022 uncertainty concerning the enforceability of\nintellectual property rights or contractual or\nother obligations\n\n\u2022 difficulty in competing in economies in which the\ngovernment controls or protects all or a portion of\nthe local economy or specific businesses, or where\ngraft or corruption may be pervasive\n\n\u2022 the threat of regulatory investigations, civil\nlitigations or criminal prosecutions that are\narbitrary or otherwise contrary to established\nlegal principles in other parts of the world, and\n\n\u2022 the termination of licenses required to operate\nin the local market or the suspension of business\nrelationships with governmental bodies.\n\nIf the application of the laws, rules and\nregulations in any jurisdiction is susceptible to\nproducing inconsistent or unexpected outcomes, this\ncan create a more difficult environment in which\nJPMorgan Chase conducts its business and could\nnegatively affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations and\nreduce its earnings with respect to that\njurisdiction. For example, conducting business\ncould require JPMorgan Chase to devote significant\nadditional resources to understanding, and\nmonitoring changes in, local laws, rules and\nregulations, as well as structuring its operations\nto comply with local laws, rules and regulations\nand implementing and administering related internal\npolicies and procedures.\n\nThere can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase will\nalways be successful in its efforts to fully\nunderstand and to conduct its business in\ncompliance with the laws, rules and regulations of\nall of the jurisdictions in which it operates, and\nthe risk of non-compliance can be greater in\njurisdictions that have less predictable legal and\nregulatory frameworks.\n\nRequirements for the orderly resolution of JPMorgan\nChase could result in JPMorgan Chase having to\nrestructure or reorganize its businesses and could\nincrease its funding or operational costs or\ncurtail its businesses.\n\nJPMorgan Chase is required under Federal Reserve\nand FDIC rules to prepare and submit periodically\nto those agencies a detailed plan for rapid and\norderly resolution in bankruptcy, without\nextraordinary government support, in the event of\nmaterial financial distress or failure. The\nevaluation of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s resolution plan by\nthese agencies may change, and the requirements for\nresolution plans may be modified from time to time.\nAny such determinations or modifications could\nresult in JPMorgan Chase needing to make changes to\nits legal entity structure or to certain internal\nor external activities, which could increase its\nfunding or operational costs, or hamper its ability\nto serve clients and customers.\n      \n  12  \n      \nIf the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were both to\ndetermine that a resolution plan submitted by\nJPMorgan Chase has deficiencies, they could jointly\nimpose more stringent capital, leverage or\nliquidity requirements or restrictions on JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s growth, activities or operations. The\nagencies could also require that JPMorgan Chase\nrestructure, reorganize or divest assets or\nbusinesses in ways that could materially and\nadversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations and\nstrategy.\n\nHolders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s debt and equity\nsecurities will absorb losses if it were to enter\ninto a resolution.\n\nFederal Reserve rules require that JPMorgan Chase &\nCo. (the \u201cParent Company\u201d) maintain minimum levels\nof unsecured external long-term debt and other\nloss-absorbing capacity with specific terms\n(\u201celigible LTD\u201d) for purposes of recapitalizing\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operating subsidiaries if the\nParent Company were to enter into a resolution\neither:\n\n\u2022 in a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of\nthe U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or\n\n\u2022 in a receivership administered by the FDIC under\nTitle II of the Dodd-Frank Act (\u201cTitle II\u201d).\n\nIf the Parent Company were to enter into a\nresolution, holders of eligible LTD and other debt\nand equity securities of the Parent Company will\nabsorb the losses of the Parent Company and its\nsubsidiaries.\n\nThe preferred \u201csingle point of entry\u201d strategy\nunder JPMorgan Chase\u2019s resolution plan contemplates\nthat only the Parent Company would enter bankruptcy\nproceedings. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s subsidiaries would be\nrecapitalized, as needed, so that they could\ncontinue normal operations or subsequently be\ndivested or wound down in an orderly manner. As a\nresult, the Parent Company\u2019s losses and any losses\nincurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first\non holders of the Parent Company\u2019s equity\nsecurities and thereafter on its unsecured\ncreditors, including holders of eligible LTD and\nother debt securities. Claims of holders of those\nsecurities would have a junior position to the\nclaims of creditors of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nsubsidiaries and to the claims of priority (as\ndetermined by statute) and secured creditors of the\nParent Company.\n\nAccordingly, in a resolution of the Parent Company\nin bankruptcy, holders of eligible LTD and other\ndebt securities of the Parent Company would realize\nvalue only to the extent available to the Parent\nCompany as a shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. and its other subsidiaries, and only after any\nclaims of priority and secured creditors of the\nParent Company have been fully repaid.\n\nThe FDIC has similarly indicated that a single\npoint of entry recapitalization model could be a\ndesirable strategy to resolve a systemically\nimportant financial institution, such as the Parent\nCompany, under Title II. However, the FDIC\n\nhas not formally adopted a single point of entry\nresolution strategy.\n\nIf the Parent Company were to approach, or enter\ninto, a resolution, none of the Parent Company, the\nFederal Reserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s preferred resolution strategy, and\nlosses to holders of eligible LTD and other debt\nand equity securities of the Parent Company, under\nwhatever strategy is ultimately followed, could be\ngreater than they might have been under JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s preferred strategy.\n                                                                                                            \n  Political                                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \nEconomic uncertainty or instability caused by\npolitical or geopolitical developments can\nnegatively impact JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses.\n\nPolitical developments in the U.S. and other\ncountries can cause uncertainty in the economic\nenvironment and market conditions in which JPMorgan\nChase operates its businesses. Certain governmental\npolicy initiatives, as well as heightened\ngeopolitical tensions, could significantly affect\nU.S. and global economic growth and cause higher\nvolatility in the financial markets, including:\n\n\u2022 an outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or\nother geopolitical instabilities\n\n\u2022 monetary policies and actions taken by the\nFederal Reserve and other central banks or\ngovernmental authorities, including any sustained\nlarge-scale asset purchases or any suspension or\nreversal of those actions\n\n\u2022 fiscal policies, including with respect to\ntaxation and spending\n\n\u2022 actions that governments take or fail to take in\nresponse to the effects of health emergencies, the\nspread of infectious diseases, epidemics or\npandemics, as well as the effectiveness of any\nactions taken\n\n\u2022 governmental actions or initiatives relating to\nclimate risk, or more generally, the impact of\nbusiness activities on environmental, social and\ngovernance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters, and the management of\nclimate and other ESG-related risks\n\n\u2022 isolationist foreign policies\n\n\u2022 economic or financial sanctions\n\n\u2022 the implementation of tariffs and other\nprotectionist trade policies, or\n\n\u2022 other governmental policies or actions adopted or\ntaken in response to political or social pressures.\n\nThese types of political developments, and\nuncertainty about the possible outcomes of these\ndevelopments, could:\n\n\u2022 erode investor confidence in the U.S. economy and\nfinancial markets, which could potentially\nundermine the status of the U.S. dollar as a safe\nhaven currency\n      \n  13  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7

or\n\n\u2022 cause JPMorgan Chase to refrain from engaging in\nbusiness opportunities that it might otherwise\npursue.\n\nThese factors could lead to:\n\n\u2022 slower growth rates, rising inflation or\nrecession\n\n\u2022 greater market volatility\n\n\u2022 a contraction of available credit and the\nwidening of credit spreads\n\n\u2022 erosion of adequate risk premium on certain\nfinancial

of\nassets, including client assets, or\n\n\u2022 other market dislocations, including unfavorable\neconomic conditions that could spread from a\nparticular country or region to other countries or\nregions.\n\nAny of these potential outcomes could cause\nJPMorgan Chase to suffer losses on its market-\nmaking positions or in its investment portfolio,\nreduce its liquidity and capital levels, increase\nthe allowance for credit losses or lead to higher\nnet charge-offs, hamper its ability to deliver\n\nproducts and services to its clients and customers,\nand weaken its results of operations and financial\ncondition or credit rating.\n\nJPMorgan Chase's business and results of operations\nmay also be adversely affected by actions or\ninitiatives by national, state or local\ngovernmental authorities that:\n\n\u2022 seek to discourage financial institutions from\ndoing business with companies engaged in certain\nindustries, or conversely, to penalize financial\ninstitutions that elect not to do business with\nsuch companies, or\n\n\u2022 mandate specific business practices that\ncompanies operating in the relevant jurisdiction\nmust adopt.\n\nBecause governmental policies in one jurisdiction\nmay differ or conflict with those in other\njurisdictions, JPMorgan Chase may face negative\nconsequences regardless of the course of action it\ntakes or elects not to take, including:\n\n\u2022 restrictions or prohibitions on doing business\nwithin a particular jurisdiction, or with\ngovernmental entities in a jurisdiction\n\n\u2022 the threat of enforcement actions, including\nunder antitrust or other anti-competition laws,\nrules and regulations, and\n\n\u2022 harm to its reputation arising from public\ncriticism, including from politicians, activists\nand other stakeholders.\n\nJPMorgan Chase has been prohibited from engaging in\ncertain business activities in specific\njurisdictions as a result of these types of\ngovernmental actions, and there is no assurance\nthat it will not face similar restrictions on its\nbusiness and operations in the future.\n\nIn addition, JPMorgan Chase's relationships or\nability to transact with clients and customers, and\nwith governmental or regulatory bodies in\njurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase does\nbusiness, could be adversely affected if its\ndecisions with respect to doing business with\ncompanies in certain sensitive industries are\nperceived to harm those companies or to align with\nparticular political viewpoints. Furthermore,\nJPMorgan Chase's participation in or association\nwith certain environmental and social industry\ngroups or initiatives could be viewed by activists\nor governmental authorities as boycotting or other\ndiscriminatory business behavior.\n                                                                                                            \n  Market                                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nEconomic and market events and conditions can\nmaterially affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses and\ninvestment and market-making positions.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s results of operations can be\nnegatively affected by adverse changes in any of\nthe following:\n\n\u2022 investor, consumer and business sentiment\n\n\u2022 events that reduce confidence in the financial\nmarkets\n\n\u2022 inflation, deflation or recession\n      \n  14  \n      \n\u2022 high unemployment or, conversely, a tightening\nlabor market\n\n\u2022 the availability and cost of capital, liquidity\nand credit\n\n\u2022 levels and volatility of interest rates, credit\nspreads and market prices for currencies, equities\nand commodities, as well as the duration of any\nsuch changes\n\n\u2022 the economic effects of an outbreak or escalation\nof hostilities, terrorism or other geopolitical\ninstabilities, cyber attacks, climate change,\nnatural disasters, severe weather conditions,\nhealth emergencies, the spread of infectious\ndiseases, epidemics or pandemics or other\nextraordinary events beyond JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\ncontrol, and\n\n\u2022 the strength of the U.S. and global economies.\n\nAll of these are affected by global economic,\nmarket and political events and conditions, as well\nas regulatory restrictions.\n\nIn addition, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s investment portfolio\nand market-making businesses can suffer losses due\nto unanticipated market events, including:\n\n\u2022 severe declines in asset values\n\n\u2022 unexpected credit events\n\n\u2022 unforeseen events or conditions that may cause\npreviously uncorrelated factors to become\ncorrelated (and vice versa)\n\n\u2022 the inability to effectively hedge risks related\nto market-making and investment portfolio\npositions, or\n\n\u2022 other market risks that may not have been\nappropriately taken into account in the\ndevelopment, structuring or pricing of a financial\ninstrument.\n\nIf JPMorgan Chase experiences significant losses in\nits investment portfolio or from market-making\nactivities, this could reduce JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nprofitability and its liquidity and capital levels,\nand thereby constrain the growth of its businesses.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer businesses can be\nnegatively affected by adverse economic conditions\nand governmental policies.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer businesses are\nparticularly affected by U.S. and global economic\nconditions, including:\n\n\u2022 personal and household income distribution\n\n\u2022 unemployment or underemployment\n\n\u2022 prolonged periods of exceptionally high or low\ninterest rates\n\n\u2022 changes in the value of collateral such as\nresidential real estate and vehicles\n\n\u2022 changes in housing prices\n\n\u2022 the level of inflation and its effect on prices\nfor goods and services\n\n\u2022 consumer and small business confidence levels,\nand\n\n\u2022 changes in consumer spending or in the level of\nconsumer debt.\n\nHeightened levels of unemployment or\nunderemployment that result in reduced personal and\nhousehold income could negatively affect consumer\ncredit performance to the extent that consumers are\nless able to service their debts. In addition,\nsustained low growth, low or negative interest\nrates, inflationary pressures or recessionary\nconditions could diminish customer demand for the\nproducts and services offered by JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nconsumer businesses.\n\nAdverse economic conditions could also lead to an\nincrease in delinquencies, additions to the\nallowance for credit losses and higher net charge-\noffs, which can reduce JPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings.\nThese consequences could be significantly worse in\ncertain geographies, including where declining\nindustrial or manufacturing activity has resulted\nin or could result in higher levels of\nunemployment, or where high levels of consumer\ndebt, such as outstanding student loans, could\nimpair the ability of customers to pay their other\nconsumer loan obligations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings from its consumer\nbusinesses could also be adversely affected by\ngovernmental policies and actions that affect\nconsumers, including:\n\n\u2022 policies and initiatives relating to medical\ninsurance, education, immigration, employment\nstatus and housing\n\n\u2022 laws, rules and regulations relating specifically\nto the financial services industry, such as\nlimitations on late payment, overdraft and\ninterchange fees, and\n\n\u2022 policies aimed at the economy more broadly, such\nas higher taxes and increased regulation which\ncould result in reductions in consumer disposable\nincome.\n\nUnfavorable market and economic conditions can have\nan adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s wholesale\nbusinesses.\n\nIn JPMorgan Chase\u2019s wholesale businesses, market\nand economic factors can affect the volume of\ntransactions that JPMorgan Chase executes for its\nclients or for which it advises clients, and,\ntherefore, the revenue that JPMorgan Chase receives\nfrom those transactions. These factors can also\ninfluence the willingness of other financial\ninstitutions and investors to participate in\ncapital markets transactions that JPMorgan Chase\nmanages, such as loan syndications or securities\nunderwriting. Furthermore, if a significant and\nsustained deterioration in market conditions were\nto occur, the profitability of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbusinesses engaged in capital markets activities,\nincluding loan syndication, securities underwriting\nand leveraged lending activities, could be reduced\nto the extent that those businesses:\n\n\u2022 earn less fee revenue due to lower transaction\nvolumes, including when clients are unwilling or\nunable to\n      \n  15  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                                                  \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\nrefinance their outstanding debt obligations in\nunfavorable market conditions, or\n\n\u2022 dispose of portions of credit commitments at a\nloss, or hold larger residual positions in credit\ncommitments that cannot be sold at favorable\nprices.\n\nThe fees that JPMorgan Chase earns from managing\nclient assets or holding assets under custody for\nclients could be diminished by declining asset\nvalues or other adverse macroeconomic conditions.\nFor example, higher interest rates or a downturn in\nfinancial markets could affect the valuation of\nclient assets that JPMorgan Chase manages or holds\nunder custody, which, in turn, could affect\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s revenue from fees that are based\non the amount of assets under management or\ncustody. Similarly, adverse macroeconomic or market\nconditions could prompt outflows from JPMorgan\nChase funds or accounts, or cause clients to invest\nin products that generate lower revenue.\nSubstantial and unexpected withdrawals from a\nJPMorgan Chase fund can also hamper the investment\nperformance of the fund, particularly if the\noutflows create the need for the fund to dispose of\nfund assets at disadvantageous times or prices, and\ncould lead to further withdrawals based on the\nweaker investment performance.\n\nAn adverse change in market conditions in\nparticular segments of the economy, such as a\nsudden and severe downturn in oil and gas prices or\nan increase in commodity prices, severe declines in\ncommercial real estate values, or sustained changes\nin consumer behavior that affect specific economic\nsectors, could have a material adverse effect on\nclients of JPMorgan Chase whose operations or\nfinancial condition are directly or indirectly\ndependent on the health or stability of those\nmarket segments or economic sectors, as well as\nclients that are engaged in related businesses.\nJPMorgan Chase could incur credit losses on its\nloans and other commitments to clients that operate\nin, or are dependent on, any sector of the economy\nthat is or comes under stress.\n\nAn economic downturn or sustained changes in\nconsumer behavior that results in shifts in\nconsumer and business spending could also have a\nnegative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nwholesale clients, and thereby diminish JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s earnings from its wholesale operations. For\nexample, the businesses of certain of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s wholesale clients are dependent on\nconsistent streams of rental income from commercial\nreal estate properties, including offices, which\nare owned or being built by those clients.\nSustained adverse economic conditions or hybrid\nwork models could result in reductions in the\nrental cash flows that owners or developers receive\nfrom their tenants which, in turn, could depress\nthe values of the properties, impair the ability of\nborrowers to service or refinance their commercial\nreal estate loans and lead to an increase in\nforeclosures. These consequences could result in\nJPMorgan Chase experiencing increases in the\nallowance for credit losses, higher delinquencies,\ndefaults and charge-offs within its commercial real\nestate loan portfolio and\n\nincurring higher costs for servicing a larger\nvolume of delinquent loans in that portfolio. An\nincrease in foreclosures could result in higher\noperational risk associated with JPMorgan Chase\nowning and managing real property, and any\ninadequacy in governance or control over the\nforeclosed properties could result in regulatory\nscrutiny and reputational harm.\n\nChanges in interest rates and credit spreads can\nadversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings, its\nliquidity or its capital levels.\n\nWhen interest rates are high or increasing,\nJPMorgan Chase can generally be expected to earn\nhigher net interest income. However, higher\ninterest rates can also lead to:\n\n\u2022 fewer originations of commercial and residential\nreal estate loans\n\n\u2022 losses on underwriting exposures or incremental\nclient-specific downgrades, or increases in the\nallowance for credit losses and net charge-offs due\nto higher financing costs for clients\n\n\u2022 the loss of deposits, particularly if customers\nwithdraw deposits because they believe that\ninterest rates offered by JPMorgan Chase are lower\nthan those of competitors or if JPMorgan Chase\nmakes incorrect assumptions about depositor\nbehavior\n\n\u2022 losses on available-for-sale (\u201cAFS\u201d) securities\nheld in the investment securities portfolio\n\n\u2022 lower net interest income if central banks\nintroduce interest rate increases more quickly than\nanticipated and this results in a misalignment in\nthe pricing of short-term and long-term borrowings\n\n\u2022 less liquidity in the financial markets, and\n\n\u2022 higher funding costs.\n\nAll of these outcomes could adversely affect\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings or its liquidity and\ncapital levels, and any negative outcomes could be\nmore severe in a prolonged period of high interest\nrates. Higher interest rates can also negatively\naffect the payment performance on loans within\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer and wholesale loan\nportfolios that are linked to variable interest\nrates. If borrowers of variable rate loans are\nunable to afford higher interest payments, those\nborrowers may reduce or stop making payments,\nthereby causing JPMorgan Chase to incur losses and\nincreased operational costs related to servicing a\nhigher volume of delinquent loans.\n\nOn the other hand, a low or negative interest rate\nenvironment may cause:\n\n\u2022 net interest margins to be compressed, which\ncould reduce the amounts that JPMorgan Chase earns\non its investment securities portfolio to the\nextent that it is unable to reinvest\ncontemporaneously in higher-yielding instruments\n      \n  16  \n      \n\u2022 unanticipated or adverse changes in depositor\nbehavior, which could negatively affect JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s broader asset and liability management\nstrategy, and\n\n\u2022 a reduction in the value of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nmortgage servicing rights (\u201cMSRs\u201d) asset,\ndecreasing revenues.\n\nWhen credit spreads widen, it becomes more\nexpensive for JPMorgan Chase to borrow. JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s credit spreads may widen or narrow not only\nin response to events and circumstances that are\nspecific to JPMorgan Chase but also as a result of\ngeneral economic and geopolitical events and\nconditions. Changes in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit\nspreads will affect, positively or negatively,\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings on certain liabilities,\nsuch as derivatives, that are recorded at fair\nvalue.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s results may be materially affected\nby market fluctuations and significant changes in\nthe value of financial instruments.\n\nThe value of securities, derivatives and other\nfinancial instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or\nin which it makes markets can be materially\naffected by market fluctuations. Market volatility,\nilliquid market conditions and other disruptions in\nthe financial markets may make it extremely\ndifficult to value certain financial instruments.\nSubsequent valuations of financial instruments in\nfuture periods, in light of factors then\nprevailing, may result in significant changes in\nthe value of these instruments. In addition, at the\ntime of any disposition of these financial\ninstruments, the price that JPMorgan Chase\nultimately realizes will depend on the demand and\nliquidity in the market at that time and may be\nmaterially lower than their current fair value. Any\nof these factors could cause a decline in the value\nof financial instruments that JPMorgan Chase owns\nor in which it makes markets, which may have an\nadverse effect on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s results of\noperations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s risk management and monitoring\nprocesses, including its stress testing framework,\nseek to quantify and manage JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nexposure to more extreme market moves. However,\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s hedging and other risk management\nstrategies may not be effective, and it could incur\nsignificant losses, if extreme market events were\nto occur.\n                                                                                                            \n  Credit                                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nJPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected by\nadverse changes in the financial condition of\nclients, counterparties, custodians and CCPs.\n\nJPMorgan Chase routinely executes transactions with\nclients and counterparties such as corporations,\nfinancial institutions, asset managers, hedge\nfunds, securities exchanges and government entities\nwithin and outside the U.S. Many of these\ntransactions expose JPMorgan Chase to the credit\nrisk of its clients and counterparties, and can\ninvolve JPMorgan Chase in disputes and litigation\nif a client or counterparty defaults. JPMorgan\nChase can also be subject to losses or liability\nwhere a financial institution that\n\nit has appointed to provide custodial services for\nclient assets or funds becomes insolvent as a\nresult of fraud or the failure to abide by existing\nlaws and obligations, or where clients are unable\nto access assets held by JPMorgan Chase as\ncustodian due to governmental actions or other\nfactors.\n\nA default by, or the financial or operational\nfailure of, a CCP through which JPMorgan Chase\nexecutes contracts would require JPMorgan Chase to\nreplace those contracts, thereby increasing its\noperational costs and potentially resulting in\nlosses. In addition, JPMorgan Chase can be exposed\nto losses if a member of a CCP in which JPMorgan\nChase is also a member defaults on its obligations\nto the CCP because of requirements that each member\nof the CCP absorb a portion of those losses.\nFurthermore, JPMorgan Chase can be subject to\nbearing its share of non-default losses incurred by\na CCP, including losses from custodial, settlement\nor investment activities or due to cyber or other\nsecurity breaches.\n\nAs part of its clearing services activities,\nJPMorgan Chase is exposed to the risk of\nnonperformance by its clients, which it seeks to\nmitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate\ncollateral. JPMorgan Chase is also exposed to\nintra-day credit risk of its clients in connection\nwith providing cash management, clearing, custodial\nand other transaction services to those clients. If\na client for which JPMorgan Chase provides these\nservices becomes bankrupt or insolvent, JPMorgan\nChase may incur losses, become involved in disputes\nand litigation with one or more CCPs, the client\u2019s\nbankruptcy estate and other creditors, or be\nsubject to regulatory investigations. All of the\nforegoing events can increase JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\noperational and litigation costs, and JPMorgan\nChase may suffer losses to the extent that any\ncollateral that it has received is insufficient to\ncover those losses.\n\nTransactions with government entities, including\nnational, state, provincial, municipal and local\nauthorities, can expose JPMorgan Chase to enhanced\nsovereign, credit, operational and reputation\nrisks. Government entities may, among other things,\nclaim that actions taken by government officials\nwere beyond the legal authority of those officials\nor repudiate transactions authorized by a previous\nincumbent government. These types of actions have\nin the past caused, and could in the future cause,\nJPMorgan Chase to suffer losses or hamper its\nability to conduct business in the relevant\njurisdiction.\n\nIn addition, local laws, rules and regulations\ncould limit JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to resolve\ndisputes and litigation in the event of a\ncounterparty default or unwillingness to make\npreviously agreed-upon payments, which could\nsubject JPMorgan Chase to losses.\n\nDisputes may arise with counterparties to\nderivatives contracts with regard to the terms, the\nsettlement procedures or the value of underlying\ncollateral. The disposition of those disputes could\ncause JPMorgan Chase to incur unexpected\ntransaction, operational and legal costs, or result\nin credit losses.

JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses could be\nsignificantly disrupted by such an event,\nparticularly if it leads to other market\nparticipants incurring significant losses,\nexperiencing liquidity issues or defaulting, and\nJPMorgan Chase is likely to have significant\ninterrelationships with, and credit exposure to,\nsuch a significant market participant.\n\nJPMorgan Chase may suffer losses if the value of\ncollateral declines in stressed market conditions.\n\nDuring periods of market stress or illiquidity,\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit risk may be further\nincreased when:\n\n\u2022 JPMorgan Chase fails to realize the estimated\nvalue of the collateral it holds\n\n\u2022 collateral is liquidated at prices that are not\nsufficient to recover the full amount owed to it,\nor\n\n\u2022 counterparties are unable to post collateral,\nwhether for operational or other reasons.\n\nFurthermore, disputes with counterparties\nconcerning the valuation of collateral may increase\nin times of significant market stress, volatility\nor illiquidity, and JPMorgan Chase could suffer\nlosses during these periods if it is unable to\nrealize the fair value of collateral or to manage\ndeclines in the value of collateral.\n\nJPMorgan Chase could incur significant losses\narising from concentrations of credit and market\nrisk.\n\nJPMorgan Chase is exposed to greater credit and\nmarket risk to the extent that groupings of its\nclients or counterparties, or obligors on\nsecurities and other financial instruments:\n\n\u2022 engage in similar or related businesses, or in\nbusinesses in related industries\n\n\u2022 do business in the same geographic region, or\n\n\u2022 have business profiles, models or strategies that\ncould cause their ability to meet their obligations\nto be similarly affected by changes in economic\nconditions.\n\nFor example, a significant deterioration in the\ncredit quality of a counterparty, borrower or other\nobligor could lead to concerns about the\ncreditworthiness of other counterparties, borrowers\nor obligors in similar, related or dependent\nindustries. This type of interrelationship could\nexacerbate JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit, liquidity and\nmarket risk exposure and potentially cause it to\nincur losses,\n\nincluding fair value losses in its market-making\nbusinesses and investment portfolios. In addition,\nJPMorgan Chase may be required to increase the\nallowance for credit losses or establish other\nreserves with respect to certain clients,\nindustries or country exposures in order to align\nwith directives or expectations of its banking\nregulators.\n\nSimilarly, challenging economic conditions that\naffect a particular industry or geographic area\ncould lead to concerns about the credit quality of\ncounterparties, borrowers or other obligors not\nonly in that particular industry or geography but\nin related or dependent industries, wherever\nlocated. These conditions could also heighten\nconcerns about the ability of customers of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s consumer businesses who live in those areas\nor work in those affected industries or related or\ndependent industries to meet their obligations to\nJPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors\nvarious segments of its credit and market risk\nexposures to assess the potential risks of\nconcentration or contagion, but its ability to\ndiversify or hedge its exposure against those risks\nmay be limited.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer businesses can also be\nharmed by an excessive expansion of consumer credit\nby bank or non-bank competitors. Heightened\ncompetition for certain types of consumer loans\ncould prompt industry-wide reactions such as\nsignificant reductions in the pricing or margins of\nthose loans or the making of loans to less-\ncreditworthy borrowers. If large numbers of\nconsumers subsequently default on their loans,\nwhether due to weak credit profiles, an economic\ndownturn or other factors, this could impair their\nability to repay obligations owed to JPMorgan Chase\nand result in higher charge-offs and other credit-\nrelated losses. More broadly, widespread defaults\non consumer debt could lead to recessionary\nconditions in the U.S. economy, and JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s consumer businesses may earn lower revenues\nin such an environment.\n\nIf JPMorgan Chase is unable to reduce positions\neffectively during a market dislocation, this can\nincrease both the market and credit risks\nassociated with those positions and the level of\nrisk-weighted-assets (\u201cRWA\u201d) that JPMorgan Chase\nholds on its balance sheet. These factors could\nadversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s capital position,\nfunding costs and the profitability of its\nbusinesses.\n                                                                                                            \n  Liquidity                                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to operate its businesses\ncould be impaired if its liquidity is constrained.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s liquidity can be impacted at any\ngiven time as a result of factors such as:\n\n\u2022 market-wide illiquidity or disruption\n\n\u2022 changes in liquidity or capital requirements\nresulting from changes in laws, rules and\nregulations, including those in response to\neconomic effects of systemic events\n\n\u2022 actions taken by the U.S. government or by the\nFederal Reserve to reduce its balance sheet, which\nmay reduce\n      \n  18  \n      \ndeposits held by JPMorgan Chase and other financial\ninstitutions\n\n\u2022 inability to sell assets, or to sell assets at\nfavorable times or prices\n\n\u2022 default by a CCP or other significant market\nparticipant\n\n\u2022 unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral\n\n\u2022 unexpected loss of deposits or higher than\nanticipated draws on lending-related commitments,\nand\n\n\u2022 lack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan\nChase or financial institutions in general.\n\nA reduction in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s liquidity may be\ncaused by events over which it has little or no\ncontrol. For example, periods of market stress, low\ninvestor confidence and significant market\nilliquidity could result in higher funding costs\nfor JPMorgan Chase and could limit its access to\nsome of its traditional sources of liquidity.\n\nJPMorgan Chase may need to raise funding from\nalternative sources if its access to stable and\nlower-cost sources of funding, such as deposits and\nborrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks, is\nreduced. Alternative sources of funding could be\nmore expensive or limited in availability. JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s funding costs could also be negatively\naffected by actions that JPMorgan Chase may take in\norder to:\n\n\u2022 satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and\nnet stable funding ratio requirements\n\n\u2022 address obligations under its resolution plan, or\n\n\u2022 satisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions\noutside the U.S. relating to the pre-positioning of\nliquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal\nentities.\n\nMore generally, if JPMorgan Chase fails to\neffectively manage its liquidity, this could\nconstrain its ability to fund or invest in its\nbusinesses and subsidiaries, and thereby adversely\naffect its results of operations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company and\ndepends on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to\nmake payments on its outstanding securities.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company that\nholds the stock of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and an\nintermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase\nHoldings LLC (the \u201cIHC\u201d). The IHC in turn generally\nholds the stock of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s subsidiaries\nother than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its\nsubsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and\nprovides intercompany lending to the Parent\nCompany.\n\nThe Parent Company is obligated to contribute to\nthe IHC substantially all the net proceeds received\nfrom securities issuances (including issuances of\nsenior and subordinated debt securities and of\npreferred and common stock).\n\nThe ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the\nIHC to make payments to the Parent Company is also\n\nlimited. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to\nregulatory restrictions on its dividend\ndistributions, as well as capital adequacy\nrequirements, such as the Supplementary Leverage\nRatio (\u201cSLR\u201d), and liquidity requirements and other\nregulatory restrictions on its ability to make\npayments to the Parent Company. The IHC is\nprohibited from paying dividends or extending\ncredit to the Parent Company if certain capital or\nliquidity thresholds are breached, or if limits are\notherwise imposed by the Parent Company\u2019s\nmanagement or Board of Directors.\n\nAs a result of these arrangements, the ability of\nthe Parent Company to make various payments is\ndependent on its receiving dividends from JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. and dividends and borrowings from\nthe IHC.

In addition, as a\nGlobal Systemically Important Bank (\u201cGSIB\u201d),\nJPMorgan Chase is required to hold additional\ncapital buffers, including a GSIB surcharge, a\nStress Capital Buffer (\u201cSCB\u201d), and a\ncountercyclical buffer, each of which is reassessed\nat least annually. The amount of capital that\nJPMorgan Chase is required to hold in order to\nsatisfy these leverage- and risk-based requirements\ncould increase at any given time due to factors\nsuch as:\n\n\u2022 actions by banking regulators, including changes\nin laws, rules, and regulations\n\n\u2022 changes in the composition of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbalance sheet or developments that could increase\nRWA, such as increased market risk, customer\ndelinquencies, client credit rating downgrades or\nother factors, and\n\n\u2022 increases in estimated stress losses as\ndetermined by the Federal Reserve under the\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, which\ncould increase JPMorgan Chase\u2019s SCB.\n\nAny failure by or inability of JPMorgan Chase to\nmaintain the required level and composition of\ncapital, or unfavorable changes in applicable\ncapital requirements, could have an adverse impact\non JPMorgan Chase\u2019s shareholders, such as:\n\n\u2022 reducing the amount of common stock that JPMorgan\nChase is permitted to repurchase\n\n\u2022 requiring the issuance of, or prohibiting the\nredemption of, capital instruments in a manner\ninconsistent with JPMorgan Chase\u2019s capital\nmanagement strategy\n\n\u2022 constraining the amount of dividends that may be\npaid on common stock, or\n\n\u2022 curtailing JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business activities\nor operations.\n\nBanking regulators have released a proposal to\namend the Basel III risk-based capital framework\nwhich could significantly revise the risk-based\ncapital requirements for banks with assets of $100\nbillion or more, including JPMorgan Chase.\nUncertainty remains as to the manner in which these\nrequirements will ultimately apply to JPMorgan\nChase, however it is possible that these\nrequirements could impact JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\ndecisions concerning the business activities in\nwhich it will engage and its levels of capital\ndistributions to its shareholders.\n                                                                                                            \n  Operational                                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses are dependent on the\neffectiveness of internal and external operational\nsystems.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses rely on the ability of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s financial, accounting, transaction\nexecution, data processing and other operational\nsystems to process, record, monitor and report a\nlarge number of transactions on a continuous basis,\nand to do so accurately, quickly and securely. In\naddition to proper design, installation,\nmaintenance and training, the effective functioning\nof JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational systems depends on:\n\n\u2022 the quality of the information contained in those\nsystems, as inaccurate, outdated, incomplete or\ncorrupted data can significantly compromise the\nfunctionality or reliability of a particular system\nand other systems to which it transmits or from\nwhich it receives information, and\n\n\u2022 JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to continue to maintain\nand upgrade its systems on a regular basis in line\nwith technological advancements and evolving\nsecurity requirements, carefully manage any changes\nintroduced to its systems to maintain security and\noperational continuity, and adhere to all\napplicable legal and regulatory requirements,\nparticularly in regions where JPMorgan Chase may\nface a heightened risk of malicious activity.\n\nJPMorgan Chase has experienced and expects that it\nwill continue to experience failures and\ndisruptions in the stability of its operational\nsystems, including degraded performance of data\nprocessing systems, data quality issues,\ndisruptions of network connectivity and\nmalfunctioning software, as well as disruptions in\nits ability to access and use the operational\nsystems of third parties. These incidents have\nresulted in various negative effects for customers,\nincluding the inability to access account\ninformation or to make transactions through ATM,\ninternet or mobile channels, the exfiltration of\ncustomer personal data, the recording of\nduplicative transactions and extended delays for\ncustomers requiring services from call\n      \n  20  \n      \ncenters. There can be no assurance that these and\nother types of operational failures or disruptions\nwill not occur in the future.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to effectively manage the\nstability of its operational systems and\ninfrastructure could be hindered by many factors,\nany of which could have a negative impact on\nJPMorgan Chase and its clients, customers and\ncounterparties, including:\n\n\u2022 JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to effectively maintain\nand upgrade systems and infrastructure can become\nmore challenging as the speed, frequency, volume,\ninterconnectivity and complexity of transactions\ncontinue to increase\n\n\u2022 attempts by third parties to defraud JPMorgan\nChase or its clients and customers are increasing,\nevolving and becoming more complex, and during\nperiods of market disruption or economic\nuncertainty, these attempts can be expected to\nincrease in volume\n\n\u2022 errors made by JPMorgan Chase or another market\nparticipant, whether inadvertent or malicious,\ncould cause widespread system disruption\n\n\u2022 failure to detect weaknesses or shortcomings in\noperational systems in a timely manner\n\n\u2022 isolated or seemingly insignificant errors in\noperational systems could compound, or migrate to\nother systems over time, to become larger issues\n\n\u2022 disruptions in operational systems or in the\nability of systems to communicate with each other\ncould be caused by failures in synchronization or\nencryption software, or degraded performance of\nmicroprocessors, and\n\n\u2022 attempts by third parties to block the use of key\ntechnology solutions by claiming that the use\ninfringes on their intellectual property rights.\n\nJPMorgan Chase also depends on its ability to\naccess and use the operational systems of third\nparties, including its custodians, vendors (such as\nthose that provide data and cloud computing\nservices, and security and technology services) and\nother market participants (such as clearing and\npayment systems, CCPs and securities exchanges),\nand external operational systems with which\nJPMorgan is connected, whether directly or\nindirectly, can be sources of operational risk to\nJPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase may be exposed not\nonly to a systems failure or cyber attack that may\nbe experienced by a vendor or market infrastructure\nwith which JPMorgan Chase is directly connected,\nbut also to a systems breakdown or cyber attack\ninvolving another party to which such a vendor or\ninfrastructure is connected. Similarly, retailers,\npayment systems and processors, data aggregators\nand other external parties with which JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s customers do business can increase JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s operational risk. This is particularly the\ncase where activities of customers or other parties\nare beyond JPMorgan Chase\u2019s security and control\nsystems, including through the use of the internet,\n\ncloud computing services, and personal smart phones\nand other mobile devices or services.\n\nIf an external party obtains access to customer\naccount data on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems, whether\nauthorized or unauthorized, and that party\nmisappropriates that data, this could result in\nnegative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase and its\nclients and customers, including a heightened risk\nof fraudulent transactions using JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nsystems, losses from fraudulent transactions and\nreputational harm arising from the perception that\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems may not be secure.\n\nAs JPMorgan Chase\u2019s interconnectivity with clients,\ncustomers and other external parties continues to\nexpand, JPMorgan Chase increasingly faces the risk\nof operational failure or cyber attacks with\nrespect to the systems of those parties. Security\nbreaches affecting JPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients or\ncustomers, or systems breakdowns or failures,\nsecurity breaches or human error or misconduct\naffecting other external parties, may require\nJPMorgan Chase to take steps to protect the\nintegrity of its own operational systems or to\nsafeguard confidential information, including\nrestricting the access of customers to their\naccounts. These actions can increase JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s operational costs and potentially diminish\ncustomer satisfaction and confidence in JPMorgan\nChase.\n\nFurthermore, the widespread and expanding\ninterconnectivity among financial institutions,\nclearing banks, CCPs, payments processors,\nfinancial technology companies, securities\nexchanges, clearing houses and other financial\nmarket infrastructures increases the risk that the\ndisruption of an operational system involving one\ninstitution or entity, including due to a cyber\nattack, may cause industry-wide operational\ndisruptions that could materially affect JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s ability to conduct business. In addition,\nthe risks associated with the disruption of an\noperational system of a third party could be\nexacerbated to the extent that the services\nprovided by that system are used by a significant\nnumber or proportion of market participants.\n\nThe ineffectiveness, failure or other disruption of\noperational systems upon which JPMorgan Chase\ndepends, including due to a systems malfunction,\ncyber incident or other systems failure, could\nresult in unfavorable ripple effects in the\nfinancial markets and for JPMorgan Chase and its\nclients and customers, including:\n\n\u2022 delays or other disruptions in providing\nservices, including the provision of liquidity or\ninformation to clients and customers\n\n\u2022 impairment of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to execute\ntransactions, including delays or failures in the\nconfirmation or settlement of transactions or in\nobtaining access to funds or other assets required\nfor settlement\n\n\u2022 the possibility that funds transfers, capital\nmarkets trades or other transactions are executed\nerroneously\n      \n  21  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                                                  \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\n\u2022 financial losses, including due to loss-sharing\nrequirements of CCPs, payment systems or other\nmarket infrastructures, or as possible restitution\nto clients and customers\n\n\u2022 higher operational costs associated with\nreplacing services provided by a system that has\nexperienced a failure or other disruption\n\n\u2022 limitations on JPMorgan Chase's ability to\ncollect data needed for its business and operations\n\n\u2022 loss of confidence in the ability of JPMorgan\nChase, or financial institutions generally, to\nprotect against and withstand operational\ndisruptions\n\n\u2022 dissatisfaction among JPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients or\ncustomers\n\n\u2022 significant exposure to litigation and regulatory\nfines, penalties or other sanctions, and\n\n\u2022 harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\n\nIf JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational systems, or those\nof acquired businesses or of external parties on\nwhich JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses depend, are\nunable to meet the requirements of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbusinesses and operations or bank regulatory\nstandards, or if they fail or have other\nsignificant shortcomings, JPMorgan Chase could be\nmaterially and adversely affected.\n\nA successful cyber attack affecting JPMorgan Chase\ncould cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase and\nits clients and customers.\n\nJPMorgan Chase experiences numerous cyber attacks\non its computer systems, software, networks and\nother technology assets on a daily basis from\nvarious actors, including groups acting on behalf\nof hostile countries, cyber-criminals,\n\u201chacktivists\u201d (i.e., individuals or groups that use\ntechnology to promote a political agenda or social\nchange) and others.

Any such breach could result in serious\nand harmful consequences for JPMorgan Chase or its\nclients and customers.\n\nA principal reason that JPMorgan Chase cannot\nprovide absolute security against cyber attacks is\nthat it may not always be possible to anticipate,\ndetect or recognize threats to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nsystems, or to implement effective preventive\nmeasures against all breaches because:\n\n\u2022 the techniques used in cyber attacks evolve\nfrequently and are increasingly sophisticated, and\ntherefore may not be recognized until launched or\nmay go undetected for extended periods\n\n\u2022 cyber attacks can originate from a wide variety\nof sources, including JPMorgan Chase\u2019s own\nemployees, cyber-criminals, hacktivists, well-\nresourced groups linked to terrorist organizations\nor hostile nation-states that can sustain malicious\nactivities for extended periods, or third parties\nwhose objective is to disrupt the operations of\nfinancial institutions more generally\n\n\u2022 JPMorgan Chase does not have control over the\ncybersecurity of the systems of the large number of\nclients, customers, counterparties and third-party\nservice providers with which it does business, and\n\n\u2022 it is possible that a third party, after\nestablishing a foothold on an internal network\nwithout being detected, may gain access to other\nnetworks and systems.\n\nThe risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack\ncould increase in the future due to factors such\nas:\n\n\u2022 JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ongoing expansion of its mobile\nbanking and other internet-based product offerings\nand its internal use of internet-based products and\napplications, including those that use cloud\ncomputing services\n\n\u2022 advances in artificial intelligence, such as the\nuse of machine learning and generative artificial\nintelligence by malicious actors to develop more\nadvanced social engineering attacks, including\ntargeted phishing attacks\n\n\u2022 the inability to maintain the security of\ninformation transmitted by JPMorgan Chase due to\nadvances in quantum computing that may counteract\nor nullify existing information protections, and\n\n\u2022 the acquisition and integration of new\nbusinesses.\n      \n  22  \n      \nIn addition, a third party could misappropriate\nconfidential information obtained by intercepting\nsignals or communications from mobile devices used\nby JPMorgan Chase\u2019s employees.\n\nThe dynamic nature of the cyber threat landscape\nnecessitates continuous enhancement and adaptation\nof cybersecurity controls. Failure to discover or\naddress known vulnerabilities or shortcomings in\ncybersecurity controls, or to prioritize or\ncomplete enhancements to address them, in each case\nin a timely manner, may leave JPMorgan Chase\nvulnerable to cyber attacks, potentially resulting\nin data breaches, financial losses, reputational\ndamage and regulatory penalties, including the\nfailure to prioritize or complete enhancements\nrelating to:\n\n\u2022 preventing unauthorized access and protecting\nagainst the misuse of access, including the\nmaintenance and enhancement of controls related to\nsecure software development practices and identity\nand access management, such as those relating to\nthe management of administrative access to systems\n\n\u2022 detecting, escalating and addressing effectively\nand in a timely manner any vulnerabilities that may\nbe present either in internally-developed software\nor externally-provided software or services,\nincluding vulnerabilities that could allow\nattackers to exploit unknown security flaws in\nsoftware and hardware (\u201czero-day vulnerabilities\u201d)\n\n\u2022 enhancing early detection of attacks against\nthird-party vendors, including attacks targeting\nvulnerabilities in third-party open-source\nsoftware, in support of the secure development and\nmaintenance of internal systems\n\n\u2022 maintaining and enhancing controls related to\ntechnology asset management and inventory systems\nto prevent the risk of undetected vulnerabilities\nthat could undermine JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to\noperate an effective control process\n\n\u2022 upgrading the coverage and capabilities of\nsystems and controls to protect JPMorgan Chase and\nits clients and customers from the impact of\ndistributed denial-of-service attacks, or to\nrecover from outages that could be caused by a\nmalware or ransomware attack\n\n\u2022 strengthening network security and management of\noutbound connections to reduce the risk of data\nloss\n\n\u2022 identifying, assessing and mitigating insider\nthreat activities that could lead to the misuse of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems or client and customer\ninformation, and\n\n\u2022 integrating acquired businesses where system\nintegration may be complex or may require extensive\nand lengthy remediation or enhancement of controls.\n\nA successful penetration or circumvention of the\nsecurity of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems or the systems\nof a vendor, governmental body or another market\nparticipant could cause serious negative\nconsequences, including:\n\n\u2022 significant disruption of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\noperations and those of its clients, customers and\ncounterparties, including losing access to\noperational systems\n\n\u2022 misappropriation of confidential information of\nJPMorgan Chase or that of its clients, customers,\ncounterparties, employees or regulators\n\n\u2022 disruption of or damage to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nsystems and those of its clients, customers and\ncounterparties\n\n\u2022 the inability, or extended delays in the ability,\nto fully recover and restore data that has been\nstolen, manipulated or destroyed, or the inability\nto prevent systems from processing fraudulent\ntransactions\n\n\u2022 demands that JPMorgan Chase pay a ransom to a\nmalicious actor that has perpetrated a\ncybersecurity breach\n\n\u2022 unintended violations by JPMorgan Chase of\napplicable privacy and other laws\n\n\u2022 financial loss to JPMorgan Chase or to its\nclients, customers, counterparties or employees\n\n\u2022 loss of confidence in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\ncybersecurity and business resiliency measures\n\n\u2022 dissatisfaction among JPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients,\ncustomers or counterparties\n\n\u2022 significant exposure to litigation and regulatory\nfines, penalties or other sanctions, and\n\n\u2022 harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\n\nThe extent of a particular cyber attack, the\nmethods and tools used by various actors, and the\nsteps that JPMorgan Chase may need to take to\ninvestigate the attack may not be immediately\nclear, and it may take a significant amount of time\nbefore such an investigation can be completed.\nWhile such an investigation is ongoing, JPMorgan\nChase may not necessarily know the full extent of\nthe harm caused by the cyber attack, and that\ndamage may continue to spread. These factors may\ninhibit JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to provide rapid,\nfull and reliable information about the cyber\nattack to its clients, customers, counterparties\nand regulators, as well as the public. Furthermore,\nit may not be clear how best to contain and\nremediate the harm caused by the cyber attack, and\ncertain errors or actions could be repeated or\ncompounded before they are discovered and\nremediated. Any or all of these factors could\nfurther increase the costs and consequences of a\ncyber attack.\n\nJPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected if it\nfails to identify and address operational risks\nassociated with the introduction of or changes to\nproducts, services and delivery platforms or the\nadoption of new technologies.\n\nWhen JPMorgan Chase launches a new product or\nservice, introduces a new platform for the delivery\nor distribution of products or services (including\nmobile connectivity, electronic trading and cloud\ncomputing), acquires or invests in a business,\nmakes changes to an existing product, service\n      \n  23  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                                                  \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\nor delivery platform, or adopts a new technology,\nit may not fully appreciate or identify new\noperational risks that may arise from those\nchanges, including increased reliance on third\nparty providers, or may fail to implement adequate\ncontrols to mitigate the risks associated with\nthose changes. Any significant failure in this\nregard could diminish JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to\noperate one or more of its businesses or result in:\n\n\u2022 potential liability to clients, counterparties\nand customers\n\n\u2022 higher compliance and operational cost\n\n\u2022 higher litigation costs, including regulatory\nfines, penalties and other sanctions\n\n\u2022 damage to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation\n\n\u2022 impairment of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s liquidity\n\n\u2022 regulatory intervention, or\n\n\u2022 weaker competitive standing.\n\nAny of the foregoing consequences could materially\nand adversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses\nand results of operations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business and operations rely on\nits ability, and the ability of key external\nparties, to maintain appropriately-staffed\nworkforces, and on the competence, trustworthiness,\nhealth and safety of employees.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to operate its businesses\nefficiently and profitably, to offer products and\nservices that meet the expectations of its clients\nand customers, and to maintain an effective risk\nmanagement framework is highly dependent on its\nability to staff its operations appropriately and\non the competence, trustworthiness, health and\nsafety of its employees. JPMorgan Chase's\nbusinesses and operations similarly rely on the\nworkforces of third parties, including employees of\nvendors, custodians and financial markets\ninfrastructures, and of businesses that it may seek\nto acquire. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses could be\nmaterially and adversely affected by:\n\n\u2022 the ineffective implementation of business\ndecisions\n\n\u2022 any failure to institute controls that\nappropriately address risks associated with\nbusiness activities, or to appropriately train\nemployees with respect to those risks and controls\n\n\u2022 staffing shortages, particularly in tight labor\nmarkets\n\n\u2022 the possibility that significant portions of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s workforce are unable to work\neffectively, including because of illness,\nquarantines, shelter-in-place arrangements,\ngovernment actions or other restrictions in\nconnection with health emergencies, the spread of\ninfectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics, or due\nto extraordinary events beyond JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\ncontrol such as natural disasters or an outbreak or\nescalation of hostilities\n\n\u2022 a significant operational breakdown or failure,\ntheft, fraud or other unlawful conduct, or\n\n\u2022 other negative outcomes caused by human error or\nmisconduct by an employee of JPMorgan Chase or of\nanother party on which JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses\nor operations rely.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations could also be impaired\nif the measures taken by it or by governmental\nauthorities to protect the health and safety of its\nemployees are ineffective, or if any external party\non which JPMorgan Chase relies fails to take\nappropriate and effective actions to protect the\nhealth and safety of its employees.\n\nJPMorgan Chase faces substantial legal and\noperational risks in the processing and\nsafeguarding of personal information.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses and operations are\nsubject to complex and evolving laws, rules and\nregulations, both within and outside the U.S.,\ngoverning the privacy and protection of personal\ninformation of individuals. Governmental\nauthorities around the world have adopted and are\nconsidering the adoption of numerous legislative\nand regulatory initiatives concerning privacy, data\nprotection and security. Litigation or enforcement\nactions relating to these laws, rules and\nregulations could result in\n\nfines or orders requiring that JPMorgan Chase\nchange its data-related practices, which could have\nan adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to\nprovide products and otherwise harm its business\noperations.\n\nImplementing processes relating to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\ncollection, use, sharing and storage of personal\ninformation to comply with all applicable laws,\nrules and regulations in all relevant\njurisdictions, including where the laws of\ndifferent jurisdictions are in conflict, can:\n\n\u2022 increase JPMorgan Chase\u2019s compliance and\noperating costs\n\n\u2022 hinder the development of new products or\nservices, curtail the offering of existing products\nor services, or affect how products and services\nare offered to clients and customers\n\n\u2022 demand significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nmanagement, and\n\n\u2022 require JPMorgan Chase to structure its\nbusinesses, operations and systems in less\nefficient ways.\n\nNot all of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients, customers,\nvendors, counterparties and other external parties\nmay have appropriate controls in place to protect\nthe confidentiality, integrity or availability of\nthe information exchanged between them and JPMorgan\nChase, particularly where information is\ntransmitted by electronic means. JPMorgan Chase\ncould be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines,\npenalties or other sanctions if personal\ninformation of clients, customers, employees or\nothers were to be mishandled or misused, such as\nsituations where such information is:\n      \n  24  \n      \n\u2022 erroneously provided to parties who are not\npermitted to have the information, or\n\n\u2022 intercepted or otherwise compromised by\nunauthorized third parties.\n\nConcerns regarding the effectiveness of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s measures to safeguard personal information,\nor the perception that those measures are\ninadequate, could cause JPMorgan Chase to lose\nexisting or potential clients and customers or\nemployees, and thereby reduce JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nrevenues. Furthermore, any failure or perceived\nfailure by JPMorgan Chase to comply with applicable\nprivacy or data protection laws, rules and\nregulations, or any failure to appropriately\ncalibrate, manage and monitor access by employees\nor third parties to personal information, could\nsubject JPMorgan Chase to inquiries, examinations\nand investigations that could result in\nrequirements to modify or cease certain operations\nor practices, significant liabilities or regulatory\nfines, penalties or other sanctions. Any of these\ncould damage JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation and\notherwise adversely affect its businesses.\n\nIn recent years, well-publicized incidents\ninvolving the inappropriate collection, use,\nsharing or storage of personal information have led\nto expanded governmental scrutiny of practices\nrelating to the processing or safeguarding of\npersonal information by companies in the U.S. and\nother countries. That scrutiny has in some cases\nresulted in, and could in the future lead to, the\nadoption of stricter laws, rules and regulations\nrelating to the collection, use, sharing and\nstorage of personal information. These types of\nlaws, rules and regulations can prohibit or\nsignificantly restrict financial services firms\nsuch as JPMorgan Chase from transferring\ninformation across national borders or sharing\ninformation among affiliates or with third parties\nsuch as vendors, thereby increase compliance costs\nand operational risk, or restrict JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nuse of personal information when developing or\noffering products or services to customers. Some\ncountries are considering or have adopted\nlegislation implementing data protection\nrequirements or requiring local storage and\nprocessing of data which could increase the cost\nand complexity of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s delivery of\nproducts and services.

Actual results associated\nwith the First Republic acquisition may differ from\nthe anticipated positive results, including with\nrespect to:\n\n\u2022 the settlement of the final purchase price\n\n\u2022 the total cost of integration\n\n\u2022 the time required to complete the integration\n\n\u2022 the overall performance of the assets and\nliabilities acquired in the First Republic\nacquisition, or\n\n\u2022 an improved price for JPMorgan Chase\u2019s common\nstock.\n\nIntegration of an acquired business can be complex\nand costly, and involves the combination of\nrelevant accounting and data processing systems and\nmanagement controls, as well as managing relevant\nrelationships with employees, clients, suppliers\nand other business partners. The integration\nprocess could result in the disruption of ongoing\nbusinesses or inconsistencies in standards,\ncontrols, procedures and policies that could\nadversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to\nmaintain relationships with clients and customers.\nIn addition, the loss of key employees in\nconnection with the First Republic acquisition\ncould adversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to\nsuccessfully conduct its business.\n\nJPMorgan Chase could also incur unanticipated costs\nor losses in connection with the First Republic\nacquisition, including if JPMorgan Chase fails to\ncomply with the conditions of the shared-loss\nagreements with the FDIC related to certain loans\nand lending-related commitments, which could\ndiminish the coverage of the credit losses these\nagreements are designed to provide.\n\nEnhanced regulatory and other standards for the\noversight of vendors and other service providers\ncan result in higher costs and other potential\nexposures.\n\nJPMorgan Chase must comply with enhanced regulatory\nand other standards associated with doing business\nwith vendors and other service providers, including\nstandards\n\nrelating to the outsourcing of functions as well as\nthe performance of significant banking and other\nfunctions by subsidiaries. JPMorgan Chase incurs\nsignificant costs and expenses in connection with\nits initiatives to address the risks associated\nwith oversight of its internal and external service\nproviders. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s failure to\nappropriately assess and manage these\nrelationships, especially those involving\nsignificant banking functions, shared services or\nother critical activities, could materially\nadversely affect JPMorgan Chase. Specifically, any\nsuch failure could result in:\n\n\u2022 potential harm to clients and customers, and any\nliability associated with that harm\n\n\u2022 regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions\n\n\u2022 lower revenues, and the opportunity cost from\nlost revenues\n\n\u2022 increased operational costs, or\n\n\u2022 harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s risk management framework and\ncontrol environment may not be effective in\nidentifying and mitigating every risk to JPMorgan\nChase.\n\nAny inadequacy or lapse in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s risk\nmanagement framework, governance structure,\npractices, models or reporting systems, or in its\ncontrol environment could expose it to unexpected\nlosses, and its financial condition or results of\noperations could be materially and adversely\naffected. Any such inadequacy or lapse could:\n\n\u2022 hinder the timely escalation of material risk\nissues to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s senior management and\nBoard of Directors\n\n\u2022 lead to business decisions that have negative\noutcomes for JPMorgan Chase\n\n\u2022 require significant resources and time to\nremediate\n\n\u2022 lead to non-compliance with laws, rules and\nregulations\n\n\u2022 attract heightened regulatory scrutiny\n\n\u2022 expose JPMorgan Chase to litigation, regulatory\ninvestigations or regulatory fines, penalties or\nother sanctions\n\n\u2022 lead to potential harm to customers and clients,\nand any liability associated with that harm\n\n\u2022 harm its reputation, or\n\n\u2022 otherwise diminish confidence in JPMorgan Chase.\n\nJPMorgan Chase relies on data to assess its various\nrisk exposures. Any deficiencies in the accuracy,\ntimeliness or completeness of data, or the\neffectiveness of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s data gathering,\nanalysis and validation processes could result in\nineffective risk management practices. These\ndeficiencies could also result in inaccurate or\nuntimely risk reporting.\n      \n  26  \n      \nMany of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s risk management strategies\nand techniques consider historical market behavior\nand to some degree are based on management\u2019s\nsubjective judgment or assumptions. For example,\nmany models used by JPMorgan Chase are based on\nassumptions regarding historical correlations among\nprices of various asset classes or other market\nindicators. In times of market stress, including\ndifficult or less liquid market environments, or in\nthe event of other unforeseen circumstances,\npreviously uncorrelated indicators may become\ncorrelated. Conversely, previously-correlated\nindicators may become uncorrelated at those times.\nSudden market movements and unanticipated market or\neconomic movements could, in some circumstances,\nlimit the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s risk\nmanagement strategies, causing it to incur losses.\n\nJPMorgan Chase could recognize unexpected losses,\nits capital levels could be reduced and it could\nface greater regulatory scrutiny if its models,\nestimations or judgments, including those used in\nits financial statements, are inadequate or\nincorrect.\n\nJPMorgan Chase has developed and uses a variety of\nmodels and other analytical and judgment-based\nestimations to measure, monitor and implement\ncontrols over its market, credit, capital,\nliquidity, operational and other risks. JPMorgan\nChase also uses internal models and estimations as\na basis for its stress testing and in connection\nwith the preparation of its financial statements\nunder U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\n(\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d).\n\nThese models and estimations are based on a variety\nof assumptions and historical trends, and are\nperiodically reviewed and modified as necessary.\nThe models and estimations that JPMorgan Chase\nuses, including those that use machine learning,\nartificial intelligence or quantum computing, may\nnot be effective in all cases to identify, observe\nand mitigate risk due to a variety of factors, such\nas:\n\n\u2022 reliance on historical trends that may not\npersist in the future, including assumptions\nunderlying the models and estimations such as\ncorrelations among certain market indicators or\nasset prices\n\n\u2022 inherent limitations associated with forecasting\nuncertain economic and financial outcomes\n\n\u2022 historical trend information may be incomplete,\nor may not be indicative of severely negative\nmarket conditions such as extreme volatility,\ndislocation or lack of liquidity\n\n\u2022 sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in\nprices of certain loans and securities may make it\nmore difficult to value certain financial\ninstruments\n\n\u2022 technology that is introduced to run models or\nestimations may not perform as expected, or may not\nbe well understood by the personnel using the\ntechnology\n\n\u2022 models and estimations may contain erroneous\ndata, valuations, formulas or algorithms, and\n\n\u2022 review processes may fail to detect flaws in\nmodels and estimations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase may experience unexpected losses if\nmodels, estimates or judgments used or applied in\nconnection with its risk management activities or\nthe preparation of its financial statements are\ninadequate or incorrect. For example, where quoted\nmarket prices are not available for certain\nfinancial instruments that require a determination\nof their fair value, JPMorgan Chase may make fair\nvalue determinations based on internally developed\nmodels or other means which ultimately rely to some\ndegree on management estimates and judgment. In\naddition, JPMorgan Chase may experience increased\nuncertainty in its estimates if assets acquired\ndiffer from those used to develop those models,\nwhich may lead to unexpected losses.\n\nSimilarly, JPMorgan Chase establishes an allowance\nfor expected credit losses related to its credit\nexposures which requires significant judgments,\nincluding forecasts of how macroeconomic conditions\nmight impair the ability of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nclients and customers to repay their loans or other\nobligations. These types of estimates and judgments\nmay not prove to be accurate due to a variety of\nfactors, including when the current and forecasted\nenvironments are significantly different from the\nhistorical environments upon which the models were\ndeveloped. The increased uncertainty may\nnecessitate a greater degree of judgment and\nanalytics to inform any adjustments that JPMorgan\nChase may make to model outputs than would\notherwise be the case.\n\nSome of the models and other analytical and\njudgment-based estimations used by JPMorgan Chase\nin managing risks are subject to review by, and\nrequire the approval of, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nregulators. These reviews are required before\nJPMorgan Chase may use those models and estimations\nfor calculating market risk RWA, credit risk RWA\nand operational risk RWA under Basel III.

Each of these\nobjectives could be adversely affected by any\nfailure on the part of management to:\n\n\u2022 devise effective business plans and strategies\n\n\u2022 offer products and services that meet changing\nexpectations of clients and customers\n\n\u2022 allocate capital in a manner that promotes long-\nterm stability to enable JPMorgan Chase to build\nand invest in\n\nmarket-leading businesses, even in a highly\nstressed environment\n\n\u2022 allocate capital appropriately due to imprecise\nmodeling or subjective judgments made in connection\nwith those allocations\n\n\u2022 appropriately assess and monitor principal\ninvestments made to enhance or accelerate JPMorgan\nChase's business strategies\n\n\u2022 conduct appropriate due diligence on prospective\nbusiness acquisitions or investments, or\neffectively integrate newly-acquired businesses\n\n\u2022 appropriately address concerns of clients,\ncustomers, investors, employees and other\nstakeholders, including with respect to climate and\nother ESG matters\n\n\u2022 react quickly to changes in market conditions or\nmarket structures, or\n\n\u2022 develop and enhance the operational, technology,\nrisk, financial and managerial resources necessary\nto grow and manage JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses.\n\nFurthermore, JPMorgan Chase may incur costs in\nconnection with disposing of excess properties,\npremises and facilities, and those costs could be\nmaterial to its results of operations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase faces significant and increasing\ncompetition in the rapidly evolving financial\nservices industry.\n\nJPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive\nenvironment in which it must evolve and adapt to\nchanges in financial regulation, technological\nadvances, increased public scrutiny and changes in\neconomic conditions. JPMorgan Chase expects that\ncompetition in the U.S. and global financial\nservices industry will continue to be intense.\nCompetitors include:\n\n\u2022 other banks and financial institutions\n\n\u2022 trading, advisory and investment management firms\n\n\u2022 finance companies\n\n\u2022 technology companies, and\n\n\u2022 other non-bank firms that are engaged in\nproviding similar as well as new products and\nservices.\n\nJPMorgan Chase cannot provide assurance that the\nsignificant competition in the financial services\nindustry will not materially and adversely affect\nits future results of operations. For example,\naggressive or less disciplined lending practices by\nnon-bank competitors could lead to a loss of market\nshare for traditional banks, and in an economic\ndownturn could result in instability in the\nfinancial services industry and adversely impact\nother market participants, including JPMorgan\nChase.\n\nNew competitors in the financial services industry\ncontinue to emerge. For example, technological\nadvances and the growth of e-commerce have made it\npossible for non-\n      \n  28  \n      \ndepository institutions to offer products and\nservices that traditionally were banking products.\nThese advances have also allowed financial\ninstitutions and other companies to provide\nelectronic and internet-based financial solutions,\nincluding electronic securities and cryptocurrency\ntrading, lending and other extensions of credit to\nconsumers, payments processing and online automated\nalgorithmic-based investment advice. Furthermore,\nboth financial institutions and their non-banking\ncompetitors face the risk that payments processing\nand other products and services, including deposits\nand other traditional banking products, could be\nsignificantly disrupted by the use of new\ntechnologies, such as cryptocurrencies and other\napplications using secure distributed ledgers, that\nmay not require intermediation. New technologies\nhave required and could require JPMorgan Chase to\nspend more to modify or adapt its products to\nattract and retain clients and customers or to\nmatch products and services offered by its\ncompetitors, including technology companies. In\naddition, new technologies may be used by\ncustomers, or breached or infiltrated by third\nparties, in unexpected ways, which can increase\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s costs for complying with laws,\nrules and regulations that apply to the offering of\nproducts and services through those technologies\nand reduce the income that JPMorgan Chase earns\nfrom providing products and services through those\ntechnologies.\n\nOngoing or increased competition may put pressure\non the pricing for JPMorgan Chase\u2019s products and\nservices or may cause JPMorgan Chase to lose market\nshare, particularly with respect to traditional\nbanking products. This competition may be based on\nquality and variety of products and services\noffered, transaction execution, innovation,\nreputation and price. The failure of any of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses to meet the\nexpectations of clients and customers, whether due\nto general market conditions, under-performance, a\ndecision not to offer a particular product or\nservice, changes in client and customer\nexpectations or other factors, could affect\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to attract or retain\nclients and customers. Any such impact could, in\nturn, reduce JPMorgan Chase\u2019s revenues. Increased\ncompetition also may require JPMorgan Chase to make\nadditional capital investments in its businesses,\nor to extend more of its capital on behalf of its\nclients to remain competitive.\n\nThe effects of climate change could adversely\naffect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business and operations,\nboth directly and as a result of impacts on its\nclients and customers.\n\nJPMorgan Chase operates in many regions, countries\nand communities around the world where its\nbusiness, and the activities of its clients and\ncustomers, could be adversely affected by climate\nchange. Climate change could manifest as a\nfinancial risk to JPMorgan Chase either through\nchanges in the physical climate or from the process\nof transitioning to a low-carbon economy. Both\nphysical risks and transition risks associated with\nclimate change could have negative impacts on the\nfinancial condition or\n\ncreditworthiness of JPMorgan\u2019s clients and\ncustomers, and on its exposure to those clients and\ncustomers.\n\nPhysical risks include the increased frequency or\nseverity of acute weather events, such as floods,\nwildfires and tropical cyclones, and chronic shifts\nin the climate, such as persistent changes in\nprecipitation levels, rising sea levels, or\nincreases in average ambient temperature. Potential\nadverse impacts of climate-related physical risks\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 declines in asset values, including due to the\ndestruction or degradation of property\n\n\u2022 reduced availability or increased cost of\ninsurance for clients of JPMorgan Chase\n\n\u2022 interruptions to business operations, including\nsupply chain disruption, and\n\n\u2022 population migration or unemployment in affected\nregions.\n\nTransition risks arise from societal adjustment to\na low-carbon economy, such as changes in public\npolicy, adoption of new technologies or changes in\nconsumer preferences towards low-carbon goods and\nservices. These risks could also be influenced by\nchanges in the physical climate. Potential adverse\nimpacts of transition risks include:\n\n\u2022 sudden devaluation of assets, including\nunanticipated write-downs (\u201cstranded assets\u201d)\n\n\u2022 increased operational and compliance costs driven\nby changes in climate policy\n\n\u2022 increased energy costs driven by governmental\nactions and initiatives such as emission pricing\nand accelerated decarbonization policies\n\n\u2022 negative consequences to business models, and the\nneed to make changes in response to those\nconsequences, and\n\n\u2022 damage to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation, including\ndue to any perception that its business practices\nare contrary to public policy or the preferences of\ndifferent stakeholders.\n\nClimate risks can also arise from inconsistencies\nand conflicts in the manner in which climate policy\nand financial regulations are implemented in the\nmany regions where JPMorgan Chase operates,\nincluding initiatives to apply and enforce policy\nand regulation with extraterritorial effect.\nAdditionally, internal models and estimations used\nin climate risk assessments have an increased level\nof uncertainty due to limited historical trend\ninformation and the absence of standardized,\nreliable and comprehensive greenhouse gas emissions\ndata, which could lead to inaccurate disclosures or\nfinancial reporting.\n                                                                                                            \n  Conduct                                                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \nConduct failure by JPMorgan Chase employees can\nharm clients and customers, impact market\nintegrity, damage JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation and\ntrigger litigation and regulatory action.\n      \n  29  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                                                  \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s employees interact with clients,\ncustomers, counterparties and other market and\nindustry participants, and with each other, every\nday. All employees are expected to demonstrate\nvalues and exhibit the behaviors that are an\nintegral part of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Code of Conduct\nand Business Principles, including JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\ncommitment to \u201cdo first class business in a first\nclass way.\u201d JPMorgan Chase endeavors to embed\nconduct risk management throughout an employee\u2019s\nlife cycle, including recruiting, onboarding,\ntraining and development, and performance\nmanagement. Conduct risk management is also an\nintegral component of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s promotion\nand compensation processes.\n\nNotwithstanding these expectations, policies and\npractices, certain employees have engaged in\nimproper or illegal conduct in the past. These\ninstances of misconduct have resulted in\nlitigation, and resolutions of governmental\ninvestigations or enforcement actions involving\nconsent orders, deferred prosecution agreements,\nnon-prosecution agreements and other civil or\ncriminal sanctions. There is no assurance that\nfurther inappropriate or unlawful actions by\nemployees have not occurred or will not occur, lead\nto a violation of the terms of these resolutions\n(and associated consequences), or that any such\nactions will always be detected, deterred or\nprevented.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation could be harmed, and\ncollateral consequences could result, from a\nfailure by one or more employees to conduct\nthemselves in accordance with JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nexpectations, policies and practices, including by\nacting in ways that harm clients, customers, other\nmarket participants, employees or others. Some\nexamples of this include:\n\n\u2022 improperly selling and marketing JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nproducts or services\n\n\u2022 engaging in insider trading, market manipulation\nor unauthorized trading\n\n\u2022 engaging in improper or fraudulent behavior in\nconnection with government relief programs\n\n\u2022 facilitating a transaction where a material\nobjective is to achieve a particular tax,\naccounting or financial disclosure treatment that\nmay be subject to scrutiny by governmental or\nregulatory authorities, or where the proposed\ntreatment is unclear or may not reflect the\neconomic substance of the transaction\n\n\u2022 failing to fulfill fiduciary obligations or other\nduties owed to clients or customers\n\n\u2022 violating antitrust or anti-competition laws by\ncolluding with other market participants\n\n\u2022 using electronic communications channels that\nhave not been approved by JPMorgan Chase\n\n\u2022 engaging in discriminatory behavior or harassment\nwith respect to clients, customers or employees, or\nacting contrary to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s goal of\nfostering a diverse and inclusive workplace\n\n\u2022 managing or reporting risks in ways that\nsubordinate JPMorgan Chase\u2019s risk appetite to\nbusiness performance goals or employee compensation\nobjectives, and\n\n\u2022 misappropriating property, confidential or\nproprietary information, or technology assets\nbelonging to JPMorgan Chase, its clients and\ncustomers or third parties.\n\nThe consequences of any failure by one or more\nemployees to conduct themselves in accordance with\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s expectations, policies or\npractices could include litigation, or regulatory\nor other governmental investigations or enforcement\nactions. Any of these proceedings or actions could\nresult in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties\nor other sanctions, or lead to:\n\n\u2022 financial losses\n\n\u2022 increased operational and compliance costs\n\n\u2022 greater scrutiny by regulators and other parties\n\n\u2022 regulatory actions that require JPMorgan Chase to\nrestructure, curtail or cease certain of its\nactivities\n\n\u2022 the need for significant oversight by JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s management\n\n\u2022 loss of clients or customers, and\n\n\u2022 harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\n\nThe foregoing risks could be heightened with\nrespect to newly-acquired businesses if JPMorgan\nChase fails to successfully integrate employees of\nthose businesses or any of those employees do not\nconduct themselves in accordance with JPMorgan\nChase's expectations, policies and practices.\n                                                                                                            \n  Reputation                                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nDamage to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation could harm\nits businesses.\n\nMaintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to\nits ability to attract and retain clients,\ncustomers, investors and employees. Damage to\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation can therefore cause\nsignificant harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business and\nprospects, and can arise from numerous sources,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 employee misconduct, including discriminatory\nbehavior or harassment with respect to clients,\ncustomers or employees, or actions that are\ncontrary to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s goal of fostering a\ndiverse and inclusive workplace\n\n\u2022 security breaches, including as a result of cyber\nattacks\n\n\u2022 failure to safeguard client, customer or employee\ninformation\n\n\u2022 failure to manage risks associated with its\nclient relationships, or with transactions or\nbusiness activities in which JPMorgan Chase or its\nclients engage, including transactions or\nactivities that may be unpopular among one or more\nconstituencies\n      \n  30  \n      \n\u2022 failure to meet publicly-announced commitments to\nsupport ESG initiatives\n\n\u2022 non-compliance with laws, rules, and regulations\n\n\u2022 operational failures\n\n\u2022 litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or\nother sanctions\n\n\u2022 actions taken in executing regulatory and\ngovernmental requirements during a global or\nregional health emergency, spread of infectious\ndisease, epidemic or pandemic\n\n\u2022 regulatory investigations or enforcement actions,\nor resolutions of these matters, and\n\n\u2022 failure or perceived failure to comply with laws,\nrules or regulations by JPMorgan Chase or its\nclients, customers, counterparties or other\nparties, including newly-acquired businesses,\ncompanies in which JPMorgan Chase has made\nprincipal investments, parties to joint ventures\nwith JPMorgan Chase, and vendors with which\nJPMorgan Chase does business.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation may be significantly\ndamaged by adverse publicity or negative\ninformation regarding JPMorgan Chase, whether or\nnot true, that may be published or broadcast by the\nmedia or posted on social media, non-mainstream\nnews services or other parts of the internet, or\nthat may be disseminated through disinformation\ncampaigns targeted at JPMorgan Chase. This latter\nrisk can be magnified by the speed and\npervasiveness with which information is\ndisseminated through those channels.\n\nSocial and environmental activists have been\nincreasingly targeting JPMorgan Chase and other\nfinancial services firms with public criticism\nconcerning their business practices, including\nbusiness relationships with clients that are\nengaged in certain sensitive industries, such as\ncompanies:\n\n\u2022 whose products are or are perceived to be harmful\nto human health, or\n\n\u2022 whose activities negatively affect or are\nperceived to negatively affect the environment,\nworkers\u2019 rights or communities.\n\nActivists have also taken actions intended to\nchange or influence JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business\npractices with respect to ESG matters, including\npublic protests at JPMorgan Chase\u2019s headquarters\nand other properties, and submitting specific ESG-\nrelated proposals for a vote by JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nshareholders.\n\nIn addition, JPMorgan Chase and other companies\nhave been and continue to be criticized by\nactivists, politicians and other members of the\npublic concerning positions taken with respect to\nmatters of public policy. These criticisms can be\nmore widespread during election years in various\njurisdictions, and could have the effect of\nfocusing attention on a company such as JPMorgan\nChase as part of a wider public debate on public\npolicy matters.\n\nThese and other types of criticism and actions\ndirected at JPMorgan Chase could potentially\nengender dissatisfaction among clients, customers,\ninvestors, employees, government officials and\nother stakeholders. In all of these cases, JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s reputation and its business and results of\noperations could be harmed by :\n\n\u2022 greater scrutiny from governmental or regulatory\nbodies, or further criticism from politicians and\nother members of the public\n\n\u2022 unfavorable coverage or commentary in the media,\nincluding through social media campaigns\n\n\u2022 certain clients and customers ceasing doing\nbusiness with JPMorgan Chase, and encouraging\nothers to do so\n\n\u2022 impairment of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to attract\nnew clients and customers, to expand its\nrelationships with existing clients and customers,\nor to hire or retain employees, or\n\n\u2022 certain investors opting to divest from\ninvestments in securities of JPMorgan Chase.\n\nActions by the financial services industry\ngenerally or individuals in the industry can also\naffect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation. For example,\nthe reputation of the industry as a whole can be\ndamaged by concerns that:\n\n\u2022 consumers have been treated unfairly by a\nfinancial institution, or\n\n\u2022 a financial institution has acted inappropriately\nwith respect to the methods used to offer products\nto customers.\n\nIf JPMorgan Chase is perceived to have engaged in\nthese types of behaviors, this could weaken its\nreputation among clients or customers, employees or\nother stakeholders.\n\nFailure to effectively manage potential conflicts\nof interest or to satisfy fiduciary obligations can\nresult in litigation and enforcement actions, as\nwell as damage JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to manage potential\nconflicts of interest is highly complex due to the\nbroad range of its business activities which\nencompass a variety of transactions, obligations\nand interests with and among JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nclients and customers. JPMorgan Chase can become\nsubject to litigation, enforcement actions, and\nheightened regulatory scrutiny, and its reputation\ncan be damaged, by the failure or perceived failure\nto:\n\n\u2022 adequately address or appropriately disclose\nconflicts of interest, including potential\nconflicts of interest that may arise in connection\nwith providing multiple products and services in,\nor having one or more investments related to, the\nsame transaction\n\n\u2022 identify and address any conflict of interest\nthat a third party with which it is does business\nmay have with respect to a transaction involving\nJPMorgan Chase\n\n\u2022 deliver appropriate standards of service and\nquality\n      \n  31  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                                                  \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\n\u2022 treat clients and customers fairly and with the\nappropriate standard of care\n\n\u2022 use client and customer data responsibly and in a\nmanner that meets legal requirements and regulatory\nexpectations\n\n\u2022 provide fiduciary products or services in\naccordance with the applicable legal and regulatory\nstandards, or\n\n\u2022 handle or use confidential information of\ncustomers or clients appropriately and in\ncompliance with applicable data protection and\nprivacy laws, rules and regulations.\n\nA failure or perceived failure to appropriately\naddress conflicts of interest or fiduciary\nobligations could result in customer\ndissatisfaction, litigation and regulatory fines,\npenalties or other sanctions, and heightened\nregulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions, all of\nwhich can lead to lost revenue and higher operating\ncosts and cause serious harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nreputation.\n                                                                                                            \n  Country                                                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \nAn outbreak or escalation of hostilities between\ncountries or within a country or region could have\na material adverse effect on the global economy and\non JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses within the affected\nregion or globally.\n\nAggressive actions by hostile governments or\ngroups, including armed conflict or intensified\ncyber attacks, could expand in unpredictable ways\nby drawing in other countries or escalating into\nfull-scale war with potentially catastrophic\nconsequences, particularly if one or more of the\ncombatants possess nuclear weapons. Depending on\nthe scope of the conflict, the hostilities could\nresult in:\n\n\u2022 worldwide economic disruption\n\n\u2022 heightened volatility in financial markets\n\n\u2022 severe declines in asset values, accompanied by\nwidespread sell-offs of investments\n\n\u2022 sudden increases in prices in the energy and\ncommodity markets or for certain safe haven\ncurrencies\n\n\u2022 substantial depreciation of local currencies,\npotentially leading to defaults by borrowers and\ncounterparties in the affected region\n\n\u2022 disruption of global trade, and\n\n\u2022 diminished consumer, business and investor\nconfidence.\n\nAny of the above consequences could have\nsignificant negative effects on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\noperations and earnings, both in the countries or\nregions directly affected by the hostilities or\nglobally. Further, if the U.S. were to become\ndirectly involved in such a conflict, this could\nlead to a curtailment of any operations that\nJPMorgan Chase may have in the affected countries\nor region, as well as in any nation that is aligned\nagainst the U.S. in the hostilities. JPMorgan Chase\ncould also experience more numerous and aggressive\ncyber attacks launched by or under the\n\nsponsorship of one or more of the adversaries in\nsuch a conflict.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business and operations in certain\ncountries can be adversely affected by local\neconomic, political, regulatory and social factors.\n\nSome of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase\nconducts business have economies or markets that\nare less developed and more volatile or may have\npolitical, legal and regulatory regimes that are\nless established or predictable than other\ncountries in which JPMorgan Chase operates. In\naddition, in some jurisdictions in which JPMorgan\nChase conducts business, the local economy and\nbusiness activities are subject to substantial\ngovernment influence or control. Some of these\ncountries have in the past experienced economic\ndisruptions, including:\n\n\u2022 extreme currency fluctuations\n\n\u2022 high inflation\n\n\u2022 low or negative growth\n\n\u2022 defaults or reduced ability to service sovereign\ndebt a nd\n\n\u2022 increased fraud or other misrepresentation of\nvalue.\n\nThe governments in these countries have sometimes\nreacted to these developments by imposing\nrestrictive policies that adversely affect the\nlocal and regional business environment, such as:\n\n\u2022 price, capital or exchange controls, including\nimposition of punitive transfer and convertibility\nrestrictions or forced currency exchange\n\n\u2022 expropriation or nationalization of assets or\nconfiscation of property, including intellectual\nproperty, and\n\n\u2022 changes in laws, rules and regulations.\n\nThe impact of these actions could be accentuated in\ntrading markets that are smaller, less liquid and\nmore volatile than more-developed markets. These\ntypes of government actions can negatively affect\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations in the relevant\ncountry, either directly or by suppressing the\nbusiness activities of local clients or multi-\nnational clients that conduct business in the\njurisdiction.\n\nIn addition, emerging markets countries, as well as\nmore developed countries, have been susceptible to\nunfavorable social developments arising from poor\neconomic conditions or governmental actions,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 widespread demonstrations, civil unrest or\ngeneral strikes\n\n\u2022 crime and corruption\n\n\u2022 security and personal safety issues\n\n\u2022 an outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or\nother geopolitical instabilities\n\n\u2022 overthrow of incumbent governments\n\n\u2022 terrorist attacks, and\n      \n  32  \n      \n\u2022 other forms of internal discord.\n\nThese economic, political, regulatory and social\ndevelopments have in the past resulted in, and in\nthe future could lead to, conditions that can\nadversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations in\nthose countries and impair the revenues, growth and\nprofitability of those operations. In addition, any\nof these events or circumstances in one country can\naffect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations and investments\nin another country or countries, including in the\nU.S.\n                                                                                                            \n  People                                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to attract and retain\nqualified and diverse employees is critical to its\nsuccess.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s employees are its most important\nresource, and in many areas of the financial\nservices industry, competition for qualified\npersonnel is intense. JPMorgan Chase endeavors to\nattract talented and diverse new employees and\nretain, develop and motivate its existing\nemployees. JPMorgan Chase's efforts to hire and\nretain talented and diverse employees could be\nhindered by factors such as:\n\n\u2022 the emerging need for more-skilled workers in an\nevolving labor and workplace environment, including\ndue to changes in technology, and\n\n\u2022 targeted recruitment of JPMorgan Chase employees\nby competitors.\n\nIf JPMorgan Chase were unable to continue to\nattract or retain qualified and diverse employees,\nincluding successors to the Chief Executive\nOfficer, members of the Operating Committee and\nother senior leaders, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s performance,\nincluding its competitive position, could be\nmaterially and adversely affected.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s use of hybrid work models could\nresult in deterioration in employee performance or\ndegradation of JPMorgan Chase's control environment\nwhich may have a material and adverse effect on its\nbusiness and operations. Alternatively,\ndiscontinuing hybrid work models could harm\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to attract and retain\nemployees.\n\nUnfavorable changes in immigration or travel\npolicies could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbusinesses and operations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase relies on the skills, knowledge and\nexpertise of employees located throughout the\nworld. Changes in immigration or travel policies in\nthe U.S. and other countries that unduly restrict\nor otherwise make it more difficult for employees\nor their family members to work in, or travel to or\ntransfer between, jurisdictions in which JPMorgan\nChase has operations or conducts its business could\ninhibit JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to attract and\nretain qualified employees, and thereby dilute the\nquality of its workforce, or could prompt JPMorgan\nChase to make structural changes to its worldwide\nor regional operating models that cause its\noperations to be less efficient or more costly.\n                                                                                                            \n  Legal                                                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \nJPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks from\nlitigation and formal and informal regulatory and\ngovernment investigations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is\notherwise involved in many legal proceedings,\nincluding class actions, derivative actions and\nother litigation or disputes with third parties, as\nwell as criminal proceedings. Actions currently\npending against JPMorgan Chase may result in\njudgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other\nsanctions adverse to JPMorgan Chase. Any of these\nmatters could materially and adversely affect\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business, financial condition or\nresults of operations, or cause serious\nreputational harm. As a participant in the\nfinancial services industry, it is likely that\nJPMorgan Chase will continue to experience a high\nlevel of litigation and regulatory and government\ninvestigations related to its businesses and\noperations.\n\nRegulators and other government agencies conduct\nexaminations of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries\nboth on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses and operations are\nsubject to heightened regulatory oversight. This\nheightened regulatory scrutiny, or the results of\nsuch an investigation or examination, may lead to\nadditional regulatory investigations or enforcement\nactions. There is no assurance that those actions\nwill not result in resolutions or other enforcement\nactions against JPMorgan Chase. Furthermore, a\nsingle event involving a potential violation of law\nor regulation may give rise to numerous and\noverlapping investigations and proceedings, either\nby multiple federal, state or local agencies and\nofficials in the U.S. or, in some instances,\nregulators and other governmental officials in\nnon-U.S. jurisdictions.\n\nIf another financial institution violates a law or\nregulation relating to a particular business\nactivity or practice, this will often give rise to\nan investigation by regulators and other\ngovernmental agencies of the same or similar\nactivity or practice by JPMorgan Chase.\n\nThese and other initiatives by U.S. and non-U.S.\ngovernmental authorities may subject JPMorgan Chase\nto judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or\nother sanctions, and may require JPMorgan Chase to\nrestructure its operations and activities or to\ncease offering certain products or services. All of\nthese potential outcomes could harm JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s reputation or lead to higher operational\ncosts, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nprofitability, or result in collateral\nconsequences. In addition, the extent of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s exposure to legal and regulatory matters\ncan be unpredictable and could, in some cases,\nexceed the amount of reserves that JPMorgan Chase\nhas established for those matters.\n      \n  33  \n      \n                                                                                                            \n  Parts I and II                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                                                                                          \u2502\n\u2502  Item 1B.

Comparisons noted in the sections\nbelow are for the full year of 2023 versus the full year of 2022, unless otherwise specified. Firmwide\noverview JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $49.6 billion for 2023, up 32%, earnings per share of $16.23,\nROE of 17% and ROTCE of 21%. \u2022 Total net revenue was $158.1 billion, up 23%, reflecting:\n\n\u2013 Net interest income (\u201cNII\u201d) of $89.3 billion, up 34%, driven by higher rates, the impact of First\nRepublic, and higher revolving balances in Card Services, partially offset by lower Markets net interest\nincome and lower average deposit balances. NII excluding Markets was $90.0 billion, up 44%. \u2013 Noninterest\nrevenue (\u201cNIR\u201d) was $68.8 billion, up 11%, driven by the impact of First Republic, including the $2.8\nbillion estimated bargain purchase gain, higher Markets noninterest revenue, and higher asset management\nfees, partially offset by the absence of the gain on the sale of Visa B shares in the prior year, higher net\nsecurities losses in Treasury and CIO, and lower auto operating lease income. \u2022 Noninterest expense was\n$87.2 billion, up 14%, predominantly driven by higher compensation expense, reflecting an increase in\nemployees, primarily in technology and front office, as well as wage inflation. The increase in expense also\nincludes the $2.9 billion FDIC special assessment and costs associated with the First Republic acquisition.\n\u2022 The provision for credit losses was $9.3 billion, reflecting $6.2 billion of net charge-offs and a net\naddition to the allowance for credit losses of $3.1 billion. Net charge-offs increased $3.3 billion,\npredominantly driven by Card Services, and to a lesser extent single name exposures in wholesale. The net\naddition to the allowance for credit losses included: \u2013 a net addition of $1.3 billion in consumer ,\npredominantly driven by CCB, reflecting $1.4 billion in Card Services driven by loan growth, including an\nincrease in revolving balances, partially offset by a net reduction of $200 million in Home Lending, and \u2013 a\nnet addition of $657 million in wholesale , driven by net downgrade activity and a deterioration in the\noutlook for commercial real estate in CB. The net addition also included $1.2 billion to establish the\nallowance for First Republic loans and lending-related commitments in the second quarter of 2023. The\nprovision in the prior year included a $3.5 billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses and net\ncharge-offs of $2.9 billion. \u2022 The total allowance for credit losses was $24.8 billion at December 31, 2023.\nThe Firm had an allowance for loan losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 1.75%, compared with 1.81% in\nthe prior year. \u2022 The Firm\u2019s nonperforming assets totaled $7.6 billion at December 31, 2023, up 5%,\npredominantly driven by wholesale nonaccrual loans, which reflected the impact of downgrades.

Refer to Business\nSegment Results on page 67, and Notes 6 and 34 for additional information. 2023 compared with 2022\nInvestment banking fees decreased, reflecting in CIB: \u2022 lower advisory fees due to a lower number of\ncompleted transactions, reflecting the lower level of announced deals in the current and the prior year amid\na challenging environment, and \u2022 lower debt underwriting fees as challenging market conditions, primarily in\nthe first half of the year, resulted in lower issuance activity across leveraged loans, investment-grade\nloans and high-grade bonds. This was largely offset by higher issuance activity in high-yield bonds driven\nby higher industry-wide issuance, partially offset by \u2022 higher equity underwriting fees driven by a higher\nlevel of follow-on offerings due to lower equity market volatility and a higher level of convertible\nsecurities offerings, which benefited from higher rates, partially offset by lower activity in private\nplacements amid a challenging environment. Refer to CIB segment results on pages 72\u201377 and Note 6 for\nadditional information. Principal transactions revenue increased, reflecting in CIB: \u2022 higher Equity Markets\nprincipal transactions revenue in Prime Finance and Equity Derivatives, \u2022 higher Fixed Income Markets\nprincipal transactions revenue in Securitized Products and Fixed Income\n\nFinancing, largely offset by lower revenue in Rates and Currencies & Emerging Markets; \u2013 the net increase in\nMarkets principal transactions revenue was more than offset by a decline in Markets net interest income,\nprimarily due to higher funding costs; and \u2022 losses of $280 million in Credit Adjustments & Other compared\nwith $836 million in the prior year. The prior year included net markdowns on held-for-sale positions,\nprimarily unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio in CIB and CB. The increase in principal\ntransactions revenue also included the impact of higher short-term cash deployment activities in Treasury\nand CIO, reflective of the current interest rate environment. Principal transactions revenue in CIB\ngenerally has offsets across other revenue lines, including net interest income. The Firm assesses the\nperformance of its Markets business on a total net revenue basis. Refer to CIB and Corporate segment results\non pages 72\u201377 and pages 84\u201385, respectively, and Note 6 for additional information. Lending- and deposit-\nrelated fees increased, reflecting: \u2022 higher lending-related revenue driven by the amortization of the\npurchase discount on certain acquired lending-related commitments associated with First Republic, primarily\nin AWM and CB, predominantly offset by \u2022 lower deposit-related fees in CB and CIB driven by the higher level\nof client credits that reduce such fees.

The net addition in Card Services was driven by loan growth,\nincluding an increase in revolving balances, partially offset by reduced borrower uncertainty. The net\nreduction in Home Lending was driven by improvements in the outlook for home prices; and \u2022 $657 million in\nwholesale , driven by net downgrade activity and the net effect of changes in the Firm's weighted average\nmacroeconomic outlook, including a deterioration in the outlook for commercial real estate in CB, partially\noffset by the impact of changes in the loan and lending-related commitment portfolios.

Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for\nadditional information.\n\nInvestment securities decreased due to:\n\n\u2022 lower available-for-sale (\"AFS\") securities\ndriven by maturities and paydowns, predominantly\noffset by the impact of First Republic, net\npurchases, and the transfer of securities from\nheld-to-maturity (\u201cHTM\u201d) in the first\n\nquarter of 2023, and\n\n\u2022 lower HTM securities driven by maturities and\npaydowns, and the transfer of securities to AFS.\n\nRefer to Corporate segment results on pages 84\u201385,\nInvestment Portfolio Risk Management on page 134\nand Notes 2 and 10 for additional information on\ninvestment securities.\n\nLoans increased, reflecting:\n\n\u2022 $146 billion of loans associated with First\nRepublic,\n\n\u2022 growth in new accounts in Card Services, as well\nas higher revolving balances, which continued to\nnormalize to pre-pandemic levels, and\n\n\u2022 growth in Auto loans due to net originations.\n\nThe allowance for loan losses increased,\nreflecting:\n\n\u2022 a net addition to the allowance for loan losses\nof $2.2 billion, consisting of:\n\n\u2013 $1.3 billion in consumer , predominantly driven\nby CCB, reflecting $1.4 billion in Card Services\ndriven by loan growth, including an increase in\nrevolving balances, partially offset by a net\nreduction of $176 million in Home Lending, and\n\n\u2013 $930 million in wholesale , driven by net\ndowngrade activity and the net effect of changes in\nthe Firm's weighted average macroeconomic outlook,\nand\n\n\u2022 $1.1 billion to establish the allowance for the\nFirst Republic loans in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nThe allowance for loan losses also reflected a\nreduction of $587 million, on January 1, 2023, as a\nresult of the adoption of the Financial Instruments\n- Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings\naccounting guidance.\n                                             \n  58    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                             \nReferences in this Form 10-K to \"changes to the TDR\naccounting guidance\" pertain to the Firm's adoption\nof this guidance.\n\nThere was also a $408 million net reduction in the\nallowance for lending-related commitments\nrecognized in other liabilities on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets.\n\nRefer to Consolidated Results of Operations and\nCredit and Investment Risk Management on pages\n54\u201357 and pages 111\u2013134, respectively, and Notes 2,\n3, 12 and 13 for additional information on loans\nand the total allowance for credit losses; and\nBusiness Segment Results on page 67 and Note 34 for\nadditional information on the First Republic\nacquisition.\n\nAccrued interest and accounts receivable decreased\ndue to lower client receivables related to client-\ndriven activities in Markets.\n\nPremises and equipment increased as a result of the\nconstruction-in-process associated with the Firm's\nheadquarters, the First Republic acquisition,\nlargely lease right-of-use assets, and higher\ncapitalized software. Refer to Note 16 and 18 for\nadditional information.\n\nGoodwill, MSRs and other intangibles increased\npredominantly due to:\n\n\u2022 other intangibles and goodwill related to the\nacquisition of the remaining 51% interest in CIFM,\n\n\u2022 core deposit intangibles associated with the\nFirst Republic acquisition, and\n\n\u2022 higher MSRs as a result of net additions\nprimarily from

These assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the normal course of\nbusiness due to the amount and timing of cash flows, which are affected by client-driven and risk management\nactivities and market conditions. The Firm believes that cash flows from operations, available cash and\nother liquidity sources, and its capacity to generate cash through secured and unsecured sources, are\nsufficient to meet its operating liquidity needs. \u2022 In 2023, cash provided primarily reflected net income,\nlower other assets, and accrued interest and accounts receivable, predominantly offset by higher trading\nassets, lower accounts payable and other liabilities, and higher securities borrowed. \u2022 In 2022, cash\nprovided resulted from higher accounts payable and other liabilities, lower securities borrowed, and net\nproceeds from sales, securitizations, and paydowns of loans held-for-sale, partially offset by higher\ntrading assets.\n\nInvesting activities The Firm\u2019s investing activities predominantly include originating held-for-investment\nloans, investing in the investment securities portfolio and other short-term instruments. \u2022 In 2023, cash\nprovided resulted from net proceeds from investment securities, proceeds from sales and securitizations of\nloans held-for-investment and lower securities purchased under resale agreements, largely offset by net\noriginations of loans and net cash used in the First Republic Bank acquisition. \u2022 In 2022, cash used\nresulted from net originations of loans and higher securities purchased under resale agreements, partially\noffset by net proceeds from investment securities. Financing activities The Firm\u2019s financing activities\ninclude acquiring customer deposits and issuing long-term debt and preferred stock. \u2022 In 2023, cash used\nreflected lower deposits, which included the impact of the repayment of the deposits provided to First\nRepublic Bank by the consortium of large U.S. banks that the Firm assumed as part of the First Republic\nacquisition, partially offset by higher securities loaned under repurchase agreements and net proceeds from\nlong- and short-term borrowings. \u2022 In 2022, cash used reflected lower deposits, partially offset by net\nproceeds from long- and short-term borrowings. \u2022 For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of common\nstock and cash dividends on common and preferred stock. * * * Refer to Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis\non pages 58\u201360, Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101, and Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102\u2013109, and\nthe Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows on page 170 for a further discussion of the activities affecting\nthe Firm\u2019s cash flows.\n                                             \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    61  \n                                             \n                                                    \n  EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM\u2019S USE  \n  OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES                    \n                                                    \n                                                                                                            \n  Non-GAAP financial measures                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial\nStatements in accordance with U.S. GAAP; these\nfinancial statements appear on pages 166\u2013170. That\npresentation, which is referred to as \u201creported\u201d\nbasis, provides the reader with an understanding of\nthe Firm\u2019s results that can be tracked consistently\nfrom year-to-year and enables a comparison of the\nFirm\u2019s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial\nstatements of other companies.\n\nIn addition to analyzing the Firm\u2019s results on a\nreported basis, management reviews Firmwide\nresults, including the overhead ratio, on a\n\u201cmanaged\u201d basis; these Firmwide managed basis\nresults are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm\nalso reviews the results of the LOBs on a managed\nbasis. The Firm\u2019s definition of managed basis\nstarts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP\nresults and includes certain reclassifications to\npresent total net revenue for the Firm (and each of\nthe reportable business segments) on an FTE basis.\nAccordingly, revenue from investments that receive\ntax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented\nin the managed results on a basis comparable to\ntaxable investments and securities. These financial\nmeasures allow\n\nmanagement to assess the comparability of revenue\nfrom year-to-year arising from both taxable and\ntax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax\nimpact related to tax-exempt items is recorded\nwithin income tax expense. These adjustments have\nno impact on net income as reported by the Firm as\na whole or by the LOBs.\n\nManagement also uses certain non-GAAP financial\nmeasures at the Firm and business-segment level\nbecause these other non-GAAP financial measures\nprovide information to investors about the\nunderlying operational performance and trends of\nthe Firm or of the particular business segment, as\nthe case may be, and therefore facilitate a\ncomparison of the Firm or the business segment with\nthe performance of its relevant competitors. Refer\nto Business Segment Results on pages 65\u201385 for\nadditional information on these non-GAAP measures.\nNon-GAAP financial measures used by the Firm may\nnot be comparable to similarly named non-GAAP\nfinancial measures used by other companies.\n\nThe following summary table provides a\nreconciliation from the Firm\u2019s reported U.S. GAAP\nresults to managed basis.\n

reviews\nthese metrics excluding Markets, as shown below.\nMarkets consists of CIB\u2019s Fixed Income Markets and\nEquity Markets.

The\nreorganization of the business segments is expected to be effective in the second quarter of 2024. Refer to\nRecent events on page 52 for additional information.\n                                                                                                            \n   Description of business segment reporting methodology                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nResults of the business segments are intended to\npresent each segment as if it were a stand-alone\nbusiness. The management reporting process that\nderives business segment results includes the\nallocation of certain income and expense items. The\nFirm periodically assesses the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications used\nfor segment reporting, and therefore further\nrefinements may be implemented in future periods.\nThe Firm also assesses the level of capital\nrequired for each LOB on at least an annual basis.\nThe Firm\u2019s LOBs also provide various business\nmetrics which are utilized by the Firm and its\ninvestors and analysts in assessing performance.\n\nRevenue sharing\n\nWhen business segments join efforts to sell\nproducts and services to the Firm\u2019s clients and\ncustomers, the participating business segments may\nagree to share revenue from those transactions.\nRevenue is generally recognized in the segment\nresponsible for the related product or service,\nwith allocations to the other segment(s) involved\nin the transaction. The segment results reflect\nthese revenue-sharing agreements.\n\nExpense allocation\n\nWhere business segments use services provided by\ncorporate support units, or another business\nsegment, the costs of those services are allocated\nto the respective business segments. The expense is\ngenerally\n\nallocated based on the actual cost and use of\nservices provided. In contrast, certain costs and\ninvestments related to corporate support units,\ntechnology and operations that are not currently\nutilized by any LOB are not allocated to the\nbusiness segments and are retained in Corporate.\nExpense retained in Corporate generally includes\ncosts that would not be incurred if the segments\nwere stand-alone businesses, and other items not\nsolely aligned with a particular business segment.\n\nFunds transfer pricing\n\nFunds transfer pricing (\u201cFTP\u201d) is the process by\nwhich the Firm allocates interest income and\nexpense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and\ntransfers the primary interest rate risk and\nliquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.\n\nThe funds transfer pricing process considers the\ninterest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of\nassets and liabilities and off-balance sheet\nproducts. Periodically, the methodology and\nassumptions utilized in the FTP process are\nadjusted to reflect economic conditions and other\nfactors, which may impact the allocation of net\ninterest income to the segments.\n\nAs a result of the higher interest rate\nenvironment, the cost of funds for assets and the\ncredits earned for liabilities have generally\nincreased, impacting the business segments\u2019 net\ninterest income. During the period ended December\n31, 2023, this has resulted in higher cost of funds\nfor loans and\n                                             \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    65  \n                                             \nMarkets activities, and contributed to margin\nexpansion on deposits.\n\nForeign exchange risk\n\nForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs\nand Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain\nrevenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages\nthese risks centrally and reports the impact of\nforeign exchange rate movements related to the\ntransferred risk in its results. Refer to Market\nRisk Management on page 143 for additional\ninformation.\n\nDebt expense and preferred stock dividend\nallocation\n\nAs part of the funds transfer pricing process,\nalmost all of the cost of the credit spread\ncomponent of outstanding unsecured long-term debt\nand preferred stock dividends is allocated to the\nreportable business segments, while the balance of\nthe cost is retained in Corporate. The methodology\nto allocate the cost of unsecured long-term debt\nand preferred stock dividends to the business\nsegments is aligned with the relevant regulatory\ncapital requirements and funding needs of the LOBs,\nas applicable.\n\nThe allocated cost of unsecured long-term debt is\nincluded in a business segment\u2019s net interest\nincome, and net income is reduced by preferred\nstock dividends, to arrive at a business segment\u2019s\nnet income applicable to common equity.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101\nfor additional information.\n\nCapital allocation\n\nThe amount of capital assigned to each business\nsegment is referred to as equity. The Firm\u2019s\ncurrent allocation methodology incorporates Basel\nIII Standardized risk-weighted assets (\u201cRWA\u201d) and\nthe global systemically important banks (\u201cGSIB\u201d)\nsurcharge, both under rules currently in effect, as\nwell as a simulation of capital in a severe stress\nenvironment. At least annually, the assumptions,\njudgments and methodologies used to allocate\ncapital are reassessed and, as a result, the\ncapital allocated to the LOBs may change.\n\nRefer to Line of business equity on page 98 for\nadditional information on capital allocation.\n                                                                                                            \n   Segment Results

Net interchange income in Card Services\nalso reflected the impact of a reduction in rewards\ncosts and partner payments in the first quarter of\n2023 related to a periodic tax refund on airline\nmiles redeemed and an increase to the rewards\nliability due to adjustments to certain reward\nprogram terms in the second quarter of 2023;\n\n\u2022 higher travel-related commissions in Card\nServices,\n\npredominantly offset by\n\n\u2022 lower auto operating lease income as a result of\na decline in volume, and\n\n\u2022 lower mortgage fees and related income in Home\nLending.\n\nRefer to Note 6 for additional information on card\nincome,\n\nasset management fees, and commissions and other\nfees; and Critical Accounting Estimates on pages\n155\u2013158 for credit card rewards liability.\n\nRefer to Note 15 for further information regarding\nchanges in the value of the MSR asset and related\nhedges, and mortgage fees and related income.\n\nRefer to Note 34 for additional information on the\nFirst Republic acquisition.\n\nNoninterest expense was $34.8 billion, up 12%,\nreflecting:\n\n\u2022 higher compensation expense, driven by an\nincrease in employees, including the impact of\nFirst Republic in the second half of 2023 and\nadditions primarily in bankers, advisors and\ntechnology, wage inflation and higher revenue-\nrelated compensation, as well as\n\n\u2022 higher noncompensation expense, driven by the\nimpact of First Republic, investments in marketing\nand technology, the increase in the FDIC assessment\nannounced in the prior year as well as higher legal\nexpense, partially offset by lower auto lease\ndepreciation on lower auto lease assets.\n\nThe provision for credit losses was $6.9 billion,\nreflecting:\n\n\u2022 net charge-offs of $5.3 billion, up $2.6 billion,\npredominantly driven by Card Services, as the\nportfolio continued to normalize to pre-pandemic\nlevels,\n\n\u2022 a $1.2 billion net addition to the allowance for\ncredit losses, which included $1.4 billion in Card\nServices, partially offset by a net reduction of\n$200 million in Home Lending. The net addition in\nCard Services was driven by loan growth, including\nan increase in revolving balances, partially offset\nby reduced borrower uncertainty. The net reduction\nin Home Lending was driven by improvements in the\noutlook for home prices; and\n\n\u2022 $408 million to establish the allowance for the\nFirst Republic loans and lending-related\ncommitments in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nThe provision in the prior year was $3.8 billion,\ndriven by net charge-offs of $2.7 billion and a\n$1.1 billion net addition to the allowance for\ncredit losses across CCB.\n\nRefer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on\npages 111\u2013134 and Allowance for Credit Losses on\npages 131\u2013133 for a further discussion of the\ncredit portfolios and the allowance for credit\nlosses.\n                                             \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    69  \n                                             \n                                                                                                          \n  Selected metrics                                                                                        \n  As of or for the year ended                                                                             \n  December 31,                                                                                            \n  (in millions, except employees)                       2023                    2022                2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Selected balance sheet data (period-end)                                                                \n  Total assets                                $      642,951          $      514,085  $    500,370        \n  Loans:                                                                                                  \n  Banking & Wealth Management(a)                      31,142    -d            29,008        35,095        \n  Home Lending(b)                                    259,181    -d           172,554       180,529        \n  Card Services                                      211,175                 185,175       154,296        \n  Auto                                                77,705                  68,191        69,138        \n  Total loans                                        579,203                 454,928       439,058        \n  Deposits                                         1,094,738    -e         1,131,611     1,148,110        \n  Equity                                              55,500                  50,000        50,000        \n  Selected balance sheet data (average)                                                                   \n  Total assets                                $      584,367          $      497,263  $    489,771        \n  Loans:                                                                                                  \n  Banking & Wealth Management                         30,142    -f            31,545        44,906        \n  Home Lending(c)                                    232,115    -f           176,285       181,049        \n  Card Services                                      191,424                 163,335       140,405        \n  Auto                                                72,674                  68,098        67,624        \n  Total loans                                        526,355                 439,263       433,984        \n  Deposits                                         1,126,552    -g         1,162,680     1,054,956        \n  Equity                                              54,349                  50,000        50,000        \n  Employees                                          141,640                 135,347       128,863        \n                                                                                                          \n(a) At December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, included\n$94 million, $350 million and $5.4 billion of\nloans, respectively, in Business Banking under the\nPPP.

Excluding $257 million of markdowns on held-\nfor-sale positions, primarily unfunded commitments,\nin the bridge financing portfolio recorded in the\nsecond quarter of 2022, Investment Banking revenue\nwas down 8%. Investment Banking fees were down 5%,\ndriven by lower advisory and debt underwriting\nfees, partially offset by higher equity\nunderwriting fees. T he Firm ranked #1 for Global\nInvestment Banking fees, according to Dealogic.\n\n\u2013 Advisory fees were $2.8 billion , dow n 8%, due\nto a lower number of completed transactions,\nreflecting the lower level of announced deals in\nthe current and the prior year amid a challenging\nenvironment.\n\n\u2013 Debt underwriting fees were $2.6 billion, down\n8%, as challenging market conditions, primarily in\nthe first half of the year, resulted in lower\nissuance activity across leveraged loans,\ninvestment-grade loans, and high-grade bonds. This\nwas largely offset by higher issuance activity in\nhigh-yield bonds driven by higher industry-wide\nissuance.\n\n\u2013 Equity underwriting fees were $1.2 billion, up\n11%, driven by a higher level of follow-on\nofferings due to lower equity market volatility and\na higher level of convertible securities offerings\nwhich benefited from higher rates, partially offset\nby lower activity in private placements amid a\nchallenging environment.\n\n\u2022 Payments revenue was $9.3 billion, up 22%, driven\nby deposit margin expansion on higher rates and\nfees, partially offset by the higher level of\nclient credits that reduce such fees and lower\naverage deposits. The net impact of equity\ninvestments was flat reflecting net markdowns in\nboth periods, including the impact of an impairment\nin the current year.\n\n\u2022 Lending revenue was $1.0 billion, down 27%,\ndriven by $494 million of fair value losses on\nhedges of retained loans which included an increase\nin hedging activity, compared to $27 million of\ngains in the prior year, partially offset by higher\nnet interest income.\n\nMarkets & Securities Services revenue was $32.3\nbillion, down 1%. Markets revenue was $27.8\nbillion, down 4%.\n\n\u2022 Fixed Income Markets revenue was $18.8 billion,\nup 1%, driven by an increase in finance and trading\nactivity in the Securitized Products Group and\nimproved performance in Credit Trading,\npredominantly offset by lower revenue in Currencies\n& Emerging Markets as the business substantially\nnormalized from the prior year\u2019s elevated levels of\nvolatility and client activity.\n\n\u2022 Equity Markets revenue was $9.0 billion, down\n13%, driven by lower revenue in Equity Derivatives\nand Cash Equities, compared with a stronger\nperformance in the prior year.\n\n\u2022 Securities Services revenue was $4.8 billion, up\n6%, driven by deposit margin expansion on higher\nrates, largely offset by lower average deposits and\nfees.\n\n\u2022 Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $280\nmillion, compared with a loss of $836 million in\nthe prior year.\n\nNoninterest expense was $28.6 billion, up 5%,\ndriven by higher legal expense, compensation\nexpense, including the impact of wage inflation,\nand higher indirect tax expense.\n\nThe provision for credit losses was $121 million,\ndriven by net charge-offs of $272 million, up $190\nmillion, driven by single name exposures, largely\noffset by a $151 million net reduction in the\nallowance for credit losses.\n\nThe net reduction in the allowance was driven by\nthe impact of changes in the loan and lending-\nrelated commitment portfolios and the net effect of\nchanges in the Firm\u2019s weighted average\nmacroeconomic outlook, predominantly offset by an\naddition for certain accounts receivable and net\ndowngrade activity.\n\nThe provision in the prior year was $1.2 billion,\npredominantly driven by a net addition to the\nallowance for credit

Markets\nincludes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity\nMarkets. Markets revenue consists of principal\ntransactions, fees, commissions and other income,\nas well as net interest income. The Firm assesses\nits Markets business performance on a total revenue\nbasis, as offsets generally occur across revenue\nline items. For example, securities that generate\nnet interest income may be risk-managed by\nderivatives that are reflected at fair value in\nprincipal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 6\nand 7 for a description of the composition of these\nincome statement line items.\n\nPrincipal transactions reflects revenue on\nfinancial instruments and commodities transactions\nthat arise from client-driven market-making\nactivity. Principal transactions revenue includes\namounts recognized upon executing new transactions\nwith market participants, as well as \u201cinventory-\nrelated revenue\u201d, which is revenue recognized from\ngains and losses on derivatives and other\ninstruments that the Firm has been holding in\nanticipation of, or in response to, client demand,\nand changes in the fair value of instruments used\nby the Firm to actively manage the risk exposure\narising from such inventory. Principal transactions\nrevenue recognized upon executing new transactions\nwith market participants is affected by many\nfactors including the level of client activity, the\nbid-offer spread (which is the\n\ndifference between the price at which a market\nparticipant is willing and able to sell an\ninstrument to the Firm and the price at which\nanother market participant is willing and able to\nbuy it from the Firm, and vice versa), market\nliquidity and volatility. These factors are\ninterrelated and sensitive to the same factors that\ndrive inventory-related revenue, which include\ngeneral market conditions, such as interest rates,\nforeign exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity\nand commodity prices, as well as other\nmacroeconomic conditions.\n                                             \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    75  \n

Net\ninterest income was $12.1 billion, up 47%, driven by: \u2022 deposit margin expansion on higher rates, partially\noffset by lower average deposits, and \u2022 higher average loans, including the impact from First Republic.\nNoninterest revenue was $3.5 billion, up 5%, driven by: \u2022 higher lending-related revenue predominantly\ndriven by the amortization of the purchase discount on certain acquired lending-related commitments\nassociated with First Republic, \u2022 net markups on held-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in\nthe bridge financing portfolio, compared with net markdowns in the prior year, and \u2022 higher investment\nbanking revenue and card income, predominantly offset by \u2022 lower deposit-related fees due to the higher\nlevel of client credits that reduce such fees, and \u2022 the absence of a gain on an equity-method investment\nreceived in partial satisfaction of a loan. Noninterest expense was $5.4 billion, up 14%, driven by higher\ncompensation expense, reflecting an increase in employees including front office and technology, as well as\nhigher volume-related expense, including the impact of new client acquisitions. The provision for credit\nlosses was $2.0 billion, reflecting: \u2022 a $1.0 billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses,\ndriven by the net effect of changes in the Firm\u2019s weighted average macroeconomic outlook, including a\ndeterioration in the outlook for commercial real estate and net downgrade activity, partially offset by the\nimpact of changes in the loan and lending-related commitment portfolios, \u2022 $608 million to establish the\nallowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related commitments in the second quarter of 2023; and \u2022\nnet charge-offs of $316 million, up $232 million, primarily driven by Real Estate, predominantly\nconcentrated in Office.

Revenue from Asset\nManagement was $9.1 billion, up 4%, driven by: \u2022 a gain of $339 million on the original minority interest in\nCIFM upon the Firm's acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in the entity, and \u2022 higher asset management\nfees driven by strong net inflows largely offset by the net impact of foreign exchange rate movements, as\nwell as the removal of most money market fund fee waivers in the prior year, largely offset by \u2022 lower\nperformance fees, and \u2022 lower NII due to higher funding costs. Revenue from Global Private Bank was $10.7\nbillion, up 20%, driven by: \u2022 higher net interest income on higher average loans associated with First\nRepublic, and from deposit margin expansion on higher rates, largely offset by lower average deposits, and \u2022\nhigher noninterest revenue, predominantly driven by the amortization of the purchase discount on certain\nacquired lending-related commitments associated with First Republic, partially offset by net investment\nvaluation losses. Noninterest expense was $12.8 billion, up 8%, predominantly driven by higher compensation,\nincluding continued growth in private banking advisor teams, revenue-related compensation and the impacts of\nclosing the Global Shares and J.P. Morgan Asset Management China acquisitions. The provision for credit\nlosses was $159 million, predominantly driven by a $146 million addition to the allowance for credit losses\nto establish the allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related commitments in the second\nquarter of 2023. The provision in the prior year was $128 million driven by a net addition to the allowance\nfor credit losses.\n                                             \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    81  \n                                             \n                                                      \n  Asset Management has two high-level measures of     \n  its overall fund performance.                       \n  \u2022Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF    \n  assets under management in funds rated 4- or        \n  5-star:                                             \n  Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on     \n  their risk adjusted performance over various        \n  periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and     \n  represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked      \n  funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5%    \n  of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating      \n  represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked     \n  funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5%    \n  of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is   \n  the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of   \n  industrywide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar   \n  rating is derived from a weighted average of the    \n  performance associated with a fund\u2019s three-, five   \n  and ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating    \n  metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds, separate star    \n  ratings are provided at the individual share class  \n  level. The Nomura \u201cstar rating\u201d is based on         \n  three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds    \n  with fewer than three years of history are not      \n  rated and hence excluded from these rankings. All   \n  ratings, the assigned peer categories and the       \n  asset values used to derive these rankings are      \n  sourced from the applicable fund rating provider.   \n  Where applicable, the fund rating providers         \n  redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The    \n  percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the   \n  share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at  \n  a \u201cprimary share class\u201d level to represent the      \n  star rating of all other funds, except for Japan,   \n  for which Nomura provides ratings at the fund       \n  level. The performance data may have been           \n  different if all share classes had been included.   \n  Past performance is not indicative of future        \n  results.                                            \n  \u2022Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF    \n  assets under management in funds ranked in the 1st  \n  or 2nd quartile (one, three and five years):        \n  All quartile rankings, the assigned peer            \n  categories and the asset values used to derive      \n  these rankings are sourced from the fund rating     \n  providers. Quartile rankings are based on the       \n  net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where      \n  applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate  \n  asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of   \n  AUM is based on fund performance and associated     \n  peer rankings at the share class level for          \n  U.S.-domiciled funds, at a \u201cprimary share class\u201d    \n  level to represent the quartile ranking for U.K.,   \n  Luxembourg and Hong Kong SAR funds and at the fund  \n  level for all other funds. The performance data     \n  may have been different if all share classes had    \n  been included.

Net revenue was $8.0 billion, compared with $80 million in the prior year, predominantly driven by\nhigher net interest income due to higher rates, partially offset by the impact of lower Firmwide average\ndeposit balances. Noninterest revenue was $132 million, compared with a loss of $1.8 billion in the prior\nyear, driven by: \u2022 the $2.8 billion estimated bargain purchase gain associated with the First Republic\nacquisition, \u2022 higher losses in the prior year on certain revenues associated with foreign exchange rate\nmovements that are risk-managed by Treasury and CIO, and \u2022 the impact of higher short-term cash deployment\nactivities as a result of the current interest rate environment, partially offset by \u2022 higher net investment\nsecurities losses related to the sales of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, associated\nwith repositioning the investment securities portfolio, and \u2022 lower net gains related to certain other\nCorporate investments. The prior year included a gain on the sale of Visa B shares and proceeds from an\ninsurance settlement. Noninterest expense was $5.6 billion, up $4.6 billion, predominantly driven by: \u2022 the\n$2.9 billion FDIC special assessment, \u2022 $1.0 billion associated with First Republic, predominantly driven by\nintegration and restructuring costs as well as expenses recorded in the second quarter of 2023 with respect\nto individuals associated with First Republic who did not become employees of the Firm until July 2, 2023, \u2022\na greater benefit in the prior year on certain expenses associated with foreign exchange rate movements that\nare risk-managed by Treasury and CIO, \u2022 higher legal expenses, and \u2022 higher costs associated with the Firm's\ninternational consumer growth initiatives, partially offset by \u2022 lower benefits-related and real estate\nexpenses. The net impact of movements in foreign exchange rates associated with the foreign exchange risk\nthat was transferred to Treasury and CIO on certain revenues and expenses was not material to net income.\nRefer to Foreign Exchange Risk on page 66 for additional information . Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for\nadditional information on the investment securities portfolio and the allowance for credit losses.\n                                             \n  84    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                             \nThe provision for credit losses was $171 million,\nreflecting a net addition to the allowance for\ncredit losses related to a single name exposure,\nwhich was subsequently charged off upon the\nrestructuring of a loan. The current period income\ntax benefit was driven by: \u2022 the finalization of\ncertain income tax regulations, other tax\nadjustments and tax benefits associated with tax\naudit settlements, partially offset by \u2022 the impact\nfrom changes in the level and mix of income and\nexpenses subject to U.S. federal, state and local\ntaxes that also impacted the Firm's tax reserves.\nThe income taxes associated with the First Republic\nacquisition are reflected in the estimated bargain\npurchase gain. The prior period income tax benefit\nwas driven by benefits related to tax audit\nsettlements as well as other tax adjustments,\npartially offset by a change in the level and mix\nof income and expenses subject to U.S. federal,\nstate and local taxes that also impacted the Firm's\ntax reserves.

Treasury and CIO overview\nTreasury and CIO is predominantly responsible for\nmeasuring, monitoring, reporting and managing the\nFirm\u2019s liquidity, funding, capital, structural\ninterest rate and foreign exchange risks. The risks\nmanaged by Treasury and CIO arise from the\nactivities undertaken by the Firm\u2019s four major\nreportable business segments to serve their\nrespective client bases, which generate both on-\nand off-balance sheet assets and liabilities.\nTreasury and CIO seeks to achieve the Firm\u2019s asset-\nliability management objectives generally by\ninvesting in high-quality securities that are\nmanaged for the longer-term as part of the Firm\u2019s\ninvestment securities portfolio. Treasury and CIO\nalso uses derivatives to meet the Firm \u2019 s asset-\nliability management objectives. Refer to Note 5\nfor further information on derivatives. In\naddition, Treasury and CIO manages the Firm\u2019s cash\nposition primarily through deposits at central\nbanks and investments in short-term instruments.\nRefer to Liq uidity Risk Management on pages\n102\u2013109 for further information on liquidity and\nfunding risk .

When the Firm extends a\nconsumer or wholesale loan, advises customers and\nclients on their investment decisions, makes\nmarkets in securities, or offers other products or\nservices, the Firm takes on some degree of risk.\nThe Firm\u2019s overall objective is to manage its\nbusiness, and the associated risks, in a manner\nthat balances serving the interests of its clients,\ncustomers and investors, and protecting the safety\nand soundness of the Firm.\n\nThe Firm believes that effective risk management\nrequires, among other things:\n\n\u2022 Acceptance of responsibility, including\nidentification and escalation of risks by all\nindividuals within the Firm;\n\n\u2022 Ownership of risk identification, assessment,\ndata and management within each of the LOBs and\nCorporate; and\n\n\u2022 A Firmwide risk governance and oversight\nstructure.\n\nThe Firm follows a disciplined and balanced\ncompensation framework with strong internal\ngovernance and independent oversight by the Board\nof Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d). The impact of risk and\ncontrol issues is carefully considered in the\nFirm\u2019s performance evaluation and incentive\ncompensation processes.\n                                                                                                            \n  Risk governance framework                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm\u2019s risk governance framework involves\nunderstanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and\nimpacts of risks.\n\nDrivers of risks are factors that cause a risk to\nexist. Drivers of risks include, but are not\nlimited to, the economic environment, regulatory or\ngovernment policy, competitor or market evolution,\nbusiness decisions, process or judgment error,\ndeliberate wrongdoing, dysfunctional markets, and\nnatural disasters.\n\nTypes of risks are categories by which risks\nmanifest themselves. The Firm\u2019s risks are generally\ncategorized in the following four risk types:\n\n\u2022 Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital,\nliquidity, or reputation associated with poorly\ndesigned or failed business plans or an inadequate\nresponse to changes in the operating environment.\n\n\u2022 Credit and investment risk is the risk associated\nwith the default or change in credit profile of a\nclient, counterparty or customer; or loss of\nprincipal or a reduction in expected returns on\ninvestments, including consumer credit risk,\nwholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio\nrisk.\n\n\u2022 Market risk is the risk associated with the\neffect of changes in market factors, such as\ninterest and foreign exchange rates, equity and\ncommodity prices, credit spreads or implied\nvolatilities, on the value of assets and\nliabilities held for both the short and long term.\n\n\u2022 Operational risk is the risk of an adverse\noutcome resulting from inadequate or failed\ninternal processes or systems; human factors; or\nexternal events impacting the Firm\u2019s processes or\nsystems. Operational risk includes cybersecurity,\ncompliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and\nmodel risk.\n\nImpacts of risks are consequences of risks, both\nquantitative and qualitative. There may be many\nconsequences of risks manifesting, including\nquantitative impacts such as a reduction in\nearnings and capital, liquidity outflows, and fines\nor penalties, or qualitative impacts such as damage\nto the Firm\u2019s reputation, loss of clients and\ncustomers, and regulatory and enforcement actions.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s risk governance framework is managed on\na Firmwide basis. The Firm has an Independent Risk\nManagement (\u201cIRM\u201d) function, which is comprised of\nRisk Management and Compliance. The Firm\u2019s Chief\nExecutive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) appoints, subject to\napproval by the Risk Committee of the Board of\nDirectors (the \u201cBoard Risk Committee\u201d), the Firm\u2019s\nChief Risk Officer (\u201cCRO\u201d) to lead the IRM function\nand maintain the risk governance framework of the\nFirm. The framework is subject to approval by the\nBoard Risk Committee through its review and\napproval of the Risk Governance and Oversight\nPolicy.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s CRO oversees and delegates authority to\nthe Firmwide Risk Executives (\u201cFREs\u201d), the Chief\nRisk Officers of the LOBs and Corporate (\u201cLOB\nCROs\u201d), and the Firm\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer\n(\u201cCCO\u201d), who, in turn, establish Risk Management\nand Compliance organizations, develop the Firm\u2019s\nrisk governance policies and standards, and define\nand oversee the implementation of the Firm\u2019s risk\ngovernance framework. The LOB CROs oversee risks\nthat arise in their LOBs and Corporate, while FREs\noversee risks that span across the LOBs and\nCorporate, as well as functions and regions. Each\narea of the Firm giving rise to risk is expected to\noperate within the parameters identified by the IRM\nfunction, and within the risk and control standards\nestablished by its own management.\n                                                                                                            \n  Three lines of defense                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm\u2019s \u201cthree lines of defense\u201d are as follows:\n\nThe first line of defense consists of each LOB,\nTreasury and CIO, and certain Other Corporate\ninitiatives, including their aligned Operations,\nTechnology and Control Management. The first line\nof defense owns the identification of risks within\ntheir respective organizations and the design and\nexecution of controls to manage those risks.\nResponsibilities also include adherence to\napplicable laws, rules and regulations and\nimplementation of the risk\n                                             \n  86    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                             \ngovernance framework established by IRM, which may\ninclude policies, standards, limits, thresholds and\ncontrols.\n\nThe second line of defense is the IRM function,\nwhich is separate from the first line of defense\nand is responsible for independently measuring\nrisk, as well as assessing and challenging the risk\nmanagement practices of the first line of defense.\nIRM is also responsible for the identification of\nrisks within its respective organization, adherence\nto applicable laws, rules and regulations and for\nthe development and implementation of policies and\nstandards with respect to its own processes.\n\nThe third line of defense is Internal Audit, an\nindependent function that provides objective\nassessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of\nFirmwide processes, controls, governance and risk\nmanagement.

These scenarios are articulated in\nterms of macroeconomic factors, which are key\ndrivers of business results; global market shocks,\nwhich generate short-term but severe trading\nlosses; and idiosyncratic operational risk events.\nThe scenarios are intended to capture and stress\nkey vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks facing\nthe Firm. In addition to CCAR and other periodic\nstress testing, management also considers tailored\nstress scenarios and sensitivity analyses, as\nnecessary.\n                                                                                                            \n  Contingency Capital Plan                                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm\u2019s Contingency Capital Plan establishes the\ncapital management framework for the Firm and\nspecifies the principles underlying the Firm\u2019s\napproach towards capital management in normal\neconomic conditions and in stressed environments.\nThe Contingency Capital Plan defines how the Firm\ncalibrates its targeted capital levels and meets\nminimum capital requirements, monitors the ongoing\nappropriateness of planned capital distributions,\nand sets out the capital contingency actions that\nare expected to be taken or considered at various\nlevels of capital depletion during a period of\nstress.\n                                                                                                            \n  Regulatory capital                                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \nThe Federal Reserve establishes capital\nrequirements, including well-capitalized standards,\nfor the Firm as a consolidated financial holding\ncompany. The Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency (\"OCC\") establishes similar minimum\ncapital requirements and standards for the Firm\u2019s\nprincipal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nThe U.S. capital requirements generally follow the\nCapital Accord of the Basel Committee, as amended\nfrom time to time.\n\nBasel III Overview\n\nThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum\ncapital ratios and overall capital adequacy\nstandards for large and internationally active U.S.\nBHCs and banks, including the Firm and JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of regulatory\ncapital that must be held by BHCs and banks is\ndetermined by calculating RWA, which are on-balance\nsheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures,\nweighted according to risk. Under the rules\ncurrently in effect, two comprehensive approaches\nare prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized\napproach (\u201cBasel III Standardized\u201d), and an\nadvanced approach (\u201cBasel III Advanced\u201d).\n\nFor each of these risk-based capital ratios, the\ncapital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against\nthe lower of the Standardized or Advanced\napproaches compared to their respective regulatory\ncapital ratio requirements.\n\nIn July 2023, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the\nFDIC released a proposal to amend the risk-based\ncapital framework, entitled \"Regulatory capital\nrule: Amendments applicable to large banking\norganizations and to banking organizations with\nsignificant trading activity,\" which is referred to\nin this Form 10-K as \u201cU.S. Basel III proposal\u201d.\nUnder the proposal, changes to the framework would\ninclude replacement of the Advanced approach with\nan expanded risk-based approach, which would not\npermit the use of internal models for the\ncalculation of RWA, other than for market risk. In\naddition, the stress capital buffer requirement\nwould be applicable to both the expanded risk-based\napproach and the Standardized approach. The\nproposal would significantly revise risk-based\ncapital requirements for all banks with assets of\n$100 billion or more, including the Firm and other\nU.S. GSIBs. The proposed effective date is July 1,\n2025, with a three-year transition period\napplicable to the expanded risk-based approach.\nBased on the Firm's understanding of the proposal,\nas applied to its Consolidated balance sheets as of\nJune 30, 2023 (the reference date for a special\ndata collection exercise conducted by the Federal\nReserve), the estimated impact at the end of the\ntransition period would increase RWA by\napproximately 30%, which would result in an\napproximately 25% increase to CET1 capital\nnecessary to meet the Firm\u2019s CET1 ratio\nrequirement, all else equal. These estimates do not\nreflect any actions that the Firm may take to\nmitigate the impact of the rule as currently\nproposed.\n\nPending the finalization of the U.S. Basel III\nproposal, the Firm expects that it will continue to\nbuild capital above the current levels, and\ntherefore the CET1 target of 13.5% previously set\nby the Firm (which was with respect to the current\nStandardized RWA measure) is no longer meaningful.\nThe Firm's quarterly capital ratios will vary\ndependent on market conditions and other factors.\nUnder the requirements of the U.S. Basel III\nproposal, the new expanded risk-based approach,\nwhen fully phased-in, would be the Firm\u2019s binding\nconstraint.\n\nThe current Basel III rules establish capital\nrequirements for calculating credit risk RWA and\nmarket risk RWA, and in the case of Basel III\nAdvanced, operational risk RWA. Key differences in\nthe calculation of credit risk RWA between the\nStandardized and Advanced approaches are that for\nBasel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on\nrisk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the\nuse of internal credit models and parameters,\nwhereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA\nis generally based on supervisory risk-weightings\nwhich vary primarily by counterparty type and asset\nclass. Market risk RWA is generally calculated\nconsistently between Basel III Standardized and\nBasel III Advanced. In addition to the RWA\ncalculated under these approaches, the Firm may\nsupplement such amounts to\n                                             \n  92    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                             \nincorporate management judgment and feedback from\nits regulators.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Advanced Total Capital\nratio became the most binding constraint for the\nFirm\u2019s Basel III risk-based ratios, primarily\nreflecting the reduction in the Stress Capital\nBuffer requirement. However, as of December 31,\n2023, with respect to the CET1 and Tier 1 risk-\nbased ratios, the Standardized ratios are more\nbinding than the Advanced ratios.\n\nBasel III also includes a requirement for Advanced\nApproaches banking organizations, including the\nFirm, to calculate its SLR. As of the fourth\nquarter of 2023, the Firm\u2019s SLR became more binding\nthan the Basel III risk-based ratios, primarily\nreflecting the reduction in the Stress Capital\nBuffer requirement. With the increase in the GSIB\nsurcharge in the first quarter of 2024, the Firm\nexpects the risk-based ratios to revert to being\nmore binding than the SLR.\n\nRefer to page 95 for additional information on GSIB\nsurcharge and page 98 for additional information on\nSLR.\n\nOther Key Regulatory Developments\n\nGSIB Surcharge\n\nIn July 2023, the Federal Reserve also released a\nproposal to amend the calculation of the GSIB\nsurcharge. If adopted as proposed, these amendments\nwould require the Firm to assess its GSIB surcharge\non an annual basis, using the average of the\nquarterly surcharge calculations throughout the\ncalendar year, with daily averaging required for\ncertain measures within the surcharge calculation.\nSurcharge increments would be reduced from 50 bps\nto 10 bps and there would also be other technical\namendments to the Method 2 calculation. The\nproposed amendments would revise risk-based capital\nrequirements for the Firm and other U.S. GSIBs, and\nwould become effective two calendar quarters after\nthe adoption of the final rule. Refer to Risk-based\nCapital Regulatory Requirements on pages 94-95 for\nfurther information on the GSIB surcharge.\n\nTLAC and Eligible LTD Requirements\n\nIn August 2023, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and\nthe OCC released a proposal to expand the eligible\nlong-term debt (\"eligible LTD\") and clean holding\ncompany requirements under the existing total loss-\nabsorbing capacity (\"TLAC\") rule to apply to non-\nGSIB banks with $100 billion or more in total\nconsolidated assets. While U.S. GSIBs are already\nsubject to these requirements, the proposal would\nreduce the amount of LTD with remaining maturities\nof less than two years that count towards a U.S.\nGSIB's TLAC requirement. The proposal would also\nexpand the existing capital deduction framework for\nLTD issued by GSIBs to include LTD issued by non-\nGSIB banks subject to the LTD requirements.\n                                             \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    93  \n                                             \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nRisk-based Capital Regulatory Requirements\n\nThe following chart presents the Firm\u2019s Basel III\nCET1 capital ratio requirements under the Basel III\nrules currently in effect.\n\nAll banking institutions are currently required to\nhave a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-\nweighted assets.\n\nCertain banking organizations, including the Firm,\nare required to hold additional levels of capital\nto serve as a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d. The\ncapital conservation buffer incorporates a GSIB\nsurcharge, a discretionary countercyclical capital\nbuffer and a fixed capital conservation buffer of\n2.5% for Advanced regulatory capital requirements,\nas well as a variable SCB requirement, floored at\n2.5%, for Standardized regulatory capital\nrequirements.\n\nUnder the Federal Reserve\u2019s GSIB rule, the Firm is\nrequired to assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual\nbasis under two separately prescribed methods based\non data for the previous fiscal year-end, and is\nsubject to the higher of the two. \u201cMethod 1\u201d\nreflects the GSIB surcharge as prescribed by the\nBasel Committee\u2019s assessment methodology, and is\ncalculated by the Financial Stability Board (\u201cFSB\u201d)\nacross five criteria: size, cross-jurisdictional\nactivity, interconnectedness, complexity and\nsubstitutability. \u201cMethod 2\u201d, calculated by the\nFirm, modifies the Method 1 requirements to include\na measure of short-term wholesale funding in place\nof substitutability, and introduces a GSIB score\n\u201cmultiplication factor\u201d.\n                                             \n  94    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                             \nThe following table presents the Firm\u2019s effective\nGSIB surcharge for the years ended December 31,\n2024, 2023 and 2022.\n                                                   \n                   2024         2023         2022  \n  Method 1    2.5     %    2.5     %    2.0     %  \n  Method 2    4.5     %    4.0     %    3.5     %  \n                                                   \nOn November 27, 2023, the FSB released its annual list of GSIBs based upon data as of December 31, 2022,\nwhich affirmed the Firm\u2019s Method 1 GSIB surcharge of 2.5%, which will be effective January 1, 2025, unless\nthe Firm\u2019s Method 1 GSIB surcharge, as determined by the FSB, is lower based upon data as of December 31,\n2023. The Firm\u2019s Method 2 surcharge calculated using data as of December 31, 2021 is 4.5% (up from 4.0%),\nwhich became effective January 1, 2024. The Firm\u2019s estimated Method 2 surcharge calculated using data as of\nDecember 31, 2022 is 4.5%. Accordingly, based on the GSIB rule currently in effect, the Firm\u2019s effective\nGSIB surcharge increased to 4.5% on January 1, 2024. The U.S. federal regulatory capital standards include a\nframework for setting a discretionary countercyclical capital buffer taking into account the macro financial\nenvironment in which large, internationally active banks function. As of December 31, 2023, the U.S.\ncountercyclical capital buffer remained at 0%. The Federal Reserve will continue to review the buffer at\nleast annually. The buffer can be increased if the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC determine that systemic\nrisks are meaningfully above normal and can be calibrated up to an additional 2.5% of RWA subject to a\n12-month implementation period. Failure to maintain regulatory capital equal to or in excess of the risk-\nbased regulatory capital minimum plus the capital conservation buffer (inclusive of the GSIB surcharge) and\nany countercyclical buffer will result in limitations to the amount of capital that the Firm may distribute,\nsuch as through dividends and common share repurchases, as well as on discretionary bonus payments for\ncertain executive officers. Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity The Federal Reserve\u2019s TLAC rule requires the U.S.\nGSIB top-tier holding companies, including the Firm, to maintain minimum levels of external TLAC and\neligible LTD. Refer to TLAC on page 100 for additional information.\n\nLeverage-based Capital Regulatory Requirements Supplementary leverage ratio Banking organizations subject to\nthe Basel III Advanced approach are currently required to have a minimum SLR of 3.0%. Certain banking\norganizations, including the Firm, are also required to hold an additional 2.0% leverage buffer. The SLR is\ndefined as Tier 1 capital under Basel III divided by the Firm\u2019s total leverage exposure. Total leverage\nexposure is calculated by taking the Firm\u2019s total average on-balance sheet assets, less amounts permitted to\nbe deducted for Tier 1 capital, and adding certain off-balance sheet exposures, as defined in regulatory\ncapital rules. Refer to SLR on page 98 for additional information. Failure to maintain an SLR equal to or\ngreater than the regulatory requirement will result in limitations on the amount of capital that the Firm\nmay distribute such as through dividends and common share repurchases, as well as on discretionary bonus\npayments for certain executive officers. Other regulatory capital In addition to meeting the capital ratio\nrequirements of Basel III, the Firm and its principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. must also\nmaintain minimum capital and leverage ratios in order to be \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d under the regulations issued\nby the Federal Reserve and the Prompt Corrective Action requirements of the FDIC Improvement Act,\nrespectively. Refer to Note 27 for additional information.

Line of business equity\nEach business segment is allocated capital by\ntaking into consideration a variety of factors\nincluding capital levels of similarly rated peers\nand applicable regulatory capital requirements. ROE\nis measured and internal targets for expected\nreturns are established as key measures of a\nbusiness segment\u2019s performance. The Firm\u2019s current\nallocation methodology incorporates Basel III\nStandardized RWA and the GSIB surcharge, both\n\nunder rules currently in effect, as well as a\nsimulation of capital in a severe stress\nenvironment. At least annually, the assumptions,\njudgments and methodologies used to allocate\ncapital are reassessed and, as a result, the\ncapital allocated to the LOBs may change.

Contingency funding plan\nThe Firm\u2019s Contingency Funding Plan (\u201cCFP\u201d) sets\nout the strategies for addressing and managing\nliquidity resource needs during a liquidity stress\nevent and incorporates liquidity risk limits,\nindicators and risk appetite tolerances. The CFP\nalso identifies the alternative contingent funding\nand liquidity resources available to the Firm and\nits legal entities in a period of stress. LCR and\nHQLA The LCR rule requires that the Firm and\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of\neligible HQLA that is sufficient to meet their\nrespective estimated total net cash outflows over a\nprospective 30 calendar-day period of significant\nstress. Eligible HQLA, for purposes of calculating\nthe LCR, is the amount of unencumbered HQLA that\nsatisfy certain operational considerations as\ndefined in the LCR rule. HQLA primarily consist of\ncash and certain high-quality liquid securities as\ndefined in the LCR rule. Under the LCR rule, the\namount of eligible HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand-alone\n100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not\ntransferable to non-bank affiliates, must be\nexcluded from the Firm\u2019s reported eligible HQLA.\nEstimated net cash outflows are based on\nstandardized stress outflow and inflow rates\nprescribed in the LCR rule, which are applied to\nthe balances of the Firm\u2019s assets, sources of\nfunds, and obligations. The LCR for both the Firm\nand JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a\nminimum of 100%.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Firm and\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s average LCR for the\nthree months ended December 31, 2023, September 30,\n2023 and December 31, 2022 based on the Firm\u2019s\ninterpretation of the LCR framework.\n                                                                                                         \n  Average amount                    Three months ended                                  December 31,     \n  (in millions)                      December 31, 2023        September 30, 2023                2022     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co.:                                                                                  \n  HQLA                                                                                                   \n  Eligible cash(a)               $             485,263     $             402,663     $       542,847     \n  Eligible securities(b)(c)                    313,365                   378,702             190,201     \n  Total HQLA(d)                  $             798,628     $             781,365     $       733,048     \n  Net cash outflows              $             704,857     $             696,668     $       652,580     \n  LCR                                              113  %                    112  %              112  %  \n  Net excess eligible HQLA(d)    $              93,771     $              84,697     $        80,468     \n  JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.:                                                                             \n  LCR                                              129  %                    123  %              151  %  \n  Net excess eligible HQLA       $             215,190     $             167,096     $       356,733     \n                                                                                                         \n(a) Represents cash on deposit at central banks,\nprimarily the Federal Reserve Banks.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s average LCR for\nthe three months ended December 31, 2023 decreased\ncompared with the three months ended December 31,\n2022, reflecting a decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A.\u2019s HQLA as a result of a reduction in cash due\nto a decline in average deposits and loan growth,\nas well as the impact of First Republic and lower\nmarket values of HQLA-eligible investment\nsecurities. These impacts were partially offset by\nCIB markets activities.

Each of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A.'s average LCR may fluctuate from period to\nperiod due to changes in their respective eligible\nHQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of\nongoing business activity and from the continued\nimpacts of Federal Reserve actions as well as other\nfactors. Refer to the Firm\u2019s U.S. LCR Disclosure\nreports, which are available on the Firm\u2019s website,\nfor a further discussion of the Firm\u2019s LCR.\n                                                                                                            \n  Liquidity sources                                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \nIn addition to the assets reported in the Firm\u2019s\neligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had\nunencumbered marketable securities, such as equity\nand debt securities, that the Firm believes would\nbe available to raise liquidity. This includes\nexcess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank\naffiliates. The fair value of these securities was\napproximately $649 billion and $694 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, although\nthe amount of liquidity that could be raised at any\nparticular time would be dependent on prevailing\nmarket conditions. The decrease compared to\nDecember 31, 2022, was driven by a reduction in\nexcess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A., partially offset by an increase in\nunencumbered AFS securities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Firm had\napproximately $1.4 trillion of available cash and\nsecurities comprised of eligible end-of-period\nHQLA, excluding the impact of regulatory haircuts\nof $798.0 billion and $735.5 billion, respectively,\nand unencumbered marketable securities with a fair\nvalue of approximately $649 billion and $694\nbillion, respectively.\n\nThe Firm also had available borrowing capacity at\nthe Federal Home Loan Banks (\u201cFHLBs\u201d) and the\ndiscount window at the Federal Reserve Banks as a\nresult of collateral pledged by the Firm to such\nbanks of approximately $340 billion and $323\nbillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the\nbenefit of cash and securities reported in the\nFirm\u2019s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered\nsecurities that are currently pledged at the\nFederal Reserve Banks discount window and other\ncentral banks. Available borrowing capacity\nincreased from December 31, 2022 primarily due to a\nhigher amount of wholesale loans pledged at the\nFederal Reserve Banks. Although available, the Firm\ndoes not view this borrowing capacity at the\nFederal Reserve Banks discount window and the other\ncentral banks as a primary source of liquidity.\n                                                                                                            \n  NSFR                                                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nThe net stable funding ratio (\u201cNSFR\u201d) is a\nliquidity requirement for large banking\norganizations that is intended to measure the\nadequacy of \u201cavailable\u201d stable funding that is\nsufficient to meet their \u201crequired\u201d amounts of\nstable funding over a one-year horizon.\n\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2023, both\nthe Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were\ncompliant with the 100% minimum NSFR requirement,\nbased on the Firm\u2019s interpretation of the final\nrule.

A significant\nportion of the Firm\u2019s deposits are consumer\ndeposits and wholesale operating deposits, which\nare both considered to be stable sources of\nliquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are\ngenerally considered to be stable sources of\nliquidity because they are generated from customers\nthat maintain operating service relationships with\nthe Firm.\n\nThe Firm believes that average deposit balances are\ngenerally more representative of deposit trends\nthan period-end deposit balances. However, during\nperiods of market disruption, average deposit\ntrends may be impacted.\n\nAverage deposits were lower for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, reflecting the net impact of:\n\n\u2022 lower balances in AWM due to continued migration\ninto higher-yielding investments driven by the\nhigher interest rate environment, partially offset\nby growth from new and existing customers as a\nresult of new product offerings and the impact of\nFirst Republic,\n\n\u2022 a decline in CCB reflecting higher customer\nspending, largely offset by the impact of First\nRepublic,\n\n\u2022 a decrease in CB due to continued deposit\nattrition as clients seek higher-yielding\ninvestments, partially offset by the retention of\ninflows associated with disruptions in the market\nin the first quarter of 2023,\n\n\u2022 a decline in CIB due to deposit attrition,\nincluding actions taken to reduce certain deposits,\npredominantly offset by\n\nnet issuances of structured notes as a result of\nclient demand, and\n\n\u2022 growth in Corporate related to the Firm's\ninternational consumer initiatives.\n\nPeriod-end deposits increased from December 31,\n2022, reflecting the net impact of:\n\n\u2022 higher balances in CIB due to net issuances of\nstructured notes as a result of client demand, as\nwell as deposit inflows from client-driven\nactivities in Payments and Securities Services,\npartially offset by deposit attrition, including\nactions taken to reduce certain deposits,\n\n\u2022 growth in Corporate related to the Firm's\ninternational consumer initiatives,\n\n\u2022 lower balances in CCB reflecting higher customer\nspending,\n\n\u2022 a decline in AWM due to continued migration into\nhigher-yielding investments driven by the higher\ninterest rate environment, predominantly offset by\ngrowth from new and existing customers as a result\nof new product offerings, and\n\n\u2022 a decrease in CB due to continued deposit\nattrition as clients seek higher-yielding\ninvestments, predominantly offset by the retention\nof inflows associated with disruptions in the\nmarket in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThe net increase also included $61 billion of\ndeposits associated with First Republic, primarily\nreflected in CCB, AWM and CB.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    105  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nRefer to Business Segment Results on pages 65\u201385\nand Note 34 for additional information on the First\nRepublic acquisition.

Refer to Note\n3 for further information on structured notes.\nCertain deposits are covered by insurance\nprotection that provides additional funding\nstability and results in a benefit to the LCR.\nDeposit insurance protection may be available to\ndepositors in the countries in which the deposits\nare placed. For example, the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) provides deposit\ninsurance protection for deposits placed in a U.S.\ndepository institution. At December 31, 2023 and\n2022, the Firmwide estimated uninsured deposits\nwere $1,331.9 billion and $1,383.7 billion,\nrespectively, primarily reflecting wholesale\noperating deposits.\n\nTotal uninsured deposits include time deposits. The\ntable below presents an estimate of uninsured U.S.\nand non-U.S. time deposits, and their remaining\nmaturities. The Firm\u2019s estimates of its uninsured\nU.S. time deposits are based on data that the Firm\ncalculates periodically under applicable FDIC\nregulations.

The Firm\u2019s\nlong-term funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations and\nregulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification,\nmaximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors\nand currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan.\n\nThe significant majority of the Firm\u2019s total outstanding long-term debt has been issued by the Parent\nCompany to provide flexibility in support of the funding needs of both bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The\nParent Company advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not\nissue debt to external counterparties.

The Firm\nbelieves that it\n\nmaintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a\npotential decrease in funding capacity due to\nratings downgrades.\n\nAdditionally, the Firm\u2019s funding requirements for\nVIEs and other third-party commitments may be\nadversely affected by a decline in credit ratings.\nRefer to Note 5 and Note 14 for additional\ninformation.\n\nThe credit ratings of the Parent Company and the\nFirm\u2019s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as\nof December 31, 2023, were as follows:\n                                                                                                            \n                                                                               J.P.                         \n                                                                               Morgan                       \n                                                                               Secur\u2026                       \n                                                                               LLC                          \n                                                                               J.P.                         \n                                                                               Morgan                       \n                                                                               Secur\u2026                       \n                                         JPMorg\u2026                               plc                          \n           JPMor\u2026                        Chase                                 J.P.                         \n           Chase                         Bank,                                 Morgan                       \n  Dece\u2026    & Co.

The Firm provides credit\nto a variety of clients and customers, ranging from\nlarge corporate and institutional clients to\nindividual consumers and small businesses. In its\nconsumer businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit\nrisk primarily through its home lending, credit\ncard, auto, and business banking businesses. In its\nwholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit\nrisk through its underwriting, lending, market-\nmaking, and hedging activities with and for clients\nand counterparties, as well as through its\noperating services activities (such as cash\nmanagement and clearing activities), and securities\nfinancing activities. The Firm is also exposed to\ncredit risk through its investment securities\nportfolio and cash placed with banks.\n\nCredit Risk Management monitors, measures and\nmanages credit risk throughout the Firm and defines\ncredit risk policies and procedures. The Firm\u2019s\ncredit risk management governance includes the\nfollowing activities:\n\n\u2022 Maintaining a credit risk policy framework\n\n\u2022 Monitoring, measuring and managing credit risk\nacross all portfolio segments, including\ntransaction and exposure approval\n\n\u2022 Setting industry and geographic concentration\nlimits, as appropriate, and establishing\nunderwriting guidelines\n\n\u2022 Assigning and managing credit approval\nauthorities in connection with the approval of\ncredit exposure\n\n\u2022 Managing criticized exposures and delinquent\nloans, and\n\n\u2022 Estimating credit losses and supporting\nappropriate credit risk-based capital management\n                                                                                                            \n  Risk identification and measurement                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \nTo measure credit risk, the Firm employs several\nmethodologies for estimating the likelihood of\nobligor or counterparty default. Methodologies for\nmeasuring credit risk vary depending on several\nfactors, including type of asset (e.g., consumer\nversus wholesale), risk measurement parameters\n(e.g., delinquency status and borrower\u2019s credit\nscore versus wholesale risk-rating) and risk\nmanagement and collection processes (e.g., retail\ncollection center versus centrally managed workout\ngroups). Credit risk measurement is based on the\nprobability of default of an obligor or\ncounterparty, the loss severity given a default\nevent and the exposure at default.\n\nBased on these factors and the methodology and\nestimates described in Note 13 and Note 10, the\nFirm estimates credit losses for its exposures. The\nallowance for loan losses reflects estimated credit\nlosses related to the consumer and wholesale held-\nfor-investment loan portfolios, the allowance for\nlending-related commitments reflects estimated\ncredit losses related to the Firm\u2019s lending-related\ncommitments and the allowance for investment\nsecurities reflects estimated credit losses related\nto the investment securities portfolio. Refer to\nNote 13, Note 10 and Critical Accounting Estimates\nused by the Firm on pages 155\u2013158 for further\ninformation.\n\nIn addition, potential and unexpected credit losses\nare reflected in the allocation of credit risk\ncapital and represent the potential volatility of\nactual losses relative to the established\nallowances for loan losses and lending-related\ncommitments. The analyses for these losses include\nstress testing that considers alternative economic\nscenarios as described below.\n                                                                                                            \n  Stress testing                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \nStress testing is important in measuring and\nmanaging credit risk in the Firm\u2019s credit\nportfolio. The stress testing process assesses the\npotential impact of alternative economic and\nbusiness scenarios on estimated credit losses for\nthe Firm. Economic scenarios and the underlying\nparameters are defined centrally, articulated in\nterms of macroeconomic factors and applied across\nthe businesses. The stress test results may\nindicate credit migration, changes in delinquency\ntrends and potential losses in the credit\nportfolio. In addition to the periodic stress\ntesting processes, management also considers\nadditional stresses outside these scenarios,\nincluding industry and country- specific stress\nscenarios, as appropriate. The Firm uses stress\ntesting to inform decisions on setting risk\nappetite both at a Firm and LOB level, as well as\nto assess the impact of stress on individual\ncounterparties.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    111  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Risk monitoring and management                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm has developed policies and practices that\nare designed to preserve the independence and\nintegrity of the approval and decision-making\nprocess for extending credit so that credit risks\nare assessed accurately, approved properly,\nmonitored regularly and managed actively at both\nthe transaction and portfolio levels.

Historical and forecasted economic\nperformance and trends are incorporated into the\nmodeling of estimated consumer credit losses and\nare part of the monitoring of the credit risk\nprofile of the portfolio.\n\nWholesale credit risk is monitored regularly at an\naggregate portfolio, industry, and individual\nclient and counterparty level with established\nconcentration limits that are reviewed and revised\nperiodically as deemed appropriate by management.\nIndustry and counterparty limits, as measured in\nterms of exposure and economic risk appetite, are\nsubject to stress-based loss constraints.\n\nManagement of the Firm\u2019s wholesale credit risk\nexposure is accomplished through a number of means,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 Loan underwriting and credit approval processes\n\n\u2022 Loan syndications and participations\n\n\u2022 Loan sales and securitizations\n\n\u2022 Credit derivatives\n\n\u2022 Master netting agreements, and\n\n\u2022 Collateral and other risk-reduction techniques\n\nIn addition to Credit Risk Management, an\nindependent Credit Review function is responsible\nfor:\n\n\u2022 I ndependently assessing risk grades assigned to\nexposures in the Firm\u2019s wholesale credit portfolio\nand the timeliness of risk grade changes initiated\nby responsible business units; and\n\n\u2022 Evaluating the effectiveness of the credit\nmanagement processes of the LOBs and Corporate,\nincluding the adequacy of credit analyses and risk\ngrading/loss given default (\u201cLGD\u201d) rationales,\nproper monitoring and management of credit\nexposures, and compliance with applicable grading\npolicies and underwriting guidelines.\n\nRefer to Note 12 for further discussion of consumer\nand wholesale loans.\n                                                                                                            \n  Risk reporting                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \nTo enable monitoring of credit risk and effective\ndecision-making, aggregate credit exposure, credit\nquality forecasts, concentration levels and risk\nprofile changes are reported regularly to senior\nmembers of Credit Risk Management. Detailed\nportfolio reporting of industry, clients,\ncounterparties and customers, product and geography\nare prepared, and the appropriateness of the\nallowance for credit losses is reviewed by senior\nmanagement at least on a quarterly basis. Through\nthe risk reporting and governance structure, credit\nrisk trends and limit exceptions are provided\nregularly to, and discussed with, risk committees,\nsenior management and the Board of Directors.\n                                              \n  112    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                    \n  CREDIT PORTFOLIO  \n                    \nCredit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or\ncustomer.

The new guidance requires disclosure of loan modifications to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty consisting of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction,\nother-than-insignificant payment delay, term extension or a combination of these modifications. The Firm has\ndefined these types of modifications as financial difficulty modifications (\"FDMs\"). As a result of the\nelimination of the requirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a\nconcession, the population of loans considered FDMs differs from the population previously considered TDRs.\nRefer to Note 1 and Note 12 for further information.\n

The following discussions provide\ninformation concerning individual loan products.\nRefer to Note 12 for further information about this\nportfolio, including information about\ndelinquencies, loan modifications and other credit\nquality indicators. Residential real estate: The\nresidential real estate portfolio, including loans\nheld-for-sale and loans at fair value,\npredominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and\nhome equity lines of credit. Retained loans\nincreased compared to December 31, 2022 driven by\nresidential real estate loans associated with First\nRepublic. Retained nonaccrual loans decreased\ncompared to December 31, 2022 predominantly driven\nby loan sales, partially offset by the net impact\nof paydowns and additions, including those\nassociated with First Republic. Net recoveries were\nlower for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared\nto the prior year driven by lower prepayments due\nto higher interest rates. Loans at fair value\nincreased from December 31, 2022, driven by an\nincrease in Home Lending as originations outpaced\nwarehouse loan sales, and in CIB as purchases\noutpaced sales and paydowns. At December 31, 2023\nand 2022, the carrying values of interest-only\nresidential mortgage loans were $90.6 billion and\n$36.3 billion, respectively. The increase was\ndriven by First Republic. These loans have an\ninterest-only payment period generally followed by\nan adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing\npayment period to maturity and are typically\noriginated as higher-balance loans to higher-income\nborrowers. The credit performance of this portfolio\nis comparable with the performance of the broader\nprime mortgage portfolio. The carrying value of\nhome equity lines of credit outstanding was $16.1\nbillion at December 31, 2023, which included $2.6\nbillion associated with First Republic. The\ncarrying value of home equity lines of credit\noutstanding included $4.2 billion of HELOCs that\nhave recast from interest-only to fully amortizing\npayments or have been modified and $4.3 billion of\ninterest-only balloon HELOCs, which primarily\nmature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk of\nHELOCs during their revolving period by closing or\nreducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted\nby law when borrowers are exhibiting a material\ndeterioration in their credit risk profile.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the\nFirm\u2019s residential mortgage portfolio insured\nand/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies,\npredominantly loans held-for-sale and loans at fair\nvalue.

In addition to FDMs, the\nFirm also had $69 million of loans subject to trial\nmodification where the terms of the loans have not\nbeen permanently modified, as well as $9 million of\nloans subject to discharge under Chapter 7\nbankruptcy proceedings (\"Chapter 7 loans\"). The\nchanges to the TDR accounting guidance eliminated\nthe TDR reasonably expected and concession\nassessment criteria. Accordingly, trial\nmodifications and Chapter 7 loans were considered\nTDRs, but not FDMs. Refer to Note 1 and Note 12 for\nfurther information.

The portfolio increased when compared\nto December 31, 2022 due to originations of scored\nauto loans and an increase in other consumer\nunsecured fair value option loans in CIB associated\nwith First Republic, largely offset by paydowns.\nNet charge-offs for the year ended December 31,\n2023 increased compared to the prior year due to\nhigher charge-offs of scored auto loans driven by\nthe decline in used vehicle valuations.

The December 31, 2023 30+ and\n90+ day delinquency rates of 2.14% and 1.05%,\nrespectively, increased compared to the December\n31, 2022 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.45%\nand 0.68%, respectively. Net charge-offs increased\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to\nthe prior year as delinquencies have normalized.\n\nConsistent with the Firm\u2019s policy, all credit card\nloans typically remain on accrual status until\ncharged off. However, the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan\nlosses includes the estimated uncollectible portion\nof accrued and billed interest and fee income.\n\nGeographic and FICO composition of credit card\nloans\n\nAt December 31, 2023, $98.1 billion, or 46% of the\ntotal retained credit card loan portfolio, was\nconcentrated in California, Texas, New York,\nFlorida and Illinois, compared with $85.4 billion,\nor 46%, at December 31, 2022.\n                                                                                                            \n  Modifications of credit card loans                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, credit card\nFDMs were $648 million. FDMs increased for the year\nended December 31, 2023 compared to credit card\nTDRs in the prior year, as delinquencies have\nnormalized. In addition to FDMs, the Firm also had\n$27 million of loans subject to trial modification\nwhere the terms of the loans have not been\npermanently modified for the year ended December\n31, 2023. The changes to the TDR accounting\nguidance eliminated the TDR reasonably expected and\nconcession assessment criteria. Accordingly, trial\nmodifications were considered TDRs, but not FDMs.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, credit card\nTDRs were $418 million.\n\nRefer to Note 1 and Note 12 for further information\nabout this portfolio, including information about\ndelinquencies, geographic and FICO composition, and\nmodifications.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    119  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n                              \n  WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO  \n                              \nIn its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending,\nmarket-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various\noperating services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and\ncash placed with banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm\u2019s wholesale businesses is\ngenerally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it\noriginates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations\nand credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth\nreviews of client credit quality and transaction structure, inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of\nindustry, product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 122\u2013125 for further\ninformation. The Firm\u2019s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM, and Corporate,\nand risk-rated exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the\nallowance for loan losses. The Firm continues to convert certain operations, and to integrate clients,\nproducts and services, associated with First Republic. Accordingly, reporting classifications and internal\nrisk rating profiles in the wholesale portfolio may change in future periods. Refer to Business Developments\non page 53 for additional information. As of December 31, 2023, retained loans increased $68.8 billion\npredominantly driven by the impact of First Republic. Lending-related commitments increased $64.8 billion,\ndriven by the impact of First Republic, and net portfolio activity in CIB and CB. As of December 31, 2023,\nnonperforming exposure increased $476 million predominantly driven by nonperforming retained loans in Real\nEstate and Healthcare, reflecting downgrades, and Individuals largely driven by the impact of First\nRepublic, partially offset by a single name upgrade in Civic Organizations. For the year ended December 31,\n2023, wholesale net charge-offs increased $698 million, predominantly driven by the restructuring of a loan,\nincreases in Real Estate (concentrated in Office) and

                         \nThe Firm uses lending-related financial\ninstruments, such as commitments (including\nrevolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to\naddress the financing needs of its clients. The\ncontractual amounts of these financial instruments\nrepresent the maximum possible credit risk should\nthe clients draw down on these commitments or when\nthe Firm fulfills its obligations under these\nguarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to\nperform according to the terms of these contracts.\nMost of these commitments and guarantees have\nhistorically been refinanced, extended, cancelled,\nor expired without being drawn upon or a default\noccurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe\nthat the total contractual amount of these\nwholesale lending-related commitments is\nrepresentative of the Firm\u2019s expected future credit\nexposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28\nfor further information on wholesale lending-\nrelated commitments.\n                                                                                                            \n  Receivables from customers                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nReceivables from customers reflect held-for-\ninvestment margin loans to brokerage clients in\nCIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets\nmaintained in the clients\u2019 brokerage accounts\n(including cash on deposit, and primarily liquid\nand readily marketable debt or equity securities).\nTo manage its credit risk, the Firm establishes\nmargin requirements and monitors the required\nmargin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires\nclients to deposit additional cash or other\ncollateral, or to reduce positions, when\nappropriate. Credit risk arising from lending\nactivities subject to collateral maintenance\nrequirements is generally mitigated by factors such\nas the short-term nature of the activity, the fair\nvalue of collateral held and the Firm\u2019s right to\ncall for, and the borrower\u2019s obligation to provide,\nadditional margin when the fair value of the\ncollateral declines. Because of these mitigating\nfactors, these receivables generally do not require\nan allowance for credit losses. However, if in\nmanagement\u2019s judgment, an allowance for credit\nlosses is required, the Firm estimates expected\ncredit losses based on the value of the collateral\nand probability of borrower default. These\nreceivables are reported within accrued interest\nand accounts receivable on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated\nbalance sheets.\n\nRefer to Note 13 for further information on the\nFirm\u2019s accounting policies for the allowance for\ncredit losses.\n                                                                                                            \n  Derivative contracts                                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to\nmanage risk, including credit risk and risks\narising from fluctuations in interest rates,\nforeign exchange and equities and commodities\nprices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in\norder to meet these needs and uses derivatives to\nmanage certain risks associated with net open risk\npositions from its market-making activities,\nincluding the counterparty credit risk arising from\nderivative receivables. The Firm also uses\nderivative instruments to manage its own credit\nrisk and other market risk exposure. The nature of\nthe counterparty and the settlement mechanism of\nthe derivative affect the credit risk to which the\nFirm is exposed. For OTC derivatives, the Firm is\nexposed to the credit risk of the derivative\ncounterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives\n(\u201cETD\u201d), such as futures and options, and cleared\nover-the-counter (\u201cOTC-cleared\u201d) derivatives, the\nFirm can also be exposed to the\n\ncredit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible,\nthe Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk\nexposures arising from derivative contracts through\nthe use of legally enforceable master netting\narrangements and collateral agreements. The\npercentage of the Firm\u2019s OTC derivative\ntransactions subject to collateral agreements \u2014\nexcluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are\nnot typically covered by collateral agreements due\nto their short maturity and centrally cleared\ntrades that are settled daily \u2014 was approximately\n87% at both December 31, 2023 and 2022. Refer to\nNote 5 for additional information on the Firm\u2019s use\nof collateral agreements and further discussion of\nderivative contracts, counterparties and settlement\ntypes.\n\nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported\non the Consolidated balance sheets was $54.9\nbillion and $70.9 billion at December 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively. The decrease was primarily as a\nresult of market movements. Derivative receivables\nrepresent the fair value of the derivative\ncontracts after giving effect to legally\nenforceable master netting agreements and the\nrelated cash collateral held by the Firm.\n\nIn addition, the Firm holds liquid securities and\nother cash collateral that may be used as security\nwhen the fair value of the client\u2019s exposure is in\nthe Firm\u2019s favor. For these purposes, the\ndefinition of liquid securities is consistent with\nthe definition of high quality liquid assets as\ndefined in the LCR rule.\n\nIn management\u2019s view, the appropriate measure of\ncurrent credit risk should also take into\nconsideration other collateral, which generally\nrepresents securities that do not qualify as high\nquality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The\nbenefits of these additional collateral amounts for\neach counterparty are subject to a legally\nenforceable master netting agreement and limited to\nthe net amount of the derivative receivables for\neach counterparty.\n\nThe Firm also holds additional collateral\n(primarily cash, G7 government securities, other\nliquid government agency and guaranteed securities,\nand corporate debt and equity securities) delivered\nby clients at the initiation of transactions, as\nwell as collateral related to contracts that have a\nnon-daily call frequency and collateral that the\nFirm has agreed to return but has not yet settled\nas of the reporting date. Although this collateral\ndoes not reduce the receivables balances and is not\nincluded in the tables below, it is available as\nsecurity against potential exposure that could\narise should the fair value of the client\u2019s\nderivative contracts move in the Firm\u2019s favor.\nRefer to Note 5 for additional information on the\nFirm\u2019s use of collateral agreements for derivative\ntransactions.\n                                              \n  128    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nThe following tables summarize the net derivative\nreceivables and the internal ratings profile for\nthe periods presented.\n                                                                             \n  Derivative receivables                                                     \n  December 31, (in millions)                         2023              2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Total, net of cash collateral          $   54,864        $   70,880        \n  Liquid securities and other cash                                           \n  collateral held against derivative        -22,461           -23,014        \n  receivables                                                                \n  Total, net of liquid securities and    $   32,403        $   47,866        \n  other cash collateral                                                      \n  held against derivative receivables          -993            -1,261        \n  Total, net of collateral               $   31,410        $   46,605        \n                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \n  Ratings                                                                                                   \n  profile of                                                                                                \n  derivative                                                                                                \n  receivables                                                                                               \n  December 31,                    2023       % of exposure                     2022       % of exposure     \n  (in millions,        Exposure net of                 net          Exposure net of                 net     \n  except ratios)            collateral       of collateral               collateral       of collateral     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Investment-gr\u2026    $           24,004                  76  %    $           35,097                  75  %  \n  Noninvestment\u2026                 7,406                  24                   11,508                  25     \n  Total             $           31,410                 100  %    $           46,605                 100  %  \n                                                                                                            \nWhile useful as a current view of credit exposure,\nthe net fair value of the derivative receivables\ndoes not capture the potential future variability\nof that credit exposure. To capture this\nvariability, the Firm calculates, on a client-by-\nclient basis, three measures of potential\nderivatives-related credit loss: Peak, Derivative\nRisk Equivalent (\u201cDRE\u201d), and Average exposure\n(\u201cAVG\u201d). These measures all incorporate netting and\ncollateral benefits, where applicable.\n\nPeak represents a conservative measure of potential\nderivative exposure, including the benefit of\ncollateral, to a counterparty calculated in a\nmanner that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5%\nconfidence level over the life of the transaction.\nPeak is the primary measure used by the Firm for\nsetting credit limits for derivative contracts,\nsenior management reporting and derivatives\nexposure management.\n\nDRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk\nof derivative exposure, including the benefit of\ncollateral, on a basis intended to be equivalent to\nthe risk of loan exposures. DRE is a less extreme\nmeasure of potential credit loss than Peak and is\nused as an input for aggregating derivative credit\nrisk exposures with loans and other credit risk.\n\nFinally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair\nvalue of the Firm\u2019s derivative exposures, including\nthe benefit of collateral, at future time periods.\nAVG over the total life of the derivative contract\nis used as the primary metric for pricing purposes\nand is used to calculate credit risk capital and\nCVA, as further described below.\n\nThe fair value of the Firm\u2019s derivative receivables\nincorporates CVA to reflect the credit quality of\ncounterparties. CVA is based on the Firm\u2019s AVG to a\ncounterparty and the counterparty\u2019s credit spread\nin the credit derivatives market. The Firm believes\nthat active risk management is essential to\ncontrolling the dynamic credit risk in the\nderivatives portfolio. In addition, the Firm\u2019s risk\nmanagement process for derivatives exposures takes\ninto consideration the potential impact of wrong-\nway risk, which\n\nis broadly defined as the risk that exposure to a\ncounterparty is positively correlated with the\nimpact of a default by the same counterparty, which\ncould cause exposure to increase at the same time\nas the counterparty\u2019s capacity to meet its\nobligations is decreasing. Many factors may\ninfluence the nature and magnitude of these\ncorrelations over time. To the extent that these\ncorrelations are identified, the Firm may adjust\nthe CVA associated with a particular counterparty\u2019s\nAVG. The Firm risk manages exposure to changes in\nCVA by entering into credit derivative contracts,\nas well as interest rate, foreign exchange, equity\nand commodity derivative contracts.\n\nThe below graph shows exposure profiles to the\nFirm\u2019s current derivatives portfolio over the next\n10 years as calculated by the Peak, DRE and AVG\nmetrics.

The credit derivatives used in credit\nportfolio management activities do not qualify for\nhedge accounting under U.S. GAAP; these derivatives\nare reported at fair value, with gains and losses\nrecognized in principal transactions revenue. In\ncontrast, the loans and lending-related commitments\nbeing risk-managed are accounted for on an accrual\nbasis. This asymmetry in accounting treatment,\nbetween loans and lending-related commitments and\nthe credit derivatives used in credit portfolio\nmanagement activities, causes earnings volatility\nthat is not representative, in the Firm\u2019s view, of\nthe true changes in value of the Firm\u2019s overall\ncredit exposure. The effectiveness of credit\ndefault swaps (\u201cCDS\u201d) as a hedge against the Firm\u2019s\nexposures may vary depending on a number of\nfactors, including the named reference entity\n(i.e., the Firm may experience losses on specific\nexposures that are different than the named\nreference entities in the purchased CDS); the\ncontractual terms of the CDS (which may have a\ndefined credit event that does not align with an\nactual loss realized by the Firm); and the maturity\nof the Firm\u2019s CDS protection (which in some cases\nmay be shorter than the Firm\u2019s exposures). However,\nthe Firm generally seeks to purchase credit\nprotection with a maturity date that is the same or\nsimilar to the maturity date of the exposure for\nwhich the protection was purchased, and remaining\ndifferences in maturity are actively monitored and\nmanaged by the Firm.

The Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses\ngenerally consists of: \u2022 the allowance for loan\nlosses, which covers the Firm\u2019s retained loan\nportfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented\nseparately on the Consolidated balance sheets, \u2022\nthe allowance for lending-related commitments,\nwhich is reflected in accounts payable and other\nliabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, and\n\u2022 the allowance for credit losses on investment\nsecurities, which is reflected in investment\nsecurities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\nDiscussion of changes in the allowance The\nallowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2023\nwas $24.8 billion, reflecting a net addition of\n$3.1 billion from December 31, 2022. The net\naddition to the allowance for credit losses\nincluded $1.9 billion, consisting of: \u2022 $1.3\nbillion in consumer , predominantly driven by CCB,\ncomprised of $1.4 billion in Card Services,\npartially offset by a net reduction of $200 million\nin Home Lending. The net addition in Card Services\nwas driven by loan growth, including an increase in\nrevolving balances, partially offset by reduced\nborrower uncertainty. The net reduction in Home\nLending was driven by improvements in the outlook\nfor home prices, and \u2022 $675 million in wholesale ,\ndriven by net downgrade activity, the net effect of\nchanges in the Firm\u2019s weighted average\nmacroeconomic outlook, including deterioration in\nthe outlook for commercial real estate in CB, and\nan addition for certain accounts receivable in CIB,\npartially offset by the impact of changes in the\nloan and lending-related commitment portfolios. The\nnet addition also included $1.2 billion to\nestablish the allowance for the First Republic\nloans and lending-related commitments in the second\nquarter of 2023. The changes in the Firm's weighted\naverage macroeconomic outlook also included updates\nto the central scenario in the third quarter of\n2023 to reflect a lower forecasted unemployment\nrate consistent with a higher growth rate in GDP,\nand the impact of the additional weight placed on\nthe adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023,\nreflecting elevated recession risks due to high\ninflation and tightening financial conditions. The\nallowance for credit losses also reflected a\nreduction of $587 million as a result of the\nadoption of changes to the TDR accounting guidance\non January 1, 2023. Refer to Note 1 for further\ninformation.\n\nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated\nusing a weighted average of five internally\ndeveloped macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse\nscenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic\nfactors than the central case assumptions provided\nin the table below, resulting in a weighted average\nU.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.5% in the\nfourth quarter of 2024, and a weighted average U.S.\nreal GDP level that is 1.5% lower than the central\ncase at the end of the second quarter of 2025.

The investment securities portfolio is\npredominantly held by Treasury and CIO in\nconnection with the Firm's balance sheet and asset-\nliability management objectives. Principal\ninvestments are predominantly privately-held\nfinancial instruments and are managed in the LOBs\nand Corporate. Investments are typically intended\nto be held over extended periods and, accordingly,\nthe Firm has no expectation for short-term realized\ngains with respect to these investments. Investment\nsecurities risk Investment securities risk includes\nthe exposure associated with a default in the\npayment of principal and interest. This risk is\nmitigated given that the investment securities\nportfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly\nconsists of high-quality securities. At December\n31, 2023, the Treasury and CIO investment\nsecurities portfolio, net of the allowance for\ncredit losses, was $569.2 billion, and the average\ncredit rating of the securities comprising the\nportfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings\nwhere available, and where not available, based\nprimarily upon internal risk ratings). Refer to\nCorporate segment results on pages 84\u201385 and Note\n10 for further information on the investment\nsecurities portfolio and internal risk ratings.\nRefer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102\u2013109\nfor further information on related liquidity risk.\nRefer to Market Risk Management on pages 135\u2013143\nfor further information on the market risk inherent\nin the portfolio. Governance and oversight\nInvestment securities risks are governed by the\nFirm\u2019s Risk Appetite framework, and reviewed at the\nCTC Risk Committee with regular updates provided to\nthe Board Risk Committee. The Firm\u2019s independent\ncontrol functions are responsible for reviewing the\nappropriateness of the carrying value of investment\nsecurities in accordance with relevant policies.\nApproved levels for investment securities are\nestablished for each risk category, including\ncapital and credit risks.\n\nPrincipal investment risk Principal investments are\ntypically privately-held financial instruments\nrepresenting ownership interests or other forms of\njunior capital. In general, principal investments\ninclude tax-oriented investments and investments\nmade to enhance or accelerate the Firm\u2019s business\nstrategies and exclude those that are consolidated\non the Firm's balance sheets. These investments are\nmade by dedicated investing businesses or as part\nof a broader business strategy. The Firm\u2019s\nprincipal investments are managed by the LOBs and\nCorporate and are reflected within their respective\nfinancial results. The Firm\u2019s investments will\ncontinue to evolve based on market circumstances\nand in line with its strategic initiatives,\nincluding the Firm\u2019s environmental and social\ngoals.

Governance and\noversight The Firm\u2019s approach to managing principal\ninvestment risk is consistent with the Firm\u2019s risk\ngovernance structure.

The Firm\u2019s independent\ncontrol functions are responsible for reviewing the\nappropriateness of the carrying value of\ninvestments in accordance with relevant policies.\nAs part of the risk governance structure, approved\nlevels for investments are established and\nmonitored for each relevant business or segment in\norder to manage the overall size of the portfolios.\nThe Firm also conducts stress testing on these\nportfolios using specific scenarios that estimate\nlosses based on significant market moves and/or\nother risk events.\n                                              \n  134    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                          \n  MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT  \n                          \nMarket risk is the risk associated with the effect\nof changes in market factors such as interest and\nforeign exchange rates, equity and commodity\nprices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on\nthe value of assets and liabilities held for both\nthe short and long term.\n                                                                                                            \n  Market Risk Management                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nMarket Risk Management monitors market risks\nthroughout the Firm and defines market risk\npolicies and procedures.\n\nMarket Risk Management seeks to manage risk,\nfacilitate efficient risk/return decisions, reduce\nvolatility in operating performance and provide\ntransparency into the Firm\u2019s market risk profile\nfor senior management, the Board of Directors and\nregulators. Market Risk Management is responsible\nfor the following functions:\n\n\u2022 Maintaining a market risk policy framework\n\n\u2022 Independently measuring, monitoring and\ncontrolling LOB, Corporate, and Firmwide market\nrisk\n\n\u2022 Defining, approving and monitoring limits\n\n\u2022 Performing stress testing and qualitative risk\nassessments\n                                                                                                            \n  Risk measurement                                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \nMeasures used to capture market risk\n\nThere is no single measure to capture market risk\nand therefore Market Risk Management uses various\nmetrics, both statistical and nonstatistical, to\nassess risk including:\n\n\u2022 Value-at-risk\n\n\u2022 Stress testing\n\n\u2022 Profit and loss drawdowns\n\n\u2022 Earnings-at-risk\n\n\u2022 Economic Value Sensitivity\n\n\u2022 Other sensitivity-based measures\n                                                                                                            \n  Risk monitoring and control                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nMarket risk exposure is managed primarily through a\nseries of limits set in the context of the market\nenvironment and business strategy. In setting\nlimits, Market Risk Management takes into\nconsideration factors such as market volatility,\nproduct liquidity, accommodation of client\nbusiness, and management judgment. Market Risk\nManagement maintains different levels of limits.\nFirm level limits include VaR and stress limits.\nSimilarly, LOB and Corporate limits include VaR and\nstress limits and may be supplemented by certain\nnonstatistical risk measures such as profit and\nloss drawdowns. Limits may also be set within the\nLOBs and Corporate, as well as at the legal entity\nlevel.\n\nMarket Risk Management sets limits and regularly\nreviews and updates them as appropriate. Senior\nmanagement is responsible for reviewing and\napproving certain of these risk limits on an\nongoing basis. Limits that have not been reviewed\nwithin specified time periods by Market Risk\nManagement are reported to senior management. The\nLOBs and Corporate are responsible for adhering to\nestablished limits against which exposures are\nmonitored and reported.\n\nLimit breaches are required to be reported in a\ntimely manner to limit approvers, which include\nMarket Risk Management and senior management. In\nthe event of a breach, Market Risk Management\nconsults with senior members of appropriate groups\nwithin the Firm to determine the suitable course of\naction required to return the applicable positions\nto compliance, which may include a reduction in\nrisk in order to remedy the breach or granting a\ntemporary increase in limits to accommodate an\nexpected increase in client activity and/or market\nvolatility. Firm, Corporate or LOB-level limit\nbreaches are escalated as appropriate.\n\nModels used to measure market risk are inherently\nimprecise and are limited in their ability to\nmeasure certain risks or to predict losses. This\nimprecision may be heightened when sudden or severe\nshifts in market conditions occur. For additional\ndiscussion on model uncertainty refer to\nEstimations and Model Risk Management on page 154.\n\nMarket Risk Management periodically reviews the\nFirm\u2019s existing market risk measures to identify\nopportunities for enhancement, and to the extent\nappropriate, will calibrate those measures\naccordingly over time.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    135  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nThe following table summarizes the predominant business activities and related market risks, as well as\npositions which give rise to market risk and certain measures used to capture those risks, for each LOB and\nCorporate.\n\nIn addition to the predominant business activities, each LOB and Corporate may engage in principal investing\nactivities.

               \nJPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (\u201cVaR\u201d), a\nstatistical risk measure, to estimate the potential\nloss from adverse market moves in the current\nmarket environment. The Firm has a single VaR\nframework used as a basis for calculating Risk\nManagement VaR and Regulatory VaR.\n\nThe framework is employed across the Firm using\nhistorical simulation based on data for the\nprevious 12 months. The framework\u2019s approach\nassumes that historical changes in market values\nare representative of the distribution of potential\noutcomes in the immediate future. The Firm believes\nthe use of Risk Management VaR provides a daily\nmeasure of risk that is closely aligned to risk\nmanagement decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate\nand, along with other market risk measures,\nprovides the appropriate information needed to\nrespond to risk events.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR is calculated\nassuming a one-day holding period and an expected\ntail-loss methodology which approximates a 95%\nconfidence level. Risk Management VaR provides a\nconsistent framework to measure risk profiles and\nlevels of diversification across product types and\nis used for aggregating risks and monitoring limits\nacross businesses. VaR results are reported as\nappropriate to various groups including senior\nmanagement, the Board Risk Committee and\nregulators.\n\nUnderlying the overall VaR model framework are\nindividual VaR models that simulate historical\nmarket returns for individual risk factors and/or\nproduct types. To capture material market risks as\npart of the Firm\u2019s risk management framework,\ncomprehensive VaR model calculations are performed\ndaily for businesses whose activities give rise to\nmarket risk. These VaR models are granular and\nincorporate numerous risk factors and inputs to\nsimulate daily changes in market values over the\nhistorical period; inputs are selected based on the\nrisk profile of each portfolio, as sensitivities\nand historical time series used to generate daily\nmarket values may be different across product types\nor risk management systems. The VaR model results\nacross all portfolios are aggregated at the Firm\nlevel.\n\nAs VaR is based on historical data, it is an\nimperfect measure of market risk exposure and\npotential future losses. In addition, based on\ntheir reliance on available historical data,\nlimited time horizons, and other factors, VaR\nmeasures are inherently limited in their ability to\nmeasure certain risks and to predict losses,\nparticularly those associated with market\nilliquidity and sudden or severe shifts in market\nconditions.\n\nFor certain products, specific risk parameters are\nnot captured in VaR due to the lack of liquidity\nand availability of appropriate historical data.\nThe Firm uses proxies to estimate the VaR for these\nand other products when daily time series are not\navailable. It is likely that using an actual price-\nbased time series for these products, if available,\nwould affect the VaR results presented. The Firm\ntherefore considers other nonstatistical measures\nsuch as stress\n\ntesting, in addition to VaR, to capture and manage\nits market risk positions.\n\nAs VaR model calculations require daily data and a\nconsistent source for valuation, the daily market\ndata used may be different than the independent\nthird-party data collected for VCG price testing in\nits monthly valuation process. For example, in\ncases where market prices are not observable, or\nwhere proxies are used in VaR historical time\nseries, the data sources may differ. Refer to\nValuation process in Note 2 for further information\non the Firm\u2019s valuation process.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s VaR model calculations are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in response to changes in\nthe composition of the Firm\u2019s portfolios, changes\nin market conditions, improvements in the Firm\u2019s\nmodeling techniques and measurements, and other\nfactors. Such changes may affect historical\ncomparisons of VaR results. Refer to Estimations\nand Model Risk Management on page 154 for\ninformation regarding model reviews and approvals.\n\nThe Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated\nVaR in accordance with regulatory rules\n(\u201cRegulatory VaR\u201d), which is used to derive the\nFirm\u2019s regulatory VaR-based capital requirements\nunder Basel III capital rules. This Regulatory VaR\nmodel framework currently assumes a ten business-\nday holding period and an expected tail loss\nmethodology which approximates a 99% confidence\nlevel. Regulatory VaR is applied to \u201ccovered\u201d\npositions as defined by Basel III capital rules,\nwhich may be different than the positions included\nin the Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR. For example,\ncredit derivative hedges of accrual loans are\nincluded in the Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR, while\nRegulatory VaR excludes these credit derivative\nhedges. In addition, in contrast to the Firm\u2019s Risk\nManagement VaR, Regulatory VaR currently excludes\nthe diversification benefit for certain VaR models.\n\nRefer to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Basel III Pillar 3\nRegulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are\navailable on the Firm\u2019s website, for additional\ninformation on Regulatory VaR and the other\ncomponents of market risk regulatory capital for\nthe Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-\nbased measure and the respective backtesting).\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    137  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nThe table below shows the results of the Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR measure using a 95% confidence level.\nVaR can vary significantly as positions change, market volatility fluctuates, and diversification benefits\nchange.\n                                                                                                            \n  Total VaR                                                                                                 \n  As of or for the                                                                                          \n  year ended December                                                                                       \n  31,                        2023                                   2022                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (in millions)              Avg.

This reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across\nLOBs, Corporate, and risk types. For maximum and minimum VaR, diversification benefit is not meaningful as\nthe maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the\ncomponents.\n\n(b) Credit Portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan\nportfolio, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan\nportfolio, which is not reported at fair value. In line with the Firm's internal model governance, the\ncredit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to\nthe widening of the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also\nremoved to maintain consistency. This exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.\n\n(c) Corporate and other LOB VaR includes a legacy private equity position in Corporate which is publicly\ntraded .\n\n(d) In March 2022, the effects of nickel price increases and the associated volatility in the nickel market\nresulted in elevated maximum Credit Portfolio VaR, as well as maximum Total VaR.\n                                                                                                            \n  2023 compared with 2022                                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \nAverage Total VaR decreased by $15 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 when compared with the\nprior year.\n\nThe decrease was driven by reduced market\nvolatility and risk reductions predominantly\nimpacting fixed income, commodities and equities.\n\nThe following graph presents daily Risk Management\nVaR for the four trailing quarters.\n                                                                                                            \n                                         Daily Risk Management VaR                                          \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                      \n  First Quarter    Second Quarter    Third Quarter    Fourth Quarter  \n  2023             2023              2023             2023            \n                                                                      \n                                              \n  138    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  VaR backtesting                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting,\nwhich compares the daily Risk Management VaR\nresults with the daily gains and losses that are\nutilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains\nand losses depicted in the chart below do not\nreflect the Firm\u2019s reported revenue as they exclude\ncertain components of total net revenue, such as\nthose associated with the execution of new\ntransactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading\nand intraday risk management activities), fees,\ncommissions, other valuation adjustments and net\ninterest income. These excluded components of total\nnet revenue may more than offset the backtesting\ngain or loss on a particular day. The definition of\nbacktesting gains and losses above is consistent\nwith the requirements for backtesting under Basel\nIII capital rules.\n\nA backtesting exception occurs when the daily\nbacktesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management\nVaR for the prior day. Under the Firm\u2019s Risk\nManagement VaR methodology, assuming current\nchanges in market values are consistent with the\nhistorical changes used in the simulation, the Firm\nwould expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions\nfive times every 100 trading days on average. The\nnumber of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can\ndiffer from the statistically expected number of\nbacktesting exceptions if the current level of\nmarket volatility is materially different from the\nlevel of market volatility during the 12 months of\nhistorical data used in the VaR calculation.\n\nFor the 12 months ended December 31, 2023, the Firm\nposted backtesting gains on 139 of the 258 days,\nand observed 13 VaR backtesting exceptions, of\nwhich eight were in the three months ended December\n31, 2023. Firmwide backtesting loss days can differ\nfrom the loss days for which Fixed Income Markets\nand Equity Markets posted losses, as disclosed in\nCIB Markets revenue, as the population of positions\nwhich comprise each metric are different and due to\nthe exclusion of certain components of total net\nrevenue in backtesting gains and losses as\ndescribed above.\n\nThe following chart presents the distribution of\nFirmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the\ntrailing 12 months and three months ended December\n31, 2023. The daily backtesting losses are\ndisplayed as a percentage of the corresponding\ndaily Risk Management VaR.

While VaR reflects the risk of\nloss due to adverse changes in markets using recent\nhistorical market behavior, stress testing reflects\nthe risk of loss from hypothetical changes in the\nvalue of market risk sensitive positions applied\nsimultaneously. Stress testing measures the Firm\u2019s\nvulnerability to losses under a range of stressed\nbut possible economic and market scenarios. The\nresults are used to understand the exposures\nresponsible for those potential losses and are\nmeasured against limits.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s stress framework covers market risk\nsensitive positions in the LOBs and Corporate. The\nframework is used to calculate multiple magnitudes\nof potential stress for both market rallies and\nmarket sell-offs, assuming significant changes in\nmarket factors such as credit spreads, equity\nprices, interest rates, currency rates and\ncommodity prices, and combines them in multiple\nways to capture an array of hypothetical economic\nand market scenarios.\n\nThe Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus\non tail events in specific asset classes and\ngeographies, including how the event may impact\nmultiple market factors simultaneously. Scenarios\nalso incorporate specific idiosyncratic risks and\nstress basis risk between different products. The\nflexibility in the stress framework allows the Firm\nto construct new scenarios that can test the\noutcomes against possible future stress events.\nStress testing results are reported periodically to\nsenior management of the Firm, as appropriate.\n\nStress scenarios are governed by the overall stress\nframework, under the oversight of Market Risk\nManagement, and the models to calculate the stress\nresults are subject to the Firm\u2019s Estimations and\nModel Risk Management Policy. The Firmwide Market\nRisk Stress Methodology Committee reviews and\napproves changes to stress testing methodology and\nscenarios across the Firm. Significant changes to\nthe framework are escalated to senior management,\nas appropriate.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s stress testing framework is utilized in\ncalculating the Firm\u2019s CCAR and other stress test\nresults, which are reported periodically to the\nBoard of Directors. In addition, stress testing\nresults are incorporated into the Firm\u2019s Risk\nAppetite framework, and are reported periodically\nto the Board Risk Committee.\n                                                                                                            \n  Profit and loss drawdowns                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \nProfit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight\ntrading losses above certain levels of risk\ntolerance. A profit and loss drawdown is a decline\nin revenue from its year-to-date peak level.\n                                                                                                            \n  Structural interest rate risk management                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \nThe effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm\u2019s\nreported net income is important as interest rate\nrisk represents one of the Firm\u2019s significant\nmarket risks. Interest rate risk arises not only\nfrom trading activities which are included in\n\nVaR, but also from the Firm\u2019s traditional banking\nactivities, which include extension of loans and\ncredit facilities, taking deposits, issuing debt,\nas well as the investment securities portfolio, and\nassociated derivative instruments. Refer to the\ntable on page 136 for a summary by LOB and\nCorporate identifying positions included in\nearnings-at-risk.\n                                                                                                            \n  Governance                                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nThe CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm\u2019s\ninterest rate risk management policy and related\nlimits, which are subject to approval by the Board\nRisk Committee. Treasury and CIO, working in\npartnership with the LOBs, calculates the Firm\u2019s\nstructural interest rate risk profile and reviews\nit with senior management, including the CTC Risk\nCommittee. In addition, oversight of structural\ninterest rate risk is managed through a dedicated\nrisk function reporting to the CTC CRO. This risk\nfunction is responsible for providing independent\noversight and governance around assumptions and\nestablishing and monitoring limits for structural\ninterest rate risk, including limits related to\nEarnings-at-Risk and Economic Value Sensitivity.\nThe Firm manages structural interest rate risk\ngenerally through its investment securities\nportfolio and interest rate derivatives.\n                                                                                                            \n  Key Risk Drivers and Risk Management Process                                                              \n                                                                                                            \nStructural interest rate risk can arise due to a\nvariety of factors, including:\n\n\u2022 Differences in timing among the maturity or\nrepricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance\nsheet instruments\n\n\u2022 Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities\nand off-balance sheet instruments that are maturing\nor repricing at the same time\n\n\u2022 Differences in the amounts by which short-term\nand long-term market interest rates change (for\nexample, changes in the slope of the yield curve)\n\n\u2022 The impact of changes in the maturity of various\nassets, liabilities or off-balance sheet\ninstruments as interest rates change\n\nThe Firm manages interest rate exposure related to\nits assets and liabilities on a consolidated,\nFirmwide basis. Business units transfer their\ninterest rate risk to Treasury and CIO through\nfunds transfer pricing, which takes into account\nthe elements of interest rate exposure that can be\nrisk-managed in financial markets. These elements\ninclude asset and liability balances and\ncontractual rates of interest, contractual\nprincipal payment schedules, expected prepayment\nexperience, interest rate reset dates and\nmaturities, rate indices used for repricing, and\nany interest rate ceilings or floors for adjustable\nrate products.\n                                                                                                            \n  Earnings-at-Risk                                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \nOne way that the Firm evaluates its structural\ninterest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk.\nEarnings-at-risk estimates the Firm\u2019s interest rate\nexposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is\npresented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which\nincludes net interest income and certain interest\nrate sensitive fees. The baseline uses market\ninterest rates and,\n                                              \n  140    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nin the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The\nFirm conducts simulations of changes to this\nbaseline for interest rate-sensitive assets and\nliabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other\ncurrencies (\u201cnon-U.S. dollar\u201d currencies). These\nsimulations primarily include retained loans,\ndeposits, deposits with banks, investment\nsecurities, long-term debt and any related interest\nrate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of other\npositions in risk management VaR and other\nsensitivity-based measures as described on page 136\n. These simulations exclude hedges of exposure from\nnon-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk arising from\nthe Firm\u2019s capital investments. The inclusion of\nthe hedges in these simulations would increase U.S.\ndollar sensitivities and decrease non-U.S. dollar\nsensitivities. Refer to non-U.S. dollar foreign\nexchange risk on page 145 for more information.\nEarnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential\nchange to a net interest income baseline over the\nfollowing 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions.\nThese scenarios include a parallel shift involving\nchanges to both short-term and long-term rates by\nan equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving\nholding short-term rates constant and increasing\nlong-term rates; and a flatter yield curve\ninvolving increasing short-term rates and holding\nlong-term rates constant or holding short-term\nrates constant and decreasing long-term rates.\nThese scenarios consider many different factors,\nincluding: \u2022 The impact on exposures as a result of\ninstantaneous changes in interest rates from\nbaseline rates. \u2022 Forecasted balance sheet, as well\nas modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior,\nbut excluding assumptions about actions that could\nbe taken by the Firm or its clients and customers\nin response to instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage\nprepayment assumptions are based on the interest\nrates used in the scenarios compared with\nunderlying contractual rates, the time since\norigination, and other factors which are updated\nperiodically based on historical experience.\nDeposit forecasts are a key assumption in the\nFirm\u2019s earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects\ncertain assumptions relating to the reversal of\nQuantitative Easing that are highly uncertain and\nrequire management judgment. Therefore, the actual\namount of deposits held by the Firm at any\nparticular time could be impacted by actions the\nFederal Reserve may take as part of monetary\npolicy, including through the use of the Reverse\nRepurchase Facility. In addition, there are other\nfactors that impact the amount of deposits held at\nthe Firm such as the level of loans across the\nindustry and competition for deposits. \u2022 The\npricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit\nbetas, represent the amount by which deposit rates\npaid could change upon a given change in market\ninterest rates. As part of the Firm's continuous\nevaluation and periodic enhancements to its\nearnings-at-risk calculations, the Firm updated its\nmodel in the second quarter of 2023 to incorporate\ndeposit repricing lags\n\nimpacting both consumer and wholesale deposits. The\nmodel change incorporated observed pricing and\ncustomer behavior in both rising and falling\ninterest rate environments. Actual deposit rates\npaid may differ from the modeled assumptions,\nprimarily due to customer behavior and competition\nfor deposits. The Firm performs sensitivity\nanalyses of the assumptions used in earnings-at-\nrisk scenarios, including with respect to deposit\nbetas and forecasts of deposit balances, both of\nwhich are especially significant in the case of\nconsumer deposits. The results of these sensitivity\nanalyses are reported to the CTC Risk Committee and\nthe Board Risk Committee. The Firm\u2019s earnings-at-\nrisk scenarios are periodically evaluated and\nenhanced in response to changes in the composition\nof the Firm\u2019s balance sheet, changes in market\nconditions, improvements in the Firm\u2019s simulation\nand other factors. While a relevant measure of the\nFirm\u2019s interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk\nanalysis does not represent a forecast of the\nFirm\u2019s net interest income (Refer to Outlook on\npage 52 for additional information) .

Additional\ninformation on long-term debt and held to maturity\ninvestment securities is disclosed on page 195 in\nNote 2 financial instruments that are not carried\nat fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n                                              \n  142    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \nNon-U.S. dollar FX risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates affect the value of the Firm\u2019s\nassets or liabilities or future results. The Firm has structural non-U.S. dollar FX exposures arising from\ncapital investments, forecasted expense and revenue, the investment securities portfolio and non-U.S.\ndollar-denominated debt issuance. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership with the LOBs, primarily manage\nthese risks on behalf of the Firm. Treasury and CIO may hedge certain of these risks using derivatives.\nRefer to Business Segment Results on page 66 for additional information.\n                                                                                                            \n  Other sensitivity-based measures                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by\nassessing the potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (\u201cOCI\u201d) and noninterest expense\ndue to changes in relevant market variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to\nmarket risk on page 136 for additional information on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based\nmeasures.\n\nThe table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk\nsensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used\nfor hedging purposes are reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the\ntable below may not be representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at December\n31, 2023 and 2022, as the movement in market parameters

The use of different\nmeasurement approaches or assumptions could affect\nthe amount of reported country exposure.\n\nUnder the Firm\u2019s internal country risk measurement\nframework:\n\n\u2022 Deposits with banks are measured as the cash\nbalances placed with central banks, commercial\nbanks, and other financial institutions\n\n\u2022 Lending exposures are measured at the total\ncommitted amount (funded and unfunded), net of the\nallowance for credit losses and eligible cash and\nmarketable securities collateral received\n\n\u2022 Securities financing exposures are measured at\ntheir receivable balance, net of eligible\ncollateral received\n\n\u2022 Debt and equity securities are measured at the\nfair value of all positions, including both long\nand short positions\n\n\u2022 Counterparty exposure on derivative receivables\nis measured at the derivative\u2019s fair value, net of\nthe fair value of the eligible collateral received\n\n\u2022 Credit derivatives exposure is measured at the\nnet notional amount of protection purchased or sold\nfor the same underlying reference entity, inclusive\nof the fair value of the derivative receivable or\npayable, reflecting the manner in which the Firm\nmanages these exposures\n\nThe Firm\u2019s internal country risk reporting differs\nfrom the reporting provided under the FFIEC bank\nregulatory requirements.\n                                              \n  144    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nStress testing Stress testing is an important component of the Firm\u2019s country risk management framework,\nwhich aims to estimate and limit losses arising from a country crisis by measuring the impact of adverse\nasset price movements to a country based on market shocks combined with counterparty specific assumptions.\nCountry Risk Management periodically designs and runs tailored stress scenarios to test vulnerabilities to\nindividual countries or sets of countries in response to specific or potential market events, sector\nperformance concerns, sovereign actions and geopolitical risks. These tailored stress results are used to\ninform potential risk reduction across the Firm, as necessary. Risk reporting Country exposure and stress\nare measured and reported regularly, and used by Country Risk Management to identify trends and monitor high\nusages and breaches against limits. For country risk management purposes, the Firm may report exposure to\njurisdictions that are not fully autonomous, including Special Administrative Regions (\u201cSAR\u201d) and dependent\nterritories, separately from the independent sovereign states with which they are associated. The following\ntable presents the Firm\u2019s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of December 31, 2023, and\ntheir comparative exposures as of December 31, 2022. The top 20 country exposures represent the Firm\u2019s\nlargest total exposures by individual country. Country exposures may fluct uate from period to period due to\na variety of factors, including client activity, market flows and liquidity management activities undertaken\nby the Firm. The decrease in exposure to Japan when compared to December 31, 2022, was driven by a reduction\nin cash placed with the central bank of Japan as a result of liquidity management activities undertaken by\nthe Firm. The decrease in exposure to Australia when compared to December 31, 2022, was predominantly driven\nby a reduction in cash placed with the central bank of Australia due to client-driven activities resulting\nfrom changes in interest rates. The Firm continues to monitor its exposure to Russia which was approximately\n$350 million as of December 31, 2023. This amount excludes certain deposits placed on behalf of clients at\nthe Depository Insurance Agency of Russia.\n                                                                                                            \n  Top 20                                                                                                    \n  country\u2026                                                                                                  \n  (exclud\u2026                                                                                                  \n  the                                                                                                       \n  U.S.)(a)            2023                                                                                  \n  December        Deposits                         Trading                                         2022(f)  \n  31,  (in            with                             and                           Total           Total  \n  billion\u2026        banks(b)       Lending(\u2026       investin\u2026       Other(e)         exposure        exposure  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Germany     $       69.8    $       12.1    $        2.1    $       0.8    $        84.8    $       93.2  \n  United              36.4            25.5            13.5            1.7             77.1            70.1  \n  Kingdom                                                                                                   \n  Japan               29.4             2.4             3.9            0.3             36.0            55.8  \n  Austral\u2026             9.7             6.9             1.7              \u2014             18.3            25.7  \n  Brazil               5.2             5.3             6.2              \u2014             16.7            17.8  \n  Canada               2.3            11.4             2.0            0.3             16.0            14.4  \n  China                3.5             5.5             5.0              \u2014             14.0            13.7  \n  Switzer\u2026             5.2             3.6             1.2            0.9             10.9            15.3  \n  France               0.6            10.9            -2.2            0.8             10.1            18.1  \n  Singapo\u2026             1.9             3.8             3.8            0.3              9.8             9.9  \n  India                1.2             3.8             4.3            0.4              9.7             9.0  \n  Mexico               1.1             3.7             3.4              \u2014              8.2             5.4  \n  Belgium              5.6             2.1             0.3              \u2014              8.0             9.2  \n  South                0.8             3.2             3.5            0.3              7.8            10.0  \n  Korea                                                                                                     \n  Saudi                0.6             5.2             1.9              \u2014              7.7             7.9  \n  Arabia                                                                                                    \n  Spain                0.3             5.2             0.8              \u2014              6.3             3.4  \n  Italy                0.1             5.9            -0.2            0.2              6.0             5.8  \n  Netherl\u2026             0.1             6.4            -1.2            0.3              5.6             7.1  \n  Malaysia             3.5             0.2             0.4            0.1              4.2             5.3  \n  Luxembo\u2026             0.9             2.2             0.9              \u2014              4.0             4.2  \n                                                                                                            \n(a) Country exposures presented in the table\nreflect 88% of total F irmwide non-U.S. exposure,\nwhere exposure is attributed to an individual\ncountry based on the Firm\u2019s internal country risk\nmanagement approach, at both December 31, 2023 and\n2022.

Climate risk is categorized into physical\nrisk and transition risk.\n\nPhysical risk refers to economic costs and\nfinancial loss associated with a changing climate.\nAcute physical risk drivers include the increased\nfrequency or severity of climate and weather\nevents, such as floods, wildfires and tropical\ncyclones. Chronic physical risk drivers include\nmore gradual shifts in the climate, such as sea\nlevel rise, persistent changes in precipitation\nlevels and increases in average ambient\ntemperatures.\n\nTransition risk refers to the financial and\neconomic implications associated with a societal\nadjustment to a low-carbon economy. Transition risk\ndrivers include possible changes in public policy,\nadoption of new technologies and shifts in consumer\npreferences. Transition risks may also be\ninfluenced by changes in the physical climate.\n                                                                                                            \n   Organization and management                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm has a Climate Risk Management function\nthat is responsible for establishing and\nmaintaining the Firmwide framework and strategy for\nmanaging climate risks that may impact the Firm.\nThe Climate Risk Management function engages across\nthe Firm to help integrate climate risk\nconsiderations into existing risk management\nframeworks, as appropriate.\n\nOther responsibilities of Climate Risk Management\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 Setting policies, standards, procedures and\nprocesses to support identification, escalation,\nmonitoring and management of climate risk across\nthe Firm\n\n\u2022 Developing metrics, scenarios and stress testing\nmechanisms designed to assess the range of\npotential climate-related financial and economic\nimpacts to the Firm\n\n\u2022 Establishing a Firmwide climate risk data\nstrategy and the supporting climate risk technology\ninfrastructure\n\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the\nidentification, assessment and management of\nclimate risks present in their business activities\nand for adherence to applicable climate-related\nlaws, rules and regulations.\n                                                                                                            \n  Governance and oversight                                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm\u2019s approach to managing climate risk is\nconsistent with the Firm\u2019s risk governance\nstructure.

Operational\nrisk is inherent in the Firm\u2019s activities and can\nmanifest itself in various ways, including\nfraudulent acts, business disruptions (including\nthose caused by extraordinary events beyond the\nFirm's control), cyber attacks, inappropriate\nemployee behavior, failure to comply with\napplicable laws, rules and regulations or failure\nof vendors or other third party providers to\nperform in accordance with their agreements.\nOperational Risk Management attempts to manage\noperational risk at appropriate levels in light of\nthe Firm\u2019s financial position, the characteristics\nof its businesses, and the markets and regulatory\nenvironments in which it operates.\n                                                                                                            \n   Operational Risk Management Framework                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm\u2019s Compliance, Conduct, and Operational\nRisk (\u201cCCOR\u201d) Management Framework is designed to\nenable the Firm to govern, identify, measure,\nmonitor and test, manage and report on the Firm\u2019s\noperational risk.\n\nOperational Risk Governance\n\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the\nmanagement of operational risk. The Control\nManagement Organization, which consists of control\nmanagers within each LOB and Corporate, is\nresponsible for the day-to-day execution of the\nCCOR Framework.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s Global Chief Compliance Officer (\u201cCCO\u201d)\nand FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk\nAppetite is responsible for defining the CCOR\nManagement Framework and establishing the minimum\nstandards for its execution. The LOB and Corporate\naligned CCOR Lead Officers report to the Global CCO\nand FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk\nAppetite and are independent of the respective\nbusinesses or functions they oversee. The CCOR\nManagement Framework is included in the Risk\nGovernance and Oversight Policy that is reviewed\nand approved by the Board Risk Committee\nperiodically.\n\nOperational Risk Identification\n\nThe Firm utilizes a structured risk and control\nself-assessment process that is executed by the\nLOBs and Corporate. As part of this process, the\nLOBs and Corporate evaluate the effectiveness of\ntheir respective control environment to assess\ncircumstances in which controls have failed, and to\ndetermine where remediation efforts may be\nrequired. The Firm\u2019s Operational Risk and\nCompliance organization (\u201cOperational Risk and\nCompliance\u201d) provides oversight of and challenge to\nthese evaluations and may also perform independent\nassessments of significant operational risk events\nand areas of concentrated or emerging risk.\n\nOperational Risk Measurement\n\nOperational Risk and Compliance performs an\nindependent assessment of the operational risks\ninherent within the LOBs and Corporate, which\nincludes evaluating the effectiveness of the\ncontrol environments and reporting the results to\nsenior management.\n\nIn addition, Operational Risk and Compliance\nassesses operational risks through quantitative\nmeans, including operational risk-based capital and\nestimation of operational risk losses under both\nbaseline and stressed conditions.\n\nThe primary component of the operational risk-based\ncapital estimate is the Loss Distribution Approach\n(\u201cLDA\u201d) statistical model, which simulates the\nprojected frequency and severity of operational\nrisk losses based on historical data. The LDA model\nis used to estimate an aggregate operational risk\nloss over a one-year time horizon, at a 99.9%\nconfidence level. The LDA model incorporates actual\ninternal operational risk losses in the quarter\nfollowing the period in which those losses were\nrealized, and the calculation generally continues\nto reflect such losses even after the issues or\nbusiness activities giving rise to the losses have\nbeen remediated or reduced.\n\nAs required under the Basel III capital framework,\nthe Firm\u2019s operational risk capital methodology,\nwhich uses the Advanced Measurement Approach\n(\u201cAMA\u201d), incorporates internal and external losses\nas well as management\u2019s view of tail risk captured\nthrough operational risk scenario analysis, and\nevaluation of key business environment and internal\ncontrol metrics. The Firm does not reflect the\nimpact of insurance in its AMA estimate of\noperational risk capital.\n\nThe Firm considers the impact of stressed economic\nconditions on operational risk losses and develops\na forward looking view of material operational risk\nevents that may occur in a stressed environment.\nThe Firm\u2019s operational risk stress testing\nframework is utilized in calculating results for\nthe Firm\u2019s CCAR and other stress testing processes.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101\nfor information related to operational risk RWA,\nand CCAR.\n\nOperational Risk Monitoring and testing\n\nThe results of risk assessments performed by\nOperational Risk and Compliance are used in\nconnection with their independent monitoring and\ntesting compliance of the LOBs and Corporate with\nlaws, rules and regulations. Through monitoring and\ntesting, Operational Risk and Compliance\nindependently identify areas of heightened\noperational risk and tests the effectiveness of\ncontrols within the LOBs and Corporate.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    147  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nManagement of Operational Risk\n\nThe operational risk areas or issues identified\nthrough monitoring and testing are escalated to the\nLOBs and Corporate to be remediated through action\nplans, as needed, to mitigate operational risk.\nOperational Risk and Compliance may advise the LOBs\nand Corporate in the development and implementation\nof action plans.\n\nOperational Risk Reporting\n\nAll employees of the Firm are expected to escalate\nrisks appropriately. Risks identified by\nOperational Risk and Compliance are escalated to\nthe appropriate LOB and Corporate Control\nCommittees, as needed. Operational Risk and\nCompliance has established standards designed to\nensure that consistent operational risk reporting\nand operational risk reports are produced on a\nFirmwide basis as well as by the LOBs and\nCorporate. Reporting includes the evaluation of key\nrisk and performance indicators against established\nthresholds as well as the assessment of different\ntypes of operational risk against stated risk\nappetite. The standards establish escalation\nprotocols to senior management and to the Board of\nDirectors.\n                                                                                                            \n  Insurance                                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \nOne of the ways in which operational risk may be\nmitigated is through insurance maintained by the\nFirm. The Firm purchases insurance from commercial\ninsurers and maintains a wholly-owned captive\ninsurer, Park Assurance Company. Insurance may also\nbe required by third parties with whom the Firm\ndoes business.\n                                                                                                            \n  Subcategories and examples of operational risks                                                           \n                                                                                                            \nOperational risk can manifest itself in various\nways. Operational risk subcategories include\nCompliance risk, Conduct risk, Legal risk, and\nEstimations and Model risk. Refer to pages 151,\n152, 153 and 154, respectively for more information\non Compliance, Conduct, Legal, and Estimations and\nModel risk. Details on other select examples of\noperational risks such as business and technology\nresiliency, payment fraud and third-party\noutsourcing, as well as cybersecurity, are provided\nbelow.\n\nWar in Ukraine and Sanctions\n\nIn response to the war in Ukraine, numerous\nfinancial and economic sanctions have been imposed\non Russia and Russia-associated entities and\nindividuals by various governments around the\nworld, including the authorities in the U.S., U.K.\nand EU. These sanctions are complex and continue to\nevolve. The Firm continues to face increased\noperational and other risks associated with\naddressing these complex compliance-related\nmatters. To manage this increased risk, the Firm\nhas implemented controls reasonably designed to\nmitigate the risk of non-compliance and to prevent\ndealing with sanctioned persons or in property\nsubject to sanctions, as well as to block or\nrestrict payments as required by the applicable\nregulations.\n\nBusiness and technology resiliency risk\n\nDisruptions can occur due to forces beyond the\nFirm\u2019s control such as the spread of infectious\ndiseases or pandemics, severe weather, natural\ndisasters, the effects of climate change, power or\ntelecommunications loss, failure of a third party\nto provide expected services, cyberattacks, civil\nor political unrest or terrorism. The Firmwide\nBusiness Resiliency Program is designed to enable\nthe Firm to prepare for, adapt to, withstand and\nrecover from business disruptions including\noccurrence of extraordinary events beyond its\ncontrol that may impact critical business functions\nand supporting assets including staff, technology,\nfacilities and third parties. The program includes\ngovernance, awareness training, planning and\ntesting of recovery strategies, as well as\nstrategic and tactical initiatives to identify,\nassess, and manage business resiliency risks. The\nprogram is required to be managed in accordance\nwith the Firm\u2019s overall approach to Operational\nRisk Management, including alignment with\ntechnology, cybersecurity, data, physical security,\ncrisis management, real estate and outsourcing\nprograms.\n\nPayment fraud risk\n\nPayment fraud risk is the risk of external and\ninternal parties unlawfully obtaining personal\nmonetary benefit through misdirected or otherwise\nimproper payment. The Firm employs various controls\nfor managing payment fraud risk as well as\nproviding employee and client education and\nawareness trainings.\n\nThird-party outsourcing risk\n\nThe Firm\u2018s Third-Party Oversight (\u201cTPO\u201d) and Inter-\naffiliates Oversight (\u201cIAO\u201d) frameworks assist the\nLOBs and Corporate in selecting, documenting,\nonboarding, monitoring and managing their supplier\nrelationships including services provided by\naffiliates. The objectives of the TPO framework are\nto hold suppliers and other third parties to an\nappropriate standard of operational performance and\nto mitigate key risks, including data loss and\nbusiness disruptions.

The estimation methods\nare of varying levels of sophistication and are\nused for many purposes, such as the valuation of\npositions and measurement of risk, assessing\nregulatory capital requirements, conducting stress\ntesting, evaluating the allowance for credit losses\nand making business decisions. A dedicated\nindependent function, Model Risk Governance and\nReview (\u201cMRGR\u201d), defines and governs the Firm\u2019s\npolicies relating to the management of model risk\nand risks associated with certain analytical and\njudgment-based estimations, such as those used in\nrisk management, budget forecasting and capital\nplanning and analysis.\n\nThe governance of analytical and judgment-based\nestimations within MRGR\u2019s scope follows a\nconsistent approach which is used for models, as\ndescribed in detail below.\n\nModel risks are owned by the users of the models\nwithin the LOBs and Corporate based on the specific\npurposes of such models. Users and developers of\nmodels are responsible for developing, implementing\nand testing their models, as well as referring\nmodels to MRGR for review and approval. Once models\nhave been approved, model users and developers are\nresponsible for maintaining a robust operating\nenvironment, and must monitor and evaluate the\nperformance of the models on an ongoing basis.\nModel users and developers may seek to enhance\nmodels in response to changes in the relevant\nportfolios and in product and market developments,\nas well as to capture improvements in available\nmodeling techniques and systems capabilities.\n\nModels are tiered based on an internal standard\naccording to their complexity, the exposure\nassociated with the model and the Firm\u2019s reliance\non the model. This tiering is subject to the\napproval of MRGR. In its review of a model, MRGR\nconsiders whether the model is suitable for the\nspecific purposes for which it will be used. When\nreviewing a model, MRGR analyzes and challenges the\nmodel methodology and the reasonableness of model\nassumptions, and may perform or require additional\ntesting, including back-testing of model outcomes.\nModel reviews are approved by the appropriate level\nof management within MRGR based on the relevant\nmodel tier.\n\nUnder the Firm\u2019s Estimations and Model Risk\nManagement Policy, MRGR reviews and approves new\nmodels, as well as material changes to existing\nmodels, prior to their use. In certain\ncircumstances, exceptions may be granted to the\nFirm\u2019s policy to allow a model to be used prior to\nreview or approval. MRGR may also require the user\nto take appropriate actions to mitigate the model\nrisk if it is to be used in the interim. These\nactions will depend on the model and may include,\nfor example, limitation of trading activity.\n\nWhile models are inherently imprecise, the degree\nof imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by\nthe market or economic environment. This is\nparticularly true when the current and forecasted\nenvironments are significantly different from the\nhistorical environments upon which the models were\ndeveloped. This increased uncertainty may\nnecessitate a greater degree of judgment and\nanalytics to inform any adjustments that the Firm\nmay make to model outputs than would otherwise be\nthe case. In addition, the Firm may experience\nincreased uncertainty in its estimates if assets\nacquired differ from those used to develop the\nmodels.\n\nRefer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the\nFirm on pages 155\u2013158 and Note 2 for a summary of\nmodel-based valuations and other valuation\ntechniques.\n                                              \n  154    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                                                  \n  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM  \n                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s accounting policies and use of\nestimates are integral to understanding its\nreported results.

The methods used and\njudgments made reflect, among other factors, the\nnature of the assets or liabilities and the related\nbusiness and risk management strategies, which may\nvary across the Firm\u2019s businesses and portfolios.\nIn addition, the policies and procedures are\nintended to ensure that the process for changing\nmethodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The\nFirm believes its estimates for determining the\ncarrying value of its assets and liabilities are\nappropriate. The following is a brief description\nof the Firm\u2019s critical accounting estimates\ninvolving significant judgments.\n                                                                                                            \n  Allowance for credit losses                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement\u2019s estimate of expected credit losses\nover the remaining expected life of the Firm\u2019s\nfinancial assets measured at amortized cost and\ncertain off-balance sheet lending-related\ncommitments. The allowance for credit losses\ngenerally comprises:\n\n\u2022 The allowance for loan losses, which covers the\nFirm\u2019s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-\nrated),\n\n\u2022 The allowance for lending-related commitments and\n\n\u2022 The allowance for credit losses on investment\nsecurities.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses involves\nsignificant judgment on a number of matters\nincluding development and weighting of\nmacroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of\nhistorical loss experience, assessment of risk\ncharacteristics, assignment of risk ratings,\nvaluation of collateral, and the determination of\nremaining expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note\n13 for further information on these judgments as\nwell as the Firm\u2019s policies and methodologies used\nto determine the Firm\u2019s allowance for credit\nlosses.\n\nOne of the most significant judgments involved in\nestimating the Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses\nrelates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to\nestimate credit losses over the eight-quarter\nforecast period within the Firm\u2019s methodology. The\neight-quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of\nmacroeconomic variables (\u201cMEVs\u201d) that are relevant\nfor exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit\nlosses being driven primarily by a subset of less\nthan twenty variables. The specific variables that\nhave the greatest effect on the modeled losses of\neach portfolio vary by portfolio and geography.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include\nregional U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. HPI.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S.\nunemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices,\nU.S. interest rates, U.S. corporate credit spreads,\noil prices, U.S. commercial real estate prices and\nU.S. HPI.\n\nChanges in the Firm\u2019s assumptions and forecasts of\neconomic conditions could significantly affect its\nestimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio\nat the balance sheet date or lead to significant\nchanges in the estimate from one reporting period\nto the next.\n\nAs a result of the First Republic acquisition, the\nFirm recorded an allowance for credit losses for\nthe loans acquired and lending-related commitments\nassumed as of May 1, 2023. Given the differences in\nrisk rating methodologies for the First Republic\nportfolio, and the ongoing integration of products\nand systems, the allowance for credit losses for\nthe acquired wholesale portfolio was measured based\non other facilities underwritten by the Firm with\nsimilar risk characteristics and not based on\nmodeled estimates. As such, the First Republic\nwholesale portfolio is excluded from the modeled\nestimates sensitivity analysis below. The allowance\nfor credit losses for predominantly all of the\nconsumer portfolio was measured using the Firm\u2019s\nmodeled approach, as the consumer portfolio is\npredominantly residential real estate that has more\ncommonly defined risk characteristics including\nloan to value ratio and credit score, and therefore\nis reflected in the sensitivity analysis below.\nRefer to Note 34 for additional information on the\nFirst Republic acquisition.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes\nin any one factor or input might affect the overall\nallowance for credit losses because management\nconsiders a wide variety of factors and inputs in\nestimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes\nin the factors and inputs considered may not occur\nat the same rate and may not be consistent across\nall geographies or product types, and changes in\nfactors and inputs may be directionally\ninconsistent, such that improvement in one factor\nor input may offset deterioration in others.\n\nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate\nmacroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the\nmodeled credit losses determined using its central\nand relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which\nare two of the five scenarios considered in\nestimating the allowances for loan losses and\nlending-related commitments. The central and\nrelative adverse scenarios each included a full\nsuite of MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths\nand peaks/troughs of those variables over the\neight-quarter forecast period.\n\nFor example, compared to the Firm\u2019s central\nscenario shown on page 131 and in Note 13 , the\nFirm\u2019s relative adverse scenario assumes an\nelevated U.S. unemployment rate, averaging\napproximately 2.1% higher over the eight-quarter\nforecast, with a peak difference of approximately\n2.7% in the fourth quarter of 2024; lower U.S. real\nGDP with a slower recovery, remaining nearly 3.3%\nlower at the end of the eight-quarter forecast,\nwith a peak difference of\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    155  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \napproximately 3.9% in the fourth quarter of 2024;\nand lower HPI with a peak difference of\napproximately 17.9% in the third quarter of 2025.\nThis analysis is not intended to estimate expected\nfuture changes in the allowance for credit losses,\nfor a number of reasons, including: \u2022 The allowance\nas of December 31, 2023 , reflects credit losses\nbeyond those estimated under the central scenario\ndue to the weight placed on the adverse scenarios.\n\u2022 The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both\ninterrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this\nanalysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more\nsevere changes in macroeconomic variables. \u2022\nExpectations of future changes in portfolio\ncomposition and borrower behavior can significantly\naffect the allowance for credit losses. To\ndemonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss\nestimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of December\n31, 2023, the Firm compared the modeled estimates\nunder its relative adverse scenario to its central\nscenario. Without considering offsetting or\ncorrelated effects in other qualitative components\nof the Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses, the\ncomparison between these two scenarios for the\nexposures below reflect the following differences:\n\u2022 An increase of approximately $850 million for\nresidential real estate loans and lending-related\ncommitments \u2022 An increase of approximately $3.1\nbillion for credit card loans \u2022 An increase of\napproximately $3.9 billion for wholesale loans and\nlending-related commitments This analysis relates\nonly to the modeled credit loss estimates and is\nnot intended to estimate changes in the overall\nallowance for credit losses as it does not reflect\nany potential changes in other adjustments to the\nquantitative calculation, which would also be\ninfluenced by the judgment management applies to\nthe modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the\nuncertainty and imprecision of these modeled\nlifetime loss estimates based on then-current\ncircumstances and conditions. Recognizing that\nforecasts of macroeconomic conditions are\ninherently uncertain, the Firm believes that its\nprocess to consider the available information and\nassociated risks and uncertainties is appropriately\ngoverned and that its estimates of expected credit\nlosses were reasonable and appropriate for the\nperiod ended December 31, 2023 .\n\nFair value JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its\nassets and liabilities at fair value. The majority\nof such assets and liabilities are measured at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis, including derivatives,\nstructured note products and certain securities\nfinancing agreements. Certain assets and\nliabilities are measured at fair value on a\nnonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage,\nhome equity and other loans, where the carrying\nvalue is based on the fair value of the underlying\ncollateral.

Estimating fair\nvalue requires the application of judgment. The\ntype and level of judgment required is largely\ndependent on the amount of observable market\ninformation available to the Firm. For instruments\nvalued using internally developed valuation models\nand other valuation techniques that use significant\nunobservable inputs and are therefore classified\nwithin level 3 of the fair value hierarchy,\njudgments used to estimate fair value are more\nsignificant than those required when estimating the\nfair value of instruments classified within levels\n1 and 2.\n\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an\ninstrument within level 3, management must first\ndetermine the appropriate valuation model or other\nvaluation technique to use. Second, the lack of\nobservability of certain significant inputs\nrequires management to assess relevant empirical\ndata in deriving valuation inputs including, for\nexample, transaction details, yield curves,\ninterest rates, prepayment speeds, default rates,\nvolatilities, correlations, prices (such as\ncommodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of\ncomparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and\ncredit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further\ndiscussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments,\nincluding unobservable inputs used.\n\nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3,\nmanagement judgment must be applied to assess the\nappropriate level of valuation adjustments to\nreflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm\u2019s\ncreditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity\nconsiderations, unobservable parameters, and for\nportfolios that meet specified criteria, the size\nof the net open risk position. The judgments made\nare typically affected by the type of product and\nits specific contractual terms, and the level of\nliquidity for the product or within the market as a\nwhole. In periods of heightened market volatility\nand uncertainty judgments are further affected by\nthe wider variation of reasonable valuation\nestimates, particularly for positions that are less\nliquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of\nvaluation adjustments applied by the Firm.\n\nImprecision in estimating unobservable market\ninputs or other factors can affect the amount of\ngain or loss recorded for a particular position.\nFurthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation\nmethods are appropriate and consistent with those\nof other market participants, the methods and\nassumptions used reflect management judgment and\nmay vary across the Firm\u2019s businesses and\nportfolios.\n\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions\nin the determination of fair value. The use of\nmethodologies or assumptions different than those\nused by the Firm could result in a different\nestimate of fair value at the reporting date. Refer\nto Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm\u2019s\nvaluation process and hierarchy, and its\ndetermination of fair value for individual\nfinancial instruments.\n                                                                                                            \n  Goodwill impairment                                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \nUnder U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to\nreporting units and tested for impairment at least\nannually. The Firm\u2019s process and methodology used\nto conduct goodwill impairment testing is described\nin Note 15.\n\nManagement applies significant judgment when\ntesting goodwill for impairment. The goodwill\nassociated with each business combination is\nallocated to the related reporting units for\ngoodwill impairment testing.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Firm\nreviewed current economic conditions, estimated\nmarket cost of equity, as well as actual business\nresults and projections of business performance.\nBased on such reviews, the Firm has concluded that\ngoodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2023.\nFor each of the reporting units, fair value\nexceeded carrying value by at least 9% and there\nwas no indication of a significant risk of goodwill\nimpairment based on current projections and\nvaluations.\n\nThe projections for the Firm\u2019s reporting units are\nconsistent with management\u2019s current business\noutlook assumptions in the short term, and the\nFirm\u2019s best estimates of long-term growth and\nreturn on equity in the longer term. Where\npossible, the Firm uses third-party and peer data\nto benchmark its assumptions and estimates.\n\nRefer to Note 15 for additional information on\ngoodwill, including the goodwill impairment\nassessment as of December 31, 2023.\n                                                                                                            \n  Credit card rewards liability                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \nJPMorgan Chase offers credit cards with various\nrewards programs which allow cardholders to earn\nrewards points based on their account activity and\nthe terms and conditions of the rewards program.\nGenerally, there are no limits on the points that\nan eligible cardholder can earn, nor do the points\nexpire, and the points can be redeemed for a\nvariety of rewards, including cash (predominantly\nin the form of account credits), gift cards and\ntravel. The Firm maintains a rewards liability\nwhich represents the estimated cost of rewards\npoints earned and expected to be redeemed by\ncardholders. The liability is accrued as the\ncardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when\nthe cardholder redeems points. This liability was\n$13.2 billion and $11.3 billion at December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively, and is recorded in\naccounts payable and other liabilities on the\nConsolidated balance sheets. The increase in the\nliability was predominantly driven by continued\ngrowth in rewards points earned on higher spend and\npromotional offers outpacing redemptions throughout\n2023, and, to a lesser extent, adjustments to\ncertain reward program terms in the second quarter\nof 2023.\n\nThe rewards liability is sensitive to redemption\nrate (\u201cRR\u201d) and cost per point (\u201cCPP\u201d) assumptions.\nThe RR assumption is used to estimate the number of\npoints earned by customers that will be redeemed\nover the life of the account. The CPP assumption is\nused to estimate the cost of future point\nredemptions. These assumptions are evaluated\nperiodically considering historical actuals,\ncardholder\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    157  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nredemption behavior and management judgment.\nUpdates to these assumptions will impact the\nrewards liability. As of December 31, 2023, a\ncombined increase of 25 basis points in RR and 1\nbasis point in CPP would increase the rewards\nliability by approximately $376 million.\n                                                                                                            \n  Income taxes                                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \nJPMorgan Chase is subject to the income tax laws of\nthe various jurisdictions in which it operates,\nincluding U.S. federal, state and local, and\nnon-U.S. jurisdictions. These laws are often\ncomplex and may be subject to different\ninterpretations. To determine the financial\nstatement impact of accounting for income taxes,\nincluding the provision for income tax expense and\nunrecognized tax benefits, JPMorgan Chase must make\nassumptions and judgments about how to interpret\nand apply these complex tax laws to numerous\ntransactions and business events, as well as make\njudgments regarding the timing of when certain\nitems may affect taxable income in the U.S. and\nnon-U.S. tax jurisdictions.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s interpretations of tax laws around\nthe world are subject to review and examination by\nthe various taxing authorities in the jurisdictions\nwhere the Firm operates, and disputes may occur\nregarding its view on a tax position. These\ndisputes over interpretations with the various\ntaxing authorities may be settled by audit,\nadministrative appeals or adjudication in the court\nsystems of the tax jurisdictions in which the Firm\noperates. JPMorgan Chase regularly reviews whether\nit may be assessed additional income taxes as a\nresult of the resolution of these matters, and the\nFirm records additional unrecognized tax benefits,\nas appropriate. In addition, the Firm may revise\nits estimate of income taxes due to changes in\nincome tax laws, legal interpretations, and\nbusiness strategies. It is possible that revisions\nin the Firm\u2019s estimate of income taxes may\nmaterially affect the Firm\u2019s results of operations\nin any reporting period.\n\nDeferred taxes arise from differences between\nassets and liabilities measured for financial\nreporting versus income tax return purposes.\nDeferred tax assets are recognized if, in\nmanagement\u2019s judgment, their realizability is\ndetermined to be more likely than not . Deferred\ntaxes are measured using enacted tax rates expected\nto apply to taxable income in the years in which\nthose temporary differences are expected to be\nrecovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes\nof a change in tax rates is recognized within the\nprovision for income taxes in the period enacted.\n\nThe Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in\nconnection with certain tax attributes, including\nnet operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards and\nforeign tax credit (\u201cFTC\u201d) carryforwards. The Firm\nperforms regular reviews to ascertain whether its\ndeferred tax assets are realizable. These reviews\ninclude management\u2019s estimates and assumptions\nregarding future taxable income , including foreign\nsource income, and may incorporate various tax\nplanning strategies, including strategies that may\nbe available to utilize NOLs and FTCs before they\nexpire. In connection with these reviews, if it is\ndetermined that a\n\ndeferred tax asset is not realizable, a valuation\nallowance is established. The valuation allowance\nmay be reversed in a subsequent reporting period if\nthe Firm determines that, based on revised\nestimates of future taxable income or changes in\ntax planning strategies, it is more likely than not\nthat all or part of the deferred tax asset will\nbecome realizable. As of December 31, 2023,\nmanagement has determined it is more likely than\nnot that the Firm will realize its deferred tax\nassets, net of the existing valuation allowance.\n\nThe Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as\nnecessary when new information becomes available,\nincluding changes in tax law and regulations, and\ninteractions with taxing authorities. Uncertain tax\npositions that meet the more-likely-than-not\nrecognition threshold are measured to determine the\namount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax\nposition is measured at the largest amount of\nbenefit that management believes is more likely\nthan not to be realized upon settlement. It is\npossible that the reassessment of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nunrecognized tax benefits may have a material\nimpact on its effective income tax rate in the\nperiod in which the reassessment occurs. Although\nthe Firm believes that its estimates are\nreasonable, the final tax amount could be different\nfrom the amounts reflected in the Firm\u2019s income tax\nprovisions and accruals. To the extent that the\nfinal outcome of these amounts is different than\nthe amounts recorded, such differences will\ngenerally impact the Firm\u2019s provision for income\ntaxes in the period in which such a determination\nis made.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s provision for income taxes is composed\nof current and deferred taxes. The current and\ndeferred tax provisions are calculated based on\nestimates and assumptions that could differ from\nthe actual results reflected in income tax returns\nfiled during the subsequent year. Adjustments based\non filed returns are generally recorded in the\nperiod when the tax returns are filed and the\nglobal tax implications are known, which could\nimpact the Firm\u2019s effective tax rate.\n\nRefer to Note 25 for additional information on\nincome taxes.\n                                                                                                            \n  Litigation reserves                                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \nRefer to Note 30 for a description of the\nsignificant estimates and judgments associated with\nestablishing litigation reserves.\n                                              \n  158    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                                         \n  ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS  \n                                         \n                                                                                                            \n  Financial Accounting Standards                                                                            \n  Board                                                                                                     \n  (\u201cFASB\u201d) Standards Adopted                                                                                \n  since January                                                                                             \n  1, 2021                                                                                                   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Standard                           Summary of guidance                 Effects on financial statements    \n                                     \u2022Provides optional expedients                                          \n  Reference Rate                     and exceptions to current           \u2022Issued and effective March 12,    \n  Reform                             accounting guidance when            2020.

Internal control\nover financial reporting is a process designed by,\nor under the supervision of, the Firm\u2019s principal\nexecutive and principal financial officers, or\npersons performing similar functions, and effected\nby JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Board of Directors, management\nand other personnel, to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial\nstatements for external purposes in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d).\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures\nthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records,\nthat, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly\nreflect the transactions and dispositions of the\nFirm\u2019s assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to\npermit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the Firm are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nmanagement and directors; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use or\ndisposition of the Firm\u2019s assets that could have a\nmaterial effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not prevent or\ndetect misstatements. Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are\nsubject to the risk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or\nthat the degree of compliance with the policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate. Management has\ncompleted an assessment of the effectiveness of the\nFirm\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as\nof December 31, 2023. In making the assessment,\nmanagement used the \u201cInternal Control \u2014 Integrated\nFramework\u201d (\u201cCOSO 2013\u201d) promulgated by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d).\n\nBased upon the assessment performed, management\nconcluded that as of December 31, 2023, JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s internal control over financial reporting\nwas effective based upon the COSO 2013 framework.\nAdditionally, based upon management\u2019s assessment,\nthe Firm determined that there were no material\nweaknesses in its internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Firm\u2019s internal control\nover financial reporting as of December 31, 2023,\nhas been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an\nindependent registered public accounting firm, as\nstated in their report which appears herein.\n\nJames Dimon\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial\nOfficer\n\nFebruary 16, 2024\n                                              \n  162    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.:\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal\nControl over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated\nbalance sheets of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its\nsubsidiaries (the \u201cFirm\u201d) as of December 31, 2023\nand 2022, and the related consolidated statements\nof income, comprehensive income, changes in\nstockholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for each of the\nthree years in the period ended December 31, 2023,\nincluding the related notes (collectively referred\nto as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d).

Our responsibility is to\nexpress opinions on the Firm\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial statements and on the Firm\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting based on our\naudits. We are a public accounting firm registered\nwith the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Firm in accordance\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities\nand Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the\nstandards of the PCAOB. Those standards require\nthat we plan and perform the audits to obtain\nreasonable assurance about\n\nwhether the consolidated financial statements are\nfree of material misstatement, whether due to error\nor fraud, and whether effective internal control\nover financial reporting was maintained in all\nmaterial respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements\nincluded performing procedures to assess the risks\nof material misstatement of the consolidated\nfinancial statements, whether due to error or\nfraud, and performing procedures that respond to\nthose risks. Such procedures included examining, on\na test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the\naccounting principles used and significant\nestimates made by management, as well as evaluating\nthe overall presentation of the consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our audit of internal control\nover financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial\nreporting, assessing the risk that a material\nweakness exists, and testing and evaluating the\ndesign and operating effectiveness of internal\ncontrol based on the assessed risk. Our audits also\nincluded performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis\nfor our opinions.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over\nFinancial Reporting\n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting is a process designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and\nprocedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of\nrecords that, in reasonable detail, accurately and\nfairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of\nthe assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded as\nnecessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and\ndirectors of the company; and (iii) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have\na material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not prevent or\ndetect misstatements. Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are\nsubject to the risk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or\nthat the degree of compliance with the policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate.\n                                                   \n  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP300 Madison AvenueNew  \n  York, NY 10017                                   \n                                                   \n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    163  \n                                              \nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n                                                                                                            \n  Critical Audit Matters                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nThe critical audit matters communicated below are\nmatters arising from the current period audit of\nthe consolidated financial statements that were\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the\naudit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated\nfinancial statements and (ii) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex\njudgments. The communication of critical audit\nmatters does not alter in any way our opinion on\nthe consolidated financial statements, taken as a\nwhole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matters below, providing separate\nopinions on the critical audit matters or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\nAllowance for Loan Losses \u2013 Portfolio-based\ncomponent of Wholesale Loan and Credit Card Loan\nPortfolios\n\nAs described in Note 13 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, the allowance for loan losses\nfor the portfolio-based component of the wholesale\nand credit card loan portfolios was $20.2 billion\non total portfolio-based retained loans of $881.3\nbillion at December 31, 2023 . The Firm\u2019s allowance\nfor loan losses represents management\u2019s estimate of\nexpected credit losses over the remaining expected\nlife of the Firm's loan portfolios and considers\nexpected future changes in macroeconomic\nconditions. The portfolio-based component of the\nFirm\u2019s allowance for loan losses for the wholesale\nand credit card retained loan portfolios begins\nwith a quantitative calculation of expected credit\nlosses over the expected life of the loan by\napplying credit loss factors to the estimated\nexposure at default. The credit loss factors\napplied are determined based on the weighted\naverage of five internally developed macroeconomic\nscenarios that take into consideration the Firm's\neconomic outlook as derived through forecast\nmacroeconomic variables, the most significant of\nwhich are U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross\ndomestic product. This quantitative calculation is\nfurther adjusted to take into consideration model\nimprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and\nother subjective factors that are not yet otherwise\nreflected in the credit loss estimate.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination\nthat performing procedures relating to the\nallowance for loan losses for the portfolio-based\ncomponent of the wholesale and credit card loan\nportfolios is a critical audit matter are (i) the\nsignificant judgment and estimation by management\nin the forecast of macroeconomic variables,\nspecifically U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross\ndomestic product, as the Firm\u2019s forecasts of\neconomic conditions significantly affect its\nestimate of expected credit losses at the balance\nsheet date, (ii) the significant judgment and\nestimation by management in determining the\nquantitative calculation utilized in their credit\nloss estimates and the adjustments to take into\nconsideration model imprecision, emerging risk\nassessments, trends and other subjective factors\nthat are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit\nloss estimate, which both in turn led to a high\ndegree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and\neffort in performing procedures and in\n\nevaluating audit evidence obtained relating to the\ncredit loss estimates and the appropriateness of\nthe adjustments to the credit loss estimates, and\n(iii) the audit effort involved the use of\nprofessionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing\nprocedures and evaluating audit evidence in\nconnection with forming our overall opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements. These procedures\nincluded testing the effectiveness of controls\nrelating to the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses,\nincluding controls over model validation and\ngeneration of macroeconomic scenarios. These\nprocedures also included, among others, testing\nmanagement\u2019s process for estimating the allowance\nfor loan losses, which involved (i) evaluating the\nappropriateness of the models and methodologies\nused in quantitative calculations; (ii) evaluating\nthe reasonableness of forecasts of U.S.\nunemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product;\n(iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of data\nused in the estimate; and (iv) evaluating the\nreasonableness of management\u2019s adjustments to the\nquantitative output for the impacts of model\nimprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and\nother subjective factors that are not yet otherwise\nreflected in the credit loss estimate. These\nprocedures also included the use of professionals\nwith specialized skill and knowledge to assist in\nevaluating the appropriateness of certain models,\nmethodologies and macroeconomic variables .\n\nFair Value of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments\n\nAs described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, the Firm carries $1.1\ntrillion of its assets and $541.4 billion of its\nliabilities at fair value on a recurring basis.\nIncluded in these balances are $11.3 billion of\ntrading assets and $42.2 billion of liabilities\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring basis,\ncollectively financial instruments, which are\nclassified as level 3 as they contain one or more\ninputs to valuation which are unobservable and\nsignificant to their fair value measurement. The\nFirm utilized internally developed valuation models\nand unobservable inputs to estimate fair value of\nthe level 3 financial instruments. The unobservable\ninputs used by management to estimate the fair\nvalue of certain of these financial instruments\ninclude interest rate volatility, interest rate\nspread volatility, Bermudan switch value, and\ncorrelation relating to interest rates, interest\nrate-to-foreign exchange, equity prices, equity-to-\nforeign exchange, equity-to-interest rate and\ncredit.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination\nthat performing procedures relating to the fair\nvalue of certain level 3 financial instruments is a\ncritical audit matter are (i) the significant\njudgment and estimation by management in\ndetermining the inputs to estimate fair value,\nwhich in turn led to a high degree of auditor\njudgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing\nprocedures and in evaluating audit evidence\nobtained related to the fair value of these\nfinancial instruments, and (ii) the audit effort\ninvolved the use of professionals with specialized\nskill and knowledge.\n                                              \n  164    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting\nFirm\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing\nprocedures and evaluating audit evidence in\nconnection with forming our overall opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements. These procedures\nincluded testing the effectiveness of controls\nrelating to the Firm\u2019s determination of the fair\nvalue, including controls over models, inputs, and\ndata. These procedures also included, among others,\nthe involvement of professionals with specialized\nskill and knowledge to assist in developing an\nindependent estimate of fair value for a sample of\nthese financial instruments and comparing\nmanagement\u2019s estimate to the independently\ndeveloped estimate of fair value. Developing the\nindependent estimate involved testing the\ncompleteness and accuracy of data provided by\nmanagement, developing independent inputs and, as\nappropriate, evaluating and utilizing management\u2019s\naforementioned unobservable inputs.\n\nFebruary 16, 2024\n\nWe have served as the Firm\u2019s auditor since 1965.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase &

(\u201cJPMorgan Chase\u201d or the \u201cFirm\u201d), a financial holding company incorporated under\nDelaware law in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The\nFirm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial\nbanking, financial transaction processing and asset management. On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired\ncertain assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank (the \u201cFirst Republic acquisition\u201d)\nfrom the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d). The Firm continues to convert certain operations,\nand to integrate clients, products and services associated with the First Republic acquisition, to align\nwith the Firm\u2019s businesses and operations. Accordingly, reporting classification and internal risk rating\nprofiles in the wholesale portfolio may change in future periods. Refer to Note 34 for additional\ninformation on the First Republic acquisition. The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan\nChase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the\naccounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. Consolidation The Consolidated\nFinancial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a\ncontrolling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nAssets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and\nare not included on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm determines whether it has a controlling\nfinancial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a\nvariable interest entity. Voting interest entities Voting interest entities are entities that have\nsufficient equity and provide the equity investors voting rights that enable them to make significant\ndecisions relating to the entity\u2019s operations. For these types of entities, the Firm\u2019s determination of\nwhether it has a controlling interest is primarily based on the amount of voting equity interests held.\nEntities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest, through ownership of the majority of the\nentities\u2019 voting equity interests, or through other contractual rights that give the Firm control, are\nconsolidated by the Firm. Investments in companies in which the Firm has significant influence over\noperating and financing decisions (but does not own a majority of the voting equity interests) are accounted\nfor (i) in accordance with the equity method of accounting, or (ii) at fair value if the fair value option\nwas elected. These investments are generally included in other assets, with income or loss included in\nnoninterest revenue. Certain Firm-sponsored asset management funds are structured as limited partnerships or\nlimited liability companies. For many of these entities, the Firm is the general partner or managing member,\nbut the non-affiliated partners or members have the ability to remove the Firm as the general partner or\nmanaging member without cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on a simple majority vote, or the non-\naffiliated partners or members have rights to participate in important decisions. Accordingly, the Firm does\nnot consolidate these voting interest entities. However, in the limited cases where the non-managing\npartners or members do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights, the Firm evaluates the funds\nas VIEs and consolidates the funds if the Firm is the general partner or managing member and has both power\nand a potentially significant interest. The Firm\u2019s investment companies and asset management funds have\ninvestments in both publicly-held and privately-held entities, including investments in buyouts, growth\nequity and venture opportunities. These investments are accounted for under investment company guidelines\nand, accordingly, irrespective of the percentage of equity ownership interests held, are carried on the\nConsolidated balance sheets at fair value, and are recorded in other assets, with income or loss included in\nnoninterest revenue. If consolidated, the Firm retains the accounting under such specialized investment\ncompany guidelines. Variable interest entities VIEs are entities that, by design, either (1) lack sufficient\nequity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from\nother parties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions\nrelating to the entity\u2019s operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the\nexpected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The most common\ntype of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are commonly used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain\nassets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to investors. The basic SPE structure involves a\ncompany selling assets to the SPE; the SPE funds the purchase of those assets by issuing securities to\ninvestors. The legal documents that govern the transaction specify how the cash earned on the assets must be\nallocated to the SPE\u2019s investors and other parties that have rights to those cash flows. SPEs are generally\nstructured to insulate investors from claims on the SPE\u2019s assets by creditors of other entities, including\nthe creditors of the seller of the assets. The primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has a\ncontrolling financial interest) is required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. The\nprimary beneficiary is the party that has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance; and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    171  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nobligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be\nsignificant to the VIE. To assess whether the Firm has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance, the Firm considers all the facts and circumstances,\nincluding its role in establishing the VIE and its ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment\nincludes, first, identifying the activities that most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance;\nand second, identifying which party, if any, has power over those activities. In general, the parties that\nmake the most significant decisions affecting the VIE (such as asset managers, collateral managers,\nservicers, or owners of call options or liquidation rights over the VIE\u2019s assets) or have the right to\nunilaterally remove those decision-makers are deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE. To\nassess whether the Firm has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from\nthe VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Firm considers all of its economic interests,\nincluding debt and equity investments, servicing fees, and derivatives or other arrangements deemed to be\nvariable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires that the Firm apply judgment in determining whether\nthese interests, in the aggregate, are considered potentially significant to the VIE. Factors considered in\nassessing significance include: the design of the VIE, including its capitalization structure; subordination\nof interests; payment priority; relative share of interests held across various classes within the VIE\u2019s\ncapital structure; and the reasons why the interests are held by the Firm. The Firm performs on-going\nreassessments of: (1) whether entities previously evaluated under the majority voting-interest framework\nhave become VIEs, based on certain events, and are therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework; and\n(2) whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding the Firm\u2019s involvement with a VIE cause the\nFirm\u2019s consolidation conclusion to change. Refer to Note 14 for further discussion of Firm-sponsored VIEs.\nRevenue recognition Interest income The Firm recognizes interest income on loans, debt securities, and other\ndebt instruments, generally on a level-yield basis, based on the underlying contractual rate. Refer to Note\n7 for further information. Revenue from contracts with customers JPMorgan Chase recognizes noninterest\nrevenue from certain contracts with customers , in investment banking fees, deposit-related fees, asset\nmanagement fees, commissions and other fees, and components of card income, when the Firm\u2019s related\nperformance obligations are satisfied. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion of the Firm\u2019s revenue from\ncontracts with customers. Principal transactions revenue JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and\nliabilities at fair value. Changes in fair value are reported primarily in principal transactions revenue.\nRefer to Notes 2 and 3 for further discussion of fair value measurement. Refer to Note 6 for further\ndiscussion of principal transactions revenue. Use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated financial\nstatements The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expense, and\ndisclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates.\nForeign currency translation JPMorgan Chase revalues assets, liabilities, revenue and expense denominated in\nnon-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars using applicable exchange rates. Gains and losses relating to\ntranslating functional currency financial statements for U.S. reporting are included in the Consolidated\nstatements of comprehensive income. Gains and losses relating to nonfunctional currency transactions,\nincluding non-U.S. operations where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, are reported in the\nConsolidated statements of income. Offsetting assets and liabilities U.S. GAAP permits entities to present\nderivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral\nreceivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master\nnetting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities sold and purchased under repurchase agreements\nand securities borrowed or loaned under securities loan agreements to be presented net when specified\nconditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has\nelected to net such balances where it has determined that the specified conditions are met. The Firm uses\nmaster netting agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk in certain transactions, including derivative\ncontracts, resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements. A master netting\nagreement is a single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that\nagreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the\nevent of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver\ncollateral or margin when due). Upon the exercise of derivatives termination rights by the non-defaulting\nparty (i) all transactions are terminated, (ii) all transactions are valued and the positive values of \u201cin\nthe money\u201d transactions are netted against the negative values of \u201cout of the money\u201d transactions and (iii)\nthe only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount.

Typical master netting agreements for these types of transactions also often\ncontain a collateral/margin agreement that provides for a security interest in, or title transfer of,\nsecurities or cash collateral/margin to the party that has the right to demand margin (the \u201cdemanding\nparty\u201d). The collateral/margin agreement typically requires a party to transfer collateral/margin to the\ndemanding party with a value equal to the amount of the margin deficit on a net basis across all\ntransactions governed by the master netting agreement, less any threshold. The collateral/margin agreement\ngrants to the demanding party, upon default by the counterparty, the right to set-off any amounts payable by\nthe counterparty against any posted collateral or the cash equivalent of any posted collateral/margin. It\nalso grants to the demanding party the right to liquidate collateral/margin and to apply the proceeds to an\namount payable by the counterparty.

Refer to Note 11 for further discussion of the Firm\u2019s securities financing agreements.\nStatements of cash flows For JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Consolidated statements of cash flows, cash is defined as\nthose amounts included in cash and due from banks and deposits with banks on the Consolidated balance\nsheets. Accounting standards adopted January 1, 2023 Derivatives and Hedging: Fair Value Hedging \u2013 Portfolio\nLayer Method The adoption of this guidance expanded the ability to hedge a portfolio of fixed-rate assets to\nallow more types of assets to be included in the portfolio, and to allow more of the portfolio to be hedged.\nThis guidance also clarified the types of derivatives that could be used as hedges, and the balance sheet\npresentation and disclosure requirements for the hedge accounting adjustments. As permitted by the guidance,\nthe Firm elected to transfer HTM securities to AFS and designated those securities in a portfolio layer\nmethod hedge upon adoption. The adoption impact of the transfer on retained earnings was not material. Refer\nto Note 5 and Note 10 for additional information. Financial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses: Troubled Debt\nRestructurings (\u201cTDRs\u201d) The adoption of this guidance eliminated the accounting and disclosure requirements\nfor TDRs, including the requirement to measure the allowance using a discounted cash flow (\u201cDCF\u201d)\nmethodology, and allowed the option of a non-DCF portfolio-based approach for modified loans to troubled\nborrowers. If a DCF methodology is still applied for these modified loans, the discount rate must be the\npost-modification effective interest rate, instead of the pre-modification effective interest rate. The Firm\nelected to apply its non-DCF, portfolio-based allowance approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers\nfor all portfolios except collateral-dependent loans and nonaccrual risk-rated loans which the Firm elected\nto continue applying a DCF methodology. Refer to Note 13 for a description of the portfolio-based allowance\napproach and the asset-specific allowance approach. This guidance was adopted on January 1, 2023 under the\nmodified retrospective method which resulted in a net decrease to the allowance for credit losses of $\n587million and an increase to retained earnings of $ 446million, after-tax, predominantly driven by\nresidential real estate and credit card. The adoption of this guidance eliminated the disclosure\nrequirements for TDRs including the requirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or\ninvolves a concession. The new guidance requires disclosure for loan modifications to borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty consisting of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, other-than-insignificant\npayment delay, term extension or a combination of these modifications. The Firm has defined these types of\nmodifications as financial difficulty modifications (\"FDMs\"). As a result of the elimination of the\nrequirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession, the population\nof loans considered FDMs differs from those previously considered TDRs. This guidance also requires\ndisclosure of current period gross charge-offs by vintage origination year.

These assets and liabilities\nare predominantly carried at fair value on a recurring basis (i.e., assets and liabilities that are measured\nand reported at fair value on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated balance sheets). Certain assets, liabilities and\nunfunded lending-related commitments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they are\nnot measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain\ncircumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). Fair value is defined as the price that\nwould be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants at the measurement date. Fair value is based on quoted market prices or inputs, where\navailable. If prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based on valuation models and other\nvaluation techniques that consider relevant transaction characteristics (such as maturity) and use, as\ninputs, observable or unobservable market parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities,\nprices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), correlations, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.\nFair value may also incorporate valuation adjustments. The level of precision in estimating unobservable\nmarket inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position.\nFurthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of\nother market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across\nthe Firm\u2019s businesses and portfolios. The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the\ndetermination of fair value. The use of different methodologies or assumptions by other market participants\ncompared with those used by the Firm could result in the Firm deriving a different estimate of fair value at\nthe reporting date. Valuation process Risk-taking functions are responsible for providing fair value\nestimates for assets and liabilities carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The Firm\u2019s\nValuation Control Group (\u201cVCG\u201d), which is part of the Firm\u2019s Finance function and independent of the risk-\ntaking functions, is responsible for verifying these estimates and determining any fair value adjustments\nthat may be required to ensure that the Firm\u2019s positions are recorded at fair value. In addition, the Firm\u2019s\nValuation Governance Forum (\u201cVGF\u201d), which is composed of senior finance and risk executives, is responsible\nfor overseeing the management of risks arising from valuation activities conducted across the Firm. The\nFirmwide VGF is chaired by the Firmwide head of the VCG (under the direction of the Firm\u2019s Controller), and\nincludes sub-forums covering the CIB, CCB, CB, AWM and certain corporate functions including Treasury and\nCIO. Price verification process The VCG verifies fair value estimates provided by the risk-taking functions\nby leveraging independently derived prices, valuation inputs and other market data, where available. Where\nindependent prices or inputs are not available, the VCG performs additional review to ensure the\nreasonableness of the estimates. The additional review may include evaluating the limited market activity\nincluding client unwinds, benchmarking valuation inputs to those used for similar instruments, decomposing\nthe valuation of structured instruments into individual components, comparing expected to actual cash flows,\nreviewing profit and loss trends, and reviewing trends in collateral valuation. There are also additional\nlevels of management review for more significant or complex positions. The VCG determines any valuation\nadjustments that may be required to the estimates provided by the risk-taking functions. No adjustments to\nquoted prices are applied for instruments classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy (refer to\nthe discussion below for further information on the fair value hierarchy). For other positions, judgment is\nrequired to assess the need for valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect liquidity considerations,\nunobservable parameters, and, for certain portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open\nrisk position. The determination of such adjustments follows a consistent framework across the Firm: \u2022\nLiquidity valuation adjustments are considered where an observable external price or valuation parameter\nexists but is of lower reliability, potentially due to lower market activity. Liquidity valuation\nadjustments are made based on current market conditions. Factors that may be considered in determining the\nliquidity adjustment include analysis of: (1) the estimated bid-offer spread for the instrument being\ntraded; (2) alternative pricing points for similar instruments in active markets; and (3) the range of\nreasonable values that the price or parameter could take. \u2022 The Firm manages certain portfolios of financial\ninstruments on the basis of net open risk exposure and, as permitted by U.S. GAAP, has elected to estimate\nthe fair value of such portfolios on the basis of a transfer of the entire net open risk position in an\norderly transaction. Where this is the case, valuation adjustments may be necessary to reflect the cost of\nexiting a larger-than-normal market-size net open risk position. Where applied, such adjustments are based\non factors that a relevant market participant would consider in the transfer of the net open risk position,\nincluding the size of the adverse market move that is likely to occur during the period required to\nsufficiently reduce the net open risk position. \u2022 Uncertainty adjustments related to unobservable parameters\nmay be made when positions are valued using prices or input parameters to valuation models that are\nunobservable due to a lack of market activity or\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    175  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nbecause they cannot be implied from observable market data. Such prices or parameters must be estimated and\nare, therefore, subject to management judgment. Adjustments are made to reflect the uncertainty inherent in\nthe resulting valuation estimate. \u2022 Where appropriate, the Firm also applies adjustments to its estimates of\nfair value in order to appropriately reflect counterparty credit quality (CVA), the Firm\u2019s own\ncreditworthiness (DVA) and the impact of funding (FVA), using a consistent framework across the Firm. Refer\nto Credit and funding adjustments on page 192 of this Note for more information on such adjustments.\nValuation model review and approval If prices or quotes are not available for an instrument or a similar\ninstrument, fair value is generally determined using valuation models that consider relevant transaction\nterms such as maturity and use as inputs market-based or independently sourced parameters. Where this is the\ncase the price verification process described above is applied to the inputs in those models. Under the\nFirm\u2019s Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy, MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well as\nmaterial changes to existing models, prior to implementation in the operating environment. In certain\ncircumstances exceptions may be granted to the Firm\u2019s policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or\napproval. MRGR may also require the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to\nbe used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model and may include, for example, limitation of\ntrading activity. Fair value hierarchy A three-level fair value hierarchy has been established under U.S.\nGAAP for disclosure of fair value measurements. The fair value hierarchy is based on the observability of\ninputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as\nfollows. \u2022 Level 1 \u2013 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets\nor liabilities in active markets. \u2022 Level 2 \u2013 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for\nsimilar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability,\neither directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. \u2022 Level 3 \u2013 one\nor more inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\nA financial instrument\u2019s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of\ninput that is significant to the fair value measurement.\n

for at the lower of cost or net realizable\nvalue. \u201cNet realizable value\u201d is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell\n(\u201ctransaction costs\u201d). Transaction costs for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories are either not\napplicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair\nvalue for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net\nrealizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because\nunder fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 5 for\na further discussion of the Firm\u2019s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value\ndisclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.\n\n(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical\nsecurities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    181  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its\nequivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private\nequity funds, real estate and other funds, were $ 1.0billion and $ 950million, respectively. Included in\nthese balances at December 31, 2023 and 2022, were trading assets of $ 42million and $ 43million,\nrespectively, and other assets of $ 984million and $ 907million, respectively.\n\n(e) At December 31, 2023 and 2022, included $ 10.2billion and $ 9.7billion, respectively, of residential\nfirst-lien mortgages, and $ 6.0billion and $ 6.8billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages.\nResidential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs\nand government agencies of $ 2.9billion and $ 2.4billion, respectively.\n\n(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables\nand the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement\nexists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit\nassociated with cash collateral.\n                                              \n  182    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nLevel 3 valuations\n\nThe Firm has established well-structured processes for determining fair value, including for instruments\nwhere fair value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). Refer to pages 175\u2013179 of\nthis Note for further information on the Firm\u2019s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the\ndetermination of fair value for individual financial instruments. Estimating fair value requires the\napplication of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of\nobservable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed\nvaluation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore\nclassified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more\nsignificant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and\n2. In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first\ndetermine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, due to the lack of\nobservability of significant inputs, management must assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation\ninputs including transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates,\nvolatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable\ninstruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. The following table presents the Firm\u2019s primary level\n3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial\ninstruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or\narithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is\nbased on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3\nfinancial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted\nand can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or\nlevel 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable\ncomponents of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified\nwithin levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is\nrepresentative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments\nwithin a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values\npresented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being\nused to value. In the Firm\u2019s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect\nthe degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm\u2019s estimates and\nassumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the\nrelative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts\nmay have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly\ndifferent implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or\nstrike prices. The input range and weighted and arithmetic average values will therefore vary from period-\nto-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at\neach balance sheet date.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    183  \n                                              \n

The impact of changes in inputs may not be\nindependent, as a change in one unobservable input may give rise to a change in another unobservable input.\nWhere relationships do exist between two unobservable inputs, those relationships are discussed below.\nRelationships may also exist between observable and unobservable inputs (for example, as observable interest\nrates rise, unobservable prepayment rates decline); such relationships have not been included in the\ndiscussion below. In addition, for each of the individual relationships described below, the inverse\nrelationship would also generally apply. The following discussion also provides a description of attributes\nof the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the\nvaluation of the Firm\u2019s positions. Yield \u2013 The yield of an asset is the interest rate used to discount\nfuture cash flows in a discounted cash flow calculation. An increase in the yield, in isolation, would\nresult in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Credit spread \u2013 The credit spread is the amount of\nadditional annualized return over the market interest rate that a market participant would demand for taking\nexposure to the credit risk of an instrument. The credit spread for an instrument forms part of the discount\nrate used in a discounted cash flow calculation. Generally, an increase in the credit spread would result in\na decrease in a fair value measurement. The yield and the credit spread of a particular mortgage-backed\nsecurity primarily reflect the risk inherent in the instrument. The yield is also impacted by the absolute\nlevel of the coupon paid by the instrument (which may not correspond directly to the level of inherent\nrisk). Therefore, the range of yield and credit spreads reflects the range of risk inherent in various\ninstruments owned by the Firm. The risk inherent in mortgage-backed securities is driven by the\nsubordination of the security being valued and the characteristics of the underlying mortgages within the\ncollateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores, LTV ratios for residential mortgages and the nature of\nthe property and/or any tenants for commercial mortgages. For corporate debt securities, obligations of U.S.\nstates and municipalities and other similar instruments, credit spreads reflect the credit quality of the\nobligor and the tenor of the obligation. Prepayment speed \u2013 The prepayment speed is a measure of the\nvoluntary unscheduled principal repayments of a prepayable obligation in a collateralized pool. Prepayment\nspeeds generally decline as borrower delinquencies rise. An increase in prepayment speeds, in isolation,\nwould result in a decrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a premium to par and an increase\nin a fair value measurement of assets valued at a discount to par. Prepayment speeds may vary from\ncollateral pool to collateral pool, and are driven by the type and location of the underlying borrower, and\nthe remaining tenor of the obligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or floating) of interest\nrate being paid by the borrower. Typically collateral pools with higher borrower credit quality have a\nhigher prepayment rate than those with lower borrower credit quality, all other factors being equal.\nConditional default rate \u2013 The conditional default rate is a measure of the reduction in the outstanding\ncollateral balance underlying a collateralized obligation as a result of defaults. While there is typically\nno direct relationship between conditional default rates and prepayment speeds, collateralized obligations\nfor which the underlying collateral has high prepayment speeds will tend to have lower conditional default\nrates. An increase in conditional default rates would generally be accompanied by an increase in loss\nseverity and an increase in credit spreads. An increase in the conditional default rate, in isolation, would\nresult in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Conditional default rates reflect the quality of the\ncollateral underlying a securitization and the structure of the securitization itself. Based on the types of\nsecurities owned in the Firm\u2019s market-making portfolios, conditional default rates are most typically at the\nlower end of the range presented. Loss severity \u2013 The loss severity (the inverse concept is the recovery\nrate) is the expected amount of future realized losses resulting from the ultimate liquidation of a\nparticular loan, expressed as the net amount of loss relative to the outstanding loan balance. An increase\nin loss severity is generally accompanied by an increase in conditional default rates. An increase in the\nloss severity, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The loss severity\napplied in valuing a mortgage-backed security depends on factors relating to the underlying mortgages,\nincluding the LTV ratio, the nature of the lender\u2019s lien on the property and other instrument-specific\nfactors.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    185  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nCorrelation \u2013 Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two variables.\nCorrelation is a pricing input for a derivative product where the payoff is driven by one or more underlying\nrisks. Correlation inputs are related to the type of derivative (e.g., interest rate, credit, equity,\nforeign exchange and commodity) due to the nature of the underlying risks. When parameters are positively\ncorrelated, an increase in one parameter will result in an increase in the other parameter. When parameters\nare negatively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in a decrease in the other parameter. An\nincrease in correlation can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement. Given a short\ncorrelation position, an increase in correlation, in isolation, would generally result in a decrease in a\nfair value measurement. The level of correlation used in the valuation of derivatives with multiple\nunderlying risks depends on a number of factors including the nature of those risks. For example, the\ncorrelation between two credit risk exposures would be different than that between two interest rate risk\nexposures. Similarly, the tenor of the transaction may also impact the correlation input, as the\nrelationship between the underlying risks may be different over different time periods. Furthermore,\ncorrelation levels are very much dependent on market conditions and could have a relatively wide range of\nlevels within or across asset classes over time, particularly in volatile market conditions. Volatility \u2013\nVolatility is a measure of the variability in possible returns for an instrument, parameter or market index\ngiven how much the particular instrument, parameter or index changes in value over time. Volatility is a\npricing input for options, including equity options, commodity options, and interest rate options.\nGenerally, the higher the volatility of the underlying, the riskier the instrument. Given a long position in\nan option, an increase in volatility, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair value\nmeasurement. The level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular option-based derivative depends\non a number of factors, including the nature of the risk underlying the option (e.g., the volatility of a\nparticular equity security may be significantly different from that of a particular commodity index), the\ntenor of the derivative as well as the strike price of the option. Bermudan switch value \u2013 The switch value\nis the difference between the overall value of a Bermudan swaption, which can be exercised at multiple\npoints in time, and its most expensive European swaption and reflects the additional value that the multiple\nexercise dates provide the holder. Switch values are dependent on market conditions and can vary greatly\ndepending on a number of factors, such as the tenor of the underlying swap as well as the strike price of\nthe option. An increase in switch value, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair value\nmeasurement . Interest rate curve \u2013 The interest rate curve represents the relationship of interest rates\nover differing tenors. The interest rate curve is used to set interest rate and foreign exchange derivative\ncash flows and is also a pricing input used in the discounting of any derivative cash flow. Forward price \u2013\nThe forward price is the price at which the buyer agrees to purchase the asset underlying a forward contract\non the predetermined future delivery date, and is such that the value of the contract is zero at inception.\nThe forward price is used as an input in the valuation of certain derivatives and depends on a number of\nfactors including interest rates, the current price of the underlying asset, and the expected income to be\nreceived and costs to be incurred by the seller as a result of holding that asset until the delivery date.\nAn increase in the forward can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement. Changes in\nlevel 3 recurring fair value measurements The following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated\nbalance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm\nwithin level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. When a\ndetermination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the\nsignificance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial\ninstruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components\n(that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the\ngains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are\npart of the valuation methodology. The Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial\ninstruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains\nor losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm\u2019s risk management activities related\nto such level 3 instruments.\n                                              \n  186    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n

CVA represents the\nadjustment, relative to the relevant benchmark\ninterest rate, necessary to reflect counterparty\nnonperformance risk. The Firm estimates CVA using a\nscenario analysis to estimate the expected positive\ncredit exposure across all of the Firm\u2019s existing\npositions with each counterparty, and then\nestimates losses based on the probability of\ndefault and estimated recovery rate as a result of\na counterparty credit event considering contractual\nfactors designed to mitigate the Firm\u2019s credit\nexposure, such as collateral and legal rights of\noffset. The key inputs to this methodology are (i)\nthe probability of a default event occurring for\neach counterparty, as derived from observed or\nestimated CDS spreads; and (ii) estimated recovery\nrates implied by CDS spreads, adjusted to consider\nthe differences in recovery rates as a derivative\ncreditor relative to those reflected in CDS\nspreads, which generally reflect senior unsecured\ncreditor risk. FVA represents the adjustment to\nreflect the impact of funding and is recognized\nwhere there is evidence that a market participant\nin the principal market would incorporate it in a\ntransfer of the instrument. The Firm\u2019s FVA\nframework, applied to uncollateralized (including\npartially collateralized) over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d)\nderivatives incorporates key inputs such as: (i)\nthe expected funding requirements arising from the\nFirm\u2019s positions with\n\neach counterparty and collateral arrangements; and\n(ii) the estimated market funding cost in the\nprincipal market which, for derivative liabilities,\nconsiders the Firm\u2019s credit risk (DVA). For\ncollateralized derivatives, the fair value is\nestimated by discounting expected future cash flows\nat the relevant overnight indexed swap rate given\nthe underlying collateral agreement with the\ncounterparty, and therefore a separate FVA is not\nnecessary.\nThe following table provides the impact of credit\nand funding adjustments on principal transactions\nrevenue in the respective periods, excluding the\neffect of any associated hedging activities. The\nFVA presented below includes the impact of the\nFirm\u2019s own credit quality on the inception value of\nliabilities as well as the impact of changes in the\nFirm\u2019s own credit quality over time.\n                                                                                  \n  Year ended December 31,                                                         \n  (in millions)                              2023           2022            2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Credit and funding adjustments:                                                 \n  Derivatives CVA                    $  221          $  22          $  362        \n  Derivatives FVA                       114             42              47        \n                                                                                  \nValuation adjustments on fair value option elected\nliabilities\n\nThe valuation of the Firm\u2019s liabilities for which\nthe fair value option has been elected requires\nconsideration of the Firm\u2019s own credit risk. DVA on\nfair value option elected liabilities reflects\nchanges (subsequent to the issuance of the\nliability) in the Firm\u2019s probability of default and\nLGD, which are estimated based on changes in the\nFirm\u2019s credit spread observed in the bond market.\nRealized (gains)/losses due to DVA for fair value\noption elected liabilities are reported in\nprincipal transactions revenue. Unrealized\n(gains)/losses are reported in OCI.

These shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa\nClass A common shares (\u201cVisa A shares\u201d) at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain\nlitigation matters involving Visa. The conversion rate of Visa B shares to Visa A shares was 1.5875at\nDecember 31, 2023 and may be adjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the litigation matters.\nThe outcome of those litigation matters, and the effect that the resolution of those matters may have on the\nconversion rate, is unknown. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2023, there is significant uncertainty\nregarding when the transfer restrictions on Visa B shares may be terminated and what the final conversion\nrate for the Visa B shares will be. As a result of these considerations, as well as differences in voting\nrights, Visa B shares are not considered to be similar to Visa A shares, and they continue to be held at\ntheir nominal carrying value.\n\nIn connection with prior sales of Visa B shares, the Firm has entered into derivative instruments with the\npurchasers of the shares under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the conversion\nrate. Under the terms of the derivative instruments, the Firm will (a) make or receive payments based on\nsubsequent changes in the conversion rate and (b) make periodic interest payments to the purchasers of the\nVisa B shares. The payments under the derivative instruments will continue as long as the Visa B shares\nremain subject to transfer restrictions. The derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value using a\ndiscounted cash flow methodology based upon the Firm\u2019s estimate of the timing and magnitude of final\nresolution of the litigation matters. The derivative instruments are recorded in trading liabilities, and\nchanges in fair value are recognized in other income. As of December 31, 2023, the Firm held derivative\ninstruments associated with 23million Visa B shares that the Firm had previously sold, which are all subject\nto similar terms and conditions.\n\nOn January 24, 2024, Visa filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC announcing that Visa\u2019s\nstockholders approved amendments to its Certificate of Incorporation that redenominate the Visa B shares to\nVisa Class B-1 common shares (\u201cVisa B-1 shares\u201d) and authorize Visa to conduct one or more exchange offers\n(\"the Program\") which, if conducted, would have the effect of releasing transfer restrictions on a portion\nof Visa's B-1 shares through an exchange for Visa Class C common shares (\u201cVisa C shares\u201d). The Program would\nentitle the Firm to exchange its Visa B-1 shares, for Visa Class B-2 common shares (\u201dVisa B-2 shares\u201d) and\nVisa C shares, through an initial exchange offer if and when conducted by Visa. The Visa B-2 shares would\ncontinue to be subject to the transfer restrictions associated with the Visa B shares. The Firm is then\nentitled to sell the Visa C shares received after a brief lock-up period expires, and Visa is also\nauthorized to extend offers for potential future exchanges, each enabling the release of additional Visa B\nshares if certain conditions are met. The timing and likelihood of any initial or future exchange offer is\ndependent upon actions taken by Visa and other factors that may be outside of the Firm\u2019s control.\n                                              \n  194    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nAdditional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not carried on the\nConsolidated balance sheets at fair value U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of\ncertain financial instruments, which are included in the following table. However, this table does not\ninclude other items, such as nonfinancial assets, intangible assets, certain financial instruments, and\ncustomer relationships. In the opinion of management, these items, in the aggregate, add significant value\nto JPMorgan Chase. Financial instruments for which carrying value approximates fair value Certain financial\ninstruments that are not carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets are carried at amounts\nthat approximate fair value, due to their short-term nature and generally negligible credit risk. These\ninstruments include cash and due from banks, deposits with banks, federal funds sold, securities purchased\nunder resale agreements and securities borrowed, short-term receivables and accrued interest receivable,\nshort-term borrowings, federal funds purchased, securities loaned and sold under repurchase agreements,\naccounts payable, and accrued liabilities. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that the fair value of deposit\nliabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., demand, savings and certain money market deposits) be equal to\ntheir carrying value; recognition of the inherent funding value of these instruments is not permitted.\nThe following table presents, by fair value hierarchy classification, the carrying values and estimated fair\nvalues

the\ncharacteristics of the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual\nfees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and\nprimary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the\nvalue of the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan\u2019s allowance for\nloan losses, which represents the loan\u2019s expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The\ndifference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to\nchanges in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that\naffect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value.\n(b) Includes FHLB advances in level 2 of Long-term debt and Short-term borrowings and the Purchase Money\nNote in level 3 of Long-term debt associated with First Republic.

The Firm has elected to measure\ncertain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income statement volatility\ncaused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain instruments\nthat otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements\nthat are accounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are\nmanaged on a fair value basis. The Firm\u2019s election of fair value includes the following instruments: \u2022 Loans\npurchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting,\nor managed on a fair value basis, including lending-related commitments \u2022 Certain securities financing\nagreements \u2022 Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit\nderivatives, which would otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument \u2022\nStructured notes and other hybrid instruments, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain\nembedded derivatives, that are issued or transacted as part of client-driven activities \u2022 Certain long-term\nbeneficial interests issued by CIB\u2019s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying assets are\ncarried at fair value\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    197  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nChanges in fair value under the fair value option election\nThe following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, for items for which the fair value option was elected.

Refer to Note 7 for\nfurther information regarding interest income and interest expense.\nDetermination of instrument-specific credit risk for items for which the fair value option was elected The\nfollowing describes how the gains and losses that are attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit\nrisk, were determined. \u2022 Loans and lending-related commitments: For floating-rate instruments, all changes\nin value are attributed to instrument-specific credit risk. For fixed-rate instruments, an allocation of the\nchanges in value for the period is made between those changes in value that are interest rate-related and\nchanges in value that are credit-related. Allocations are generally based on an analysis of borrower-\nspecific credit spread and recovery information, where available, or benchmarking to similar entities or\nindustries. \u2022 Long-term debt: Changes in value attributable to instrument-specific credit risk were derived\nprincipally from observable changes in the Firm\u2019s credit spread as observed in the bond market. \u2022 Securities\nfinancing agreements: Generally, for these types of agreements, there is a requirement that collateral be\nmaintained with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned; as a result, there\nwould be no adjustment or an immaterial adjustment for instrument-specific credit risk related to these\nagreements.\n                                              \n  198

applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-\nterm beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests,\nfor which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-protected\nstructured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of\nprincipal at maturity, but for structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an\nunderlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit\nrisk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.\n(d) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the\ncontractual principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm\u2019s\nnext call date.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair\nvalue option was elected was $ 9.7billion and $ 7.6billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of\n$ 97million and $ 24million, respectively.

JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit portfolios to\nassess potential credit risk concentrations and to obtain additional collateral when deemed necessary and\npermitted under the Firm\u2019s agreements. Senior management is significantly involved in the credit approval\nand review process, and risk levels are adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm\u2019s risk appetite. In the\nFirm\u2019s consumer portfolio, concentrations are managed primarily by product and by U.S. geographic region,\nwith a key focus on trends and concentrations at the portfolio level, where potential credit risk\nconcentrations can be remedied through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. Refer to\nNote 12 for additional information on the geographic composition of the Firm\u2019s consumer loan portfolios. In\nthe wholesale portfolio, credit risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by industry and monitored\nregularly on both an aggregate portfolio level and on an individual client or counterparty basis. The Firm\u2019s\nwholesale exposure is managed through loan syndications and participations, loan sales, securitizations,\ncredit derivatives, master netting agreements, collateral and other risk-reduction techniques. Refer to Note\n12 for additional information on loans. The Firm does not believe that its exposure to any particular loan\nproduct or industry segment results in a significant concentration of credit risk. Terms of loan products\nand collateral coverage are included in the Firm\u2019s assessment when extending credit and establishing its\nallowance for credit losses. Refer to Note 13 for additional information on the allowance for credit losses.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    201  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nThe table below presents both on\u2013balance sheet and off\u2013balance sheet consumer and wholesale credit exposure\nby the Firm\u2019s three credit portfolio segments as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.

JPMorgan Chase\nmakes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk\nexposures. Predominantly all of the Firm\u2019s derivatives are entered into for market-making or risk management\npurposes. Market-making derivatives The majority of the Firm\u2019s derivatives are entered into for market-\nmaking purposes. Clients use derivatives to mitigate or modify interest rate, credit, foreign exchange,\nequity and commodity risks. The Firm actively manages the risks from its exposure to these derivatives by\nentering into other derivative contracts or by purchasing or selling other financial instruments that\npartially or fully offset the exposure from client derivatives. Risk management derivatives The Firm manages\ncertain market and credit risk exposures using derivative instruments, including derivatives in hedge\naccounting relationships and other derivatives that are used to manage risks associated with specified\nassets and liabilities. The Firm generally uses interest rate derivatives to manage the risk associated with\nchanges in interest rates. Fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market value as\ninterest rates change. Similarly, interest income and expense increase or decrease as a result of variable-\nrate assets and liabilities resetting to current market rates, and as a result of the repayment and\nsubsequent origination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at current market rates. Gains and\nlosses on the derivative instruments related to these assets and liabilities are expected to substantially\noffset this variability. Foreign currency derivatives are used to manage the foreign exchange risk\nassociated with certain foreign currency\u2013denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and liabilities and\nforecasted transactions, as well as the Firm\u2019s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches\nwhose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. As a result of fluctuations in foreign currencies, the\nU.S. dollar\u2013equivalent values of the foreign currency\u2013denominated assets and liabilities or the forecasted\nrevenues or expenses increase or decrease. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments related to these\nforeign currency\u2013denominated assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions, are expected to\nsubstantially offset this variability. Commodities derivatives are used to manage the price risk of certain\ncommodities inventories. Gains or losses on these derivative instruments are expected to substantially\noffset the depreciation or appreciation of the related inventory. Credit derivatives are used to manage the\ncounterparty credit risk associated with loans and lending-related commitments. Credit derivatives\ncompensate the purchaser when the entity referenced in the contract experiences a credit event, such as\nbankruptcy or a failure to pay an obligation when due. Credit derivatives primarily consist of CDS. Refer to\nthe Credit derivatives section on pages 214\u2013216 of this Note for a further discussion of credit derivatives.\nRefer to the risk management derivatives gains and losses table on page 214 and the hedge accounting gains\nand losses tables on pages 211\u2013213 of this Note for more information about risk management derivatives.\nDerivative counterparties and settlement types The Firm enters into OTC derivatives, which are negotiated\nand settled bilaterally with the derivative counterparty. The Firm also enters into, as principal, certain\nETD such as futures and options, and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with CCPs. ETD contracts are generally\nstandardized contracts traded on an exchange and cleared by the CCP, which is the Firm\u2019s counterparty from\nthe inception of the transactions. OTC-cleared derivatives are traded on a bilateral basis and then novated\nto the CCP for clearing. Derivative clearing services The Firm provides clearing services for clients in\nwhich the Firm acts as a clearing member at certain exchanges and clearing houses. The Firm does not reflect\nthe clients\u2019 derivative contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 28 for further\ninformation on the Firm\u2019s clearing services. Accounting for derivatives All free-standing derivatives that\nthe Firm executes for its own account are required to be recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair\nvalue. As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets derivative assets and liabilities, and the related cash\ncollateral receivables and payables, when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists between the\nFirm and the derivative counterparty. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and\nliabilities. The accounting for changes in value of a derivative depends on whether or not the transaction\nhas been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are\nreported and measured at fair value through earnings. The tabular disclosures on pages 207\u2013214 of this Note\nprovide additional information on the amount of, and reporting for, derivative assets, liabilities, gains\nand losses. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for a further discussion of derivatives embedded in structured notes.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    203  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nDerivatives designated as hedges The Firm applies hedge accounting to certain derivatives executed for risk\nmanagement purposes \u2013 generally interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. However, JPMorgan\nChase does not seek to apply hedge accounting to all of the derivatives associated with the Firm\u2019s risk\nmanagement activities. For example, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to purchased CDS used to manage\nthe credit risk of loans and lending-related commitments, because of the difficulties in qualifying such\ncontracts as hedges. For the same reason, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to certain interest rate,\nforeign exchange, and commodity derivatives used for risk management purposes. To qualify for hedge\naccounting, a derivative must be highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being\nhedged. In addition, for a derivative to be designated as a hedge, the risk management objective and\nstrategy must be documented. Hedge documentation must identify the derivative hedging instrument, the asset\nor liability or forecasted transaction and type of risk to be hedged, and how the effectiveness of the\nderivative is assessed prospectively and retrospectively. To assess effectiveness, the Firm uses statistical\nmethods such as regression analysis, nonstatistical methods such as dollar-value comparisons of the change\nin the fair value of the derivative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item, and\nqualitative comparisons of critical terms and the evaluation of any changes in those terms. The extent to\nwhich a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in\nthe fair value or cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed and documented at least quarterly. If it is\ndetermined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is\ndiscontinued. There are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair value hedges, cash flow hedges\nand net investment hedges. JPMorgan Chase uses fair value hedges primarily to hedge fixed-rate long-term\ndebt, AFS securities and certain commodities inventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, the changes in\nthe fair value of the derivative, and in the value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are\nrecognized in earnings. Certain amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in OCI\nand recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then\nthe adjustment to the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the hedged item and, for\ninterest-bearing financial instruments, is amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment. Derivative amounts\naffecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item \u2013 primarily net\ninterest income and principal transactions revenue. Effective January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted the new\nportfolio layer method hedge accounting guidance which expanded the ability to hedge a portfolio of fixed-\nrate assets to allow more types of assets to be included in the portfolio, and to allow more of the\nportfolio to be hedged. The Firm employs the Portfolio Layer Method to manage the interest rate risk of\nportfolios of fixed-rate assets. Throughout the life of the open hedge, basis adjustments are maintained at\nthe portfolio level and are only allocated to individual assets under certain circumstances. These include\ninstances where the portfolio amount falls below the hedged layer amounts, or in cases of voluntary de-\ndesignation. JPMorgan Chase uses cash flow hedges primarily to hedge the exposure to variability in\nforecasted cash flows from floating-rate assets and liabilities and foreign currency\u2013denominated revenue and\nexpense. For qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in OCI\nand recognized in earnings as the hedged item affects earnings. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are\nrecognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item \u2013 primarily noninterest revenue, net\ninterest income and compensation expense. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the change in value\nof the derivative recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when the cash flows that were hedged affect\nearnings. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted transaction is expected to not\noccur according to the original hedge forecast, any related derivative values recorded in AOCI are\nimmediately recognized in earnings. JPMorgan Chase uses net investment hedges to protect the value of the\nFirm\u2019s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the\nU.S. dollar. For qualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to\nchanges in spot foreign exchange rates are recorded in OCI as translation adjustments. Amounts excluded from\nthe assessment of effectiveness are recorded directly in earnings.\n                                              \n  204    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n

Derivatives contracts generally require\nadditional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined rating threshold is\nbreached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting\ncorresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional\ncollateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings\ndowngrade), nor in termination payment requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based\nupon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative\ncontract.\n                                                                                                            \n  Liquidity                                                                                                 \n  impact of                                                                                                 \n  downgrade                                                                                                 \n  triggers                                                                                                  \n  on OTC and                                                                                                \n  OTC-cleared             December 31,                                 December 31,                         \n  derivatives                     2023                                         2022                         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (in millions)           Single-notch              Two-notch          Single-notch              Two-notch  \n                             downgrade              downgrade             downgrade              downgrade  \n  Amount of                                                                                                 \n  additional                                                                                                \n  collateral to     $               75    $             1,153    $              128    $             1,293  \n  be                                                                                                        \n  posted upon                                                                                               \n  downgrade(a)                                                                                              \n  Amount                                                                                                    \n  required to                                                                                               \n  settle                                                                                                    \n  contracts with                    93                    592                    88                    925  \n  termination                                                                                               \n  triggers upon                                                                                             \n  downgrade(b)                                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \n(a) Includes the additional collateral to be posted for initial margin.\n\n(b) Amounts represent fair values of derivative payables, and do not reflect collateral posted.\n\nDerivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset\n\nIn certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains\nthe economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in\ncontemplation of the initial transfer.

Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no\nincremental impact to net income in future periods.\n(b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis\nadjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future\nperiods.

At December 31, 2023, the\namortized cost of the portfolio layer method closed portfolios was $ 83.9billion, of which $ 68.0billion was\ndesignated as hedged. The amount designated as hedged is the sum of the notional amounts of all outstanding\nlayers in each portfolio, which includes both spot starting and forward starting layers. The cumulative\namount of basis adjustments was $( 165) million, which is comprised of $ 73million and $( 238) million for\nactive and discontinued hedging relationships, respectively.

Gains\nand losses were recorded in principal transactions\nrevenue.\nGains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives The Firm makes\nmarkets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks\nassociated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit\nrisk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified\nrisk management categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are\nprimarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 6 for information on principal\ntransactions revenue.\n\nCredit derivatives Credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk\nassociated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) and which allow one party (the\nprotection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Credit derivatives\nexpose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller, as the protection seller\nis required to make payments under the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event, such\nas a bankruptcy, a failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring. The seller of credit protection\nreceives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument referenced in\nthe contract will be subject to a credit event. The Firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the\ncredit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes. First, in its capacity as a\nmarket-maker, the Firm actively manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit\nprotection, predominantly on corporate debt obligations, to meet the needs of customers. Second, as an end-\nuser, the Firm uses credit derivatives to manage credit risk associated with lending exposures (loans and\nunfunded commitments) in its wholesale and consumer businesses and derivatives counterparty exposures in its\nwholesale businesses, and to manage the credit risk arising from certain financial instruments in the Firm\u2019s\nmarket-making businesses. Following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives.\n                                              \n  214    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nCredit default swaps Credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single reference entity\n(\u201csingle-name\u201d), broad-based index or portfolio. The Firm purchases and sells protection on both single-\nname and index-reference obligations. Single-name CDS and index CDS contracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared\nderivative contracts. Single-name CDS are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity,\nwhile index CDS contracts are used to manage the credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or\ncredit market segments. Like the S&P 500 and other market indices, a CDS index consists of a portfolio of\nCDS across many reference entities. New series of CDS indices are periodically established with a new\nunderlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in the credit markets. If one of the reference\nentities in the index experiences a credit event, then the reference entity that defaulted is removed from\nthe index. CDS can also be referenced against specific portfolios of reference names or against customized\nexposure levels: for example, to provide protection against the first $ 1million of realized credit losses\nin a $ 10million portfolio of exposure. Such structures are commonly known as tranche CDS. For both single-\nname CDS contracts and index CDS contracts, upon the occurrence of a credit event, under the terms of a CDS\ncontract neither party to the CDS contract has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser\nhas recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the\nfair value of the reference obligation at settlement of the credit derivative contract, also known as the\nrecovery value. The protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying\nreference entity in order to receive amounts due under the CDS contract when a credit event occurs. Credit-\nrelated notes A credit-related note is a funded derivative with a credit risk component where the issuer of\nthe credit-related note purchases from the note investor credit protection on a reference entity or an\nindex. Under the contract, the investor pays the issuer the par value of the note at the inception of the\ntransaction, and in return, the issuer makes periodic payments to the investor, based on the credit risk of\nthe referenced entity. The issuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the\nreference entity (or one of the entities that makes up a reference index) experiences a specified credit\nevent. If a credit event occurs, the issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note, but rather,\nthe issuer pays the investor the difference between the par value of the note and the fair value of the\ndefaulted reference obligation at the time of settlement. Neither party to the credit-related note has\nrecourse to the defaulting reference entity. The following tables present a summary of the notional amounts\nof credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nUpon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of protection would typically pay out a percentage of the full\nnotional amount of net protection sold, as the amount actually required to be paid on the contracts takes\ninto account the recovery value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement. The Firm manages the\ncredit risk on contracts to sell protection by purchasing protection with identical or similar underlying\nreference entities. Other purchased protection referenced in the following tables includes credit\nderivatives bought on related, but not identical, reference positions (including indices, portfolio coverage\nand other reference points) as well as protection purchased by CIB through credit-related notes. Other\npurchased protection also includes credit protection against certain loans in the retained lending portfolio\nthrough the issuance of credit derivatives and credit-related notes.\n

notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence\nof a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic\nhedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm\u2019s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.\n                                                                                                            \n

in\ninvestment banking fees, deposit-related fees,\nasset management fees, commissions and other fees,\nand components of card income. The related\ncontracts are often terminable on demand and the\nFirm has no remaining obligation to deliver future\nservices. For arrangements with a fixed term, the\nFirm may commit to deliver services in the future.\nRevenue associated with these remaining performance\nobligations typically depends on the occurrence of\nfuture events or underlying asset values, and is\nnot recognized until the outcome of those events or\nvalues are known. Investment banking fees This\nrevenue category includes debt and equity\nunderwriting and advisory fees. As an underwriter,\nthe Firm helps clients raise capital via public\noffering and private placement of various types of\ndebt and equity instruments. Underwriting fees are\nprimarily based on the issuance price and quantity\nof the underlying instruments, and are recognized\nas revenue typically upon execution of the client\u2019s\ntransaction. The Firm also manages and syndicates\nloan arrangements.

In connection with its client-driven market-making activities, the Firm transacts\nin debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities, including physical commodities inventories and\nfinancial instruments that reference commodities. Principal transactions revenue also includes realized and\nunrealized gains and losses related to: \u2022 derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting\nrelationships, primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk; \u2022 derivatives used for\nspecific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit, foreign exchange and interest rate risks.\nRefer to Note 5 for further information on the income statement classification of gains and losses from\nderivatives activities. In the financial commodity markets, the Firm transacts in OTC derivatives (e.g.,\nswaps, forwards, options) and ETD that reference a wide range of underlying commodities. In the physical\ncommodity markets, the Firm primarily purchases and sells precious and base metals and may hold other\ncommodities inventories under financing and other arrangements with clients. The following table presents\nall realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in principal transactions revenue. This table excludes\ninterest income and interest expense on trading assets and liabilities, which are an integral part of the\noverall performance of the Firm\u2019s client-driven market-making activities in CIB and fund deployment\nactivities in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Note 7 for further information on interest income and interest\nexpense. Trading revenue is presented primarily by instrument type.

Certain credit\ncard products offer the cardholder the ability to\nearn points based on account activity, which the\ncardholder can choose to redeem for cash and non-\ncash rewards. The cost to the Firm related to these\nproprietary rewards programs varies based on\nmultiple factors including the terms and conditions\nof the rewards\n\nprograms, cardholder activity, cardholder reward\nredemption rates and cardholder reward selections.\nThe Firm maintains a liability for its obligations\nunder its rewards programs and reports the current-\nperiod cost as a reduction of card income. Credit\ncard revenue sharing agreements The Firm has\ncontractual agreements with numerous co-brand\npartners that grant the Firm exclusive rights to\nissue co-branded credit card products and market\nthem to the customers of such partners.

Substantially all the defined benefit pension plans are closed to\nnew participants. The principal defined benefit pension plan in the U.S., which covered substantially all\nU.S. employees, was closed to new participants and frozen for existing participants on January 1, 2020, (and\nJanuary 1, 2019 for new hires on or after December 2, 2017). Interest credits continue to accrue to\nparticipants\u2019 accounts based on their accumulated balances. The Firm maintains funded and unfunded\npostretirement benefit plans that provide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees and\nretirees as well as their dependents covered under these programs. None of these plans have a material\nimpact on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Firm also provides a qualified defined\ncontribution plan in the U.S. and maintains other similar arrangements in certain non-U.S. locations. The\nmost significant of these plans is the JPMorgan Chase 401(k) Savings Plan (\u201cthe 401(k) Savings Plan\u201d), which\ncovers substantially all U.S. employees. Employees can contribute to the 401(k) Savings Plan on a pretax\nand/or Roth 401(k) after-tax basis. The Firm makes annual matching and pay credit contributions to the\n401(k) Savings Plan on behalf of eligible participants.\nThe following table presents the pretax benefit obligations, plan assets, the net funded status, and the\namounts recorded in AOCI on the Consolidated balance sheets for the Firm\u2019s significant defined benefit\npension and OPEB plans.\n                                                                                                   \n  As of or for the year ended December 31,              Defined benefit                            \n  (in millions)                                  pension and OPEB plans  2023                2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Projected benefit obligations               $                 -14,740          $  -13,545        \n  Fair value of plan assets                                      22,013              19,890        \n  Net funded status                                               7,273               6,345        \n  Accumulated other comprehensive                                -1,517              -1,916        \n  income/(loss)                                                                                    \n                                                                                                   \nThe weighted-average discount rate used to value the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nwas 5.16% and 5.14%, respectively.\n\nGains and losses\n\nGains or losses resulting from changes in the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets are\nrecorded in OCI. Amortization of net gains or losses are recognized as part of the net periodic benefit cost\nover subsequent periods, if, as of the beginning of the year, the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the\ngreater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of the plan assets. Amortization is generally\nover the average expected remaining lifetime of plan participants, given the frozen status of most plans.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the net gain was attributable to market-driven increases in the fair\nvalue of plan assets, partially offset by changes in the discount rate and interest crediting rate. During\nthe year ended December 31, 2022, a remeasurement of the Firm\u2019s U.S. principal defined benefit plan in the\nthird quarter, was required as a result of a pension settlement. The remeasurement resulted in a reduction\nin the fair value of the Firm\u2019s U.S. principal defined benefit plan assets, reflecting market conditions at\nthe time of remeasurement, and a reduction in the plan\u2019s projected benefit obligation totaling $ 4.0billion\nand $ 2.6billion, respectively, resulting in a net decrease of $ 1.4billion in pre-tax AOCI.\nThe following table presents the net periodic benefit costs reported in the Consolidated statements of\nincome for the Firm\u2019s defined benefit pension, defined contribution and OPEB plans, and in other\ncomprehensive income for the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.\n                                                                                                            \n  Year ended December                                                                                       \n  31, (in millions)            Pension and OPEB plans  2023            2022                     2021        \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Total net periodic                                                                                        \n  defined benefit plan      $                    -393        $   -192          -b    $    -201          -b  \n  cost/(credit)(a)                                                                                          \n  Total defined                                 1,609           1,408                    1,333              \n  contribution plans                                                                                        \n  Total pension and OPEB                                                                                    \n  cost included in          $                   1,216        $  1,216                $   1,132              \n  noninterest expense                                                                                       \n  Total recognized in                                                                                       \n  other comprehensive       $                    -421        $  1,459                $  -1,129              \n  (income)/loss                                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \n(a) The service cost component of net periodic defined benefit cost is reported in compensation expense;

Returns on\nasset classes are developed using a forward-looking\napproach and are not strictly based on historical\nreturns, with consideration given to current market\nconditions and the portfolio mix of each plan. The\ndiscount rates used in determining the benefit\nobligations are generally provided by the Firm\u2019s\nactuaries, with the Firm\u2019s principal defined\nbenefit pension plan using a rate that was selected\nby reference to the yields on portfolios of bonds\nwith maturity dates and coupons that closely match\neach of the plan\u2019s projected cash flows.\n\nInvestment strategy and asset allocation The assets\nof the Firm\u2019s defined benefit pension plans are\nheld in various trusts and are invested in well-\ndiversified portfolios of equity and fixed income\nsecurities, cash and cash equivalents, and\nalternative investments. The Firm regularly reviews\nthe asset allocations and asset managers, as well\nas other factors that could impact the portfolios,\nwhich are rebalanced when deemed necessary. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the approved asset allocation\nranges by asset class for the Firm\u2019s principal\ndefined benefit plan are 42- 100% debt securities,\n0- 40% equity securities, 0- 2% real estate, and 0-\n10% alternatives. Assets held by the Firm\u2019s defined\nbenefit pension and OPEB plans do not include\nsecurities issued by JPMorgan Chase or its\naffiliates, except through indirect exposures\nthrough investments in exchange traded funds,\nmutual funds and collective investment funds\nmanaged by third-parties. The defined benefit\npension and OPEB plans hold investments that are\nsponsored or managed by affiliates of JPMorgan\nChase in the amount of $ 1.8billion and $\n1.7billion, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\n\nFair value measurement of the plans\u2019 assets and\nliabilities\n\nRefer to Note 2 for information on fair value\nmeasurements, including descriptions of level 1, 2,\nand

Under the terms of the LTIP, as of December 31, 2023, 54million shares of common\nstock were available for issuance through May 2025. The LTIP is the only active plan under which the Firm is\ncurrently granting share-based incentive awards. In the following discussion, the LTIP, plus prior Firm\nplans and plans assumed as the result of acquisitions, are referred to collectively as the \u201cLTI Plans,\u201d and\nsuch plans constitute the Firm\u2019s share-based incentive plans. RSUs are awarded at no cost to the recipient\nupon their grant. Generally, RSUs are granted annually and vest at a rate of 50% after two yearsand 50%\nafter three yearsand are converted into shares of common stock as of the vesting date. In addition, RSUs\ntypically include full-career eligibility provisions, which allow employees to continue to vest upon\nvoluntary termination based on age and/or service-related requirements, subject to post-employment and other\nrestrictions. All RSU awards are subject to forfeiture until vested and contain clawback provisions that may\nresult in cancellation under certain specified circumstances. Predominantly all RSUs entitle the recipient\nto receive cash payments equivalent to any dividends paid on the underlying common stock during the period\nthe RSUs are outstanding. Performance share units (\u201cPSUs\u201d) are granted annually, and approved by the Firm\u2019s\nBoard of Directors, to members of the Firm\u2019s Operating Committee under the variable compensation program.\nPSUs are subject to the Firm\u2019s achievement of specified performance criteria over a three-year period. The\nnumber of awards that vest can range from zeroto 150% of the grant amount. In addition, dividends that\naccrue during the vesting period are reinvested in dividend equivalent share units. PSUs and the related\ndividend equivalent share units are converted into shares of common stock after vesting. Once the PSUs and\ndividend equivalent share units have vested, the shares of common stock that are delivered, after applicable\ntax withholding, must be retained for an additional holding period, for a total combined vesting and holding\nperiod of approximately fiveto eightyears from the grant date depending on regulations in certain countries.\nUnder the LTI Plans, stock appreciation rights (\u201cSARs\u201d) were generally granted with an exercise price equal\nto the fair value of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s common stock on the grant date. SARs generally expire ten yearsafter\nthe grant date. In 2021, the Firm awarded its Chairman and CEO and its President and Chief Operating Officer\n1.5million and 750,000SARs, respectively. There were nogrants of SARs in 2023 or 2022. The Firm separately\nrecognizes compensation expense for each tranche of each award, net of estimated forfeitures, as if it were\na separate award with its own vesting date. Generally, for each tranche granted, compensation expense is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the vesting date of the respective tranche,\nprovided that the employees will not become full-career eligible during the vesting period. For awards with\nfull-career eligibility provisions and awards granted with no future substantive service requirement, the\nFirm accrues the estimated value of awards expected to be awarded to employees as of the grant date without\ngiving consideration to the impact of post-employment restrictions. For each tranche granted to employees\nwho will become full-career eligible during the vesting period, compensation expense is recognized on a\nstraight-line basis from the grant date until the earlier of the employee\u2019s full-career eligibility date or\nthe vesting date of the respective tranche. The Firm\u2019s policy for issuing shares upon settlement of employee\nshare-based incentive awards is to issue either new shares of common stock or treasury shares. During 2023,\n2022 and 2021, the Firm settled all of its employee share-based awards by issuing treasury shares.

Debt securities\nclassified as trading assets are discussed in Note 2. Predominantly all of the Firm\u2019s AFS and HTM securities\nare held by Treasury and CIO in connection with its asset-liability management activities. AFS securities\nare carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and losses, after any\napplicable hedge accounting adjustments or allowance for credit losses, are reported in AOCI. The specific\nidentification method is used to determine realized gains and losses on AFS securities, which are included\nin investment securities gains/(losses) on the Consolidated statements of income. HTM securities, which the\nFirm has the intent and ability to hold until maturity, are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for\ncredit losses, on the Consolidated balance sheets. For both AFS and HTM securities, purchase discounts or\npremiums are generally amortized into interest income on a level-yield basis over the contractual life of\nthe security. However, premiums on certain callable debt securities are amortized to the earliest call date.\nEffective January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted the portfolio layer method hedge accounting guidance which\npermitted a transfer of HTM securities to AFS upon adoption. The Firm transferred obligations of U.S. states\nand municipalities with a carrying value of $ 7.1billion resulting in the recognition of $ 38million net\npre-tax unrealized losses in AOCI. Refer to Note 1 and Note 24 for additional information. During 2022, the\nFirm transferred investment securities with a fair value of $ 78.3billion from AFS to HTM for capital\nmanagement purposes. AOCI included pretax unrealized losses of $ 4.8billion on the securities at the date of\ntransfer. Unrealized gains or losses at the date of transfer of these securities continue to be reported in\nAOCI and are amortized into interest income on a level-yield basis over the remaining life of the\nsecurities. This amortization will offset the effect on interest income of the amortization of the premium\nor discount resulting from the transfer recorded at fair value. Transfers of securities between AFS and HTM\nare non-cash transactions.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    227  \n

The\nFirm generally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable, consistent\nwith its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income. The Firm did\nnot reverse through interest income any accrued interest receivable for the years ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022.\n(e) As of December 31, 2023, included $ 24.2billion of AFS securities associated with First Republic. Refer\nto Note 34 for additional information.\nAt December 31, 2023 , the investment securities portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average\ncredit rating of AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily\nupon internal risk ratings). Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of securities and\ndifferentiate risk within the portfolio. The Firm\u2019s internal risk ratings generally align with the\nqualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to\nchanges in the economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody\u2019s, however the quantitative characteristics\n(e.g., probability of default (\u201cPD\u201d) and loss given default (\u201cLGD\u201d)) may differ as they reflect internal\nhistorical experiences and assumptions. Risk ratings are assigned at acquisition, reviewed on a regular and\nongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and adjusted as necessary over the life of the investment for\nupdated information affecting the issuer\u2019s ability to fulfill its obligations.\n                                              \n  228    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nAFS securities impairment\nThe following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses by aging category for AFS securities\nat December 31, 2023 and 2022.

The Firm\nrecognizes impairment losses in earnings if the\nFirm has the intent to sell the debt security, or\nif it is more likely than not that the Firm will be\nrequired to sell the debt security before recovery\nof its amortized cost. In these circumstances the\nimpairment loss is recognized in investment\nsecurities gains/(losses) in the Consolidated\nStatements of Income and is equal to the full\ndifference between the amortized cost (net of\nallowance if applicable) and the fair value of the\nsecurity. For impaired debt securities that the\nFirm has the intent and ability to hold, the\nsecurities are evaluated to determine if a credit\nloss exists. If it is determined that a credit loss\nexists, that loss is recognized as an allowance for\ncredit losses through the provision for credit\nlosses in the Consolidated Statements of Income,\nlimited by the amount of impairment. Any impairment\non debt securities that the Firm has the intent and\nability to hold not due to credit losses is\nrecorded in OCI. Factors considered in evaluating\ncredit losses include adverse conditions\nspecifically related to the industry, geographic\narea or financial condition of the issuer or\nunderlying collateral of a security; and payment\nstructure of the security. When assessing\nsecurities issued in a securitization for credit\nlosses, the Firm estimates cash flows considering\nrelevant market and economic data, underlying loan-\nlevel data, and structural features of the\nsecuritization, such as subordination, excess\nspread, overcollateralization or other forms of\ncredit enhancement, and compares the losses\nprojected for the underlying collateral (\u201cpool\nlosses\u201d) against the level of credit enhancement in\nthe securitization structure to determine whether\nthese features are sufficient to absorb the pool\nlosses, or whether a credit loss exists. For\nbeneficial interests in securitizations that are\nrated below \u201cAA\u201d at their acquisition, or that can\nbe contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in\nsuch a way that the Firm would not recover\nsubstantially all of its recorded investment, the\nFirm evaluates impairment for credit losses when\nthere is an adverse change in expected cash flows.\n\nHTM securities \u2013 credit risk Allowance for credit\nlosses The allowance for credit losses on HTM\nsecurities represents expected credit losses over\nthe remaining expected life of the securities. The\nallowance for credit losses on HTM obligations of\nU.S. states and municipalities and commercial\nmortgage-backed securities is calculated by\napplying statistical credit loss factors (estimated\nPD and LGD) to the amortized cost. The credit loss\nfactors are derived using a weighted average of\nfive internally developed eight-quarter\nmacroeconomic scenarios, followed by a single year\nstraight-line interpolation to revert to long run\nhistorical information for periods beyond the\nforecast period. Refer to Note 13 for further\ninformation on the eight-quarter macroeconomic\nforecast. The allowance for credit losses on HTM\ncollateralized loan obligations and U.S.\nresidential mortgage-backed securities is\ncalculated as the difference between the amortized\ncost and the present value of the cash flows\nexpected to be collected, discounted at the\nsecurity\u2019s effective interest rate. These cash flow\nestimates are developed based on expectations of\nunderlying collateral performance derived using the\neight-quarter macroeconomic forecast and the single\nyear straight-line interpolation, as well as\nconsidering the structural features of the\nsecurity. The application of different inputs and\nassumptions into the calculation of the allowance\nfor credit losses is subject to significant\nmanagement judgment, and emphasizing one input or\nassumption over another, or considering other\ninputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of\nthe allowance for credit losses on HTM securities.\nCredit quality indicator The primary credit quality\nindicator for HTM securities is the risk rating\nassigned to each security.At December 31, 2023 and\n2022, all HTM securities were rated investment\ngrade and were current and accruing, with\napproximately 99% and 98% rated at least AA+,\nrespectively. Allowance for credit losses on\ninvestment securities The allowance for credit\nlosses on investment securities was $ 128million, $\n96million and $ 42million as of December 31, 2023,\n2022 and 2021, respectively, which included a\ncumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings\nrelated to the transfer of HTM securities to AFS\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023.

Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period,\nweighted based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon,\namortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives,\nincluding closed portfolio hedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield\nexcludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from\ntheir contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable\ndebt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.\n(b) For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the allowance\nfor credit losses of $ 34million and the portfolio layer fair value hedge basis adjustments of $ 73million\nat December 31, 2023. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities also excludes the allowance for\ncredit losses of $ 94million at December 31, 2023.\n(c) Substantially all of the Firm\u2019s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in\n10years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects\nanticipated future prepayments, is approximately seven yearsfor agency residential MBS, seven yearsfor\nagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations, and six yearsfor nonagency residential\ncollateralized mortgage obligations.\n(d) Includes AFS securities associated with First Republic, primarily due after 10 years.

Securities financing agreements are treated as\ncollateralized financings on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated balance sheets. Where appropriate under applicable\naccounting guidance, securities financing agreements with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis.\nRefer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. Fees received and paid\nin connection with securities financing agreements are recorded over the life of the agreement in interest\nincome and interest expense on the Consolidated statements of income. The Firm has elected the fair value\noption for certain securities financing agreements. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding the\nfair value option. The securities financing agreements for which the fair value option has been elected are\nreported within securities purchased under resale agreements, securities loaned or sold under repurchase\nagreements, and securities borrowed on the Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements carried at\nfair value, current-period interest accruals are recorded within interest income and interest expense, with\nchanges in fair value reported in principal transactions revenue. However, for financial instruments\ncontaining embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with accounting\nguidance for hybrid instruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest elements, are reported in\nprincipal transactions revenue. Securities financing agreements not elected under the fair value option are\nmeasured at amortized cost. As a result of the Firm\u2019s credit risk mitigation practices described below, the\nFirm did not hold any allowance for credit losses with respect to resale and securities borrowed\narrangements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Credit risk mitigation practices Securities financing\nagreements expose the Firm primarily to credit and liquidity risk. To manage these risks, the Firm monitors\nthe value of the underlying securities (predominantly high-quality securities collateral, including\ngovernment-issued debt and U.S. GSEs and government agencies MBS) that it has received from or provided to\nits counterparties compared to the value of cash proceeds and exchanged collateral, and either requests\nadditional collateral or returns securities or collateral when appropriate. Margin levels are initially\nestablished based upon the counterparty, the type of underlying securities, and the permissible collateral,\nand are monitored on an ongoing basis. In resale and securities borrowed agreements, the Firm is exposed to\ncredit risk to the extent that the value of the securities received is less than initial cash principal\nadvanced and any collateral amounts exchanged. In repurchase and securities loaned agreements, credit risk\nexposure arises to the extent that the value of underlying securities advanced exceeds the value of the\ninitial cash principal received, and any collateral amounts exchanged. Additionally, the Firm typically\nenters into master netting agreements and other similar arrangements with its counterparties, which provide\nfor the right to liquidate the underlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged in the event of a\ncounterparty default. It is also the Firm\u2019s policy to take possession, where possible, of the securities\nunderlying resale and securities borrowed agreements. Refer to Note 29 for further information regarding\nassets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements.\n                                              \n  232    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nThe table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm\u2019s securities financing agreements, as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master\nnetting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the\nFirm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing\nagreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral\nwith its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not\neligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal\nopinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with securities\nfinancing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the\ntable below as \u201cAmounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,\u201d and reduces the \u201cNet amounts\u201d\npresented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances\nare presented gross in the \u201cNet amounts\u201d below. In transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a\nsecurities-for-securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as\ncollateral, the Firm recognizes the securities received at fair value within other assets and the obligation\nto return those securities within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n

The Firm\naccounts for loans based on the following categories: \u2022 Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment\n(i.e., \u201cretained\u201d) \u2022 Loans held-for-sale \u2022 Loans at fair value The following provides a detailed accounting\ndiscussion of the Firm\u2019s loans by category: Loans held-for-investment Originated or purchased loans held-\nfor-investment, including PCD, are recorded at amortized cost, reflecting the principal amount outstanding,\nnet of the following: unamortized deferred loan fees, costs, premiums or discounts; charge-offs; collection\nof cash; and foreign exchange. Credit card loans also include billed finance charges and fees. Interest\nincome Interest income on performing loans held-for-investment is accrued and recognized as interest income\nat the contractual rate of interest. Purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees\nor costs, are recognized in interest income over the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment of yield.\nThe Firm classifies accrued interest on loans, including accrued but unbilled interest on credit card loans,\nin accrued interest and accounts receivables on the Consolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans,\naccrued interest once billed is then recognized in the loan balances, with the related allowance recorded in\nthe allowance for credit losses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses on accrued interest on credit\ncard loans are recognized in the provision for credit losses and charge-offs are recognized by reversing\ninterest income. For other loans, the Firm generally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on\naccrued interest receivables, consistent with its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by\nreversing interest income. Nonaccrual loans Nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest has\nbeen suspended. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government\nagencies) are placed on nonaccrual status and considered nonperforming when full payment of principal and\ninterest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has been in\ndefault for a period of 90days or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of\ncollection. A loan is determined to be past due when the minimum payment is not received from the borrower\nby the contractually specified due date or for certain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), when a\nmonthly payment is due and unpaid for 30days or more. Finally, collateral-dependent loans are typically\nmaintained on nonaccrual status. On the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all interest accrued but\nnot collected is reversed against interest income. In addition, the amortization of deferred amounts is\nsuspended. Interest income on nonaccrual loans may be recognized as cash interest payments are received\n(i.e., on a cash basis) if the recorded loan balance is deemed fully collectible; however, if there is doubt\nregarding the ultimate collectibility of the recorded loan balance, all interest cash receipts are applied\nto reduce the carrying value of the loan (the cost recovery method). For consumer loans, application of this\npolicy typically results in the Firm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual consumer loans on a cash\nbasis. A loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is reasonably assured and there has been\ndemonstrated performance under the terms of the loan or, if applicable, the terms of the restructured loan.\nAs permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans are generally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual\nstatus; accordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans continue to accrue until the loan is\ncharged off or paid in full. Allowance for loan losses The allowance for loan losses represents the\nestimated expected credit losses in the held-for-investment loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and is\nrecognized on the balance sheet as a contra asset, which brings the amortized cost to the net carrying\nvalue. Changes in the allowance for loan losses are recorded in the provision for credit losses on the\nFirm\u2019s Consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note 13 for further information on the Firm\u2019s accounting\npolicies for the allowance for loan losses. Charge-offs Consumer loans are generally charged off or charged\ndown to the lower of the amortized cost or the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair\nvalue less estimated costs to sell), with an offset to the allowance for loan losses, upon reaching\nspecified stages of delinquency in accordance with standards established by the FFIEC. Residential real\nestate loans, unmodified credit card loans and scored business banking loans are generally charged off no\nlater than 180days past due. Scored auto and closed-end consumer loans, including modified credit card\naccounts placed on a fixed payment plan, are charged off no later than 120days past due. Certain consumer\nloans are charged off or charged down to their net realizable value earlier than the FFIEC charge-off\nstandards in the following circumstances: \u2022 Loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty\nthat are determined to be collateral-dependent.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    235  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n\u2022 Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event that suggests a loss is either known or highly certain\nare subject to accelerated charge-off standards (e.g., residential real estate and auto loans are charged\noff or charged down within 60days of receiving notification of a bankruptcy filing). \u2022 Auto loans upon\nrepossession of the automobile. Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not\nrecognize charge-offs on the government-guaranteed portion of loans. Wholesale loans are charged off when it\nis highly certain that a loss has been realized. The determination of whether to recognize a charge-off\nincludes many factors, including the prioritization of the Firm\u2019s claim in bankruptcy, expectations of the\nworkout/restructuring of the loan and valuation of the borrower\u2019s equity or the loan collateral. When a loan\nis charged down to the lower of its amortized cost or the estimated net realizable value of the underlying\ncollateral, the determination of the fair value of the collateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g.,\nsecurities, real estate). In cases where the collateral is in the form of liquid securities, the fair value\nis based on quoted market prices or broker quotes. For illiquid securities or other financial assets, the\nfair value of the collateral is generally estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For residential real\nestate loans, collateral values are based upon external valuation sources. When it becomes likely that a\nborrower is either unable or unwilling to pay, the Firm utilizes a broker\u2019s price opinion, appraisal and/or\nan automated valuation model of the home based on an exterior-only valuation (\u201cexterior opinions\u201d), which is\nthen updated at least every 12months, or more frequently depending on various market factors. As soon as\npracticable after the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt (e.g., by taking legal title or\nphysical possession), the Firm generally obtains an appraisal based on an inspection that includes the\ninterior of the home (\u201cinterior appraisals\u201d). Exterior opinions and interior appraisals are discounted based\nupon the Firm\u2019s experience with actual liquidation values as compared with the estimated values provided by\nexterior opinions and interior appraisals, considering state-specific factors. For commercial real estate\nloans, collateral values are generally based on appraisals from internal and external valuation sources.\nCollateral values are typically updated every sixto twelve months, either by obtaining a new appraisal or by\nperforming an internal analysis, in accordance with the Firm\u2019s policies. The Firm also considers both\nborrower- and market-specific factors, which may result in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price\nopinions at more frequent intervals. Loans held-for-sale Loans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of\ncost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in noninterest revenue. For consumer loans, the\nvaluation is performed on a portfolio basis. For wholesale loans, the valuation is performed on an\nindividual loan basis. Interest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and recognized based on the\ncontractual rate of interest. Loan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts or premiums are\ndeferred in a contra loan account until the related loan is sold. The deferred fees or costs and discounts\nor premiums are an adjustment to the basis of the loan and therefore are included in the periodic\ndetermination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments and/or the gain or loss recognized at the time\nof sale. Because these loans are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value, the Firm\u2019s allowance for\nloan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans held-for-sale are subject to\nthe Firm\u2019s nonaccrual policies. Loans at fair value Loans for which the fair value option has been elected\nare measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest revenue. Interest income on\nthese loans is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Changes in fair value are\nrecognized in noninterest revenue. Loan origination fees are recognized upfront in noninterest revenue. Loan\norigination costs are recognized in the associated expense category as incurred. Because these loans are\nrecognized at fair value, the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these\nloans. However, loans at fair value are subject to the Firm\u2019s nonaccrual policies. Refer to Note 3 for\nfurther information on the Firm\u2019s elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. Refer to\nNote 2 and Note 3 for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.\n                                              \n  236    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nLoan classification changes Loans in the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to sell are\ntransferred to the held-for-sale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer.\nCredit-related losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses; non-credit related losses such as\nthose due to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are recognized in noninterest\nrevenue. In the event that management decides to retain a loan in the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is\ntransferred to the held-for-investment portfolio at amortized cost on the date of transfer. These loans are\nsubsequently assessed for impairment based on the Firm\u2019s allowance methodology. Refer to Note 13 for a\nfurther discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses. Loan\nmodifications The Firm seeks to modify certain loans in conjunction with its loss mitigation activities.\nThrough the modification, JPMorgan Chase grants one or more concessions to a borrower who is experiencing\nfinancial difficulty in order to minimize the Firm\u2019s economic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession of\nthe collateral, and to ultimately maximize payments received by the Firm from the borrower. The concessions\ngranted vary by program and by borrower-specific characteristics, and may include interest rate reductions,\nterm extensions, other-than-insignificant payment delays or principal forgiveness. Effective January 1, 2023\nthe Firm adopted the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage\nDisclosure accounting guidance, which changed the accounting for loan modifications from TDRs to FDMs. Refer\nto Note 1 for further information . Loans, except for credit card loans, reported as FDMs are generally\nplaced on nonaccrual status, although in many cases such loans were already on nonaccrual status prior to\nmodification. These loans may be returned to performing status (the accrual of interest is resumed) if the\nfollowing criteria are met: (i) the borrower has performed under the modified terms for a minimum of six\nmonthsand/or sixpayments, and (ii) the Firm has an expectation that repayment of the modified loan is\nreasonably assured based on, for example, the borrower\u2019s debt capacity and level of future earnings,\ncollateral values, LTV ratios, and other current market considerations. In certain limited and well-defined\ncircumstances in which the loan is current at the modification date, such loans are not placed on nonaccrual\nstatus at the time of modification. The allowance for credit losses associated with FDMs is measured using\nthe Firm\u2019s established allowance methodology, which considers the expected re-default rates for the modified\nloans. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion. For periods ending prior to January 1, 2023, modifications\nof loans where the Firm granted concessions to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty were accounted\nfor and reported as TDRs. The concessions granted varied by program and by borrower-specific\ncharacteristics, and included interest rate reductions, term extensions, payment delays, principal\nforgiveness, or the acceptance of equity or other assets in lieu of payments. Loans with short-term and\nother insignificant modifications that were not considered concessions were not TDRs. Loans modified in TDRs\nwere generally measured for impairment using the Firm\u2019s established asset-specific allowance methodology,\nwhich considers the expected redefault rates for the modified loans. A loan modified in a TDR generally\nremained subject to the asset-specific component of the allowance throughout its remaining life, regardless\nof whether the loan was performing and had been returned to accrual status. Refer to Note 13 for further\ndiscussion. Foreclosed property The Firm acquires property from borrowers through loan restructurings,\nworkouts, and foreclosures. Property acquired may include real property (e.g., residential real estate,\nland, and buildings) and other commercial and personal property (e.g., automobiles, aircraft, railcars, and\nships). The Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon receiving assets in satisfaction of a loan (e.g., by\ntaking legal title or physical possession). For loans collateralized by real property, the Firm generally\nrecognizes the asset received at foreclosure sale or upon the execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure\ntransaction with the borrower. Foreclosed assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated balance\nsheets and initially recognized at fair value less estimated costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value of\nthe acquired property is reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to the lower of cost or fair value. Subsequent\nadjustments to fair value are charged/credited to noninterest revenue. Operating expense, such as real\nestate taxes and maintenance, are charged to other expense.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    237  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nLoan portfolio\nThe Firm\u2019s loan portfolio is divided into threeportfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the\nFirm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and\nWholesale.

Loans that are more than\n30days past due provide an early warning of borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and/or\nwho may be unable or unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues to age, it becomes more clear\nwhether the borrower is likely to be unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential real estate\nloans, late-stage delinquencies (greater than 150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will\nultimately result in a foreclosure or similar liquidation transaction. In addition to delinquency rates,\nother credit quality indicators for consumer loans vary based on the class of loan, as follows: \u2022 For\nresidential real estate loans, the current estimated LTV ratio, or the combined LTV ratio in the case of\njunior lien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss severity in the event of default. Additionally, LTV\nor combined LTV ratios can provide insight into a borrower\u2019s continued willingness to pay, as the\ndelinquency rate of high-LTV loans tends to be greater than that for loans where the borrower has equity in\nthe collateral. The geographic distribution of the loan collateral also provides insight as to the credit\nquality of the portfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, home price changes and specific events\nsuch as natural disasters, will affect credit quality. The borrower\u2019s current or \u201crefreshed\u201d FICO score is a\nsecondary credit quality indicator for certain loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower\u2019s\ncredit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a low FICO score (less than 660) is considered to be\nof higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a higher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high\nLTV ratio and a low FICO score is at greater risk of default than a loan to a borrower that has both a high\nLTV ratio and a high FICO score. \u2022 For scored auto and business banking loans, geographic distribution is an\nindicator of the credit performance of the portfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, geographic\ndistribution provides insights into the portfolio performance based on regional economic activity and\nevents.\n                                              \n  240    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nResidential real estate\n\nDelinquency is the primary credit quality indicator for retained residential real estate loans.

The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses. Revolving\nloans that have been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within\nthe revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for\nthose products is higher than the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving\nperiod.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    241  \n                                              \n

There were noloans that were not guaranteed by the SBA\nthat are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance,\ncertain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of\namortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the\nunderlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.\n\n(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n(d) The geographic regions presented in this table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding\nloan balances at December 31, 2023.\n\nLoan modifications The Firm grants certain modifications of auto and other loans to borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty, which effective January 1, 2023, are reported as FDMs. For the year ended December 31,\n2023, auto and other FDMs were not material and there were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers\nmodified as FDMs. For periods ending prior to January 1, 2023, modifications of auto and other loans where\nthe Firm granted concessions to borrowers who were experiencing financial difficulty were generally\naccounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that were not\nconsidered concessions were not TDRs. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, auto and other TDRs\nwere not material.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    245  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nCredit card loan portfolio\n\nThe credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans originated and purchased by the Firm.\nDelinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans as they provide an early\nwarning that borrowers may be experiencing difficulties (30 days past due); information on those borrowers\nthat have been delinquent for a longer period of time (90 days past due) is also considered. In addition to\ndelinquency rates, the geographic distribution of the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the\nportfolio based on the regional economy. While the borrower\u2019s credit score is another general indicator of\ncredit quality, the Firm does not view credit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality because the\nborrower\u2019s credit score tends to be a lagging indicator. The distribution of such scores provides a general\nindicator of credit quality trends within the portfolio; however, the score does not capture all factors\nthat would be predictive of future credit performance. Refreshed FICO score information, which is obtained\nat least quarterly, for a statistically significant random sample of the credit card portfolio is indicated\nin other credit quality indicators. FICO is considered to be the industry benchmark for credit scores. The\nFirm generally originates new credit card accounts to prime consumer borrowers. However, certain\ncardholders\u2019 FICO scores may decrease over time, depending on the performance of the cardholder and changes\nin the credit score calculation.\n\nThe following tables provide

card loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty,\nwhich effective January 1, 2023, are reported as FDMs. These modifications may involve placing the\ncustomer\u2019s credit card account on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60months, which typically includes\nreducing the interest rate on the credit card account. If the borrower does not make the contractual\npayments when due under the modified payment terms, the credit card loan continues to age and will be\ncharged-off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm does not\nreinstate the borrower's line of credit.\n\nFinancial effects of FDMs\nThe following table provides information on credit card loan modifications considered FDMs.\n                                                                                                            \n  Year ended December 31,                       % of loan modifications to                                  \n  2023                             Amortized                         total       Financial effect of loan   \n  (in millions)                   cost basis    retained credit card loans       modification               \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Loan modification                                                                                         \n                                                                                 Term extension with a      \n  Term extension and                                                             reduction in the weighted  \n  interest rate                $         648                          0.31  %    average contractual        \n  reduction(a)(b)                                                                interest rate from23.19%   \n                                                                                 to3.64%                    \n  Total                        $         648                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n(a) Term extension includes credit card loans whose terms have been modified under long-term programs by\nplacing the customer\u2019s credit card account on a fixed payment plan.\n(b) The interest rates represent weighted average at enrollment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Firm also\nhad $ 27million of credit card loans subject to\ntrial modifications.

The Firm\ngranted concessions for most of the credit card\nloans under long-term programs. These concessions\ninvolved placing the customer\u2019s credit card account\non a fixed payment plan, generally for 60months,\nand typically included reducing the interest rate\non the credit card account.

The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the\ninternal risk rating assigned to each loan. Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of loans\nand differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings on loans consider the PD and the LGD. The PD is\nthe likelihood that a loan will default. The LGD is the estimated loss on the loan that would be realized\nupon the default of the borrower and takes into consideration collateral and structural support for each\ncredit facility. Management considers several factors to determine an appropriate internal risk rating,\nincluding the obligor\u2019s debt capacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligor\u2019s earnings, the\namount and sources for repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the\nindustry and geography in which the obligor operates. The Firm\u2019s internal risk ratings generally align with\nthe qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to\nchanges in the economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody\u2019s, however the quantitative characteristics\n(e.g., PD and LGD) may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and assumptions. The Firm\ngenerally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as\ninvestment grade, and these ratings have a lower PD and/or lower LGD than non-investment grade ratings.\nNoninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as noncriticized and criticized, and the criticized\nportion is further subdivided into performing and nonaccrual loans, representing management\u2019s assessment of\nthe collectibility of principal and interest. Criticized loans have a higher PD than noncriticized loans.\nThe Firm\u2019s definition of criticized aligns with the U.S. banking regulatory definition of criticized\nexposures, which consist of special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Refer to Note 1 for\nadditional information. Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management\nand are adjusted as necessary for updated information affecting the obligor\u2019s ability to fulfill its\nobligations. As noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the industry in which the obligor conducts\nits operations. As part of the overall credit risk management framework, the Firm focuses on the management\nand diversification of its industry and client exposures, with particular attention paid to industries with\nan actual or potential credit concern.

financial\ndifficulty for Commercial and industrial and Other loan FDMs were $ 1.8billion and $ 4million, respectively.\nThere were noadditional unfunded commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties for\nSecured by real estate loan FDMs. Nature and extent of TDRs Prior to January 1, 2023, certain loan\nmodifications were considered TDRs. These loan modifications provided various concessions to borrower who\nwere experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that were\nnot considered concessions were not TDRs nor were loans for which the Firm elected to suspend TDR accounting\nguidance under the option provided by the CARES Act. For the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, new TDRs\nwere $ 801million and $ 881million, respectively. New TDRs for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021\nreflected extended maturity dates and covenant waivers primarily in the Commercial and Industrial loan\nclass. For the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the impact of these modifications resulting in new\nTDRs was not material to the Firm. As a result of the elimination of the requirement to assess whether a\nmodification is reasonably expected or involves a concession, the population of loans considered FDMs is\ngreater than the population previously considered TDRs.\n                                              \n  254    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Note 13 \u2013 Allowance for credit losses                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses over the\nremaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance\nsheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses generally comprises: \u2022 t he allowance for\nloan losses, which covers the Firm\u2019s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated), \u2022 the allowance for\nlending-related commitments, which is presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts payable and\nother liabilities, and \u2022 the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which is reflected in\ninvestment securities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The income statement effect of all changes in the\nallowance for credit losses is recognized in the provision for credit losses. Determining the\nappropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is complex and requires significant judgment by\nmanagement about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. At least quarterly, the allowance for\ncredit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the Firm. Subsequent evaluations of\ncredit exposures, considering the macroeconomic conditions, forecasts and other factors then prevailing, may\nresult in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in future periods. The Firm\u2019s policies used\nto determine its allowance for loan losses and its allowance for lending-related commitments are described\nin the following paragraphs. Refer to Note 10 for a description of the policies used to determine the\nallowance for credit losses on investment securities. Methodology for allowances for loan losses and\nlending-related commitments The allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-related commitments\nrepresents expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of retained loans and lending-related\ncommitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. The Firm does not record an allowance for future draws\non unconditionally cancellable lending-related commitments (e.g., credit cards). Expected losses related to\naccrued interest on credit card loans are considered in the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses. However, the\nFirm does not record an allowance on other accrued interest receivables, due to its policy to write t hese\nreceivables off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income. The expected life of each\ninstrument is determined by considering its contractual term, expected prepayments, cancellation features,\nand certain extension and call options. The expected life of funded credit card loans is generally estimated\nby considering expected future payments on the credit card account, and determining how much of those\namounts should be allocated to repayments of the funded loan balance (as of the balance sheet date) versus\nother account activity. This allocation is made using an approach that incorporates the payment application\nrequirements of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, generally paying\ndown the highest interest rate balances first. The estimate of expected credit losses includes expected\nrecoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off, even if such recoveries result\nin a negative allowance. Collective and Individual Assessments When calculating the allowance for loan\nlosses and the allowance for lending-related commitments, the Firm assesses whether exposures share similar\nrisk characteristics. If similar risk characteristics exist, the Firm estimates expected credit losses\ncollectively, considering the risk associated with a particular pool and the probability that the exposures\nwithin the pool will deteriorate or default. The assessment of risk characteristics is subject to\nsignificant management judgment. Emphasizing one characteristic over another or considering additional\ncharacteristics could affect the allowance. \u2022 Relevant risk characteristics for the consumer portfolio\ninclude product type, delinquency status, current FICO scores, geographic distribution, and, for\ncollateralized loans, current LTV ratios. \u2022 Relevant risk characteristics for the wholesale portfolio\ninclude risk rating, delinquency status, tenor, level and type of collateral, LOB, geography, industry,\ncredit enhancement, product type, facility purpose, and payment terms. The majority of the Firm\u2019s credit\nexposures share risk characteristics with other similar exposures, and as a result are collectively assessed\nfor impairment (\u201cportfolio-based component\u201d). The portfolio-based component covers consumer loans,\nperforming risk-rated loans and certain lending-related commitments. If an exposure does not share risk\ncharacteristics with other exposures, the Firm generally estimates expected credit losses on an individual\nbasis, considering expected repayment and conditions impacting that individual exposure (\u201casset-specific\ncomponent\u201d). The asset-specific component covers collateral-dependent loans and risk-rated loans that have\nbeen placed on nonaccrual status. Portfolio-based component The portfolio-based component begins with a\nquantitative calculation that considers the likelihood of the borrower changing delinquency status or moving\nfrom one risk rating to another. The quantitative calculation covers expected credit losses over an\ninstrument\u2019s expected life and is estimated by applying credit loss factors to the Firm\u2019s estimated exposure\nat default. The credit loss factors incorporate the probability of borrower default as well as loss severity\nin the event of default. They are derived using a weighted average of five internally developed\nmacroeconomic scenarios over an eight-quarter forecast period, followed by a single year straight-line\ninterpolation\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    255  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nto revert to long run historical information for periods beyond the eight-quarter forecast period. The five\nmacroeconomic scenarios consist of a central, relative adverse, extreme adverse, relative upside and extreme\nupside scenario, and are updated by the Firm\u2019s central forecasting team. The scenarios take into\nconsideration the Firm\u2019s macroeconomic outlook, internal perspectives from subject matter experts across the\nFirm, and market consensus and involve a governed process that incorporates feedback from senior management\nacross LOBs, Corporate Finance and Risk Management. The quantitative calculation is adjusted to take into\nconsideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not\nyet reflected in the calculation. These adjustments are accomplished in part by analyzing the historical\nloss experience, including during stressed periods, for each major product or model. Management applies\njudgment in making this adjustment, including taking into account uncertainties associated with the economic\nand political conditions, quality of underwriting standards, borrower behavior, credit concentrations or\ndeterioration within an industry, product or portfolio, as well as other relevant internal and external\nfactors affecting the credit quality of the portfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships between\nthese factors create further uncertainties. The application of different inputs into the quantitative\ncalculation, and the assumptions used by management to adjust the quantitative calculation, are subject to\nsignificant management judgment, and emphasizing one input or assumption over another, or considering other\ninputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for\nlending-related commitments. Asset-specific component To determine the asset-specific component of the\nallowance, collateral-dependent loans (including those loans for which foreclosure is probable) and\nnonaccrual risk-rated loans in the wholesale portfolio segment are generally evaluated individually. On\nJanuary 1, 2023 the Firm adopted the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings\naccounting guidance as described in Note 1. The adoption of this guidance eliminated the requirement to\nmeasure the allowance for TDRs using a discounted cash flow (DCF) methodology and allowed the option of a\nnon-DCF portfolio-based approach for modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. If a DCF\nmethodology is still applied for these modified loans, the discount rate must be the post-modification\neffective interest rate, instead of the pre-modification effective interest rate. The Firm elected to change\nfrom an asset-specific allowance approach to its non-DCF, portfolio-based allowance approach for modified\nloans to troubled borrowers for all portfolios except collateral-dependent loans and nonaccrual risk-rated\nloans, for which the asset-specific allowance approach will continue to apply. The adoption did not impact\nthe collateral-dependent allowance approach or scope. This guidance was adopted under the modified\nretrospective method which resulted in a net decrease to the allowance for credit losses of $ 587million and\nan increase to retained earnings of $ 446million, after-tax predominantly driven by residential real estate\nand credit card. For collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of collateral less estimated costs to sell,\nas applicable, is used to determine the charge-off amount for declines in value (to reduce the amortized\ncost of the loan to the fair value of collateral) or the amount of negative allowance that should be\nrecognized (for recoveries of prior charge-offs associated with improvements in the fair value of the\ncollateral). For non-collateral dependent loans, the Firm generally measures the asset-specific allowance as\nthe difference between the amortized cost of the loan and the present value of the cash flows expected to be\ncollected, discounted at the loan\u2019s effective interest rate. Subsequent changes in impairment are generally\nrecognized as an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses. The asset-specific component of the allowance\nfor non-collateral dependent loans incorporates the effect of the modification on the loan\u2019s expected cash\nflows including changes in interest rates, principal forgiveness, and other concessions, as well as\nmanagement\u2019s expectation of the borrower\u2019s ability to repay under the modified terms. Estimating the timing\nand amounts of future cash flows is highly judgmental as these cash flow projections rely upon estimates\nsuch as loss severities, asset valuations, the amounts and timing of interest or principal payments\n(including any expected prepayments) or other factors that are reflective of current and expected market\nconditions. These estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as the duration of current overall\neconomic conditions, industry, portfolio, or borrower-specific factors, the expected outcome of insolvency\nproceedings as well as, in certain circumstances, other economic factors. All of these estimates and\nassumptions require significant management judgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective. Other\nfinancial assets In addition to loans and investment securities, the Firm holds other financial assets that\nare measured at amortized cost on the Consolidated balance sheets, including credit exposures arising from\nlending activities subject to collateral maintenance requirements. Management estimates the allowance for\nother financial assets using various techniques considering historical losses and current economic\nconditions. Credit risk arising from lending activities subject to collateral maintenance requirements is\ngenerally mitigated by factors such as the short-term nature of the activity, the\n                                              \n  256    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nfair value of collateral held and the Firm\u2019s right to call for, and the borrower\u2019s obligation to provide\nadditional margin when the fair value of the collateral declines. Because of these mitigating factors, these\nexposures generally do not require an allowance for credit losses. However, management may also consider\nother factors such as the borrower\u2019s ongoing ability to provide collateral to satisfy margin requirements,\nor whether collateral is significantly concentrated in an individual issuer or in securities with similar\nrisk characteristics. If in management\u2019s judgment, an allowance for credit losses for these exposures is\nrequired, the Firm estimates expected credit losses based on the value of the collateral and probability of\nborrower default.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    257  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nAllowance for credit losses and related information\nThe table below summarizes information about the allowances for credit losses, and includes a breakdown of\nloans and lending-related commitments by impairment methodology.

                    \nDiscussion of changes in the allowance\n\nThe allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2023 was $ 24.8billion, reflecting a net addition of $\n3.1billion from December 31, 2022. The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included $\n1.9billion, consisting of: \u2022 $ 1.3billion in consumer , predominantly driven by CCB, comprised of $\n1.4billion in Card Services, partially offset by a net reduction of $ 200million in Home Lending. The net\naddition in Card Services was driven by loan growth, including an increase in revolving balances, partially\noffset by reduced borrower uncertainty. The net reduction in Home Lending was driven by improvements in the\noutlook for home prices, and \u2022 $ 675million in wholesale , driven by net downgrade activity, the net effect\nof changes in the Firm\u2019s weighted average macroeconomic outlook, including deterioration in the outlook for\ncommercial real estate in CB, and an addition for certain accounts receivable in CIB, partially offset by\nthe impact of changes in the loan and lending-related commitment portfolios. The net addition also included\n$ 1.2billion to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related commitments in the\nsecond quarter of 2023. The changes in the Firm's weighted average macroeconomic outlook also included\nupdates to the central scenario in the third quarter of 2023 to reflect a lower forecasted unemployment rate\nconsistent with a higher growth rate in GDP, and the impact of the additional weight placed on the adverse\nscenarios in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting elevated recession risks due to high inflation and\ntightening financial conditions. The allowance for credit losses also reflected a reduction of $ 587million\nas a result of the adoption of changes to the TDR accounting guidance on January 1, 2023. Refer to Note 1\nfor further information. The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of\nfive internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive\nmacroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in a weighted\naverage U.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2024, and a weighted average U.S.\nreal GDP level that is 1.5% lower than the central case at the end of the second quarter of 2025.\nThe following table presents the Firm\u2019s central\ncase assumptions for the periods presented:\n                                                                                       \n                                    Central case assumptions                           \n                                        at December 31, 2023                           \n                                                        2Q24       4Q24       2Q25     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. unemployment rate(a)                              4.1  %     4.4  %     4.1  %  \n  YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                         1.8  %     0.7  %     1.0  %  \n                                                                                       \n                                                                                       \n                                    Central case assumptions                           \n                                        at December 31, 2022                           \n                                                        2Q23       4Q23       2Q24     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. unemployment rate(a)                              3.8  %     4.3  %     5.0  %  \n  YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                         1.5  %     0.4  %       \u2014  %  \n                                                                                       \n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S.\nunemployment rate.\n(b) The year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in\nthe forecast horizon of the central scenario is\ncalculated as the percentage change in U.S. real\nGDP levels from the prior year.\nSubsequent changes to this forecast and related\nestimates will be reflected in the provision for\ncredit losses in future periods.

As asset manager\nof the funds, AWM earns a fee based on assets managed; the fee varies with each fund\u2019s investment objective\nand is competitively priced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AWM\u2019s interests are, in certain cases,\nconsidered to be significant variable interests that result in consolidation of the financial results of\nthese entities.\n\n\u2022 Commercial Banking: CB provides financing and lending-related services to a wide spectrum of clients,\nincluding certain third-party-sponsored entities that may meet the definition of a VIE. CB does not control\nthe activities of these entities and does not consolidate these entities. CB\u2019s maximum loss exposure,\nregardless of whether the entity is a VIE, is generally limited to loans and lending-related commitments\nwhich are reported and disclosed in the same manner as any other third-party transaction.\n\n\u2022 Corporate : Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of VIEs; however these\nentities are generally subject to specialized investment company accounting, which does not require the\nconsolidation of investments, including VIEs. In addition, Treasury and CIO invest in securities generally\nissued by third parties which may meet the definition of VIEs (e.g., issuers of asset-backed securities). In\ngeneral, the Firm does not have the power to direct the significant activities of these entities and\ntherefore does not consolidate these entities. Refer to Note 10 for further information on the Firm\u2019s\ninvestment securities portfolio.\n\nIn addition, CIB also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third\nparties. Refer to page 266 of this Note for more information on the VIEs sponsored by third parties.\nSignificant Firm-sponsored VIEs\nCredit card securitizations CCB\u2019s Card Services business may securitize originated credit card loans,\nprimarily through the Chase Issuance Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d). The Firm\u2019s continuing involvement in credit card\nsecuritizations includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided seller\u2019s interest in the\nreceivables, retaining certain senior and subordinated securities and maintaining escrow accounts. The Firm\nconsolidates the assets and liabilities of its sponsored credit card trusts as it is considered to be the\nprimary beneficiary of these securitization trusts based on the Firm\u2019s ability to direct the activities of\nthese VIEs through its servicing responsibilities and other duties, including making decisions as to the\nreceivables that are transferred into those trusts and as to any related modifications and workouts.\nAdditionally, the nature and extent of the Firm\u2019s other continuing involvement with the trusts, as indicated\nabove, obligates the Firm to absorb losses and gives the Firm the right to receive certain benefits from\nthese VIEs that could potentially be significant. The underlying securitized credit card receivables and\nother assets of the securitization trusts are available only for payment of the beneficial interests issued\nby the securitization trusts; they are not available to pay the Firm\u2019s other obligations or the claims of\nthe Firm\u2019s creditors. The agreements with the credit card securitization trusts require the Firm to maintain\na minimum undivided interest in the credit card trusts (generally 5%). As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the\nFirm held undivided interests in Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts of $ 4.9billion and $\n6.1billion, respectively. The Firm maintained an average undivided interest in principal receivables owned\nby those trusts of approximately 65%\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    261  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nand 62% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Firm did not retain any senior\nsecurities and retained $ 1.5billion of subordinated securities in certain of its credit card securitization\ntrusts at both December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Firm\u2019s undivided interests in the credit card trusts and\nsecurities retained are eliminated in consolidation. Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts\nThe Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial\nmortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular\ntransaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans\nand/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts.\nThe following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-\nlabel securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that\nare consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests\nor subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules),\nrecourse or guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm\u2019s only\ncontinuing involvement is servicing the loans. The Firm\u2019s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased\ninterests is the carrying value of these interests.\n

December 31, 2023 and 2022, 77% and 84%, respectively, of the Firm\u2019s retained securitization\ninterests, which are predominantly carried at fair value and include amounts required to be held pursuant to\ncredit risk retention rules, were risk-rated \u201cA\u201d or better, on an S&P-equivalent basis. The retained\ninterests in prime residential mortgages consisted of $ 2.5billion and $ 2.6billion of investment-grade\nretained interests at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $ 88million and $ 27million of\nnoninvestment-grade retained interests at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The retained interests\nin commercial and other securitization trusts consisted of $ 6.1billion and $ 5.8billion of investment-grade\nretained interests, and $ 1.7billion and $ 1.1billion of noninvestment-grade retained interests at December\n31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n                                              \n  262    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nResidential mortgage The Firm securitizes residential mortgage loans originated by CCB, as well as\nresidential mortgage loans purchased from third parties by either CCB or CIB. CCB generally retains\nservicing for all residential mortgage loans it originated or purchased, and for certain mortgage loans\npurchased by CIB. For securitizations of loans serviced by CCB, the Firm has the power to direct the\nsignificant activities of the VIE because it is responsible for decisions related to loan modifications and\nworkouts. CCB may also retain an interest upon securitization. In addition, CIB engages in underwriting and\ntrading activities involving securities issued by Firm-sponsored securitization trusts. As a result, CIB at\ntimes retains senior and/or subordinated interests (including residual interests and amounts required to be\nheld pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in residential mortgage securitizations at the time of\nsecuritization, and/or reacquires positions in the secondary market in the normal course of business. In\ncertain instances, as a result of the positions retained or reacquired by CIB or held by Treasury and CIO or\nCCB, when considered together with the servicing arrangements entered into by CCB, the Firm is deemed to be\nthe primary beneficiary of certain securitization trusts. The Firm does not consolidate residential mortgage\nsecuritizations (Firm-sponsored or third-party-sponsored) when it is not the servicer (and therefore does\nnot have the power to direct the most significant activities of the trust) or does not hold a beneficial\ninterest in the trust that could potentially be significant to the trust. Commercial mortgages and other\nconsumer securitizations CIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in\nunderwriting and trading activities involving the securities issued by securitization trusts. CIB may retain\nunsold senior and/or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk\nretention rules) in commercial mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization but, generally, the\nFirm does not service commercial loan securitizations. Treasury and CIO may choose to invest in these\nsecuritizations as well. For commercial mortgage securitizations the power to direct the significant\nactivities of the VIE generally is held by the servicer or investors in a specified class of securities\n(\u201ccontrolling class\u201d). The Firm generally does not retain an interest in the controlling class in its\nsponsored commercial mortgage securitization transactions. Re-securitizations The Firm engages in certain\nre-securitization transactions in which debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for new\nbeneficial interests. These transfers occur in connection with both U.S. GSEs and government agency\nsponsored VIEs, which are backed by residential mortgages. The Firm\u2019s consolidation analysis is largely\ndependent on the Firm\u2019s role and interest in the re-securitization trusts.\nThe following table presents the principal amount\nof securities transferred to re-securitization\nVIEs.\n                                                                                              \n  Year ended December 31,                                                                     \n  (in millions)                                   2023               2022               2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Transfers of securities to VIEs                                                             \n  U.S. GSEs and government agencies    $  18,864          $  16,128          $  53,923        \n                                                                                              \nMost re-securitizations with which the Firm is\ninvolved are client-driven transactions in which a\nspecific client or group of clients is seeking a\nspecific return or risk profile. For these\ntransactions, the Firm has concluded that the\ndecision-making power of the entity is shared\nbetween the Firm and its clients, considering the\njoint effort and decisions in establishing the re-\nsecuritization trust and its assets, as well as the\nsignificant economic interest the client holds in\nthe re-securitization trust; therefore the Firm\ndoes not consolidate the re-securitization VIE. The\nFirm did not transfer any private label securities\nto re-securitization VIEs during 2023, 2022 and\n2021, and retained interests in any such Firm-\nsponsored VIEs as of December 31, 2023 and 2022\nwere not material. Additionally, the Firm may\ninvest in beneficial interests of third-party-\nsponsored re-securitizations and generally\npurchases these interests in the secondary market.\nIn these circumstances, the Firm does not have the\nunilateral ability to direct the most significant\nactivities of the re-securitization trust, either\nbecause it was not involved in the initial design\nof the trust, or the Firm was involved with an\nindependent third-party sponsor and demonstrated\nshared power over the creation of the trust;\ntherefore, the Firm does not consolidate the re-\nsecuritization VIE.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    263  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nThe following table presents information on the\nFirm's interests in nonconsolidated re-\nsecuritization VIEs.\n                                                                                          \n  December 31,                                                                            \n  (in millions)                                  Nonconsolidated                          \n  U.S. GSEs and government agencies       re-securitization VIEs  2023              2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Interest in VIEs                     $                   3,371          $  2,580        \n                                                                                          \nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Firm did not consolidate any U.S. GSE and government agency re-\nsecuritization VIEs or any Firm-sponsored private-label re-securitization VIEs. Multi-seller conduits Multi-\nseller conduit entities are separate bankruptcy remote entities that provide secured financing,\ncollateralized by pools of receivables and other financial assets, to customers of the Firm. The conduits\nfund their financing facilities through the issuance of highly rated commercial paper. The primary source of\nrepayment of the commercial paper is the cash flows from the pools of assets. In most instances, the assets\nare structured with deal-specific credit enhancements provided to the conduits by the customers (i.e.,\nsellers) or other third parties. Deal-specific credit enhancements are generally structured to cover a\nmultiple of historical losses expected on the pool of assets, and are typically in the form of\novercollateralization provided by the seller. The deal-specific credit enhancements mitigate the Firm\u2019s\npotential losses on its agreements with the conduits. To ensure timely repayment of the commercial paper,\nand to provide the conduits with funding to provide financing to customers in the event that the conduits do\nnot obtain funding in the commercial paper market, each asset pool financed by the conduits has a minimum\n100% deal-specific liquidity facility associated with it provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. also provides the multi-seller conduit vehicles with uncommitted program-wide liquidity\nfacilities and program-wide credit enhancement in the form of standby letters of credit. The amount of\nprogram-wide credit enhancement required is based upon commercial paper issuance and approximates 10% of the\noutstanding balance of commercial paper. The Firm consolidates its Firm-administered multi-seller conduits,\nas the Firm has both the power to direct the significant activities of the conduits and a potentially\nsignificant economic interest in the conduits. As administrative agent and in its role in structuring\ntransactions, the Firm makes decisions regarding asset types and credit quality, and manages the commercial\npaper funding needs of the conduits. The Firm\u2019s interests that could potentially be significant to the VIEs\ninclude the fees received as administrative agent and liquidity and program-wide credit enhancement\nprovider, as well as the potential exposure created by the liquidity and credit enhancement facilities\nprovided to the conduits.\n\nIn the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by\nthe Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $ 9.8billion and $ 13.8billion of the commercial\npaper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively,\nwhich have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm\u2019s investments reflect the Firm\u2019s funding needs and\ncapacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to\ncredit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper\nissued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide\nliquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the\nFirm-administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-\nadministered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were $ 10.8billion and $ 10.6billion at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments\nin other unfunded commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note 28 for more information on off-balance sheet\nlending-related commitments. Municipal bond vehicles Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (\u201cTOB\u201d)\ntrusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond investments at short-term rates. In a typical TOB\ntransaction, the trust purchases highly rated municipal bond(s) of a single issuer and funds the purchase by\nissuing two types of securities: (1) puttable floating-rate certificates (\u201cfloaters\u201d) and (2) inverse\nfloating-rate residual interests (\u201cresiduals\u201d). The floaters are typically purchased by money market funds\nor other short-term investors and may be tendered, with requisite notice, to the TOB trust. The residuals\nare retained by the investor seeking to finance its municipal bond investment. TOB transactions where the\nresidual is held by a third-party investor are typically known as customer TOB trusts, and non-customer TOB\ntrusts are transactions where the Residual is retained by the Firm. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a\nthird party. The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB transactions. The Firm may provide various\nservices to a TOB trust, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider, and/or sponsor.\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC may serve as a remarketing agent on the floaters for TOB trusts. The remarketing\nagent is responsible for establishing the periodic variable rate on the floaters, conducting the initial\nplacement and remarketing tendered floaters. The remarketing agent may, but is not obligated to, make\nmarkets in floaters. Floaters held by the Firm were not material during 2023 and 2022. JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. or J.P. Morgan Securities LLC often serves as the sole liquidity or tender option provider for the TOB\ntrusts. The liquidity provider\u2019s obligation to perform is conditional and is limited by certain events\n                                              \n  264    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n(\u201cTermination Events\u201d), which include bankruptcy or failure to pay by the municipal bond issuer or credit\nenhancement provider, an event of taxability on the municipal bonds or the immediate downgrade of the\nmunicipal bond to below investment grade. In addition, the liquidity provider\u2019s exposure is typically\nfurther limited by the high credit quality of the underlying municipal bonds, the excess collateralization\nin the vehicle, or, in certain transactions, the reimbursement agreements with the Residual holders. Holders\nof the floaters may \u201cput,\u201d or tender, their floaters to the TOB trust. If the remarketing agent cannot\nsuccessfully remarket the floaters to another investor, the liquidity provider either provides a loan to the\nTOB trust for the TOB trust\u2019s purchase of the floaters, or it directly purchases the tendered floaters. TOB\ntrusts are considered to be variable interest entities. The Firm consolidates non-customer TOB trusts\nbecause as the Residual holder, the Firm has the right to make decisions that significantly impact the\neconomic performance of the municipal bond vehicle, and it has the right to receive benefits and bear losses\nthat could potentially be significant to the municipal bond vehicle.\n\nConsolidated VIE assets and liabilities\nThe following table

These transactions are conducted at arm\u2019s-length,\nand individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the\nquality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE\nthat most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially\nbe significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions\non its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any\nother third-party transaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit\nvehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing,\nenergy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the\ngeneral partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit\nvehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in\nthese partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits\nallocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding\ncommitments, was $ 35.1billion and $ 30.2billion, of which $ 14.7billion and $ 10.6billion was unfunded at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may\nwithhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to\nNote 25 for further information on affordable housing tax credits and Note 28 for more information on off-\nbalance sheet lending-related commitments. Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm may\nprovide various services to customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option\nprovider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a\nreimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions, upon the termination of the\nvehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have\nany intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The\nFirm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that\nsignificantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm\u2019s maximum exposure as\na liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at December 31, 2023 and 2022, was $ 5.1billion and $\n5.8billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $\n7.3billion and $ 8.2billion respectively. Loan securitizations The Firm has securitized and sold a variety\nof loans, including residential mortgages, credit card receivables, commercial mortgages and other consumer\nloans. The purposes of these securitization transactions were to satisfy investor demand and to generate\nliquidity for the Firm. For loan securitizations in which the Firm is not required to consolidate the trust,\nthe Firm records the transfer of the loan receivable to the trust as a sale when all of the following\naccounting criteria for a sale are met: (1) the transferred financial assets are legally isolated from the\nFirm\u2019s creditors; (2) the transferee or beneficial interest holder can pledge or exchange the transferred\nfinancial assets; and (3) the Firm does not maintain effective control over the transferred financial assets\n(e.g., the Firm cannot repurchase the transferred assets before their maturity and it does not have the\nability to unilaterally cause the holder to return the transferred assets). For loan securitizations\naccounted for as a sale, the Firm recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference between the value of\nproceeds received (including cash, beneficial interests, or servicing assets received) and the carrying\nvalue of the assets sold. Gains and losses on securitizations are reported in noninterest revenue.\n                                              \n  266    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nSecuritization activity\nThe following table provides information related to the Firm\u2019s securitization activities for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were\nnot consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization.\n                                                                                                            \n  Year                                                                                                      \n  ended                                                                                                     \n  December                                                                                                  \n  31,                 2023       Commerci\u2026            2022       Commerci\u2026            2021       Commerci\u2026  \n  (in            Resident\u2026             and       Resident\u2026             and       Resident\u2026             and  \n  million\u2026       mortgage\u2026        other(e)       mortgage\u2026        other(e)       mortgage\u2026        other(e)  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Princip\u2026    $      7,678    $      3,901    $     10,218    $      9,036    $     23,876    $     14,917  \n  securit\u2026                                                                                                  \n  All cash                                                                                                  \n  flows                                                                                                     \n  during                                                                                                    \n  the                                                                                                       \n  period:\u2026                                                                                                  \n  Proceeds                                                                                                  \n  received                                                                                                  \n  from                                                                                                      \n  loan        $      7,251    $      3,896    $      9,783    $      8,921    $     24,450    $     15,044  \n  sales as                                                                                                  \n  financi\u2026                                                                                                  \n  instrum\u2026                                                                                                  \n  Servici\u2026                                                                                                  \n  fees                  24               5              62               2             153               1  \n  collect\u2026                                                                                                  \n  Cash                                                                                                      \n  flows                                                                                                     \n  received             325             425             489             285             578             273  \n  on                                                                                                        \n  interes\u2026                                                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \n(a) Excludes re-securitization transactions.\n(b) Predominantly includes Level 2 assets.\n(c) The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the proceeds received upon loan\nsale.\n(d) Represents prime mortgages.

These loans and excess MSRs are\nsold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions\n(e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant\nto Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency.\nThe Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the\nprimary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the\ncredit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser.

The\ngoodwill impairment test is generally performed by comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit\nwith its carrying value. If the fair value is in excess of the carrying value, then the reporting unit\u2019s\ngoodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, then an\nimpairment is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit\u2019s carrying value exceeds its fair value,\nup to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Firm uses the reporting units\u2019 allocated\ncapital plus goodwill and other intangible assets as a proxy for the carrying values of equity for the\nreporting units in the goodwill impairment testing. Reporting unit equity is determined on a similar basis\nas the allocation of capital to the LOBs which takes into consideration a variety of factors including\ncapital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. LOB\u2019s allocated\ncapital levels are incorporated into the Firm\u2019s annual budget process, which is reviewed by the Firm\u2019s Board\nof Directors and Operating Committee. Allocated capital is further reviewed at least annually and updated as\nneeded. The primary method the Firm uses to estimate the fair value of its reporting units is the income\napproach. This approach projects cash flows for the forecast period and uses the perpetuity growth method to\ncalculate terminal values. These cash flows and terminal values, which are based on the reporting units\u2019\nannual budgets and forecasts are then discounted using an appropriate discount rate. The discount rate used\nfor each reporting unit represents an estimate of the cost of equity for that reporting unit and is\ndetermined considering the Firm\u2019s overall estimated cost of equity (estimated using the Capital Asset\nPricing Model), as adjusted for the risk characteristics specific to each reporting unit (for example, for\nhigher levels of risk or uncertainty associated with the business or management\u2019s forecasts and\nassumptions). To assess the reasonableness of the discount rates used for each reporting unit, management\ncompares the discount rate to the estimated cost of equity for publicly traded institutions with similar\nbusinesses and risk characteristics. In addition, the weighted average cost of equity (aggregating the\nvarious reporting units) is compared with the Firm\u2019s overall estimated cost of equity for reasonableness.\nThe valuations derived from the discounted cash flow analysis are then compared with market-based trading\nand transaction multiples for relevant competitors. Trading and transaction comparables are used as general\nindicators to assess the overall reasonableness of the estimated fair values, although precise conclusions\ngenerally cannot be drawn due to the differences that naturally exist between the Firm\u2019s businesses and\ncompetitor institutions. The Firm also takes into consideration a comparison between the aggregate fair\nvalues of the Firm\u2019s reporting\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    269  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nunits and JPMorgan Chase\u2019s market capitalization. In evaluating this comparison, the Firm considers several\nfactors, including (i) a control premium that would exist in a market transaction, (ii) factors related to\nthe level of execution risk that would exist at the Firmwide level that do not exist at the reporting unit\nlevel and (iii) short-term market volatility and other factors that do not directly affect the value of\nindividual reporting units. Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit losses,\nincreases in capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse\nregulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the\nestimated fair values of the Firm\u2019s reporting units to decline in the future, which could result in a\nmaterial impairment loss to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.\nMortgage servicing rights MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing\nservicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary\nrevenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing\ncash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary\nfee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of\nmortgage loans if servicing is retained. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to account for its\nMSRs at fair value. The Firm treats its MSRs as a single class of servicing assets based on the availability\nof market inputs used to measure the fair value of its MSR asset and its treatment of MSRs as one aggregate\npool for risk management purposes. The Firm estimates the fair value of MSRs using an option-adjusted spread\n(\u201cOAS\u201d) model, which projects MSR cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios in conjunction with the\nFirm\u2019s prepayment model, and then discounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted rates. The model considers\nportfolio characteristics, contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency\nrates, costs to service, late charges and other ancillary revenue, and other economic factors. The Firm\ncompares fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers\nrecent market activity and actual portfolio experience.\n                                              \n  270    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nThe fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest rates, including their effect on prepayment\nspeeds. MSRs typically decrease in value when interest rates decline because declining interest rates tend\nto increase prepayments and therefore reduce the expected life of the net servicing cash flows that comprise\nthe MSR asset. Conversely, securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities), and certain derivatives (e.g.,\nthose for which the Firm receives fixed-rate interest payments) increase in value when interest rates\ndecline. JPMorgan Chase uses combinations of derivatives and securities to manage the risk of changes in the\nfair value of MSRs. The intent is to offset any interest-rate related changes in the fair value of MSRs with\nchanges in the fair value of the related risk management instruments.\nThe following table summarizes MSR

However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if\nthey were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    271  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nThe following table presents the components of\nmortgage fees and related income (including the\nimpact of MSR risk management activities) for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n                                                                                                   \n  Year ended December 31,                                                                          \n  (in millions)                                         2023               2022              2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  CCB mortgage fees and related income                                                             \n  Production revenue                         $     421          $     497          $  2,215        \n  Net mortgage servicing revenue:                                                                  \n  Operating revenue:                                                                               \n  Loan servicing revenue                         1,634              1,582             1,257        \n  Changes in MSR asset fair value due to                                                           \n  collection/realization of expected cash       -1,011               -936              -788        \n  flows                                                                                            \n  Total operating revenue                          623                646               469        \n  Risk management:                                                                                 \n  Changes in MSR asset fair value due to           424              2,022               404        \n  market interest rates and other(a)                                                               \n  Other changes in MSR asset fair value                                                            \n  due to other inputs and assumptions in            43                 17              -306        \n  model(b)                                                                                         \n  Change in derivative fair value and             -336             -1,946              -623        \n  other                                                                                            \n  Total risk management                            131                 93              -525        \n  Total net mortgage servicing revenue             754                739               -56        \n  Total CCB mortgage fees and related            1,175              1,236             2,159        \n  income                                                                                           \n  All other                                          1                 14                11        \n  Mortgage fees and related income           $   1,176          $   1,250          $  2,170        \n                                                                                                   \n(a) Represents both the impact of changes in\nestimated future prepayments due to changes in\nmarket interest rates, and the difference between\nactual and expected prepayments.

These leases generally have terms of 20years or less, determined based on the contractual maturity\nof the lease, and include periods covered by options to extend or terminate the lease when the Firm is\nreasonably certain that it will exercise those options. All leases with lease terms greater than twelve\nmonths are reported as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) asset. None of these\nlease agreements impose restrictions on the Firm\u2019s ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity\nfinancing transactions or enter into further lease agreements. Certain of these leases contain escalation\nclauses that will increase rental payments based on maintenance, utility and tax increases, which are non-\nlease components. The Firm elected not to separate lease and non-lease components of a contract for its real\nestate leases. As such, real estate lease payments represent payments on both lease and non-lease\ncomponents. Operating lease liabilities and ROU assets are recognized at the lease commencement date based\non the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The future lease payments are\ndiscounted at a rate that estimates the Firm\u2019s collateralized borrowing rate for financing instruments of a\nsimilar term and are included in accounts payable and other liabilities. The operating lease ROU assets,\npredominantly included in premises and equipment, also include any lease prepayments made, plus initial\ndirect costs incurred, less any lease incentives received.

The\nFirm\u2019s lease financings are predominantly auto\noperating leases. These assets subject to operating\nleases are recognized in other assets on the Firm\u2019s\nConsolidated balance sheets and are depreciated on\na straight-line basis over the lease term to reduce\nthe asset to its estimated residual value.\nDepreciation expense is included in technology,\ncommunications and equipment expense in the\nConsolidated statements of income. The Firm\u2019s lease\nincome is generally recognized on a straight-line\nbasis over the lease term and is included in other\nincome in the Consolidated statements of income. On\na periodic basis, the Firm assesses leased assets\nfor impairment, and if the carrying amount of the\nleased asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows\nfrom the lease payments and the estimated residual\nvalue upon disposition of the leased asset, an\nimpairment is recognized. The risk of loss on auto\nand equipment leased assets relating to the\nresidual value of the leased assets is monitored\nthrough projections of the asset residual values at\nlease origination and periodic review of residual\nvalues, and is mitigated through arrangements with\ncertain manufacturers or lessees.\nThe following table presents the carrying value of\nassets subject to leases

In order to\nmodify exposure to interest rate and currency exchange rate movements, JPMorgan Chase utilizes derivative\ninstruments, primarily interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps, in conjunction with some of its\ndebt issuances. The use of these instruments modifies the Firm\u2019s interest expense on the associated debt.\nThe modified weighted-average interest rates for total long-term debt, including the effects of related\nderivative instruments, were 5.20% and 4.89% as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

These unvested\nRSUs meet the definition of participating\nsecurities based on their respective rights to\nreceive nonforfeitable dividends, and they are\ntreated as a separate class of securities in\ncomputing basic EPS. Participating securities are\nnot included as incremental shares in computing\ndiluted EPS; refer to Note 9 for additional\ninformation.\nDiluted EPS incorporates the potential impact of\ncontingently issuable shares, including awards\nwhich require future service as a condition of\ndelivery of the underlying common stock.

JPMorgan Chase\u2019s expense for income taxes\nincludes the current and deferred portions of that\nexpense. A valuation allowance is established to\nreduce deferred tax assets to the amount the Firm\nexpects to realize. Due to the inherent\ncomplexities arising from the nature of the Firm\u2019s\nbusinesses, and from conducting business and being\ntaxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions,\nsignificant judgments and estimates are required to\nbe made. Agreement of tax liabilities between\nJPMorgan Chase and the many tax jurisdictions in\nwhich the Firm files tax returns may not be\nfinalized for several years. Thus, the Firm\u2019s final\ntax-related assets and liabilities may ultimately\nbe different from those currently reported.\n\nEffective tax rate and expense\nThe following table presents a

The\nallocation of the tax basis to individual assets\nmay be refined during the measurement period, which\ncould result in an impact to the gross deferred tax\nassets and liabilities.\n\nJPMorgan Chase has recorded deferred tax assets of\n$ 290million at December 31, 2023 in connection\nwith tax attribute carryforwards. State and local\ncapital loss carryforwards were $ 1.2billion, U.S.\nfederal NOL carryforwards were $ 586million,\nnon-U.S. NOL carryforwards were $ 570million, and\nother U.S. federal tax attributes were $\n118million. If not utilized, a portion of the U.S.\nfederal NOL carryforwards and other U.S. federal\ntax attributes will expire between 2026 and 2037\nwhereas others have an unlimited carryforward\nperiod. Similarly, certain non-U.S. NOL\ncarryforwards will expire between 2026 and 2040\nwhereas others have an unlimited carryforward\nperiod. The state and local capital loss\ncarryforwards will expire in 2026 and 2027. The\nvaluation allowance at December 31, 2023, was due\nto the state and local capital loss carryforwards\nand certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets, including\nNOL carryforwards.\n                                              \n  286    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nUnrecognized tax benefits\n\nAt December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s unrecognized tax benefits, excluding\nrelated interest expense and penalties, were $\n5.4billion, $ 5.0billion and $ 4.6billion,\nrespectively, of which $ 3.9billion, $ 3.8billion\nand $ 3.4billion, respectively, if recognized,\nwould reduce the annual effective tax rate.\nIncluded in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits\nare certain items that would not affect the\neffective tax rate if they were recognized in the\nConsolidated statements of income. These\nunrecognized items include the tax effect of\ncertain temporary differences, the portion of gross\nstate and local unrecognized tax benefits that\nwould be offset by the benefit from associated U.S.\nfederal income tax deductions, and the portion of\ngross non-U.S. unrecognized tax benefits that would\nhave offsets in other jurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase\nevaluates the need for changes in unrecognized tax\nbenefits based on its anticipated tax return filing\npositions as part of its U.S. federal and state and\nlocal tax returns. In addition, the Firm is\npresently under audit by a number of taxing\nauthorities, most notably by the Internal Revenue\nService, as summarized in the Tax examination\nstatus table below. The evaluation of unrecognized\ntax benefits as well as the potential for audit\nsettlements make it reasonably possible that over\nthe next 12 months the gross balance of\nunrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease\nby as much as approximately $ 1.1billion.

(\u201cParent Company\u201d) and certain of its affiliates\nunless the loans are secured in specified amounts. Such secured loans provided by any banking subsidiary to\nthe Parent Company or to any particular affiliate, together with certain other transactions with such\naffiliate (collectively referred to as \u201ccovered transactions\u201d), must be made on terms and conditions that\nare consistent with safe and sound banking practices. In addition, unless collateralized with cash or US\nGovernment debt obligations, covered transactions are generally limited to 10% of the banking subsidiary\u2019s\ntotal capital, as determined by the risk-based capital guidelines; the aggregate amount of covered\ntransactions between any banking subsidiary and all of its affiliates is limited to 20% of the banking\nsubsidiary\u2019s total capital. The Parent Company\u2019s two principal subsidiaries are JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nand JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC, an intermediate holding company (the \u201cIHC\u201d). The IHC generally holds the\nstock of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC\nalso owns other assets and provides intercompany loans to the Parent Company. The Parent Company is\nobligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances\n(including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock). The\nprincipal sources of income and funding for the Parent Company are dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nand dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. In addition to dividend restrictions set forth in\nstatutes and regulations, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have authority under the Financial\nInstitutions Supervisory Act to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations\nthey supervise, including the Parent Company and its subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies,\nif, in the banking regulator\u2019s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice\nin light of the financial condition of the banking organization. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends\nor extending credit to the Parent Company if certain capital or liquidity \u201cthresholds\u201d are breached or if\nlimits are otherwise imposed by the Parent Company\u2019s management or Board of Directors. At January 1, 2024,\nthe Parent Company\u2019s banking subsidiaries could pay, in the aggregate, approximately $ 20billion in\ndividends to their respective bank holding companies without the prior approval of their relevant banking\nregulators. The capacity to pay dividends in 2024 will be supplemented by the banking subsidiaries\u2019 earnings\nduring the year.\n                                              \n  288    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Note 27 \u2013 Regulatory capital                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \nThe Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the Firm as\na consolidated financial holding company. The OCC establishes similar minimum capital requirements and\nstandards for the Firm\u2019s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The capital rules under Basel\nIII establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally\nactive U.S. bank holding companies and banks, including the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Two\ncomprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach (\u201cBasel III\nStandardized\u201d), and an advanced approach (\u201cBasel III Advanced\u201d). For each of the risk-based capital ratios,\nthe capital adequacy of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is evaluated against the lower of the\nStandardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements. The\nthree components of regulatory capital under the Basel III rules are as illustrated below: Under the risk-\nbased capital and leverage-based guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain\nminimum ratios for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet\nthese minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take action. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is also\nsubject to these capital requirements established by its primary regulators .\nThe following table presents the risk-based\nregulatory capital ratio requirements and well-\ncapitalized ratios to which the Firm and JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. were subject as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022.\n                                                                                                            \n                Standardiz\u2026                       Advanced                                                  \n                    capital                        capital                    Well-capit\u2026                   \n                      ratio                          ratio                         ratios                   \n                requiremen\u2026                    requiremen\u2026                                                  \n                  BHC(a)(b)       IDI(c)         BHC(a)(b)       IDI(c)            BHC(d)        IDI(e)     \n  Risk-based                                                                                                \n  capital                                                                                                   \n  ratios                                                                                                    \n  CET1                 11.4  %       7.0  %           11.0  %       7.0  %                 NA       6.5  %  \n  capital                                                                                                   \n  Tier 1               12.9          8.5              12.5          8.5               6.0  %        8.0     \n  capital                                                                                                   \n  Total                14.9         10.5              14.5         10.5              10.0          10.0     \n  capital                                                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \nNote: The table above is as defined by the\nregulations issued by the Federal Reserve, OCC and\nFDIC and to which the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. are subject.

The contractual amount of these financial instruments\nrepresents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the\ncommitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or\nclient subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and\nguarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a\ndefault occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm\u2019s\nview, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. To provide for expected\ncredit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses\non lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 13 for further information regarding the\nallowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments . The following table summarizes the contractual\namounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other\ncommitments at December 31, 2023 and 2022. The amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity\nlending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not\nexperienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized\nat the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower notice\nor, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card\nlines when the borrower is 60days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are\nsignificant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline\nin the creditworthiness of the borrower.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    291  \n                                              \n

The Firm also issues\ncommitments under multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance\nof a standby letter of credit. Guarantees U.S. GAAP requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of\na guarantee, a liability in an amount equal to the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the\nguarantee. U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a contract that contingently requires the guarantor to pay the\nguaranteed party based upon: (a) changes in an underlying asset, liability or equity security of the\nguaranteed party; or (b) a third party\u2019s failure to perform under a specified agreement. The Firm considers\nthe following off\u2013balance sheet arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: standby letters of credit and\nother financial guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, certain indemnification agreements included\nwithin third-party contractual arrangements, certain derivative contracts and the guarantees under the\nsponsored member repo program. As required by U.S. GAAP, the Firm initially records guarantees at the\ninception date fair value of the non-contingent obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of consideration\nreceived or the net present value of the premium receivable). For these obligations, the Firm records this\nfair value amount in other liabilities with an offsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums received), or\nother assets (for premiums receivable). Any premium receivable recorded in other assets is reduced as cash\nis received under the contract, and the fair value of the liability recorded at inception is amortized into\nincome as lending and deposit-related fees over the life of the guarantee contract. The lending-related\ncontingent obligation is recognized based on expected credit losses in addition to, and separate from, any\nnon-contingent obligation. Non-lending-related contingent obligations are recognized when the liability\nbecomes probable and reasonably estimable. These obligations are not recognized if the estimated amount is\nless than the carrying amount of any non-contingent liability recognized at inception (adjusted for any\namortization). Examples of non-lending-related contingent obligations include indemnifications provided in\nsales agreements, where a portion of the sale proceeds is allocated to the guarantee, which adjusts the gain\nor loss that would otherwise result from the transaction. For these indemnifications, the initial liability\nis amortized to income as the Firm\u2019s risk is reduced (i.e., over time or when the indemnification expires).\nThe contractual amount and carrying value of guarantees and indemnifications are included in the table on\npage 292.

As part of this\nprogram, the Firm provides an indemnification in the lending agreements which protects the lender against\nthe failure of the borrower to return the lent securities. To minimize its liability under these\nindemnification agreements, the Firm obtains cash or other highly liquid collateral with a market value\nexceeding 100% of the value of the securities on loan from the borrower. Collateral is marked to market\ndaily to help assure that collateralization is adequate. Additional collateral is called from the borrower\nif a shortfall exists, or collateral may be released to the borrower in the event of overcollateralization.\nIf a borrower defaults, the Firm would use the collateral held to purchase replacement securities in the\nmarket or to credit the lending client or counterparty with the cash equivalent thereof. The cash collateral\nheld by the Firm may be invested on behalf of the client in indemnified resale agreements, whereby the Firm\nindemnifies the client against the loss of principal invested. To minimize its liability under these\nagreements, the Firm obtains collateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the principal invested.\nDerivatives qualifying as guarantees The Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that have the\ncharacteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. These contracts include written put options that require the\nFirm to purchase assets upon exercise by the option holder at a specified price by a specified date in the\nfuture. The Firm may enter into written put option contracts in order to meet client needs, or for other\ntrading purposes. The terms of written put options are typically five yearsor less. Derivatives deemed to be\nguarantees also includes stable value contracts, commonly referred to as \u201cstable value products\u201d, that\nrequire the Firm to make a payment of the difference between the market value and the book value of a\ncounterparty\u2019s reference portfolio of assets in the event that market value is less than book value and\ncertain other conditions have been met. Stable value products are transacted in order to allow investors to\nrealize investment returns with less volatility than an unprotected portfolio. These contracts are typically\nlonger-term or may have no stated maturity, but allow the Firm to elect to terminate the contract under\ncertain conditions. The notional value of derivative guarantees generally represents the Firm\u2019s maximum\nexposure. However, exposure to certain stable value products is contractually limited to a substantially\nlower percentage of the notional amount. The fair value of derivative guarantees reflects the probability,\nin the Firm\u2019s view, of whether the Firm will be required to perform under the contract. The Firm reduces\nexposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting transactions, or by entering into contracts that\nhedge the market risk related to the derivative guarantees.\nThe following table summarizes the derivatives\nqualifying as guarantees as of December 31, 2023\nand 2022.\n                                                                                                        \n  (in millions)                                      December 31, 2023               December 31, 2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Notional amounts                                                                                      \n  Derivative guarantees                   $  54,562                       $  59,180                     \n  Stable value contracts with                32,488                          31,820                     \n  contractually limited exposure                                                                        \n  Maximum exposure of stable value                                                                      \n  contracts with contractually limited        1,652                           2,063                     \n  exposure                                                                                              \n  Fair value                                                                                            \n  Derivative payables                            89                             649                     \n                                                                                                        \nIn addition to derivative contracts that meet the\ncharacteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a\npurchaser and seller of credit protection in the\ncredit derivatives market. Refer to Note 5 for a\nfurther discussion of credit derivatives. Unsettled\nsecurities financing agreements In the normal\ncourse of business, the Firm enters into resale and\nsecurities borrowed agreements. At settlement,\nthese commitments result in the Firm advancing cash\nto and receiving securities collateral from the\ncounterparty. The Firm also enters into repurchase\nand securities loaned agreements. At settlement,\nthese commitments result in the Firm receiving cash\nfrom and providing securities collateral to the\ncounterparty. Such agreements settle at a future\ndate. These agreements generally do not meet the\ndefinition of a derivative, and therefore, are not\nrecorded on the Consolidated balance sheets until\nsettlement date. These agreements predominantly\nhave regular-way settlement terms. Refer to Note 11\nfor a further discussion of securities financing\nagreements. Loan sales- and securitization-related\nindemnifications Mortgage repurchase liability In\nconnection with the Firm\u2019s mortgage loan sale and\nsecuritization activities with U.S. GSEs the Firm\nhas made representations and warranties that the\nloans sold meet certain requirements, and that may\nrequire the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans\nand/or indemnify the loan purchaser if such\nrepresentations and warranties are breached by the\nFirm. Private label securitizations The liability\nrelated to repurchase demands associated with\nprivate label securitizations is separately\nevaluated by the Firm in establishing its\nlitigation reserves. Refer to Note 30 for\nadditional information regarding litigation. Loans\nsold with recourse The Firm provides servicing for\nmortgages and certain commercial lending products\non both a recourse and nonrecourse basis. In\nnonrecourse servicing, the principal credit risk to\nthe Firm is the cost of temporary servicing\nadvances of funds (i.e., normal servicing\nadvances). In recourse servicing, the servicer\nagrees to share credit risk with the owner of the\nmortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae\n                                              \n  294    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nor Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing predominantly occur\nwhen foreclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan are less than the sum of the\noutstanding principal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of\nthe underlying property. The Firm\u2019s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, thereby effectively\ntransferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities issued by\nthe trust. The unpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse as well as the carrying value of the\nrelated liability that the Firm has recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets, which is representative of the Firm\u2019s view of the likelihood it will have to perform under\nits recourse obligations, are disclosed in the table on page 292. Other off-balance sheet arrangements\nIndemnification agreements \u2013 general In connection with issuing securities to investors outside the U.S.,\nthe Firm may agree to pay additional amounts to the holders of the securities in the event that, due to a\nchange in tax law, certain types of withholding taxes are imposed on payments on the securities. The terms\nof the securities may also give the Firm the right to redeem the securities if such additional amounts are\npayable. The Firm may also enter into indemnification clauses in connection with the licensing of software\nto clients (\u201csoftware licensees\u201d) or when it sells a business or assets to a third party (\u201cthird-party\npurchasers\u201d), pursuant to which it indemnifies software licensees for claims of liability or damages that\nmay occur subsequent to the licensing of the software, or third-party purchasers for losses they may incur\ndue to actions taken by the Firm prior to the sale of the business or assets. It is difficult to estimate\nthe Firm\u2019s maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements, since this would require an assessment\nof future changes in tax law and future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred.\nHowever, based on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to be remote. Merchant charge-\nbacks Under the rules of payment networks, in its role as a merchant acquirer, the Firm\u2019s Merchant Services\nbusiness in CIB Payments, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card\ntransactions that result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder\u2019s\nfavor, the Firm will (through the cardholder\u2019s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder\nand will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If the Firm is unable to collect the amount from the\nmerchant, the Firm will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. The Firm\nmitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other\ncollateral. In addition, the Firm recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance\nrisk related to charge-backs. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Firm processed an\naggregate volume of $ 2,411.0billion, $ 2,158.4billion, and $ 1,886.7billion, respectively. Clearing\nServices \u2013 Client Credit Risk The Firm provides clearing services for clients by entering into securities\npurchases and sales and derivative contracts with CCPs, including ETDs such as futures and options, as well\nas OTC-cleared derivative contracts. As a clearing member, the Firm stands behind the performance of its\nclients, collects cash and securities collateral (margin) as well as any settlement amounts due from or to\nclients, and remits them to the relevant CCP or client in whole or part. There are two types of margin:\nvariation margin is posted on a daily basis based on the value of clients\u2019 derivative contracts and initial\nmargin is posted at inception of a derivative contract, generally on the basis of the potential changes in\nthe variation margin requirement for the contract. As a clearing member, the Firm is exposed to the risk of\nnonperformance by its clients, but is not liable to clients for the performance of the CCPs. Where possible,\nthe Firm seeks to mitigate its risk to the client through the collection of appropriate amounts of margin at\ninception and throughout the life of the transactions. The Firm can also cease providing clearing services\nif clients do not adhere to their obligations under the clearing agreement. In the event of nonperformance\nby a client, the Firm would close out the client\u2019s positions and access available margin. The CCP would\nutilize any margin it holds to make itself whole, with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by the\nFirm as a clearing member. The Firm reflects its exposure to nonperformance risk of the client through the\nrecognition of margin receivables from clients and margin payables to CCPs; the clients\u2019 underlying\nsecurities or derivative contracts are not reflected in the Firm\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements. It is\ndifficult to estimate the Firm\u2019s maximum possible exposure through its role as a clearing member, as this\nwould require an assessment of transactions that clients may execute in the future. However, based upon\nhistorical experience, and the credit risk mitigants available to the Firm, management believes it is\nunlikely that the Firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements and the risk of loss\nis expected to be remote. Refer to Note 5 for information on the derivatives that the Firm executes for its\nown account and records in its Consolidated Financial Statements.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    295  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nExchange & Clearing House Memberships The Firm is a member of several securities and derivative exchanges\nand clearing houses, both in the U.S. and other countries, and it provides clearing services to its clients.\nMembership in some of these organizations requires the Firm to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred\nby the organization as a result of the default of another member. Such obligations vary with different\norganizations. These obligations may be limited to the amount (or a multiple of the amount) of the Firm\u2019s\ncontribution to the guarantee fund maintained by a clearing house or exchange as part of the resources\navailable to cover any losses in the event of a member default. Alternatively, these obligations may also\ninclude a pro rata share of the residual losses after applying the guarantee fund. Additionally, certain\nclearing houses require the Firm as a member to pay a pro rata share of losses that may result from the\nclearing house\u2019s investment of guarantee fund contributions and initial margin, unrelated to and independent\nof the default of another member. Generally a payment would only be required should such losses exceed the\nresources of the clearing house or exchange that are contractually required to absorb the losses in the\nfirst instance. In certain cases, it is difficult to estimate the Firm\u2019s maximum possible exposure under\nthese membership agreements, since this would require an assessment of future claims that may be made\nagainst the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the\nrisk of loss to the Firm to be remote. Where the Firm\u2019s maximum possible exposure can be estimated, the\namount is disclosed in the table on page 292, in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments\nline. Sponsored member repo program The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight and\nterm resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation (\u201cFICC\u201d) on behalf of clients that become sponsored members under the FICC\u2019s rules. The\nFirm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment and performance of its sponsored member\nclients\u2019 respective obligations under the FICC\u2019s rules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these\nguarantees by obtaining a security interest in the cash or high-quality securities collateral that the\nclients place with the clearing house; therefore, the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm\u2019s\nmaximum possible exposure, without taking into consideration the associated collateral, is included in the\nExchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line on page 292. Refer to Note 11 for additional\ninformation on credit risk mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of collateral pledged\nunder repurchase agreements. Guarantees of subsidiaries In the normal course of business, the Parent Company\nmay provide counterparties with guarantees of certain of the trading and other obligations of its\nsubsidiaries on a contract-by-contract basis, as negotiated with the Firm\u2019s counterparties. The obligations\nof the subsidiaries are included on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated balance sheets or are reflected as off-balance\nsheet commitments; therefore, the Parent Company has not recognized a separate liability for these\nguarantees. The Firm believes that the occurrence of any event that would trigger payments by the Parent\nCompany under these guarantees is remote. The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and\nstructured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (\u201cJPMFC\u201d), a 100%-owned\nfinance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent\nCompany and no other subsidiary of the parent company guarantees these securities. These guarantees, which\nrank pari passu with the Firm\u2019s unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the table on\npage 292 of this Note.

The litigations range from\nindividual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class\nmembers. Investigations and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by\nboth governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages\nof adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm\u2019s lines of business and several\ngeographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory\nantitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm\nbelieves the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves\nestablished, for its legal proceedings is from $ 0to approximately $ 1.3billion at December 31, 2023. This\nestimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date\nfor those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made.\nFor certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The\nFirm\u2019s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: \u2022\nthe number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary\nstages, \u2022 the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of\nliability (if any) has yet to be determined, \u2022 the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the\nproceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and \u2022 the\nuncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made\nassumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives\nof adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition, the\noutcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate\nbecause the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm\u2019s estimate of\nthe aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary\nsignificantly. Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm\u2019s material legal proceedings. 1MDB Litigation .\nJ.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by\n1Malaysia Development Berhad (\u201c1MDB\u201d), a Malaysian state-owned and controlled investment fund. The claim\nalleges \u201cdishonest assistance\u201d against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in relation to payments of $ 300million and $\n500million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan\n(Suisse) SA held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings\n(Cayman) Limited. The Firm is challenging the validity of service and the Malaysian Court\u2019s jurisdiction to\nhear the claim. In August 2023 the Court denied an application by 1MDB to discontinue its claim with\npermission to re-file a new claim in the future. An appeals court is scheduled in August 2024 to hear\nseparate appeals filed by 1MDB and the Firm against that August 2023 decision. In its appeal, the Firm seeks\nto prevent any claim from continuing. In addition, in November 2023, the Federal Office of the Attorney\nGeneral (OAG) in Switzerland notified J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA that it is conducting an investigation into\npossible criminal liability in connection with transactions arising from J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA\u2019s\nrelationship with the 1MDB PetroSaudi joint venture and its related persons for the period September 2009\nthrough August 2015. The OAG investigation is ongoing. Amrapali . India\u2019s Enforcement Directorate (\u201cED\u201d) is\ninvestigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by\ntwooffshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects developed by\nthe Amrapali Group (\u201cAmrapali\u201d) relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units. In\nAugust 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $ 31.5million,\nand the Firm is appealing that order. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order\nmaking preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities\nand the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain criminal currency control and\nmoney laundering provisions, and ordered the ED to conduct a further inquiry. The Firm is responding to and\ncooperating with the inquiry. Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported\nsettlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (\u201cFX\u201d) sales and trading\nactivities and controls related to those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded\nguilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The Department of Labor (\"DOL\") granted the Firm\nexemptions that permit the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset\nManager exemption under\n                                              \n  298    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d) through the ten-yeardisqualification period following\nthe antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition\nCommission matter which is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal. With respect to\ncivil litigation matters, in a putative class action filed against the Firm and other foreign exchange\ndealers on behalf of certain parties who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates, the\nDistrict Court denied certification of a class and granted summary judgment against the named plaintiffs in\nMarch 2023. An appeal by those plaintiffs of the District Court's decision is pending. In addition, some FX-\nrelated individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed\noutside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. An agreement to\nresolve one of the U.K. actions was reached in December 2022. In July 2023, the U.K. Court of Appeal\noverturned the Competition Appeal Tribunal's earlier denial of a request for class certification on an opt-\nout basis. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached on the putative class action, which remains\nsubject to court approval. Government Inquiries Related to the Zelle Network . The Firm is responding to\ninquiries from civil government authorities regarding the handling of disputes related to transfers of funds\nthrough the Zelle Network. The Firm is cooperating with these inquiries and responding to requests for\ninformation. Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class\naction complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of\ncredit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In\nSeptember 2018, the parties settled the class action seeking monetary relief, with the defendants\ncollectively contributing approximately $ 6.2billion. The settlement has been approved by the District Court\nand affirmed on appeal. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the settlement, $ 700million\nhas been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow. A separate class action seeking injunctive\nrelief continues, and in September 2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class\ncertification in part, and denied the motion in part. Of the merchants who opted out of the damages class\nsettlement, certain merchants filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and\nMastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks. While some of those actions remain pending, the\ndefendants have reached settlements with the merchants who opted out representing approximately 70% of the\ncombined Mastercard-branded and Visa-branded payment card sales volume. Jeffrey Epstein Litigation. JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. was named as a defendant in lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York alleging that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. knowingly facilitated Jeffrey\nEpstein\u2019s sex trafficking and other unlawful conduct by providing banking services to Epstein until 2013. In\nJune 2023, the Court granted preliminary approval of a settlement between the victim class and JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A., pursuant to which JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid $ 290million to a fund for Epstein\nsurvivors. In November 2023, the Court granted final approval of the settlement, rejecting objections,\nincluding those of certain state Attorneys General, regarding the victims\u2019 releases. LIBOR and Other\nBenchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various\ngovernmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association\u2019s\n(\u201cBBA\u201d) London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) for various currencies and the European Banking Federation\u2019s\nEuro Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cEURIBOR\u201d). The Swiss Competition Commission\u2019s investigation relating to\nEURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain subject, continues. The Firm appealed a December 2016\ndecision by the European Commission against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European\nantitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. In December 2023, the European General Court annulled the fine imposed\nby the European Commission, but exercised its discretion to re-impose a fine in an identical amount. The\nFirm is considering its options. In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks\nin various individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In\nactions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has\nobtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other actions, and others are in various stages\nof litigation. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York has granted class\ncertification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants,\nincluding the Firm. In addition, a lawsuit filed by a group of individual plaintiffs asserting antitrust\nclaims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar\nLIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards was dismissed\nin October 2023. Plaintiff filed an appeal of the dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit in November 2023. The Firm has resolved all non-U.S. dollar LIBOR actions. Russian Litigation\n. The Firm is obligated to comply with international sanctions laws, which mandate the freezing or\nrestriction of certain assets. These laws apply when assets associated with individuals, companies, products\nor services are within the scope of the sanctions. The Firm has faced actual and threatened litigation in\nRussia seeking payments on transactions that the Firm cannot make, and is contractually excused from paying,\nunder relevant sanctions laws, with judgment entered against the Firm in one claim in February 2024. The\nRussian court may\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    299  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \ndisregard the parties\u2019 contractual agreement on forum selection, and may not recognize foreign sanctions\nlaws as a basis for not making payment. The Firm holds assets in Russia, which could be seized if the claims\nare granted and enforced. SEC Inquiries . The Firm is responding to requests from the SEC regarding aspects\nof certain advisory programs within J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, including aggregation of accounts for\nbilling, discounting advisory fees, and selecting portfolio managers. Separately, the Firm is responding to\nrequests from the SEC in connection with the timing of the Firm\u2019s liquidation of shares distributed in-kind\nto certain investment vehicles that invest in third-party managed private funds. The Firm is cooperating\nwith the SEC in regard to both inquires. Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation . JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending\nCorp. are named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law and New York State\ncommon law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange trading\nfor securities lending transactions. The settlement of this action by the parties has been preliminarily\napproved, and is subject to final court approval. Shareholder Litigation . Several shareholder putative\nclass actions, as well as shareholder derivative actions purporting to act on behalf of the Firm, have been\nfiled against the Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its current and former officers. Certain of\nthese shareholder suits relate to historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals\nand U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct which were the subject of the Firm\u2019s resolutions with the\nDOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary activities that were separately the subject of a\nresolution between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in November 2020. One of these shareholder\nderivative suits was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in May 2022, asserting breach of\nfiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct\nand fiduciary activities which were the subject of the resolutions described above. In December 2022, the\ncourt granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss this action in full, and in July 2023, the plaintiff filed an\nappeal, which remains pending. A second shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New York in December 2022 relating to the historical trading\npractices and related conduct, which asserts breach of fiduciary duty and contribution claims and alleges\nthat the shareholder is excused from making a demand to commence litigation because such a demand would have\nbeen futile. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint. In addition, a consolidated putative class\naction is pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York on behalf of\nshareholders who acquired shares of JPMorgan Chase common stock during the putative class period, alleging\nthat certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially false or misleading because they did not disclose\ncertain information relating to the historical trading practices and conduct. In December 2023, the court\ngranted Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the amended complaint. A shareholder derivative suit was filed in May\n2023 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against various officers and\ndirectors of the Firm asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment based upon allegations that\nthe defendants caused the Firm to retain Jeffrey Epstein as a client of the bank after defendants knew, or\nshould have known, that Epstein was using the Firm\u2019s financial services to facilitate his alleged sex\ntrafficking activities. In December 2023, the Court dismissed the derivative action. A separate shareholder\nderivative suit was filed in March 2022 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of federal securities laws based on the alleged\nfailure of the Board of Directors to exercise adequate oversight over the Firm\u2019s compliance with records\npreservation requirements which were the subject of resolutions between certain of the Firm\u2019s subsidiaries\nand the SEC and the CFTC. Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the amended complaint is pending. Trading Venues\nInvestigations . The Firm has been responding to government inquiries regarding its processes to inventory\ntrading venues and confirm the completeness of certain data fed to trade surveillance platforms. The Firm\nself-identified that certain trading and order data through the CIB was not feeding into its trade\nsurveillance platforms. The Firm has completed enhancements to the CIB\u2019s venue inventory and data\ncompleteness controls, and other remediation is underway. The Firm has also performed a review of the data\nnot originally surveilled, which is nearly complete, and has not identified any employee misconduct, harm to\nclients or the market. While the identified gaps represent a fraction of the overall activity across the\nCIB, the data gap on one venue, which largely consisted of sponsored client access activity, was\nsignificant. The Firm is dedicated to maintaining rigorous controls and continuously enhancing the\nreliability of its trade infrastructure. The Firm expects to enter into resolutions with two U.S. regulators\nthat will require the Firm to, among other things, complete its remediation, engage an independent\nconsultant, and pay aggregate civil penalties of approximately $ 350million. The Firm is also in advanced\nnegotiations with a third U.S. regulator, but there is no assurance that such discussions will result in a\nresolution. The Firm does not expect any disruption of service to clients as a result of these resolutions.\n* * *\n                                              \n  300    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nIn addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named\nas defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm\nbelieves it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal\nproceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from\ntime to time in the future. The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently\noutstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm\naccrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and\nthe amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings\neach quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upward or downward,\nas appropriate, based on management\u2019s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm\u2019s legal\nexpense was $ 1.4billion, $ 266million and $ 426million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and\n2021, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm\u2019s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted\nin the future. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings,\nparticularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present\nnovel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot\nstate with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of\ntheir ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters.\nJPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration\nof the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation\nreserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently\npending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm\u2019s consolidated financial condition.\nThe Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no\nassurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has\ncurrently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the\noutcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operating results for a particular\nperiod, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s income for that period.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    301  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Note 31 \u2013 International operations                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \nThe following table presents income statement and balance sheet-related information for JPMorgan Chase by\nmajor international geographic area. The Firm defines international activities for purposes of this footnote\npresentation as business transactions that involve clients residing outside of the U.S., and the information\npresented below is based predominantly on the domicile of the client, the location from which the client\nrelationship is managed, booking location or the location of the trading desk. However, many of the Firm\u2019s\nU.S. operations serve international businesses. As the Firm\u2019s operations are highly integrated, estimates\nand subjective assumptions have been made to apportion revenue and expense between U.S. and international\noperations. These estimates and assumptions are consistent with the allocations used for the Firm\u2019s segment\nreporting as set forth in Note 32. The Firm\u2019s long-lived assets for the periods presented are not considered\nby management to be significant in relation to total assets. The majority of the Firm\u2019s long-lived assets\nare located in the U.S.\n                                                                                                            \n  As of or

The Firm\u2019s definition of managed basis starts with the reported\nU.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each\nof the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax\ncredits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable\ninvestments and securities. This allows management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year\narising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt\nitems is recorded within income tax expense/(benefit). These adjustments have no impact on net income as\nreported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs. Capital allocation Each business segment is allocated\ncapital by taking into consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers\nand applicable regulatory capital requirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for expected returns\nare established as key measures of a business segment\u2019s performance. The Firm\u2019s current allocation\nmethodology incorporates Basel III Standardized RWA and the GSIB surcharge, both under rules currently in\neffect, as well as a simulation of capital in a severe stress environment. At least annually, the\nassumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the\ncapital allocated to the LOBs may change.\nSegment results and

The Firm believes that the First Republic acquisition is complementary to the Firm's existing\nfranchises. The acquisition resulted in an estimated bargain purchase gain, which represents the excess of\nthe estimated fair value of the net assets acquired above the purchase price. The Firm has determined that\nthis acquisition constitutes a business combination under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the initial recognition of\nthe assets acquired and liabilities assumed were generally measured at their estimated fair values as of May\n1, 2023. The determination of those fair values required management to make certain market-based assumptions\nabout expected future cash flows, discount rates and other valuation inputs at the time of the acquisition.\nThe Firm believes that the fair value estimates of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed provide a\nreasonable basis for determining the estimated bargain purchase gain. The Firm and the FDIC have not yet\ncompleted the settlement process under which the purchase price, and the identification of the assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed, will be finalized. The finalization of this settlement process may impact\nthe amount of the estimated bargain purchase gain. The purchase and assumption agreement entered into with\nthe FDIC allows for final settlement to occur up to a year after the acquisition date. In addition, the\npurchase price and the estimated bargain purchase gain could change pending management's finalization of its\nacquisition date fair value estimates for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which may\ntake place up to one year from the acquisition date, as permitted by U.S. GAAP. The First Republic\nacquisition resulted in a preliminary estimated bargain purchase gain of $ 2.7billion. The Firm has\ncontinued to progress in the settlement process with the FDIC and refine its acquisition-date fair value\nestimates. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2023, adjustments totaling $ 63million were made,\nincreasing the estimated bargain purchase gain to $ 2.8billion. In connection with the First Republic\nacquisition, the Firm and the FDIC entered into twoshared-loss agreements with respect to certain loans and\nlending-related commitments (the \"shared-loss assets\"): the Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement (\"CSLA\") and\nthe Single-Family Shared-Loss Agreement (\u201cSFSLA\u201d). The CSLA covers 80% of credit losses, on a pari passu\nbasis, over 5years with a subsequent 3-yearrecovery period for certain acquired commercial loans and other\nreal estate exposure. The SFSLA covers 80% of credit losses, on a pari passu basis, for 7years for certain\nacquired loans secured by mortgages on real property or shares in cooperative property constituting a\nprimary residence. The indemnification assets, which represent the fair value of the CSLA and SFSLA on the\nacquisition date, are reflected in the total assets acquired. As part of the consideration paid, JPMorgan\nChase issued a five-year, $ 50billion secured note to the FDIC (the \"Purchase Money Note\"). The Purchase\nMoney Note bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.4% and is secured by certain of the acquired loans. The\nPurchase Money Note is prepayable upon notice to the holder. The Firm had placed a $ 5billion deposit with\nFirst Republic Bank on March 16, 2023, as part of $ 30billion of deposits provided by a consortium of large\nU.S. banks. The Firm's $ 5billion deposit was effectively settled as part of the acquisition and the\nassociated allowance for credit losses was released upon closing. The Firm subsequently repaid the remaining\n$ 25billion of deposits to the consortium of banks, including accrued interest through the payment date on\nMay 9, 2023.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K    307  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nThe computation of the purchase price, the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed as part of the First Republic acquisition and the related estimated bargain purchase gain are\npresented below, and reflect the adjustments made through December 31, 2023 to the acquisition-date fair\nvalue of the net assets acquired.\n                                                                                \n                                                           Fair value purchase  \n                                                        price allocation as of  \n                                                                   May 1, 2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (in millions)                                                                 \n  Purchase price consideration                                                  \n  Amounts paid/due to the FDIC, net of cash          $                  13,524  \n  acquired(a)                                                                   \n  Purchase Money Note (at fair value)                                   48,848  \n  Settlement of First Republic deposit and other                         5,447  \n  related party transactions(b)                                                 \n  Contingent consideration - Shared-loss                                    15  \n  agreements                                                                    \n  Purchase price consideration                       $                  67,834  \n  Assets                                                                        \n  Securities                                         $                  30,285  \n  Loans(c)                                                             153,242  \n  Core deposit and customer relationship                                 1,455  \n  intangibles                                                                   \n  Indemnification assets - Shared-loss agreements                          675  \n  Accounts receivable and other assets(c)(d)                             6,574  \n  Total assets acquired                              $                 192,231  \n  Liabilities                                                                   \n  Deposits                                           $                  87,572  \n  FHLB advances                                                         27,919  \n  Lending-related commitments                                            2,614  \n  Accounts payable and other liabilities(c)(d)                           2,793  \n  Deferred tax liabilities                                                 724  \n  Total liabilities assumed                          $                 121,622  \n  Fair value of net assets acquired                  $                  70,609  \n  Estimated gain on acquisition, after-tax           $                   2,775  \n                                                                                \n(a) Includes $ 10.6billion of cash paid to the FDIC at acquisition and $ 3.6billion payable to the FDIC,\nless cash acquired of $ 680million.\n(b) Includes $ 447million of securities financing transactions with First Republic Bank that were\neffectively settled on the acquisition date.\n(c) In the fourth quarter, certain assets and liabilities were reclassified resulting in a $ 762million\nincrease to loans, an $ 870million decrease to accounts receivable and other assets and a $ 30million\nincrease to accounts payable and other liabilities.\n(d) Other assets include $ 1.2billion in tax-oriented investments and $ 683million of lease right-of-use\nassets. Other liabilities include the related tax-oriented investment liabilities of $ 669million and lease\nliabilities of $ 748million. Refer to Note 14 and Note 18 for additional information.\nThe issuance of the $ 50billion Purchase Money Note, the effective settlement of the Firm's $ 5billion\ndeposit and $ 447million of securities financing with First Republic Bank, and the $ 3.6billion payable to\nthe FDIC as part of the purchase price consideration are considered non-cash transactions.\n\nThe following describes the accounting policies and fair value methodologies generally used by the Firm for\nthe following assets acquired and liabilities assumed: core deposit and customer relationship intangibles,\nshared-loss agreements and the related indemnification assets, Purchase Money Note, and FHLB advances.\n\nFor further discussion of the Firm\u2019s accounting policies and valuation methodologies, refer to Note 2 and\nNote 3 for fair value measurement, Note 10 for investment securities, Note 12 for loans, Note 17 for\ndeposits, and Note 28 for lending-related commitments.\n\nCore deposit and customer relationship intangibles Core deposit and certain wealth management customer\nrelationship intangibles were acquired as part of the First Republic acquisition. The core deposit\nintangible of $ 1.3billion was valued by discounting estimated after-tax cost savings over the remaining\nuseful life of the deposits using the favorable source of funds method. The after-tax cost savings were\nestimated based on the difference between the cost of maintaining the core deposit base relative to the cost\nof next best alternative funding sources available to market participants. The customer relationship\nintangibles of $ 180million were valued by discounting estimated after-tax earnings over their remaining\nuseful lives using the multi-period excess earnings method. Both intangible asset valuations utilized\nassumptions that the Firm believes a market participant would use to estimate fair values, such as growth\nand attrition rates, projected fee income as well as related costs to service the relationships, and\ndiscount rates. The core deposit and customer relationship intangibles will be amortized over a projected\nperiod of future cash flows of approximately 7years. Refer to Note 15 for further discussion on other\nintangible assets. Indemnification assets - Shared-loss agreements The indemnification assets represent\nforecasted recoveries from the FDIC associated with the shared-loss assets over the respective shared-loss\nrecovery periods. The indemnification assets were recorded at fair value in other\n                                              \n  308    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nassets on the Consolidated balance sheets on the acquisition date. The fair values of the indemnification\nassets were estimated based on the timing of the forecasted losses underlying the related allowance for\ncredit losses. The subsequent quarterly remeasurement of the indemnification assets is based on changes in\nthe amount and timing of forecasted losses in the allowance for credit losses associated with the shared-\nloss assets and is recorded in other income. Under certain circumstances, the Firm may be required to make a\npayment to the FDIC upon termination of the shared-loss agreements based on the level of actual losses and\nrecoveries on the shared-loss assets. The estimated potential future payment is reflected as contingent\nconsideration as part of the purchase price consideration. Purchase Money Note and FHLB advances The\nPurchase Money Note is recorded in long-term debt on the Consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the\nPurchase Money Note was estimated based on a discounted cash flow methodology and incorporated estimated\nmarket discount rates. The FHLB advances assumed in the acquisition are recorded in short-term borrowings\nand in long-term debt. The fair values of the FHLB advances were based on a discounted cash flow methodology\nand considered the observed FHLB advance issuance rates.\n\nLoans\n\nThe following table presents the unpaid principal balance (\"UPB\") and estimated fair values of the loans\nacquired as of May 1, 2023, and reflects adjustments to the acquisition-date fair value of the loans\nacquired through December 31, 2023.\n                                                              \n                                May 1, 2023                   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (in millions)                         UPB       Fair value  \n  Residential real estate    $      106,240    $      92,053  \n  Auto and other                      3,093            2,030  \n  Total consumer                    109,333           94,083  \n  Secured by real estate             37,117           33,602  \n  Commercial & industrial             4,332            3,932  \n  Other(a)                           23,499           21,625  \n  Total wholesale                    64,948           59,159  \n  Total loans                $      174,281    $     153,242  \n                                                              \n(a) In the fourth quarter, certain assets and liabilities were reclassified resulting in a $ 900million\nincrease to the UPB and a $ 762million increase to the fair value of Other wholesale loans.\n\nUnaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information\n\nIncluded in the Firm's Consolidated statements of income are noninterest revenue, net interest income and\nnet income contributed by First Republic of $ 4.4billion, $ 3.7billion and $ 4.1billion, respectively, for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe following table presents certain unaudited pro forma financial information for the year ended December\n31, 2023 and 2022 as if the First Republic acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2022, including\nrecognition of the estimated bargain purchase gain of $ 2.8billion and the provision for credit losses of $\n1.2billion.

                         \nThe table below presents an attribution of net interest income between volume and rate. The attribution\nbetween volume and rate is calculated using annual average balances for each category of assets and\nliabilities shown in the table and the corresponding annual rates (refer to pages 310-313 for more\ninformation on average balances and rates). In this analysis, when the change cannot be isolated to either\nvolume or rate, it has been allocated to volume. The annual rates include the impact of changes in market\nrates, as well as the impact of any change in composition of the various products within each category of\nasset or liability. This analysis is calculated separately for each category without consideration of the\nrelationship between categories (for example, the net spread between the rates earned on assets and the\nrates paid on liabilities that fund those assets). As a result, changes in the granularity or groupings\nconsidered in this analysis would produce a different attribution result, and due to the complexities\ninvolved, precise allocation of changes in interest rates between volume and rates is inherently complex and\njudgmental.\n                                                                                                            \n

The\nminimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on\nthe interest rate charged during the introductory\nperiod. This introductory rate is usually\nsignificantly below the fully indexed rate. The\nfully indexed rate is calculated using an index\nrate plus a margin. Once the introductory period\nends, the contractual interest rate charged on the\nloan increases to the fully indexed rate and\nadjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index.\nThe minimum payment is typically insufficient to\ncover interest accrued in the prior month, and any\nunpaid interest is deferred and added to the\nprincipal balance of the loan.
