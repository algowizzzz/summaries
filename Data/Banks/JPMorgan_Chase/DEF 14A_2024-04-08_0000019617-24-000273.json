Burke, Our Lead Independent Director\n                                                                                               April 8, 2024\nDear Fellow Shareholders:\n\nIn connection with the 2024 Annual Meeting, we want\nto share with you some of the highlights of the work\nof the Board. The Board oversaw the Firm\u2019s continued\nstrong financial performance in 2023, building upon\nits momentum from prior years. We experienced growth\nacross all of our market-leading lines of business\nand maintained a fortress balance sheet. We achieved\nmanaged revenue of $162.4 billion, which was a\nrecord for the 6th consecutive year, as well as\nrecord net income of $49.6 billion and ROTCE of 21%.\nThe Firm increased its quarterly common dividend\nfrom $1.00 to $1.05 per share. In addition, we\nsuccessfully navigated and supported our clients and\ncustomers through the regional bank turmoil, and\ncompleted our acquisition of the assets of First\nRepublic Bank.\n\nThe Board is focused on the many factors that\ncontribute to the Firm\u2019s long-term strong\nperformance, including continued investment in\nproducts, technology and people. We remain vigilant\nand prepared to work with our customers, clients and\ncommunities around the world across a broad range of\neconomic environments. At all times, we are guided\nby our fundamental business principles and our\ncommitment to building long-term value for our\nshareholders. This was especially important to our\nwork in the past year, as geopolitics and conflicts\ndevelopments around the world produced much\nuncertainty. The ongoing wars in Ukraine and the\nMiddle East, growing tensions with China and a\npolitically divided America have the potential to\nlead to a restructuring of the global order, in\naddition to having profound human consequences.\n\nIn this environment, the Board\u2019s efforts are focused\non making informed decisions and taking appropriate\nactions to help ensure that our Firm is resilient\nand we can be there for our clients \u2013 in both good\ntimes and bad times. Among other matters, in the\npast year the Board focused on the following:\n\n\u2022 Executive succession planning\n\nOne of the Board\u2019s top priorities is to plan for an\norderly CEO transition in the medium term. As\ndiscussed in more detail in this proxy statement,\nthe Board is spending significant time on developing\nOperating Committee members who are well-known to\nshareholders as strong potential CEO candidates.\nEarlier this year, the Firm announced leadership and\norganizational changes to continue to position the\nFirm for the future. Jennifer Piepszak and Troy\nRohrbaugh were named Co-CEOs of the expanded\nCommercial & Investment Bank, and Marianne Lake\nbecame sole CEO of Consumer & Community Banking.\nMary Erdoes remains CEO of Asset &\n\nWealth Management, and Daniel Pinto continues as\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer. The Board\nbelieves that these senior management changes and\nnew alignment will help the Firm better serve its\nclients as well as further develop the Firm's most\nsenior leaders. Should the need arise in the near-\nterm, we view Mr. Pinto as a key executive who is\nimmediately ready to fulfill the responsibilities of\nthe CEO. We also continue to develop a deep bench of\npotential leaders who can execute the Firm\u2019s\nstrategy and enhance our strong culture.\n\n\u2022 Board refreshment\n\nWe are committed to maintaining a vital Board for\ntoday and the future. In January of this year, we\nwere fortunate to add Mark Weinberger to our Board\nand are pleased to nominate him for election by\nshareholders at the annual meeting. As retired\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ernst &\nYoung LLP, he brings to the Board an impressive\ncombination of skills, experience and personal\nqualities that will serve our shareholders, the Firm\nand the Board well. We would also like to take this\nopportunity to thank Tim Flynn and Mike Neal, who\nare retiring from the Board this year. We benefited\ngreatly from their respective insights and\ncontributions as directors and trusted advisors.\n\n\u2022 Oversight of key issues\n\nWe are pleased to report that your Board has been\ndiligently focused on overseeing key issues that are\ncritical to the success and sustainability of our\ninstitution. One such area is Artificial\nIntelligence (AI), which is revolutionizing the\nworld around us. While the full impact of AI on our\nbusiness remains to be seen, we recognize its\npotential to transform every aspect of our\noperations. To capitalize on this and other\ngroundbreaking technological advances, we are making\nstrategic investments in resources and expertise,\npositioning the Firm for success in a rapidly\nchanging competitive landscape. Concurrently, we are\ntaking steps to prevent unintended misuse of AI and\nto mitigate potential cybersecurity risks.\n\nIn addition, the Board is actively overseeing the\nFirm's efforts in addressing climate change and\npromoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). As\na global financial institution, we play a crucial\nrole in supporting our clients' decarbonization\nstrategies and helping to address the broader\nchallenges of transitioning to a low-carbon economy.\nWe are committed to making informed decisions based\non the best interests of our Firm and clients,\nrather than adhering to simplistic statements or\narbitrary rules. Furthermore, we firmly believe in\nthe value of DEI, both as a moral imperative and as\na\n\nTable of Contents\n\nstrategic driver of success. By fostering a diverse\nand inclusive workforce, we enable innovation,\nsmarter decision-making, and better financial\nresults for our business and the economy as a whole.\nWe continue to work closely with management to\npromote equal treatment, opportunity and access\nthroughout our organization. Our company\u2019s success\nis built upon the efforts of thousands of employees,\nour superb senior management team and our\noutstanding Board members. And it is with a heavy\nheart that\n\nwe remember one such Board member, our colleague and\nfriend, Jim Crown, who served as a member of our\nBoard of Directors from 2004 until his unexpected\npassing last year. His wisdom and spirit are\nprofoundly missed. We look forward to continuing to\ndeliver value to our customers, shareholders and\nstakeholders while remaining firm in our business\nprinciples. On behalf of the entire Board, we are\ngrateful for your support of the Board and the Firm.\n                                        \n  James Dimon                           \n  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  \n  Stephen B.

How we think about pay decisions\n\nThe Firm\u2019s Business Principles and strategic framework form the basis of our OC members\u2019 strategic\npriorities. The Compensation & Management Development Committee (\"CMDC\") references those strategic\npriorities and the Firm\u2019s compensation philosophy to assess OC members\u2019 performance and to determine their\nrespective total compensation levels and pay mix.\n\n2. How we performed against our business strategy\n\nWe continued to deliver strong multi-year financial performance, invest in our future, strengthen our risk\nand control environment, and reinforce our culture and values, including our long-standing commitment to\nserve our customers, employees and communities, and conduct business in a responsible way to drive inclusive\ngrowth.\n\n3. How performance determined pay in 2023\n\nIn determining OC member pay, the CMDC took into account performance across four broad performance\ndimensions: Business Results; Risk, Controls & Conduct; Client/Customer/Stakeholder; and Teamwork &\nLeadership. CEO pay is strongly aligned to the Firm\u2019s short-, medium- and long-term performance, with\napproximately 86% of the CEO\u2019s variable pay deferred into equity, of which 100% is in at-risk Performance\nShare Units (\"PSUs\") for both our CEO and our President & COO. Other NEO pay is also strongly aligned to\nFirm and line of business (\"LOB\") performance, with a majority of variable pay deferred into equity, of\nwhich 50% is in at-risk PSUs.\n                                                 \n  Disciplined performance assessment process to  \n  determine pay                                  \n                                                 \nThe CMDC uses a balanced holistic approach to determine annual compensation, which includes a disciplined\nassessment of performance against the aforementioned four broad dimensions over a sustained period of time.\n\nThe table below summarizes the salary and incentive compensation awarded to our NEOs for 2023 performance.\n

Given the nature and broad scope of\nthe products and services provided by the Firm,\nthere are from time to time ordinary course of\nbusiness transactions between the Firm and a\ndirector, his or her immediate family members, or\nprincipal business affiliations. These may include,\namong other relationships: extensions of credit;\nprovision of other financial and financial advisory\nproducts and services; business transactions for\nproperty or services; and charitable contributions\nmade by the JPMorgan Chase Foundation or the Firm to\na nonprofit organization of which a director is an\nofficer. The Board reviews these relationships to\nassess their materiality and determine if any such\nrelationship would impair the independence and\njudgment of the relevant director. The Board\nconsidered:\n\n\u2022 Consumer credit: credit cards and other lines of\ncredit and loans for directors Bammann, Burke,\nCombs, Flynn, Hobson, Neal, Novakovic, Weinberger\nand/or their immediate family members\n\n\u2022 Wholesale/commercial credit: extensions of credit\nand other financial and financial advisory products\nand services provided to: Berkshire Hathaway Inc.,\nfor which Mr. Combs is an Investment Officer, and\nits subsidiaries; Alto Pharmacy, LLC, for which Ms.\nDavis is the Chief Executive Officer, and its\nsubsidiaries; Ariel Investments, LLC, for which Ms.\nHobson is Co-Chief Executive Officer and President,\nand its subsidiaries, affiliates and funds; certain\nentities wholly-owned by Ms. Hobson\u2019s spouse and\ntrusts for which such spouse serves as trustee;\nGeneral Dynamics Corporation, for which Ms.\nNovakovic is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,\nand its subsidiaries; Louis Dreyfus Company B.V.,\nfor which a sibling of Mrs. Rometty serves as the\nTrading Operations Officer and Cotton Platform Head,\nand its subsidiaries; and Hearthside Food Solutions,\nLLC, for which a sibling of Mrs. Rometty serves as\nChief Executive Officer, and its affiliates\n\n\u2022 Goods and services: purchases from Berkshire\nHathaway and subsidiaries of private aviation\nservices and professional services related to the\nFirm\u2019s corporate- owned aircraft; and purchases of\ncorporate aircraft and associated maintenance\nservices and parts provided by General Dynamics\nsubsidiaries\n\nThe Board, having reviewed the relevant\nrelationships between the Firm and each non-\nmanagement director, determined, in accordance with\nthe NYSE\u2019s listing standards and the Firm\u2019s\nindependence standards, that each non- management\ndirector (Linda B. Bammann, Stephen B. Burke, Todd\nA. Combs, Alicia Boler Davis, Timothy P. Flynn, Alex\nGorsky, Mellody Hobson, Michael A. Neal, Phebe N.\nNovakovic, Virginia M. Rometty, and Mark A.\nWeinberger) had only immaterial relationships with\nJPMorgan Chase and accordingly is independent.\n\nAll directors who served on the Audit and\nCompensation & Management Development Committees of\nthe Board were also determined to meet the\nadditional independence and qualitative criteria of\nthe NYSE listing standards applicable to directors\nserving on those committees.

This includes candidates who are not available for board\nmembership immediately but may become available in the future, such as candidates whose current professional\ncommitments preclude board service and emerging leaders who require more experience. Often the Board works\nto develop a relationship with prospective candidates, becoming familiar with their skills and\neffectiveness, before the candidate is formally considered. The Board looks to recruit those who will\ncontribute individually, and it seeks to balance skills, experience, personal attributes and tenure. All\ncandidates recommended to the Governance Committee are evaluated based on the same standards outlined above.\n\nThe Firm's By-laws also provide for a right of proxy access. Our By-laws enable shareholders, under\nspecified conditions, to include their nominees for election as directors in the Firm's proxy statement.\nUnder these provisions, a shareholder group of up to 20 shareholders who have continuously owned at least 3%\nof the Firm\u2019s outstanding shares for at least three years may nominate up to 20% of the Board (but in any\nevent at least two directors). For further information, see page 112.\n\nRecent board refreshment\n\nSince our last annual shareholder meeting, the Board elected Mark Weinberger to the Board effective January\n2024. The Board used the process described above and took into account the considerations outlined on pages\n9- 10and shareholder interest in board refreshment. Mr. Weinberger has been among a select group of\nindividuals considered as part of the Governance Committee\u2019s evaluation of prospective Board members in\nrecent years.\n\nMr. Weinberger was familiar to a number of directors and executives based on his leadership roles at Ernst &\nYoung and his active involvement with the World Economic Forum and other economic, government and business\nroles. Members of the Governance Committee suggested that he be considered as a prospective candidate. They\nmet with him and reviewed his qualifications including his distinctive expertise in finance, tax and\naccountancy as a leader in those fields for over three decades prior to his retirement. His executive\nexperience and skills were among the Board's recruitment priorities as they complement the Board's existing\ncomposition and support effective oversight of the Firm's strategy. The Committee also reviewed his\nconstructive personal attributes and independence, and recommended his election by the Board.\n\nFor more information on Mr. Weinberger's qualifications, see page 15.\n                                                                                                            \n  2024 PROXY STATEMENT17JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                               \n  ELECTION OF DIRECTORS| CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                                               \n                                                                                \n  Director nominees    Board governance    Board oversight    Board engagement  \n                                                                                \nDirector re-nomination\n\nThe Governance Committee also oversees the re-nomination process. In determining whether to re-nominate a\ndirector for election at our annual meeting, the Governance Committee reviews each director, considering:\n\nRetirement policy\n\nOur Governance Principles require a non-management director to offer not to stand for re-election in each\ncalendar year following a year in which the director will be 72 or older. The Board (other than the affected\ndirector) then determines whether to accept the offer. The Board believes that the appropriate mix of\nexperience and fresh perspectives is an important consideration in assessing Board composition, and the best\ninterests of the Firm are served by taking advantage of all available talent, and evaluations as to director\ncandidacy should not be determined solely on age.\n\nNone of our director nominees will be 72 or older this year.\n\nFor a description of the annual Board and committee self-assessment process, see page 24.\n                                                                                                            \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.182024 PROXY STATEMENT                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                               \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE |ELECTION OF DIRECTORS  \n                                               \n                                                                                \n  Director nominees    Board governance    Board oversight    Board engagement  \n                                                                                \n2.

The\nBoard believes the present structure provides the\nFirm and the Board with strong leadership,\nappropriate independent oversight of management,\ncontinuity of experience that complements ongoing\nBoard refreshment, and the ability to communicate\nthe Firm's business and strategy to shareholders,\nclients, employees, regulators and the public in a\nsingle voice.\n\nAs required by the Firm\u2019s Governance Principles,\nwhen the role of the Chair is combined with that of\nthe CEO, the independent directors appoint a Lead\nIndependent Director. Our Lead Independent Director\nprovides a strong counterbalance to the Chair,\nincluding by facilitating independent oversight of\nmanagement, promoting open dialogue among the\nindependent directors during and in between Board\nmeetings, leading executive sessions at each regular\nBoard meeting without the presence of the CEO, and\nfocusing on the Board's priorities and processes.\n\nIn March 2024, the independent directors conducted\ntheir annual review of the Board\u2019s leadership\nstructure. This review was conducted first by the\nGovernance Committee, which considered the factors\non page 20, the Firm\u2019s governance\n\npractices, which include executive sessions of\nindependent directors as part of each regularly\nscheduled Board meeting and the directors\u2019 frequent\nand open interactions with senior management, and\nthe effectiveness of the Lead Independent Director\nrole. Following its review, the Governance Committee\nrecommended that the Board continue its current\nleadership structure and that Stephen B. Burke be\nre-appointed as Lead Independent Director. The\nindependent directors of the Board then conducted\ntheir own review, again taking into account the\nfactors on page 20, the Governance Committee\u2019s\nrecommendation and Mr. Burke\u2019s strong performance in\nthe Lead Independent Director role over the course\nof the prior year, and determined to maintain the\ncurrent leadership structure with Mr. Burke serving\nas Lead Independent Director.\n\nThe Board maintains the ability to change its\nleadership structure at any time should it elect to\ndo so and is not limited to its annual review of\nleadership structure. The Board has a general\npolicy, upon the next CEO transition, that the Chair\nand CEO positions shall be separate, subject to the\nBoard's determination of the leadership structure\nthat best serves the Firm and its shareholders at\nthat time. This policy is reflected in the Firm's\nGovernance Principles and reinforces the Board's\nlongstanding commitment to independent oversight\nwhile also maintaining the Board's ability to\nfulfill its fiduciary duty to determine the\nleadership structure that best serves shareholders.\n                                                                                                            \n

In 2023, directors\nparticipated in programs on a number of subjects, including: \u2022 deep dive sessions from each LOB covering\ntopics such as products, services, strategy and control environment; \u2022 diversity, equity and inclusion\n(\"DEI\"), and Racial Equity Commitment; \u2022 ESG-related matters, including sustainability and climate risk\nmanagement; \u2022 geopolitical risks; \u2022 global philanthropy; \u2022 key laws, regulations and supervisory\nrequirements applicable to the Firm; \u2022 significant and emerging risks; and \u2022 technology, generative AI and\nlarge language models, cybersecurity updates and data management.\n                                                                                                            \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.242024 PROXY STATEMENT                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                               \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE |ELECTION OF DIRECTORS  \n                                               \n                                                                                \n  Director nominees    Board governance    Board oversight    Board engagement  \n                                                                                \n3. Board oversight\n\nThe Board is responsible for oversight of the\nbusiness and affairs of the Firm on behalf of\nshareholders. It is also responsible for setting the\ncultural \u201ctone at the top.\u201d Among its core\nresponsibilities, the Board oversees:\n\nStrategy\n\nThe Board of Directors oversees the formulation and\nimplementation of the Firm's strategic initiatives\nand reviews and approves the Firm\u2019s annual strategic\nplan. Annual strategic plans include evaluation of\nperformance against the prior year\u2019s initiatives,\nassessment of the current operating environment,\nrefinement of existing strategies and development of\nnew strategic initiatives. Throughout the year, the\nCEO and senior management provide updates on the\nFirm\u2019s overall strategic direction, including\nupdates on the opportunities and performance,\npriorities and implementation of strategies in their\nrespective LOBs and Corporate Functions. These\nmanagement presentations are the foundation of\nactive dialogue with, and feedback from, the Board\nabout the strategic risks and opportunities facing\nthe Firm and its businesses.\n\nExecutive performance, talent management and\nsuccession planning\n\nThe CMDC reviews the Firm\u2019s performance periodically\nduring the course of the year, and formally, at\nleast annually. The CMDC\u2019s review of the CEO\u2019s\nperformance is presented to the Board in connection\nwith the Board\u2019s review of executive officer annual\ncompensation.\n\nIn accordance with our Governance Principles,\nsuccession planning is considered at least annually\nby the non- management directors with the CEO. The\nCMDC reviews the succession plan for the CEO in\npreparation for discussion by the Board, with such\ndiscussion guided by the Lead Independent Director.\nThese discussions occur with and without the CEO and\ninclude consideration of recommendations,\nevaluations and development plans for potential CEO\nsuccessors, in addition to ongoing review of the\nFirm's long-term strategy and analyses of CEO\ntransitions at other companies, among other factors.\n\nThe Board is focused on enabling an orderly CEO\ntransition to take place in the medium-term. As part\nof succession planning, the Board continues to\noversee management's development of several\nOperating Committee members who are well-known to\nshareholders as strong potential candidates to\nsucceed Mr. Dimon. Individual OC members have been\nprovided with opportunities to gain exposure to\ndifferent parts of the business and to deepen their\nleadership experience in new and expanded roles. In\nJanuary 2024, the Firm announced leadership changes\nand a streamlined business to continue to position\nthe Firm for the future.\n\nJennifer Piepszak and Troy Rohrbaugh were named Co-\nCEOs of the expanded Commercial & Investment Bank,\nand\n\nMarianne Lake became sole CEO of Consumer &\nCommunity Banking (\"CCB\"). Mary Erdoes remains CEO\nof Asset & Wealth Management (\"AWM\"), and Daniel\nPinto continues as President and Chief Operating\nOfficer. The Board believes that these senior\nmanagement changes and new alignment will help the\nFirm better serve its clients as well as further\ndevelop the Firm's most senior leaders. Should the\nneed arise in the near-term, the Board views Mr.\nPinto as a key executive who is immediately ready to\nlead the Firm and fulfill the responsibilities of\nCEO, as his exceptional leadership capabilities are\nwell-known to our shareholders.\n\nThe CMDC also periodically reviews the succession\nplan for members of the OC other than the CEO to\nbuild a robust talent pipeline for specific critical\nroles. The Board has numerous opportunities to meet\nwith, and assess development plans for, members of\nthe OC and other high- potential senior management\nleaders. This occurs through various means,\nincluding informal meetings, presentations to the\nBoard and its committees, and Board dinners.

The Firm\u2019s annual Comprehensive\nCapital Analysis and Review (\u201cCCAR\u201d) submission,\nwhich contains the Firm\u2019s proposed plans to make\ncapital distributions, such as dividend payments,\nstock repurchases and other capital actions, is\nreviewed and approved prior to its submission to the\nFederal Reserve. In addition, the Audit Committee\nassists the Board in the oversight of the Firm\u2019s\nfinancial statements and internal control framework.\nThe Audit Committee also assists the Board in the\nappointment, retention, compensation, evaluation and\noversight of the Firm\u2019s independent registered\npublic accounting firm.

When the Firm extends a\nconsumer or wholesale loan, advises customers and\nclients on their investment decisions, makes markets\nin securities, or offers other products or services,\nthe Firm takes on some degree of risk.

The Board of Directors oversees\nmanagement\u2019s strategic decisions, and the Board Risk\nCommittee oversees Independent Risk Management\n(\u201cIRM\u201d) and the Firm\u2019s risk governance framework.\nCybersecurity risk is overseen by the full Board,\nwith additional oversight of the relevant risk\nframework and controls provided by the Audit and\nRisk Committees. Board committees support the\nBoard\u2019s oversight responsibility by overseeing the\nrisk categories related to such committee\u2019s specific\narea of focus.\n\nCommittee chairs report significant matters\ndiscussed at committee meetings to the full Board.\nIssues escalated to the full Board may be dealt with\nin several ways, as appropriate, for example:\noversight of risk may remain with the particular\nprincipal standing committee of the Board, the Board\nmay establish or direct a Specific Purpose Committee\nto oversee such matters, or the Board may ask\nmanagement to present more frequently to the full\nBoard on the issue.\n\nEnvironmental, social and\ngovernance matters\n\nOversight of ESG-related matters is an important\npart of the Board's work in setting the policies and\nprinciples that govern our business, including:\n\n\u2022 the Firm\u2019s governance-related policies and\npractices;\n\n\u2022 our systems of risk management and controls;\n\n\u2022 our investment in our employees;\n\n\u2022 the manner in which we serve our customers and\nsupport our communities; and\n\n\u2022 how we advance sustainability in our business and\noperations.\n\nMuch of this work is done through the Board's\ncommittees. In particular, the PRC provides\noversight of the Firm\u2019s positions and practices on\npublic responsibility matters such as community\ninvestment, fair lending, consumer practices,\nsustainability and other public policy issues that\nreflect the Firm\u2019s values and character and impact\nits reputation among its stakeholders. Other Board\ncommittees consider ESG- related matters within\ntheir scope of responsibility. For instance, the\nCMDC oversees the Firm's culture, including\nreviewing employee DEI programs; the Risk Committee\nconsiders climate risk; the Governance Committee\nreviews board diversity and also considers ESG-\nrelated matters raised by shareholders; and the\nAudit Committee provides oversight of compliance\nwith the Firm's ethical standards, policies, and\nprocedures, and with laws and regulations. In the\npast year, Board and committee discussion topics\nincluded, among others, sustainability, DEI, Racial\nEquity Commitment, climate risk management, and\nreputational risks associated with ESG- related\nmatters.\n\nThe Firm is committed to being transparent about our\napproach to and performance on ESG topics. We\npublish an annual ESG Report, which provides\ninformation on how we are addressing the ESG-related\nmatters that we and our stakeholders view as\nimportant to our business. In 2023, we also\npublished a Climate Report, which included extensive\ndisclosure about the Firm's approach to climate-\nrelated risks, opportunities and targets. We monitor\nthe evolving disclosure landscape and evaluate which\nframeworks address our stakeholders' interest. In\n2023, our ESG disclosures were informed by the\nGlobal Reporting Initiative, Sustainability\nAccounting Standards Board and the Task Force on\nClimate- related Financial Disclosures.

\nEmployees\n\nThe Board is committed to maintaining a strong\ncorporate governance culture that instills and\nenhances a sense of personal accountability on the\npart of all of the Firm\u2019s employees.\n\nIn addition to discussions at Board meetings with\nsenior management about these efforts, our directors\nparticipate in events outside of the boardroom\nincluding meetings with employees that emphasize\nthis commitment. These meetings include employee\ntown halls, LOB and leadership team events such as\nour annual senior leaders\u2019 meetings and informal\nsessions with members of the OC and other senior\nleaders. In 2023, members of our Board participated\nin Regional Director dinners, Firmwide senior\nleadership events, LOB industry events and Business\nResource Groups' (\"BRGs\") events.\n\nRegulators\n\nOur Board and senior leaders regularly meet with\nregulators. These interactions help us learn first-\nhand from regulators about matters of importance to\nthem and their expectations of us. They also provide\na forum for the Board and management to keep our\nregulators well-informed about the Firm\u2019s\nperformance and business practices.\n\nStakeholders\n\nAs we strive to deliver value, management engages\nwith our stakeholders, including our customers,\nsuppliers and communities in which we work, on a\nrange of issues and in a variety of ways. These may\ninclude, for example, participation in consumer\nadvisory panels and meetings with policy advocacy\ngroups and nonprofit organizations. We actively seek\nfeedback on key topics to help us better understand\nwhat is important to our stakeholders and find ways\nto deliver value while also navigating financial,\nlegal and regulatory considerations. In recent\nyears, we have engaged in extensive stakeholder\noutreach pertaining to, among other topics,\nsustainability and DEI.\n\nManagement shares feedback from these relationships\nand engagements with the Board, providing the Board\nwith valuable insights. Board members also\nparticipate in engagements with stakeholders through\nclient events, town halls, industry conferences, and\nshareholder discussions as appropriate.\n                                                                                                            \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.282024 PROXY STATEMENT                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                               \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE |DIRECTOR COMPENSATION  \n                                               \nDirector compensation\n\nThe Governance Committee is responsible for\nreviewing director compensation and making\nrecommendations to the Board. In making its\nrecommendations, the Governance Committee annually\nreviews the Board\u2019s responsibilities and the\ncompensation practices of peer firms, which include\nthe primary financial services peer group referenced\nwith respect to the compensation of our NEOs. For\nmore information see \u201cEvaluating market practices\u201d\non page 42. The Board believes a best practice is to\nlink director compensation to the Firm\u2019s\nperformance; therefore, a significant portion of\ndirector compensation is paid in common stock.\nAnnual compensation For 2023, each non-employee\ndirector was entitled to receive an annual cash\nretainer of up to $100,000 and, if the non- employee\ndirector was on the Board at the time when annual\nperformance year equity awards were granted, an\nannual grant of deferred stock units valued at\n$250,000. Pursuant to discretion authorized under\nthe Firm's Long-Term Incentive Plan approved by\nshareholders at the 2021 Annual Meeting (the \"2021\nPlan\"), the Governance Committee recommended, and\nthe Board approved, an increase to director\ncompensation to maintain competitive compensation\nrelative to peers. Effective January 1, 2024, the\ndirectors' annual cash retainer was increased from\n$100,000 to $110,000 and the annual grant of\ndeferred stock units was increased from $250,000 to\n$265,000. In addition, the retainer for the Lead\nIndependent Director increased from $30,000 to\n$35,000; retainers for the Chairs of the Bank Board\nand the Audit and Risk Committees increased from\n$25,000 to $30,000; retainers for members of the\nBank Board and members of the Audit and Risk\nCommittees increased from $15,000 to $20,000; and\nretainers for the Chairs of our other principal\nstanding committees increased from $15,000 to\n$20,000. This is the first increase to the\ndirectors' annual retainer since 2017 and other\nrole-based retainers since 2013. Compensation paid\nduring 2023, including additional cash compensation\npaid for certain committee and other service, is\ndescribed in the following tables.\n\nEach deferred stock unit included in the annual\ngrant to directors represents the right to receive\none share of the Firm\u2019s common stock and dividend\nequivalents payable in deferred stock units for any\ndividends paid. Deferred stock units have no voting\nrights. In January of the year immediately following\na director\u2019s retirement from the Board, deferred\nstock units are distributed in shares of the Firm\u2019s\ncommon stock in either a lump sum or in annual\ninstallments for up to 15 years as elected by the\ndirector. The following table summarizes the 2023\nannual compensation for non-employee directors for\nservice on the Boards of the Firm, the Bank and J.P.\nMorgan Securities plc (\"JPMS plc\").

They must also provide us with copies of\nthese reports. These reports are required by Section\n16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We\nhave reviewed the copies of the reports that we have\nreceived and written representations from the\nindividuals required to file the reports. Based on\nthis review, we believe that during 2023 each of our\ndirectors and executive officers has complied with\napplicable reporting requirements for transactions\nin our equity securities. One late filing was made\nin April 2024 to report one transaction involving a\ngift of 222 shares in 2019 to a trust controlled by\nStephen B.

The transactions covered by\n\nthe Related Persons Policy include any financial\ntransaction, arrangement or relationship in which\nthe Firm is a participant, and the related person\nhas or will have a direct or indirect material\ninterest.\n\nAfter becoming aware of any transaction which may be\nsubject to the Related Persons Policy, the director\nor executive officer involved in such transaction is\nrequired to report all relevant facts with respect\nto the transaction to the General Counsel of the\nFirm. Upon determination by the General Counsel that\na transaction requires review under the Related\nPersons Policy, the material facts of the\ntransaction and the related person\u2019s interest in the\ntransaction are provided to the Governance\nCommittee. The transaction is then reviewed by the\ndisinterested members of the Governance Committee,\nwho determine whether approval or ratification of\nthe transaction shall be granted. In reviewing a\ntransaction, the Governance Committee considers\nfacts and circumstances that it deems relevant to\nits determination, such as: management\u2019s assessment\nof the commercial reasonableness of the transaction;\nthe materiality of the related person\u2019s direct or\nindirect interest in the transaction; whether the\ntransaction may involve an actual, or the appearance\nof, a conflict of interest; and, if the transaction\ninvolves a director, the impact of the transaction\non the director\u2019s independence.\n\nCertain types of transactions are pre-approved in\naccordance with the terms of the Related Persons\nPolicy. These include transactions in the ordinary\ncourse of business involving financial products and\nservices provided by, or to, the Firm, including\nloans, provided such transactions are in compliance\nwith the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Federal Reserve\nBoard Regulation O and other applicable laws and\nregulations.\n\nTransactions with directors, executive officers and\n5% shareholders\n\nOur directors and executive officers, and some of\ntheir immediate family members and affiliated\nentities, and BlackRock, Inc. and affiliated\nentities (\"BlackRock\") and The Vanguard Group and\naffiliated entities (\"Vanguard\"), beneficial owners\nof more than 5% of our outstanding common stock,\nwere customers of, or had transactions with or\ninvolving, JPMorgan Chase or our banking or other\nsubsidiaries in the ordinary course of business\nduring 2023.

The Firm\u2019s compensation programs play a significant role in our ability to\nattract, retain and properly motivate the highest quality workforce.\n\n2023 Performance and Annual Compensation Determination for the CEO\n\nIn assessing Mr. Dimon's performance in the context of the Firm's 2023 business results, the CMDC recognized\nthe Firm's continued focus on serving our clients and customers around the world amid ongoing, growing\ngeopolitical tensions, economic uncertainty, elevated inflation and higher rates, while investing in and\nexecuting on long-term strategic initiatives. The Firm experienced growth across all of our market-leading\nlines of business, achieved record financial results and maintained a fortress balance sheet.\n\nThe CMDC recognized that the Firm achieved managed revenue 1 of $162.4 billion, which was a record for the\nsixth consecutive year, as well as record net income of $49.6 billion, or $16.23 per share, with ROTCE 1 of\n21%. The Firm increased its quarterly common dividend from $1.00 to $1.05 per share. In addition, the Firm\nsuccessfully navigated and supported our clients and customers through the regional bank turmoil, and\ncompleted our acquisition of First Republic Bank.\n\nThe Board continues to recognize that the Firm is in a uniquely fortunate position to be led by such a\nhighly talented and experienced executive in Mr. Dimon, and in determining annual compensation for 2023,\nconsidered his holistic performance across financial and non-financial performance dimensions, including his\ncontinued exemplary leadership of the Firm. In light of the continued absolute and relative strength of the\nFirm\u2019s performance, the Board determined Mr. Dimon's annual pay of $36 million.\n\nSuccession Planning and Recent Leadership Changes\n\nOne of the Board\u2019s top priorities is succession planning for Mr. Dimon, which is focused on enabling an\norderly CEO transition to take place in the medium-term. As part of succession planning, the Board continues\nto oversee management's development of several Operating Committee members who are well-known to\nshareholders as strong potential candidates to succeed Mr. Dimon. Individual OC members have been provided\nwith opportunities to gain exposure to different parts of the business and to deepen their leadership\nexperience in new and expanded roles. In January 2024, the Firm announced leadership and organizational\nchanges. Jennifer Piepszak and Troy Rohrbaugh were named Co-CEOs of the expanded Commercial & Investment\nBank, and Marianne Lake became sole CEO of Consumer & Community Banking. Mary Erdoes remains CEO of Asset &\nWealth Management, and Daniel Pinto continues as President and Chief Operating Officer. Should the need\narise in the near-term, the Board views Mr. Pinto as a key executive who is immediately ready to lead the\nFirm and fulfill the responsibilities of CEO, as his exceptional leadership capabilities are well-known to\nour shareholders.\n\nShareholder Engagement\n\nWe highly value engaging with our shareholders and have a demonstrable history of being responsive to their\nfeedback. We engage extensively each year, and shareholder feedback continues to inform our Board and CMDC\nin their decisions. We received strong support for the 2023 Say on Pay proposal, and shareholders expressed\ntheir continued deep support for the management team, the Firm\u2019s strategy, long-term performance and pay-\nfor-performance compensation program and practices.\n\nIn the discussion that follows, we review the philosophy, key features and process of our executive\ncompensation program as well as how our Board and CMDC make pay decisions.

The performance assessment process starts with\nstrategic plans, budgets and priorities being established at those same levels, with the Board and CMDC\nengaging in regular discussions with the CEO and the Head of Human Resources (\"HR\") about individual OC\nmembers\u2019 performance throughout the year, as appropriate.\n\nThis approach (rather than determining pay levels during a single year-end process) enables the CMDC to make\nbalanced and informed OC member pay decisions that are aligned with long-term performance against four broad\ndimensions, which consider short-, medium- and long-term priorities that drive sustained shareholder value.\n\nBALANCED AND HOLISTIC APPROACH FOR ASSESSING PERFORMANCE\n\nIn determining OC compensation, the CMDC considers both what progress has been made against long-term\nstrategic priorities, and how that progress has been achieved. For example, consistently strong revenue, net\nincome and ROTCE performance over the long-term are more important than any short-term fluctuations in\nbusiness results.\n\nThe CMDC applies an approximately 50% weighting to its consideration of absolute and relative business\nresults against the Firm's strategic priorities over multiple years, i.e., \"the what,\" and an approximately\n50% weighting to its qualitative consideration of risk, controls & conduct, customer/client/stakeholder and\nteamwork & leadership, i.e., \"the how.\"\n\nNo single performance dimension in isolation determines total compensation; however, it is possible for a\nsingle significant shortcoming in any performance dimension to have a downward impact on variable\ncompensation without limitation. The CMDC has historically exercised this kind of downward discretion by\nmaking significant reductions to OC member compensation related to risk & control matters \u2014 and it will\ncontinue to do so in the future if appropriate. For example, in the past, the CMDC reduced Mr. Dimon's pay\nby 50% due to the \"London Whale\" trading incident despite the Firm achieving record earnings that year.\n\nThis assessment of performance, illustrated in the chart below, includes considerations of ESG-related\nfactors that comprise responsible leadership, thoughtful governance and sustainability where applicable:\n

PRACTICES\n\nIn order to effectively attract, properly motivate\nand retain our senior executives, the CMDC\nperiodically reviews market data relating to pay\nlevels, pay mix and pay practices.\n\nIn evaluating market data for OC members, the CMDC\nbenchmarks against our primary financial services\npeer group, which consists of large financial\nservices companies with which the Firm directly\ncompetes for both talent and business. The following\ncompanies comprise our primary financial services\npeer group, which remains unchanged from last year:\n\n\u2022 American Express\n\n\u2022 Bank of America\n\n\u2022 Citigroup\n\n\u2022 Goldman Sachs\n\n\u2022 Morgan Stanley\n\n\u2022 Wells Fargo\n\nGiven the diversity of the Firm\u2019s businesses, the\nCMDC may also periodically reference the pay plans\nand practices of other financial services companies\nas well as leading large, global firms across\nmultiple industries. The CMDC considers the size,\npresence, brand and reputation of the companies, and\nthe nature and mix of their businesses in using this\ndata. These companies include some or all of the\nfollowing: 3M, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, AT&T,\nBarclays, BlackRock, BNY Mellon, Boeing, Capital One\nFinancial, Chevron, Coca-Cola, Comcast, CVS Health,\nDeutsche Bank, ExxonMobil, General Electric, HSBC,\nIBM, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Meta, Microsoft,\nOracle, PayPal, PepsiCo, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble,\nRaytheon, UBS, Verizon, Walmart and Walt Disney.\nAlthough these reference companies are not part of\nour primary financial services peer group, we\nbelieve that their practices can provide a relevant\npoint of reference for maintaining a competitive\ntalent and compensation program.\n\nDISCIPLINED PROCESS TO DETERMINE TOTAL COMPENSATION\n\nPay level\n\nIn determining total compensation levels for\nindividual OC members, the CMDC evaluates various\npay scenarios in light of the following\nconsiderations to inform their judgment:\n\n\u2022 Performance, based on the four broad assessment\ndimensions and discussed on pages 50- 54\n\n\u2022 Value of the position to the organization and\nshareholders over time (i.e., \u201cvalue of seat\u201d)\n\n\u2022 The example they set for others by acting with\nintegrity and strengthening the Firm\u2019s culture,\nPurpose and Values\n\n\u2022 External talent market (i.e., market data)\n\nWhile market data provides the CMDC with useful\ninformation regarding our competitors, the CMDC does\nnot target specific positioning (e.g., 50 th\npercentile), nor does it use a formulaic approach in\ndetermining competitive pay levels. Instead, the\nCMDC uses a range of data as a reference, which is\nconsidered in the context of each executive\u2019s\nperformance over a multi-year period, and the CMDC\u2019s\nassessment of the value the individual delivers to\nthe Firm.\n\nPay mix\n\nOnce the CMDC determines OC members\u2019 total incentive\ncompensation, it then establishes the appropriate\npay mix between an annual cash award and long-term\nequity, including PSUs and RSUs.\n\nFor U.S. OC members other than the current CEO and\nPresident & COO, the CMDC continued to apply the\nFirm\u2019s standard cash/equity incentive mix formula to\neach of their 2023 incentive compensation awards.\nPer the Firm\u2019s formula, the OC members were awarded\n60% of their incentive compensation in long-term\nequity (30% in PSUs and 30% in RSUs), with the\nremaining 40% paid in cash 1 . The CMDC determined\nthat a 50%/50% mix of time-based RSUs and at-risk\nPSUs continues to provide an appropriate balance to\ntheir equity exposure.\n\nThe CMDC believes that this significant weighting of\npay mix to equity is aligned with the interests of\nshareholders by encouraging OC members to focus on\nthe long-term success of the Firm while mitigating\nexcessive risk-taking, and provides a competitive\nannual cash incentive opportunity.\n\nMessrs. Dimon and Pinto's annual cash incentive\nawards are subject to a cap of 25% of their\nrespective total compensation, with PSUs comprising\n100% of the equity portion of their incentive\ncompensation. The CMDC determined to not award the\nmaximum amount allowed by their respective caps in\n2023, but to maintain a lower cash award of $5\nmillion each for both Messrs. Dimon and Pinto.\n\n1 The CMDC has established a different pay mix for\nOC members in the U.K. due to local regulations for\nIdentified Staff.\n                                                                                                            \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.422024 PROXY STATEMENT                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                                   \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION |COMPENSATION DISCUSSION  \n  AND ANALYSIS                                     \n                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n  Overview    How we think about pay          How we performed against our    How performance determined    \n              decisions                       business strategy               pay in 2023                   \n                                                                                                            \nSummary of pay elements\n\nOur compensation program provides for an appropriate mix between base salary, cash and equity incentives\nthat vest over time.

Following its review of pay mix in 2023, the CMDC considered that OC member salaries\ncontinue to be generally lower than our peers, and that increasing OC salaries would be appropriate based on\ntheir current market position.\n\nIn 2024, the CMDC approved salary increases for U.S.-based OC members, excluding Messrs. Dimon and Pinto, of\n$250,000, from $750,000 to $1,000,000, effective January 1, 2024. It considered that the new salary would\ncontinue to reflect our compensation philosophy of providing competitive compensation for top talent, and\nresult in an appropriate pay mix, with the majority of compensation continuing to be delivered through\nvariable compensation in the form of cash and equity. This increase is related to how the CMDC considers pay\nmix decisions, and total compensation will not be impacted for the forthcoming year as the CMDC will perform\nits balanced and holistic review of performance to determine total compensation.\n                                                                                                            \n  2024 PROXY STATEMENT43JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                                   \n  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS| EXECUTIVE  \n  COMPENSATION                                     \n                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n  Overview    How we think about pay          How we performed against our    How performance determined    \n              decisions                       business strategy               pay in 2023                   \n                                                                                                            \nPerformance share unit program\n\nAs part of the design of the PSU program, the ultimate number of PSUs paid out at vesting is determined by a\npre-established formula set at the time of the award based on the Firm\u2019s absolute and relative ROTCE\nperformance over the subsequent three years, with the value of the payout ranging from 0% to 150% and\nsubject to risk and control features. The value upon vesting of PSUs is also directly tied to the Firm\u2019s\nperformance through its stock price, similar to RSUs. The CMDC believes that the PSU design continues to\nappropriately incentivize strong performance by our OC members, does not encourage excessive risk-taking and\nis aligned with long-term shareholder interests. Since PSUs were first introduced in 2015, we have received\npositive shareholder support for this aspect of our executive compensation program.\n\nUPDATES TO THE PSU PROGRAM\n\nThe CMDC reviews and approves the key features of the PSU program each year. For the 2023 PSU awards granted\nin January 2024, the CMDC maintained the key structure of the design, with select updates to address\nexternal factors and enhance the rigor of the PSU program.\n\n\u2022 PSU Peers: In 2023, Credit Suisse (a PSU peer company) was acquired by UBS (also a PSU peer company). In\nresponse, the CMDC reviewed several potential peer alternatives for both new and outstanding awards, and\napproved removing Credit Suisse without a replacement, which results in 10 companies used for evaluating\nrelative performance. The current PSU Peers continue to reflect large financial services companies with at\nleast 30% of JPMorgan Chase's revenue mix.\n\n\u2022 PSU relative Payout Scale: In conjunction with the removal of Credit Suisse, the CMDC approved an updated\nrelative Payout Scale, where rank #11 payout is now 0% (compared to 40% previously).\n\n\u2022 Common equity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d) capital ratio 1 hurdle : Given increased capital requirements since the\nintroduction of this risk- based hurdle in 2017, the CMDC approved increasing the hurdle by 50 basis points,\nfrom 7.5% to 8%.\n\nThe above program updates are applicable to PSU awards granted in January 2024, and the PSU Peers and\nrelative Payout Scale updates also apply to outstanding awards granted in January 2021, 2022, and 2023, to\nmaintain the intended rigor and economics of the awards.

Due to local U.K. regulations,  \n                                 PSUs are subject to an extended seven-year vesting period commencing       \n                                 ratably on the third anniversary of the grant for OC members in the U.K.   \n                                 \u2022The CMDC selected ROTCE, a comprehensive performance metric that          \n                                 measures the Firm\u2019s net income applicable to common equity as a            \n  Performance Measure            percentage of average tangible common equity. ROTCE is used by the Firm,   \n                                 as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the earnings power of      \n                                 common shareholders\u2019 equity capital and is a useful metric for comparing   \n                                 the profitability of the Firm with that of competitors.                    \n                                 \u2022Payout under the PSU plan is calculated at the end of the three-year      \n                                 performance period based on absolute and relative average ROTCE1, per the  \n                                 payout scale below. The use of both absolute and relative ROTCE helps      \n  Payout Scale                   promote a reasonable outcome for both shareholders and participants. For   \n                                 the 2023 PSU award, the CMDC set the absolute ROTCE thresholds as          \n                                 follows: (1) maximum payout at 18% or greater; and (2) zero payout at      \n                                 less than 6%.                                                              \n                                 \u2022In determining companies to include in the relative ROTCE scale, the      \n                                 CMDC selected competitors with business activities that overlap with at    \n                                 least 30% of the Firm\u2019s revenue mix.

To meet this objective, OC members are\nsubject to a stock ownership guideline and retention\npolicy. While on the Operating Committee, each\nmember is required to accumulate either: \u2022 A minimum\nof between 200,000 and 400,000 shares (1 million\nshares for the CEO); or \u2022 A minimum fixed dollar\nvalue of shares of between $10 million and $30\nmillion ($75 million for the CEO). \u2022 In 2023, this\nrepresented 13x to 40x of OC member base salary, or\n50x for the CEO Shares credited for purposes of\nsatisfying the above ownership levels include shares\nowned outright, as well as 50% of unvested RSUs and\nPSUs, but do not include stock appreciation rights\n(\"SARs\") or stock options. The stock ownership\nguideline must be met within six years of the later\nof the effective date of the policy or appointment\nto the Operating Committee. If the stock ownership\nguidelines are subsequently increased, the higher\nownership guideline must be satisfied within six\nyears of such revision, unless otherwise determined\nby the CEO and CMDC. Prior to reaching their\ndesignated share ownership guideline, OC members are\nrequired to retain 75% of all net shares received\nfrom equity awards granted after they join the\nOperating Committee. Once they have met their\nownership guideline, the policy requires OC members\nto continue retaining 50% of all net shares received\nfrom awards (75% for the CEO) as summarized below:\n                                                                                                            \n  Retention Requirement                                                                                     \n  Before Guideline Met                After Guideline Met                                                   \n  75% of net shares until             50% of net shares for theduration of their service\u00a0on\u00a0theOperating    \n  stock ownership guideline is met    Committee(75% for the CEO)                                            \n                                                                                                            \nBecause OC members are required to continue accumulating shares even after having met their share ownership\nguideline, the resulting increase of share ownership over time further strengthens the alignment of their\ninterests with those of our shareholders. Notably, since he became CEO, Mr. Dimon has acquired a substantial\namount of stock through compensation and purchases on the open market. ANTI-HEDGING/ANTI-PLEDGING PROVISIONS\nAll employees are prohibited from hedging or pledging unvested RSUs and PSUs, and unexercised stock\nappreciation rights or stock options. In addition:\n\n\u2022 Shares owned outright or through deferred compensation by an OC member may not be hedged \u2022 Shares held\ndirectly by an OC or Board member 1 may not be held in margin accounts or otherwise pledged INTEGRATING RISK\nWITH COMPENSATION The CMDC holds an annual joint session with the Risk Committee to review Firmwide HR and\ncompensation practices, including: \u2022 How we integrate risk, controls and conduct considerations into key HR\npractices including performance development, compensation and promotion \u2022 Compensation features and elements\ndesigned to discourage imprudent risk-taking (e.g., multi-year vesting, clawbacks, prohibition on hedging,\netc.) \u2022 Annual incentive pool processes for LOBs and functions \u2022 Regulatory updates which have impacted or\nmay impact HR practices in the future The committees are also provided with information on our performance\ndevelopment process, a summary of risk, controls and conduct feedback, and updates regarding HR Control\nForum issues. STRONG ACCOUNTABILITY AND RECOVERY PROVISIONS Our executive compensation program is designed\nto hold executives accountable, when appropriate, for meaningful actions or issues that negatively impact\nbusiness performance or the Firm\u2019s reputation in current or future years. Issues that may warrant recovery\ndeterminations can be raised at any time, including in HR Control Forums, annual assessments of employee\nperformance and when Designated Employees resign or their employment is terminated by the Firm. Under the\nFirm\u2019s process to govern these determinations: \u2022 We have established a process for reviewing compensation or\nother employee actions following a determination that the cause and materiality of a risk-related loss,\nissue or other set of facts and circumstances warrants such a review of accountability for actual or\npotential misconduct. \u2022 The CMDC is responsible for determinations involving OC members (determinations\ninvolving the CEO are subject to ratification by independent members of the Board). The Firm has a framework\nthat identifies and assesses employee risk and drives consistent management decisions and discipline. For\nmore material risk and control issues, the HR Control Forum process described on the following page explains\nhow issues are reviewed and impacts are recommended.\n\n1 For information on the hedging/pledging restrictions applicable to our directors, please see \u201cDirector\ncompensation\u201d on pages 29and 30.\n                                                                                                            \n  2024 PROXY STATEMENT47JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                                   \n  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS| EXECUTIVE  \n  COMPENSATION                                     \n                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n  Overview    How we think about pay          How we performed against our    How performance determined    \n              decisions                       business strategy               pay in 2023                   \n                                                                                                            \nHOLDING INDIVIDUALS ACCOUNTABLE\n\nTo hold individuals responsible for taking risks\ninconsistent with the Firm\u2019s risk appetite and to\ndiscourage future imprudent behavior, the Firm has\npolicies and procedures that enable it to take\ntimely and proportionate actions with respect to\naccountable individuals, including:\n\nI.

The Firm has a framework in place that provides for recommended impacts to drive consistency.\nHowever, the precise actions we take with respect to accountable individuals, which may also include\ncoaching and training in addition to the above, are based on the relevant circumstances, including the\nnature of their involvement, the magnitude of the event and the impact on the Firm. CLAWBACK DISCLOSURE\nDuring 2023, we did not take any action to recover or clawback any incentive compensation from the OC\nmembers or Firmwide Controller.\n\nRISK, CONTROLS & CONDUCT REVIEW

We have implemented\na disciplined executive talent management and succession planning process that includes LOBs and Functions\nholding talent review discussions within their management teams and identifying potential successors for key\nleadership roles.\n\nOne of the Board\u2019s top priorities is succession planning for Mr. Dimon, which entails enabling an orderly\nCEO transition to take place in the medium-term. As part of succession planning, the Board continues to\noversee management's development of several Operating Committee members who are well-known to shareholders\nas strong potential candidates to succeed Mr. Dimon. As noted on page 35of the CD&A, in January 2024, the\nFirm announced leadership and organizational changes.\n\nThe Board has well-developed processes in place to support proper governance. This includes the CMDC\nreviewing the succession plan for the CEO, and the Lead Independent Director regularly leading succession\ndiscussions with the non-executive directors of the Board. The CMDC also reviews the succession plan for\nmembers of the Operating Committee other than the CEO, which is also discussed by the full Board of\nDirectors. This is in addition to Board discussions of talent management, which occur frequently throughout\nthe year.\n\nDIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION\n\nHaving an inclusive workforce that is reflective of diverse backgrounds and perspectives is important to the\nwork we do.

We are focused on being an\nemployer of choice for all talent, where employees feel like they belong.\n\nAn important part of our efforts include the Firm's Business Resource Groups (\"BRGs\"), which serve as\nnetworks for employees to connect with colleagues and grow professionally, while advancing the Firm's DEI\nstrategies.

Actual amounts of PSUs received by NEOs upon vesting may range from 0%\nto 150% of the target shares (excluding accrued dividends), depending upon the Firm\u2019s performance.\n\n2 In 2021, the Board and CMDC granted one-time special awards of SARs to Messrs. Dimon and Pinto, which are\nnot reflected in the table above because they were not part of regular annual compensation. Refer to the\nSummary Compensation Table on page 63for further information.\n\n3 Mr. Pinto's 2022 and 2023 salary of $1,500,000 includes a fee of \u00a3100,000 and \u00a396,164 respectively for his\nservice on the J.P. Morgan Securities plc Board. In 2021, he received a salary of \u00a3475,000 and a fixed\nallowance paid in British pound sterling of $8,400,000, in accordance with local regulations.\n\n4 Ms. Erdoes's 2021 incentive compensation included a significant reduction related to internal, SEC and\nCFTC investigations into the Firm's compliance with certain record preservation requirements.\n\n5 Ms. Lake was not a NEO in 2021.\n\n6 Ms. Piepszak was included as a NEO in the 2021 Proxy Statement due to her role as CFO. She is voluntarily\ndisclosed as a NEO in this year's Proxy Statement due to her role as Co- CEO of CCB, which she shared with\nMs. Lake in 2022 and 2023.\n\nINTERPRETING 2023 NEO COMPENSATION\n\nThe table above is presented to show how the CMDC and Board viewed compensation awarded for 2023\nperformance. It differs from how compensation is reported in the \u201cSummary Compensation Table\u201d (\u201cSCT\u201d) on\npage 63, which is required by the SEC, and is not intended as a substitute for the SCT. There are two\nprincipal differences between the SCT and the table above:\n\n1. The Firm grants both cash and equity incentive compensation after a performance year is completed. In\nboth the table above and the SCT, cash incentive compensation paid in 2024 for 2023 performance is shown as\n2023 compensation. In the table above, the equity awards (RSUs and PSUs) granted in 2024 for 2023\nperformance are shown as 2023 compensation. In contrast, the SCT reports the value of equity awards in the\nyear in which they are granted. As a result, awards granted in 2023 for 2022 performance are shown in the\nSCT as 2023 compensation.\n\n2. The SCT reports the change in pension value and nonqualified deferred compensation and all other\ncompensation. These amounts are not shown in the table above.\n                                                                                                            \n  2024 PROXY STATEMENT55JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                                   \n  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS| EXECUTIVE  \n  COMPENSATION                                     \n                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n  Overview    How we think about pay          How we performed against our    How performance determined    \n              decisions                       business strategy               pay in 2023                   \n                                                                                                            \n2023 CEO annual compensation is aligned with multi-year performance\n                                                                                                            \n  James Dimon                                                                                               \n  CHAIRMAN & CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER                                                                        \n  In determining Mr. Dimon\u2019s compensation, independent members of the Board considered his exemplary        \n  leadership and achievements across the Firm's four broad performance dimensions.

Dimon and Pinto were granted special option awards in the form of SARs that were not part\nof their regular annual compensation and will not be awarded on a recurring basis. The special options were\nawarded at the fair value on the respective grant dates of each award. The grant date fair value was\ndetermined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The assumptions at the time of grant, and the equivalent\nvalues as of December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, are reflected in the chart below:\n                                                                                                            \n                                                        Assumptio\u2026                                          \n                                                                      Expected     Expected      Remaining  \n                                  Award    JPM stock    Risk free     annual       common         expected  \n  Name         As of date        strike        price    interest      dividend     stock           life in  \n                                  price                 rate          yield        price             years  \n                                                                                   volatility               \n  James        7/20/2021        $148.73      $148.73    1.23%         2.69%        27.49%               10  \n  Dimon                                                                                                     \n               12/31/2021       $148.73      $158.63    1.52%         2.58%        26.23%               10  \n               12/31/2022       $148.73      $133.39    3.88%         3.07%        29.02%                9  \n               12/31/2023       $148.73      $170.16    3.88%         2.53%        24.51%                8  \n  Daniel       12/14/2021       $159.10      $159.10    1.44%         2.51%        25.76%               10  \n  Pinto                                                                                                     \n               12/31/2021       $159.10      $158.63    1.52%         2.54%        25.88%               10  \n               12/31/2022       $159.10      $133.39    3.88%         3.01%        28.53%                9  \n               12/31/2023       $159.10      $170.16    3.88%         2.48%        24.09%                8  \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm\u2019s accounting for employee stock-based incentives (including assumptions used to value employee\nstock options and SARs) is described in Note 9 to the Firm\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023\nAnnual Report on pages 225 - 226.\n\n5 Amounts for years 2023, 2022, and 2021 are the aggregate change in the actuarial present value of the\naccumulated benefits under all defined benefit pension plans (including supplemental plans). No NEOs had\nearnings in excess of 120% of the applicable federal rate on deferred compensation balances where the rate\nof return is not calculated in the same or in a similar manner as earnings on hypothetical investments under\nthe Firm's qualified plans. The amount of earnings in excess of 120% of the applicable federal rate included\nin this column is $0 for each of 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n6 \u201cAll other compensation\u201d includes the cost, if any, for a NEO\u2019s spouse to attend business-related events\nwhere spousal attendance is expected or customary; and the cost, if any, for assistance with certain travel\narrangements. This did not exceed the greater of $25,000 or 10% of the NEO\u2019s total perquisites and personal\nbenefits except as specifically noted in the footnotes that follow.\n\n7 The \u201cAll other compensation\u201d amount for Mr. Dimon includes: $5,000 in employer non-matching contributions\nto the U.S. defined contribution plan; $362,226 for personal use of corporate aircraft; $30,400 for personal\nuse of corporate cars; and $150,645 for the cost of residential, personal travel, and related security paid\nby the Firm, including one-time\n                                                                                                            \n  2024 PROXY STATEMENT63JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                            \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES| EXECUTIVE  \n  COMPENSATION                              \n                                            \nexpenditures related to system installations and upgrades. Mr. Dimon\u2019s personal use of corporate aircraft\nand cars, and certain related security, is required pursuant to security measures approved by the Board. We\nconsider such security measures necessary, and not a personal benefit. Incremental costs are determined as\nfollows:\n\n\u25e6 Aircraft: operating cost per flight hour for the aircraft type used, developed by an independent reference\nsource, including fuel, fuel additives and lubricants; landing and parking fees; crew expenses; small\nsupplies and catering; maintenance, labor and parts; engine restoration costs; and a maintenance service\nplan.\n\n\u25e6 Cars: annual lease valuation of the cars; annual insurance premiums; fuel expense; annual maintenance;\nother miscellaneous expense; and annual drivers\u2019 compensation, including salary, overtime, benefits and\nbonus. The resulting total is allocated between personal and business use based on mileage.\n\n8 Mr. Pinto's 2023 and 2022 salary of $1,500,000 includes a fee of \u00a396,164 for 2023 and \u00a3100,000 for 2022\nfor his service on the J.P. Morgan Securities plc Board. Since Mr. Pinto was located in the U.K. prior to\n2022, the terms and composition of his compensation awarded prior to 2022 reflected the requirements of\nlocal regulations, including changes that came into effect in 2014 and 2021 to comply with the Capital\nRequirements Directive IV and V respectively.\n\n9 The \u201cAll other compensation\u201d amount for Mr. Pinto includes $3,000 in employer non-matching contributions\nto the U.S. defined contribution plan; $67,586 in tax compliance assistance for business travel and\nrelocation at the Firm's request; and $26,451 for spousal travel related to business events.\n\n10 The \u201cAll other compensation\u201d amount for Ms. Erdoes includes $5,000 in employer non-matching contributions\nto the U.S. defined contribution plan.\n\n11 Ms. Lake was not a NEO in 2021.\n\n12 The \u201cAll other compensation\u201d amount for Ms. Lake includes $21,006 in employer contributions to a non-U.S.\ndefined contribution plan and $53,409 for tax settlement payments made on behalf of Ms. Lake in connection\nwith her international assignment at the Firm's request and consistent with the Firm's policy for employees\nworking on international assignments. The Firm's expatriate assignment policy provides that the Firm will be\nresponsible for any incremental U.S. and state income taxes due on home-country employer- provided benefits\nthat would not otherwise be taxable to the employee in their home country.\n\n13 The \u201cAll other compensation\u201d amount for Ms. Piepszak includes $5,000 in employer non-matching\ncontributions to the U.S. defined contribution plan.\n\n14 The \u201cAll other compensation\u201d amount for Mr. Barnum includes $5,000 in employer non-matching contributions\nto the U.S. defined contribution plan.\n\nII. 2023 GRANTS OF PLAN-BASED AWARDS 1\n\nThe following table shows grants of plan-based awards made in 2023.

On January 16, 2024, the\nFirm awarded RSU and PSU awards as part of 2023 annual incentive compensation. Because these awards were\ngranted in 2024, they do not appear in this table, which is required to include only equity awards actually\ngranted during 2023. These 2024 awards are however reflected in the \u201cNEO annual compensation table\" on page\n55.\n\n2 PSUs vest on March 25, 2026, and are subject to a two-year holding period post-vesting. Each PSU\nrepresents the right to receive one share of common stock on the vesting date. The ultimate number of PSUs\nthat will vest will be determined by the Firm\u2019s performance over the three-year performance period and will\ninclude any accumulated reinvested dividend equivalent shares. The dividend equivalent shares, if any, will\nbe based on: (1) the number of PSUs earned at vesting; and (2) on dividends that would have been paid on the\nFirm\u2019s common stock during the vesting period as of each dividend payment date, if any.\n\n3 RSUs vest in two equal installments on January 13, 2025 and 2026. Each RSU represents the right to receive\none share of common stock on the vesting date and non-preferential dividend equivalents, payable in cash,\nequal to any dividends paid on the Firm\u2019s common stock during the vesting period.\n\n4 The grant date fair value for RSUs and PSUs is based on the average of the high and the low prices of\nJPMorgan Chase common stock on the grant date multiplied by the number of units granted (for RSUs) or target\nnumber of PSUs.\n                                                                                                            \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.642024 PROXY STATEMENT                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                                  \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION |EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n  TABLES                                          \n                                                  \nIII.

The Plan was frozen with respect to pay credit\ncontributions, effective January 1, 2020, and frozen with respect to new entrants into the Plan, effective\nJanuary 1, 2019. Employees became fully vested in the value of their Plan benefits as a result of this\nchange. The years of service listed above are as of the freeze date. The Plan employed a cash balance\nformula (in the form of pay and interest credits) to determine amounts at retirement. Pay credits ceased\neffective with the plan freeze. Interest credits, which generally equal the yield on one-year U.S. Treasury\nbills plus 1% (subject to a minimum of 4.5%), continue to accrue. Account balances include the value of\nbenefits earned under prior heritage company plans, if any. Benefits are payable as an actuarially\nequivalent lifetime annuity with survivorship rights (if married) or optionally under a variety of other\npayment forms, including a single-sum distribution.\n\nExcess Retirement Plan \u2014 Benefits were determined under the same terms and conditions as the Retirement\nPlan, but reflecting base salary in excess of IRS limits up to $1 million and benefit amounts in excess of\nIRS limits. Benefits are generally payable in a lump sum in the year following termination. The plan is\nclosed to new participants and accruals under the plan were discontinued as of May 1, 2009.\n\nPresent value of accumulated benefits \u2014 The valuation method and all material assumptions used to calculate\nthe amounts above are consistent with those reflected in Note 8 to the Firm\u2019s Consolidated Financial\nStatements in the 2023 Form 10-K on pages 222- 224. Key assumptions include the discount rate (5.35%);\ninterest rates (interest crediting rates of 6.42% for 2024, 5.50% for 2025, and 5.00% thereafter, to project\ncash balances; 4.12% to convert annuities to lump sums and lump sums to annuities) and mortality rates (for\nthe present value of annuities, the Pri-2012 (white-collar) projected generational mortality table with\nprojection scale MP2021; for lump sums, the UP94 mortality table projected to 2002, with 50%/50% male/female\nweighting). We assumed benefits would commence at normal retirement date or unreduced retirement date, if\nearlier. Benefits paid from the Retirement Plan were assumed to be paid either as single-sum distributions\n(with probability of 85%) or life annuities (with probability of 15%). Benefits from the Excess Retirement\nPlan are paid as single-sum distributions. No death or other separation from service was assumed prior to\nretirement date.\n                                                                                                            \n  2024 PROXY STATEMENT67JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                            \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES| EXECUTIVE  \n  COMPENSATION                              \n                                            \nVI. 2023 NON-QUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION\n\nThe Deferred Compensation Plan allows eligible participants to defer their annual cash incentive\ncompensation awards on a before-tax basis up to a maximum of $1 million. A lifetime $10 million cap applies\nto deferrals of cash made after 2005. No deferral elections have been permitted relative to equity awards\nsince 2006. During 2023, there were no contributions made by the Firm nor contributions made or withdrawals\nor distributions received by the Named Executive Officers.\n                                                                                               \n                          Aggregate earnings                Aggregate                          \n                          (loss) in last                    balance at last                    \n  Name                    fiscal year ($)1                  fiscal year\u2013end ($)                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  James Dimon                                 $    8,268                         $    162,088  \n  Daniel Pinto                                       830                               26,448  \n  Mary Callahan Erdoes                                 \u2014                                    \u2014  \n  Marianne Lake                                        \u2014                                    \u2014  \n  Jennifer Piepszak                                   17                                  542  \n  Jeremy Barnum                                        \u2014                                    \u2014  \n                                                                                               \n1 The Deferred Compensation Plan allows participants to direct their deferrals among several investment\nchoices, including JPMorgan Chase common stock; an interest income fund based 50% on a weighted average of\nreturns by Hartford Investment Management Company SVA Bond Index Division and 50% by Newport Group\ndesignated set of general account life insurance policies owned by JPMorgan Chase; Hartford funds indexed to\nfixed income, bond, balanced, S&P 500, Russell 2000 and international portfolios; and Hartford investments\nin Vanguard Variable Insurance Fund high-yield bond, mid-cap and REIT index. In addition, there are balances\nin deemed investment choices from heritage company plans that are no longer open to new deferrals.\n\nInvestment returns in 2023 for the following investment choices were: Short-Term Fixed Income, 6.49%;\nInterest Income, 3.24%; Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, 5.57%; High-Yield, 11.51%; Balanced\nPortfolio, 15.58%; S&P 500 Index, 26.23%; Mid-Cap Index, 15.83%; Russell 2000 Index, 16.82%; REIT Index,\n11.70%; International, 14.65%; and JPMorgan Chase common stock, including dividend equivalents, 30.63%.\n\nBeginning with deferrals credited January 2005 under the Deferred Compensation Plan, participants were\nrequired to elect to receive distribution of the deferral balance beginning either following retirement or\ntermination or in a specific year but no earlier than the second anniversary of the date the deferral would\notherwise have been paid. If retirement or termination were elected, payments will commence during the\ncalendar year following retirement or termination. Participants may elect the distribution to be lump sum or\nannual installments for a maximum of 15 years. With respect to deferrals made after December 31, 2004, under\nthe Deferred Compensation Plan, account balances are automatically paid as a lump sum in the year following\ntermination if employment terminates prior to the participant attaining 15 years of service. With respect to\ndeferrals made after December 31, 2017, account balances are automatically paid as a lump sum in the year\nfollowing termination if employment terminates prior to the participant attaining 5 years of service.\n\nThe Supplemental Savings and Investment Plan (\u201cSSIP\u201d) is a heritage plan applicable to former Bank One\nemployees which is closed to new participants and does not permit new deferrals. It functions similarly to\nthe Deferred Compensation Plan. The investment return in 2023 for the following investment choice was:\nShort-Term Fixed Income, 5.38%. With respect to the SSIP, account balances are automatically paid as a lump\nsum in the year following termination unless an installment option is elected prior to termination of\nemployment.\n                                                                                                            \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.682024 PROXY STATEMENT                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                                  \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION |EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n  TABLES                                          \n                                                  \nVII. 2023 POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL\n\nWe believe our pay practices relating to termination events, summarized below, illustrate our commitment to\nsound corporate governance, are consistent with best practices and are aligned with the interests of\nshareholders.\n                                                                                                            \n   TERMINATION POLICIES ALIGNED WITH SHAREHOLDER INTERESTS                                                  \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  No golden parachute agreements    \u2022NEOs are not entitled to any accelerated cash/equity payments or       \n                                    special benefits upon a change in control                               \n                                    \u2022All of the U.S. based NEOs are \u201cat will\u201d employees and are not         \n  No employment agreements          covered by employment agreements                                        \n                                    \u2022Ms. Lake's terms of employment reflect applicable U.K. legal           \n                                    standards                                                               \n  No special cash severance         \u2022Severance amounts for NEOs are capped at one-year salary, not to       \n                                    exceed $400,000 (or \u00a3275,000 in the case of Ms. Lake)                   \n  No special executive benefits     \u2022NEOs are not entitled to any special benefits upon termination         \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Standard, broad-based severance                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \nMr. Dimon, Mr. Pinto, Ms. Erdoes, Ms. Piepszak and Mr. Barnum are covered under the Firm\u2019s broad-based U.S.\nSeverance Pay Plan. Benefits under the U.S. Severance Pay Plan are based on an employee\u2019s base salary and\nlength of service on termination of employment. Employees remain eligible for coverage at active employee\nrates under certain of the Firm\u2019s employee welfare plans (such as medical and dental) for up to six months\nafter their employment terminates. Ms. Lake is covered under the Firm\u2019s U.K. Discretionary Redundancy\nPolicy, which provides for a lump sum payment on termination based on base salary and length of service and\nsubject to a cap of \u00a3275,000. In addition, in the event of termination by the Firm for reasons other than\ncause, employees may be considered, at the discretion of the Firm, for a cash payment in lieu of an annual\nincentive compensation award, taking into consideration all circumstances the Firm deems relevant, including\nthe circumstances of the employee\u2019s leaving and the employee\u2019s contributions to the Firm over his or her\ncareer. Severance benefits and any such discretionary payment are subject to execution of a release in favor\nof the Firm and certain post-termination restrictions.\n\nThe table on the following page sets forth the benefits and compensation which the Named Executive Officers\nwould have received if their employment had terminated on December 31, 2023. The amounts shown in the table\non the following page do not include other payments and benefits available generally to salaried employees\nupon termination of employment, such as accrued vacation pay, distributions from the 401(k) Savings Plan,\npension and deferred compensation plans, or any death, disability or post retirement welfare benefits\navailable under broad-based employee plans. For information on the pension and deferred compensation plans,\nsee \u201cTable V: 2023 Pension benefits\u201d on page 67and \u201cTable VI: 2023 Non-qualified deferred compensation\u201d on\npage 68. Such tables also do not show the value of vested SARs, which would be listed in \u201cTable III:\nOutstanding equity awards at fiscal year-end 2023\u201d on pages 65and 66; however, there were no vested SARs\noutstanding on December 31, 2023.\n\nNEOs are not entitled to any additional equity awards in connection with a potential termination. Rather,\nunder certain termination scenarios including disability, death, termination without cause, or resignation\n(if full-career eligible), NEOs\u2019 outstanding equity awards continue to vest in accordance with their terms\n(or accelerate in the event of death). The table on the following page shows the value of these unvested\nRSUs, PSUs and SARs based on the closing price of our common stock on December 29, 2023.\n                                                                                                            \n  Government Office provision                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nEmployees with applicable awards, including NEOs, are covered under the Firm\u2019s Government Office provision\nwhich allows for continued vesting of equity awards if the employee resigns to accept a covered government\noffice. For such employees who are full-career eligible, outstanding performance year awards continue to\nvest in accordance with their terms whether they leave the Firm to enter government service or otherwise,\nso, for these awards, the Government Office provision does not provide any benefit to employees who are\nfull-career eligible. All NEOs meet the full-career eligibility provision of their applicable awards. 1\n\nFor employees who are not full-career eligible, and for awards that do not have full career eligibility\nprovisions, the value of awards that would continue to vest as a result of the Government Office provision\nof our equity plan would equal a percentage of the unvested stock awards ranging from 0% prior to three\nyears of employment by the Firm to 50% after three years of employment increasing to 100% after five years.\n\n1 Refer to Notes 3 and 6 on page 70.\n

NEOs are not entitled to\nany additional equity awards in connection with a potential termination.\n\n2 Involuntary terminations without cause include involuntary terminations due to redundancies and\ninvoluntary terminations without alternative employment. For \u201cSeverance and other,\u201d amounts shown represent\nseverance under the Firm\u2019s broad-based U.S. Severance Pay Plan, or the U.K. Discretionary Redundancy Policy\nin the case of Ms. Lake. Base salary greater than $400,000 per year, or \u00a3275,000 in the case of Ms. Lake, is\ndisregarded for purposes of determining severance amounts. The rate used to convert Ms. Lake\u2019s eligible\nseverance to U.S. dollars was the blended spot rate for the month of December 2023, which was $1.2665 U.S.\ndollars per British pound sterling.\n\n3 For employees in good standing who have resigned and have met full-career eligibility or other acceptable\ncriteria, awards continue to vest over time on their original schedule, provided that the employees, for the\nremainder of the vesting period, do not perform services for a financial services company or work in their\nprofession (whether or not for a financial services company); provided that employees may work for a\ngovernment, education or not-for-profit organization. The awards shown represent RSUs and PSUs that would\ncontinue to vest because the NEOs have met the full-career eligibility criteria. The awards are subject to\ncontinuing post-employment obligations to the Firm during this period.\n\n4 In the case of disability, stock awards continue to vest pursuant to their original vesting schedule.\n\n5 Vesting restrictions on stock awards and restrictions upon exercise of SARs lapse immediately upon death.\n\n6 The Government Office provision of an award does not provide any benefit to employees who have met the\nfull-career eligibility provision of that same award. Therefore, under the terms of the Government Office\nprovision, NEOs would generally not receive any benefit upon termination since they meet the full-career\neligibility provision entitling them to continued vesting of their equity awards (see preceding Note 3). For\nawards that do not have the full career eligibility provision, the amount reported is based on the December\n31, 2023 value of the award in which the NEO is eligible to continue to vest.\n\n7 For death, represents the value of PSUs granted on January 19, 2021, January 18, 2022, and January 17,\n2023 assuming: (a) maximum payout related to 2021, 2022, and 2023 performance years; (b) target payout\nrelated to 2024 and 2025 performance years; and (c) accumulated reinvested dividend equivalent shares as of\nDecember 31, 2023. For involuntary without cause, full career eligibility provision and disability, (a)\nmaximum payout related to PSUs granted on January 19, 2021; and (b) target payout is assumed related to PSUs\ngranted on January 18, 2022 and January 17, 2023.\n                                                                                                            \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.702024 PROXY STATEMENT                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                                  \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION |PAY VERSUS PERFORMANCE  \n  DISCLOSURE                                      \n                                                  \nPay versus performance disclosure\n\nPAY VERSUS PERFORMANCE TABLE\n\nThe following table presents the executive Compensation Actually Paid (\"CAP\") for our Principal Executive\nOfficer (\"PEO\") and non-PEO NEOs relative to the Firm\u2019s financial performance in the format specified by the\nSEC pursuant to Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K. The CMDC does not utilize CAP for compensation considerations\nand determinations; for more information on our compensation philosophy and pay decisions for our Named\nExecutive Officers, see our \"Compensation Discussion and Analysis\" which starts on page 35.\n\nThe Firm continues to consider ROTCE its most important company-selected financial performance measure for\ncompensation. ROTCE is a comprehensive performance metric that measures the Firm's net income applicable to\ncommon equity as a percentage of average tangible common equity, and reflects how well management is using\nshareholders\u2019 equity to generate profit. It is a fundamental performance metric that is widely used by the\nFirm, investors and analysts in assessing the earnings power of common shareholders\u2019 equity capital, and is\nuseful for comparing the profitability of the Firm with that of our competitors.\n                                                                                                            \n                                       Avera\u2026    Avera\u2026     Value                                           \n           Summa\u2026                      Summa\u2026    Compe\u2026        of                                           \n           Compe\u2026    Compe\u2026            Compe\u2026    Actua\u2026    Initi\u2026                                           \n            Table    Actua\u2026            Table       Paid     Fixed                      Net       ROTCE4     \n  Year1     Total      Paid            Total         to      $100                      Income       (%)     \n              for    to PEO            for       non-P\u2026    Inves\u2026                      ($B)                 \n              PEO      ($)2            non-P\u2026      NEOs     Based                                           \n              ($)                      NEOs        ($)2       On:                                           \n                                       ($)                                                                  \n  Comp\u2026      Peer                                                                                           \n  TSR3\u2026     Group                                                                                           \n           TSR3(\u2026                                                                                           \n  2023     $35,0\u2026    $103,\u2026    $21,4\u2026            $41,0\u2026    $137.\u2026    $132.94    $49.6                21  %  \n  2022     34,84\u2026    37,46\u2026    19,23\u2026            17,20\u2026    105.48     118.54     37.7                18  %  \n  2021     84,42\u2026    130,5\u2026    23,47\u2026            35,68\u2026    120.68     132.50     48.3                23  %  \n  2020     31,66\u2026    10,69\u2026    19,25\u2026            14,70\u2026     94.48      98.24     29.1                14  %  \n                                                                                                            \n1 NEOs included in the above table are comprised of the following individuals.

In 2022, both PEO CAP and non-PEO NEO average CAP decreased significantly from 2021,\ndue to a decrease in the Firm\u2019s stock price as of year-end 2022, consistent with the broader market decline.\nThe largest impact of the change in the stock price was on Messrs. Dimon and Pinto's outstanding SARs\nawards, both of which were out of the money as of the end of 2022. In 2023, the increase in both PEO CAP and\nnon-PEO NEO average CAP was attributable to an increase in the Firm's stock price as of year-end 2023, which\noutperformed the S&P Financials Index as well as the broader market in general. Additionally, the PEO and\nnon-PEO NEO average CAP were impacted by Messrs. Dimon and Pinto's outstanding SARs awards, both of which\nwere in the money as of the end of 2023.\n\nIn summary, the Firm's PEO CAP and non-PEO NEO average CAP reflect a general correlation with:\n\n\u2022 The Firm\u2019s stock price and TSR, primarily due to a significant majority of our NEOs\u2019 compensation being in\nthe form of long- term equity\n\n\u2022 The Firm\u2019s net income, which reflects our pay-for-performance compensation philosophy and practices\n\n\u2022 The Firm\u2019s ROTCE, which emphasizes our commitment to providing strong returns to shareholders while\nmaintaining a fortress balance sheet\n\nIn addition, the Firm\u2019s change in TSR over the past four years reflects a general correlation with that of\nthe broader S&P Financials Index.\n\nUNRANKED TABULAR LIST OF THE FIRM'S MOST IMPORTANT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES\n\nAs required by SEC rules, the most important financial performance measures that the Firm used to link\nexecutive compensation during the last fiscal year to company performance are listed below.\n                                                     \n  Performance Measures                               \n  Managed revenue for the Firm and the lines of      \n  business                                           \n  Pre-tax income (ex.

Therefore, as\npermitted under SEC rules, for this year's disclosure we have used the 2023 annual total compensation of the\nsame estimated median employee that we identified for last year's disclosure in our 2023 Proxy Statement.\n\nFor the disclosure in our 2023 Proxy Statement, annual total compensation included salary as of December 31,\n2022, as well as overtime pay, fixed allowance and incentive compensation, if applicable. We annualized the\nsalary portion of the compensation for employees who were hired during 2022; however, we did not make any\nfull-time equivalent adjustments to part-time, temporary and seasonal employees. We did not apply any cost-\nof-living adjustments as part of the calculation. In determining the scope of our employees (other than our\nCEO), we included our global workforce of full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal employees who were\nemployed as of December 31, 2022.\n\nCOMPARABILITY\n\nWe believe the ratio above is a reasonable estimate, based on the methodology we have described.

On March 19,\n2024, the Compensation & Management Development\nCommittee (\u201cCMDC\u201d) adopted, subject to shareholder\napproval, the Amended and Restated JPMorgan Chase\nLong-Term Incentive Plan (the \u201c2024 Plan\u201d). The 2024\nPlan would supersede the 2021 Plan and apply to\nawards granted on or after May 21, 2024.\n\nWe are submitting this proposal to our shareholders\nin response to feedback we received about our equity\ncompensation practices during our semi-annual\nshareholder outreach program. Our shareholders\nindicated a preference for more frequent requests\nfor approval of a smaller quantity of shares, as\nopposed to requesting larger quantities less\nfrequently. As a result, the CMDC and the Board\nconsidered this feedback in determining the number\nof shares to request for authorization under the\n2024 Plan.\n\nThe primary purpose of the 2024 Plan is to:\n\n\u2022 Renew the term of the 2021 Plan to a term date of\nMay 31, 2028;\n\n\u2022 Authorize an additional approximately 38.2 million\nshares, bringing the total number of authorized\nshares for new awards to 81 million, which is 4\nmillion shares lower than that approved by\nshareholders under the 2021 Plan; and\n\n\u2022 Continue to incorporate our non-employee director\ncompensation program, including:\n\n\u2013 Annual cash retainer of $110,000 and, if the non-\nemployee director is on the Board at the time when\nannual performance year equity awards are granted,\nan annual grant of deferred stock units valued at\n$265,000. The Board is authorized in its discretion\nto increase the cash retainer and/or the equity\naward by a combined total of up to $25,000, to\ndecrease them, or to change their form;\n\n\u2013 Designated role cash retainers of: (i) $35,000 for\nserving as the Lead Independent Director; (ii)\n$30,000 for chairing the JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\n(\u201cBank\u201d) board, Audit Committee or Risk Committee;\nand (iii) $20,000 for chairing any other principal\nstanding committee or for serving on any of the Bank\nboard, Audit Committee or Risk Committee; and\n\n\u2013 The Board is authorized in its discretion to\nincrease the cash retainer for serving as the Lead\nIndependent Director by up to $65,000, which is an\nincrease of $60,000 from the 2021 Plan.\nAdditionally, the Board is authorized in its\ndiscretion to increase the cash retainers described\nin (ii) and (iii) by up to $5,000 (unchanged from\nthe 2021 Plan). The Board is\n\nauthorized to decrease retainers, or to change their\nform.\n\nThe 2024 Plan maintains many of the governance\npractices and features of the 2021 Plan, including:\n\n\u2022 The exclusion of our stock option/stock\nappreciation rights (\u201cSARs\u201d) recycling feature;\n\n\u2022 The inclusion of a one-year minimum vesting\nrequirement on the 5% of shares that are exempt from\nthe minimum three-year vesting;\n\n\u2022 The reduction of the maximum number of shares that\ncan be granted as Incentive Stock Options from 20\nmillion to 7 million; and\n\n\u2022 The standard of review for actions under the 2024\nPlan.\n\nWhy shareholders should approve the 2024 Plan\n\nWe believe that voting in favor of the 2024 Plan is\nimportant, as a well-designed equity program serves\nto strengthen the alignment of employees\u2019 long-term\neconomic interests with those of shareholders while\nnot causing unreasonable dilution to shareholders.\nWithout shareholder approval, the Firm will lose a\ncritical shareholder alignment feature of our\ncompensation framework. The Firm is seeking\nshareholder approval one year before the 2025\nexpiration of the 2021 Plan to ensure that our\ncompensation program continues to be aligned with\nthe interests of our shareholders.\n\nSummary of the 2024 Plan\n\nThe following summary of the 2024 Plan sets forth\nits material terms.

Subject to the provisions of the 2024\nPlan, the CMDC has complete control over the\nadministration of the 2024 Plan and has the\nauthority in its sole discretion to:\n\n\u2022 Construe, interpret and implement the 2024 Plan\nand all award agreements;\n\n\u2022 Establish, amend and rescind any rules and\nregulations relating to the 2024 Plan;\n\n\u2022 Grant awards under the 2024 Plan;\n\n\u2022 Determine who shall receive awards, when such\nawards shall be made and the terms and provisions of\naward agreements;\n\n\u2022 Establish plans supplemental to the 2024 Plan\ncovering employees residing outside of the United\nStates;\n\n\u2022 Provide for mandatory or voluntary deferrals of\nawards under the 2024 Plan; and\n\n\u2022 Make all other determinations in its discretion\nthat it may deem necessary or advisable for the\nadministration of the 2024 Plan.\n\nThe CMDC may delegate to officers of JPMorgan Chase\nresponsibility for awards to officers and employees\nof our Firm not subject to Section 16 of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934. The CMDC\u2019s\ndeterminations in the administration of the 2024\nPlan will be final, and the Board and the CMDC will\nhave no liability for any action taken under the\n2024 Plan in good faith (including any action taken\nrelating to awards to our non-employee directors).\n\nThe Governance Committee is responsible for\nreviewing and making recommendations to the Board\nregarding awards to our non-employee directors.\n                                                                                                            \n  Number of shares                                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \nIf this proposal is approved, a total of 81 million\nshares will be authorized for issuance for new\nawards under the 2024 Plan, including approximately\n42.8 million remaining shares from the 2021 Plan.\n                                                                                                            \n  Awards                                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nThe forms of the awards that may be granted under\nthe 2024 Plan are:\n\n\u2022 Stock Options. May be awarded in the form of an\n\u201cincentive\u201d stock option or a nonqualified stock\noption. Stock options may not be exercisable later\nthan 10 years after their date of grant. The CMDC\nwill establish the option exercise price at the time\nthe option is granted, provided that the exercise\nprice may not be less than 100% of the fair market\nvalue of a share of common stock on the date of\ngrant. The exercise price shall be paid in full at\nthe time of such exercise, with the method and form\nof such payment determined by the CMDC from time to\ntime.\n\n\u2022 SARs . The CMDC may award SARs. Upon exercise, a\nSAR generally entitles a participant to receive an\namount equal to the positive difference between the\nfair market value of a share of common stock on the\ndate the SAR is exercised and the per share exercise\nprice of the SAR, multiplied by the number of shares\nof common stock with respect to which the SAR is\nexercised. SARs may not be exercisable later than 10\nyears after the date they are granted. The exercise\nprice per share of common stock covered by a SAR is\ndetermined by the CMDC at the time each SAR is\ngranted; provided, however, that the exercise price\nmay not be less than 100% of the fair market value\nof a share of common stock on the date of grant.\nSARs may be granted independently of any award of\nstock options or in conjunction with all or any part\nof a stock options award, either at the same time\nthe award of stock options is granted or at any\nlater time during the term of such options. If a SAR\nis granted in tandem with a stock option, the\nexercise price of the SAR will not be less than 100%\nof the fair market value of a share of common stock\non the date of grant. A SAR or applicable portion\nthereof allocated to a stock option shall terminate\nand no longer be exercisable upon the termination or\nexercise of any related stock option. The CMDC will\ndetermine at the date of grant whether the SAR shall\nbe settled in cash, common stock or a combination of\ncash and common stock.\n\n\u2022 Other Stock-Based Awards. The CMDC may grant\nawards of common stock and other awards that are\nvalued in whole or in part by reference to, or\notherwise based on the fair market value of common\nstock (\u201cOther Stock-Based Awards\u201d). Other Stock-\nBased Awards include, without limitation: (i) shares\nof common stock; (ii) shares of common stock subject\nto restrictions on transfer until the completion of\na specified period of service, the occurrence of an\nevent or the attainment of performance objectives\n(each as specified by the CMDC); (iii) shares of\ncommon stock issuable upon the completion of a\nspecified period of service; (iv) restricted stock\nunits distributed in the form of shares of common\nstock after the restrictions lapse; and (v)\nconditioning the right to an award upon the\noccurrence of an event or the attainment of one or\nmore performance objectives. The CMDC shall\ndetermine at the time of grant whether Other Stock-\nBased Awards shall be settled in cash, common stock\nor a combination of cash and common stock.\n\n\u2022 Performance Awards. The 2024 Plan provides that\nthe CMDC may specify performance criteria or\nstandards with respect to an award based upon one or\nmore of the following criteria: stock price,\nshareholder value added, earnings per share, income\nbefore or after taxes (including income before\ninterest, taxes, depreciation and amortization),\nreturn on common equity including return on tangible\ncommon equity, revenue growth, efficiency ratio,\nexpense management, return on investment, ratio of\nnon-performing assets to performing assets, return\non assets, profitability or performance of\nidentifiable business units, credit quality, or any\nother criteria as determined by the CMDC in its sole\ndiscretion.

The CMDC will determine whether, with respect\nto a performance period, the applicable performance\ngoals have been met with respect to a given\nparticipant and, if they have, to ascertain the\namount of the applicable performance award. The\namount of the performance award actually paid to a\ngiven participant may be less than the amount\ndetermined by the applicable performance goal\nformula, at the discretion of the CMDC, and the\namount determined by the CMDC for a performance\nperiod shall be paid to the participant at such time\nas determined by the CMDC in its sole discretion\nafter the end of such performance period.\n\n\u2022 Dividends/Dividend Equivalents. The terms and\nconditions of Other Stock-Based Awards of restricted\nstock and restricted stock units may provide the\nparticipant with dividends or dividend equivalents\npayable prior to vesting; and awards of Other Stock-\nBased Awards of restricted stock may provide for\nvoting rights prior to vesting. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, with respect to awards of restricted\nstock and restricted stock units specifically\ndesignated in the award agreement as performance-\nbased, dividends or dividend equivalents shall be\naccumulated and shall be paid to the participants\nonly in an amount based on the number of shares, if\nany, that vest under the terms of the award.\n                                                                                                            \n  Director compensation                                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \nCompensation to non-employee directors under the\n2024 Plan includes:\n\n\u2022 Annual cash retainer and equity award. For each\ncalendar year for service on the Board, each\nDirector shall receive a cash retainer of $110,000\nand, if the Director is on the Board at the time\nwhen annual performance year equity awards are\ngranted, an annual grant of deferred stock units\nvalued at $265,000. During the 2024 Plan term, the\nBoard is authorized in its discretion to increase\nthe cash retainer and/or the equity award by a\ncombined total of up to $25,000, to decrease them,\nor to change their form.\n\n\u2022 Designated role retainers. For each calendar year,\neach Director who serves in the following designated\nroles shall receive an annual cash retainer of: (i)\n$35,000 for serving as the Lead Independent\nDirector; (ii) $30,000 for chairing the Bank board,\nAudit Committee or Risk Committee; and (iii) $20,000\nfor chairing any other principal standing committee\nand for serving on any of the Bank board, Audit\nCommittee or Risk Committee. During the 2024 Plan\nterm, the Board is authorized in its discretion to\nincrease the cash retainer described in (i) for\nserving as the Lead Independent Director by up to\n$65,000, and the retainers described in (ii) or\n(iii) by up to $5,000. The Board is authorized to\ndecrease retainers, or to change their form.\n\n\u2022 Additional fees or retainers. The Board may at any\ntime provide any Director with a retainer or other\nfee in addition to that provided for the\naforementioned, including for service on a specific\npurpose committee or for any other special service,\nin each case determined in the discretion of the\nBoard.\n\n\u2022 Form of Director compensation.

However, these minimum\nvesting and exercise periods do not apply to awards\nthat vest or become exercisable earlier due to (i)\ncircumstances such as death, retirement or\ninvoluntary termination of employment, (ii) the\nachievement of performance objectives over a period\nof at least one year, (iii) standard vest date\noccurring within 10 days of the grant date\nanniversary or (iv) if the Firm determines for\nregulatory or other considerations to provide an\nequity award in excess of that which would have been\nawarded to the individual under the cash equity\npolicy in effect for the performance year.\n                                                                                                            \n  Amendments and Termination                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nThe Board of Directors may amend, suspend or\nterminate the 2024 Plan or any portion thereof at\nany time without shareholder approval, except to the\nextent otherwise required by the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934 or New York Stock Exchange listing\nrequirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except\nin the case of an adjustment in connection with a\ncapital structure change (as described below under\n\u201cAdjustments\u201d), any amendment by the Board of\nDirectors shall be conditioned on shareholder\nconsent if it increases (i) the number of shares\nauthorized for grant under the 2024 Plan, (ii) the\nnumber of shares authorized for grant to individual\nparticipants under any form of award, or (iii) if\nsuch amendment eliminates restrictions applicable to\nthe reduction of the exercise price of an option or\nSAR, or the surrender of an option and SAR in\nconsideration for a new award with a lower exercise\nprice.\n\nNo awards may be made under the 2024 Plan after May\n31, 2028, or after the date the Board terminates the\n2024 Plan, if sooner.\n                                                                                                            \n  2024 PROXY STATEMENT79JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  APPROVAL OF AMENDED AND RESTATED LONG-TERM  \n  INCENTIVE PLAN| EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION      \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Adjustments                                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nIn the event there is a change in the outstanding\nshares of common stock by reason of any stock\ndividend or split, recapitalization, issuance of a\nnew class of common stock, merger, consolidation,\nspin-off, combination or exchange of shares or other\nsimilar corporate change, or any distributions to\nshareholders of common stock other than regular cash\ndividends, the CMDC will make such substitution or\nadjustment, if any, as it deems equitable, as to the\nnumber or kind of shares of common stock or other\nsecurities issued or reserved for issuance pursuant\nto the 2024 Plan, including, but not limited to,\nadjustments to the number of shares of common stock\nin the aggregate with respect to which awards may be\ngranted under the 2024 Plan or the number of awards\ngranted to any participant and to make appropriate\nadjustments (including the number of shares and the\nexercise price) to any outstanding awards.\n                                                                                                            \n  Federal income tax consequences                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \nThe following discussion summarizes the Federal\nincome tax consequences to participants who may\nreceive awards under the 2024 Plan and to JPMorgan\nChase arising out of the granting of such awards.\nThe discussion is based upon interpretations of the\nInternal Revenue Code in effect as of March 2024 and\nregulations promulgated thereunder as of such date.\n\nThis discussion is not intended to, and does not,\nprovide or supplement tax advice to recipients of\nawards, and participants are advised to consult with\ntheir own personal independent tax advisors with\nrespect to the specific tax consequences that, in\nlight of their particular circumstances, might arise\nin connection with their receipt of awards under the\n2024 Plan, including, but not limited to, any state,\nlocal or foreign tax consequences and the effect, if\nany, of gift, estate and inheritance taxes.\n\nNonqualified Stock Option/Stock Appreciation Rights.\nUpon the grant of a nonqualified stock option or\nSAR, a participant will not be in receipt of taxable\nincome. Upon exercise of either a nonqualified stock\noption or a SAR, a participant will be in receipt of\nordinary income in an amount equal to the excess of\nthe fair market value of the acquired shares of\ncommon stock (and/or cash) over the exercise price,\nand will be subject to FICA (Social Security and\nMedicare) tax in respect of such amounts. Gain or\nloss upon a subsequent sale of any common stock\nwould be taxed to the participant as long- or short-\nterm capital gain or loss depending on the holding\nperiod.\n\nIncentive Stock Options. A participant will not be\nin receipt of taxable income upon the grant or\nexercise of an incentive stock option (\u201cISO\u201d). Upon\nthe exercise of an ISO, the amount by which the fair\nmarket value of the stock received on exercise\nexceeds the exercise price is generally a tax\npreference adjustment for the purpose of the\nalternative minimum tax. If the participant holds\nthe shares acquired on the exercise of an ISO for\nthe requisite ISO holding period set forth in the\nInternal Revenue Code, the participant generally\n\nwill recognize a long-term capital gain or loss upon\ntheir subsequent sale or exchange measured by the\ndifference between the sale price and the exercise\nprice of the ISO. If a participant does not hold the\nshares acquired on the exercise of an ISO for the\nrequisite holding period, the participant may be in\nreceipt of ordinary income based upon a formula set\nforth in the Internal Revenue Code, generally the\nlesser of (i) the difference between the fair market\nvalue of the common stock on the date of exercise of\nthe ISO over the exercise price of the ISO and (ii)\nthe amount realized upon the disposition of the\ncommon stock acquired by the ISO over the exercise\nprice of the ISO. To the extent that the amount\nrealized on such sale or exchange exceeds the fair\nmarket value of the common stock on the date of the\nISO exercise, the participant will generally\nrecognize capital gains.\n\nOther Stock-Based Awards. The income tax\nconsequences of the Other Stock-Based Awards will\ndepend on how such awards are structured. In the\ncase of the grant of a restricted stock unit\n(whether time-vested or subject to achievement of\nperformance goals), a participant will not be in\nreceipt of taxable income. On delivery, a\nparticipant will be in receipt of ordinary income in\nan amount equal to the fair market value of the\nacquired shares of common stock (and/or cash). The\nparticipant will be subject to FICA (Social Security\nand Medicare) tax at the time any portion of a\nrestricted stock unit is deemed vested for tax\npurposes. The fair market value of any acquired\nshares (if any) on the delivery date will be the\nparticipant\u2019s tax basis for purposes of determining\nany subsequent gain or loss from the sale of the\nshares, and the participant\u2019s holding period with\nrespect to the shares will begin at the delivery\ndate.\n\nDeduction . Generally, JPMorgan Chase will be\nentitled to a tax deduction equal to the amount\nrecognized as ordinary income (including on the\nexercise of a stock option or SAR or on delivery\npursuant to a restricted stock unit). However, we\nwill generally not be entitled to a tax deduction\nwith respect to any amount that represents\ncompensation in excess of $1 million paid to covered\nemployees (other than awards pursuant to contracts\nentered into prior to the repeal of the exemption\nfor qualified performance-based compensation under\nSection 162(m) of the Code that may remain eligible\nfor such exemption). For this purpose, a \u201ccovered\nemployee\u201d means our chief executive officer, our\nchief financial officer and our three highest\ncompensated employees other than the chief executive\nofficer and the chief financial officer (based on\ncompensation reported to our shareholders), and any\nindividual who was previously a covered employee at\nany time on or after January 1, 2017. The American\nRescue Plan Act of 2021 includes provisions to\nexpand the applicability of Section 162(m),\nbeginning on or after January 1, 2027, to also\ninclude the next 5 highest compensated employees, so\nthat the total number of covered employees subject\nto the $1 million deduction limitation will be at\nleast 10. For the avoidance of doubt, we will not be\nentitled to any tax deduction with respect to an\nISO, if the participant holds the shares acquired on\nthe exercise of an ISO for the requisite ISO holding\nperiod.\n                                                                                                            \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.802024 PROXY STATEMENT                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                                   \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION |APPROVAL OF AMENDED AND  \n  RESTATED LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN                \n                                                   \nOur equity compensation program promotes shareholder\ninterests We believe our long-term incentive\ncompensation program serves a fundamental role in\nmotivating our employees to deliver sustained\nshareholder value by driving individual, line of\nbusiness and Firmwide results.

Reduce or\naltogether eliminate annual incentive compensation;\n2. Cancel unvested awards (in full or in part); 3.\nClawback/Recover previously paid incentive\ncompensation (cash and/or equity); 4.

For information on the factors reviewed\nby the Audit Committee, see the Audit Committee\nReport on pages 88- 89.\n\nThe members of the Audit Committee and the Board\nbelieve that continued retention of PwC as the\nFirm\u2019s independent external auditor is in the best\ninterests of JPMorgan Chase and its shareholders.\nPwC and its predecessors have acted as our\nindependent registered public accounting firm since\n1965. The Board believes the Firm receives\nsignificant benefits from the extensive history PwC\nhas with the Firm. These benefits include:\n\n\u2022 the high quality of its audit work and accounting\nadvice, as a result of their institutional knowledge\nof our businesses, global operations, key risks,\naccounting policies, financial systems and internal\ncontrol framework;\n\n\u2022 its audit efficiency and effectiveness, which\nresults in a lower fee structure due to their\nhistory and familiarity with our businesses;\n\n\u2022 the time and expense that would be avoided by\nmanagement and staff in order to onboard a new\nauditor; and\n\n\u2022 its commitment to maintaining their independence\nfrom the Firm.\n\nA member of PwC will be present at the annual\nmeeting and will have the opportunity to make a\nstatement and respond to appropriate questions from\nshareholders.\n\nBOARD OVERSIGHT OF PWC\n\nThe Audit Committee held eight private sessions with\nPwC during 2023.\n\nThe Audit Committee assesses PwC\u2019s independence\nthroughout the year. This includes reviewing with\nPwC its practices for maintaining its independence.\nThe Audit Committee has also established policies\nand procedures for approving services provided by\nPwC. It is JPMorgan Chase\u2019s policy to use PwC only\nfor audit and audit-related services, and tax\nservices in certain circumstances. For more\ninformation, see Audit Committee Approval Policies\nand Procedures on page 87.\n\nNo member of PwC\u2019s audit team may be hired by the\nFirm for a period of one year after such person\ntransferred from the Firm\u2019s audit engagement to\nanother role at PwC, or has terminated employment\nwith PwC. Further, no former PwC employee who was a\nmanager or partner may be hired by the Firm as the\nCFO, Principal Accounting Officer, General Auditor,\nTreasurer, Director of Tax or CFO or Controller of a\nLOB or Corporate function for a period of two years\nfollowing his or her termination of employment with\nPwC.\n\nIn accordance with SEC rules and PwC policies, audit\npartners are subject to rotation requirements to\nlimit the number of consecutive years of service an\nindividual partner may provide audit services to the\nFirm. The lead audit partner and quality review\npartner may provide services to our Firm for a\nmaximum of five consecutive years. As a result of\nthe rotation requirements, the Audit Committee\napproved the selection of the current lead audit\npartner beginning with the 2021 audit engagement.\nThe lead audit partner is expected to serve in this\ncapacity through the end of the 2025 audit.\n                                                                                                            \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.862024 PROXY STATEMENT                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  AUDIT MATTERS |RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT  \n  REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM           \n                                              \nFEES PAID TO PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP The Audit\nCommittee is responsible for negotiating the terms\nand fees associated with the Firm\u2019s retention of\nPwC, including the annual integrated audit of the\nFirm\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Audit fees For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, fees for the\nannual integrated audit of the Firm\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Firm\u2019s internal control\nover financial reporting, and quarterly reviews of the Firm\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements, were $51.7\nmillion and $45.1 million, respectively. Fees for services related to statutory/subsidiary audits,\nattestation reports required by statute or regulation, and comfort letters and consents related to SEC\nfilings and other similar filings with non-U.S. authorities were $25.8 million and $25.9 million,\nrespectively. The increase in Audit fees with PwC is primarily driven by the First Republic Bank\nacquisition, inflation and continued business growth.\n\nAudit-related fees Audit-related fees comprise assurance and related services that are traditionally\nperformed by the independent registered public accounting firm. These services include attestation and\nagreed-upon procedures which address accounting, reporting and control matters relating to fiduciary,\ntransaction processing, investment management, servicing activities and ESG initiatives; reviews related to\ninvestment and lending processes, and technology systems; and due diligence reviews related to acquisitions\nand divestitures. These services are normally provided in connection with the recurring audit engagement.\nThe increase in audit-related fees is primarily driven by services rendered during the calendar year for\ncomplying with internal control reporting requirements as well as new engagements due to continued business\ngrowth. Tax fees Fees for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, for tax compliance and tax return\npreparation services were $3.7 million and $4.9 million, respectively. Fees for other tax services,\nincluding tax advisory and consultation on tax matters, were $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively.\nAUDIT COMMITTEE APPROVAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES The Audit Committee\u2019s policies and procedures require the\nAudit Committee to pre-approve a list of specified audit, audit-related and tax services, and review and\napprove the terms and fees for the annual integrated audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements. All\nrequests for audit, audit-related and tax services that are not on the pre-approved list of specified\nservices must be approved by the Audit Committee. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s pre-approval policy does not provide for\na de minimis exception under which the pre- approval requirement may be waived. Pre-approved services to be\nperformed by PwC with estimated costs in excess of $250,000 are approved by the Chair of the Audit\nCommittee; and pre-approved services with estimated costs less than or equal to $250,000 are delegated to\nthe Firmwide Controller\u2019s office for approval.\n                                                                                                            \n  2024 PROXY STATEMENT87JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                         \n  AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT| AUDIT MATTERS  \n                                         \nAudit Committee report\n\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of\nJPMorgan Chase is comprised of four non-management\ndirectors. The Board has determined that each member\nof our committee has no material relationship with\nthe Firm under the Board\u2019s director independence\nstandards and that each member is independent under\nthe listing standards of the NYSE, where the Firm\u2019s\nsecurities are listed, and under the SEC\u2019s standards\nrelating to the independence of audit committees.\nThe Board has also determined that each member is\nfinancially literate and is an audit committee\nfinancial expert as defined by the SEC.\n\nCHARTER\n\nThe Audit Committee operates under a written charter\nadopted by the Board, which is available on our\nwebsite at jpmorganchase.com/about/governance/board-\ncommittees/audit-committee. We annually review our\ncharter and our practices. We have determined that\nour charter and practices are consistent with the\nlisting standards of the NYSE and the provisions of\nthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The purpose of the\nAudit Committee is to assist the Board in its\noversight of:\n\n\u2022 the independent registered public accounting\nfirm\u2019s qualifications and independence,\n\n\u2022 the performance of the Firm's internal audit\nfunction and the independent registered public\naccounting firm, and\n\n\u2022 management\u2019s responsibilities to assure that there\nis in place an effective system of controls\nreasonably designed to safeguard the assets and\nincome of the Firm; assure the integrity of the\nFirm\u2019s financial statements; and maintain compliance\nwith the Firm\u2019s ethical standards, policies, plans\nand procedures, and with laws and regulations.\n\nAUDIT COMMUNICATIONS AND FEES\n\nWe discussed with PwC the matters required to be\ndiscussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight\nBoard (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) Auditing Standard No. 1301,\nCommunications with Audit Committees, including\nPwC\u2019s overall audit scope and audit approach as set\nforth in the terms of their engagement letter; PwC\u2019s\noverall audit strategy for significant audit risks\nidentified by them; and the nature and extent of the\nspecialized skills necessary to perform the planned\naudit. We have established procedures to receive and\ntrack the handling of issues regarding accounting\nand reporting, internal control and auditing\nmatters. In addition, we monitor the audit, audit-\nrelated and tax services provided by PwC. The Audit\nCommittee has also evaluated and concluded that\naudit-related and tax services provided by PwC do\nnot impair PwC\u2019s independence.\n\nDetails of the fees paid to PwC for its services, as\nwell as the Audit Committee\u2019s \u201cpre-approval policy\u201d\nfor such services, can be found on page 87.\n\nASSESSMENT OF PWC\n\nThe Audit Committee annually reviews PwC\u2019s\nqualifications, performance and independence in\nconnection with its determination as to whether to\nretain PwC. In conducting our review we considered,\namong other things:\n\n\u2022 the professional qualifications of PwC, and that\nof the lead audit partner, quality review partner\nand other key engagement partners;\n\n\u2022 PwC\u2019s current and historical performance on the\nFirm\u2019s audit, including the extent and quality of\nits communications with the Audit Committee and the\nFirm\u2019s management;\n\n\u2022 PwC\u2019s demonstrated professional skepticism and\nobjectivity, including fresh perspectives brought\nthrough the required periodic rotation of the lead\naudit partner, the quality review partner and other\npartners who play a significant role in the audit\nengagement;\n\n\u2022 PwC\u2019s demonstrated capability, expertise and\nefficiency in which it handles the breadth and\ncomplexity of the Firm\u2019s global operations,\nincluding the use of technology, specialists, and\nsubject matter experts;\n\n\u2022 PwC\u2019s depth of institutional knowledge and\nunderstanding of the Firm\u2019s global businesses,\noperations and systems, the financial services\nindustry, including the global regulatory\nenvironment, U.S. and international accounting\nstandards, the potential effect on the financial\nstatements of the significant risks and exposures\nfacing the Firm, and the Firm\u2019s internal control\nover financial reporting;\n\n\u2022 external data relating to PwC\u2019s audit quality and\nperformance, including recent PCAOB reports on PwC\n(including its global network of firms), and the\nresults of peer review and self-review examinations;\n\n\u2022 an analysis of PwC\u2019s known legal risks and\nsignificant proceedings that could impair PwC\u2019s\nability to perform the Firm\u2019s annual audit;\n\n\u2022 PwC\u2019s tenure as the Firm\u2019s independent auditor;\n\n\u2022 the appropriateness of PwC\u2019s fees, both on an\nabsolute basis and as compared with fees paid by\ncertain peer banking firms; and\n\n\u2022 the advisability and potential impact of selecting\na different independent registered public accounting\nfirm, including the additional costs and\ninefficiencies associated with hiring a new\nindependent registered public accounting firm.\n                                                                                                            \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.882024 PROXY STATEMENT                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                         \n  AUDIT MATTERS |AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT  \n                                         \nPwC provided us the written disclosures and the\nletter required by PCAOB\u2019s Ethics and Independence\nRule 3526, Communications with Audit Committees\nConcerning Independence, and we discussed and\nconfirmed with PwC their independence.\n\nAs a result of this evaluation, we believe PwC has\nthe capability to provide the necessary expertise,\nindependence and professional skepticism to continue\nto audit the Firm\u2019s businesses on a global basis,\nand we approved the appointment of PwC as JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s independent registered public accounting\nfirm for 2024, subject to shareholder ratification.\n\nManagement is responsible for the Firm\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, the financial\nreporting process and JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Consolidated\nFinancial Statements. PwC is responsible for\nperforming an independent audit of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nConsolidated Financial Statements and of the\neffectiveness of internal control over financial\nreporting in accordance with auditing standards\npromulgated by the PCAOB. The Firm\u2019s Internal Audit\nfunction, under the direction of the General\nAuditor, is independent of the Firm\u2019s businesses and\nthe Independent Risk Management function. Internal\nAudit reports directly to the Audit Committee (and\nadministratively to the Firm\u2019s CEO) and is\nresponsible for preparing an annual audit plan and\nconducting internal audits intended to independently\ntest and evaluate the Firm\u2019s governance, risk\nmanagement and internal controls. The members of the\nAudit Committee are not professionally engaged in\nthe practice of accounting or auditing; as noted\nabove, the Audit Committee\u2019s responsibility is to\nmonitor and oversee these processes.\n\nThe Audit Committee regularly meets and holds\ndiscussions with the Firm\u2019s management, internal\nauditors and with PwC, and also holds private\nsessions with the General Auditor and with PwC,\nwithout members of\n\nmanagement present. These discussions include issues\nencountered during the audit, the Firm\u2019s quarterly\nearnings materials, and Quarterly and Annual Reports\non Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, respectively, prior to\nfiling with the SEC; as well as actions the Audit\nCommittee has taken during the prior year.\n\nManagement represented to us that JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nConsolidated Financial Statements were prepared in\naccordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America (\u201cU.S.\nGAAP\u201d). We reviewed and discussed JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nConsolidated Financial Statements with management,\nthe General Auditor and PwC. We also reviewed and\ndiscussed with PwC the quality of the Firm\u2019s\nsignificant accounting principles, the\nreasonableness of critical accounting estimates and\njudgments, critical audit matters PwC identified\nduring the audit, and the disclosures in JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements, including\ndisclosures relating to significant accounting\npolicies. We relied, without independent\nverification, on the information provided to us and\non the representations made by management, internal\nauditors and the independent auditor. Based on our\nreview of the reports given to us by PwC and our\ndiscussions with the Firm\u2019s management, internal\nauditors and PwC, as well as their respective\nrepresentations to us, we recommended to the Board,\nand the Board approved, inclusion of the audited\nConsolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC.\n\nMarch 18,2024\n\nAudit Committee\n\nTimothy P.

The Board\u2019s focus is on its fiduciary\nduty, namely, advancing the long-term financial interests of the Firm\u2019s shareholders.\n\nThe shareholder proposals and supporting statements appear in the form they were submitted to us. Consistent\nwith recent trends we've observed, a number of the proposals do not explain how they promote shareholders'\ninterests or even assert that they do. Some proposals provide no empirical evidence of financial\neffectiveness; some propose solutions without identifying a failure or material problem or ask the Firm to\nadopt practices that are not common among our peers; and still others are based on assertions about the Firm\nthat we believe are inaccurate and misleading.\n\nThere is meaningful cost attached to the implementation of each shareholder proposal. For instance, five of\nthe proposals request preparation of a report. The Firm already publishes numerous reports, including an ESG\nReport and a Climate Report, on topics that we have determined to be of interest to a broad base of\nshareholders and other stakeholders. Each of these reports require considerable time and resources to\nproduce, including senior management time and attention. Creating additional and potentially duplicative\nreports is not a good use of resources, particularly when, based on our assessment, interest in the topic is\nlimited.\n\nAfter a thorough evaluation, taking into account the potential costs, benefits, and alignment with our\nshareholders' long-term financial interests, as well as the themes addressed in the proposals, the Board\nstrongly recommends a vote AGAINST each of the shareholder proposals presented within this proxy statement.\n\nWe firmly believe in the value of shareholder engagement and recognize that our shareholders hold diverse\nviews and perspectives on various issues. While the Board recommends votes AGAINST these proposals, we\nremain open to continued engagement with the proponents and others who share our commitment to the long-term\nvalue of JPMorgan Chase.\n                                                                                                            \n  2024 PROXY STATEMENT91JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Table of ContentsSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nPROPOSAL 5 \u2014 INDEPENDENT BOARD CHAIRMAN Kenneth\nSteiner has advised us that he intends to introduce\nthe following resolution: Shareholders request that\nthe Board of Directors adopt an enduring policy, and\namend the governing documents as necessary in order\nthat 2 separate people hold the office of the\nChairman and the office of the CEO as follows:\nSelection of the Chairman of the Board The Board\nrequires the separation of the offices of the\nChairman of the Board and the Chief Executive\nOfficer. Whenever possible, the Chairman of the\nBoard shall be an Independent Director. The Board\nhas the discretion to select a Temporary Chairman of\nthe Board who is not an Independent Director to\nserve while the Board is seeking an Independent\nChairman of the Board on an accelerated basis. It is\na best practice to adopt this proposal soon. However\nthis policy could be phased in when there is a\ncontract renewal for our current CEO or for the next\nCEO transition. This proposal topic won 47%-support\nat the 2021 JPM annual meeting. It takes much more\nJPM shareholder conviction of the merits of this\nproposal topic to vote for this shareholder proposal\ntopic, and thereby reject the recommendation of the\nBoard of Directors, than to simply go along with the\nJPM Board of Directors recommendation. There are at\nleast 2 ways 47%-support can be considered a\nmajority vote. This 47% vote was especially\nimpressive because the proposal had to swim upstream\nagainst repeated glossy management special\nsolicitations sent to the shareholders who have no\nan independent source for proxy voting advice. The\n47% also represented a majority vote from\nprofessional investors who had access to independent\nproxy voting advice. Any proposal that gets above\n45% support has to get a majority vote from the most\ninformed shares because there is an overwhelming\nabundance of automatic votes from the JPM shares\nthat have no other source of proxy voting advice\nother than JPM management. The Board of Directors\ndisingenuously put forth a laughable policy that it\ncould always have one person fill the 2 most\nimportant jobs at JPM as long as the directors gave\nalmost any excuse to not have an independent board\nchairman. JPM also needs to take the role of the\nlead director more seriously. JPM's so-called Lead\nDirector, Mr. Stephen Burke, violates the most\nimportant attribute of a Lead Director \u2014\nindependence. As director tenure goes up director\nindependence goes down. Mr. Burke has 20-years\ndirector tenure. And Mr. Burke got the most against\nvotes of any JPM director again in 2023 surpassing\nTimothy Flynn, chair of the JPM Audit Committee, and\nMr. James Dimon who was again third highest in\nagainst votes.\n\nA lead director can be given a list of duties but\nthere is no rule that prevents the Chairman from\noverriding the lead director in any of the so-called\nlead director duties. Please vote yes: Independent\nBoard Chairman \u2014 Proposal 5 BOARD RESPONSE TO\nPROPOSAL 5 The Board of Directors recommends that\nshareholders vote AGAINST this proposal for the\nfollowing reasons:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u2022The proposal\u2019s requested policy is adverse to the interests of the Firm's shareholders because it        \n  restricts the Board\u2019s ability to use its experience, judgment, boardroom insight and ongoing shareholder  \n  feedback to make the best-informed decision on its leadership structure based on current facts and        \n  circumstances.                                                                                            \n  \u2022The Board evaluates the Firm\u2019s leadership structure on at least an annual basis and believes that using  \n  its judgment to determine the appropriate structure is a core Board function and a key part of            \n  fulfilling its fiduciary duty to shareholders.                                                            \n  \u2022In 2022, the Board enhanced its Corporate Governance Principles by adopting a general policy that upon   \n  the next CEO transition, the Chair and CEO positions will be separate, subject to the Board\u2019s             \n  determination of the leadership structure that best serves the Firm and its shareholders at the time.     \n  \u2022Contrary to the proponent\u2019s assertion, the Board determined that the current Lead Independent Director,  \n  Stephen B. Burke, is independent. His tenure has allowed him to gain invaluable institutional knowledge,  \n  making him extremely effective as Lead Independent Director. Mr. Burke has been overwhelmingly supported  \n  by shareholders, receiving more than 90% of shareholder votes for each election during his tenure.        \n  \u2022The Board empowers the Lead Independent Director role to include robust responsibilities and             \n  independent authority to provide a strong, effective counterbalance to the Chair. A Lead Independent      \n  Director is appointed when the Chair is not independent.                                                  \n  \u2022The proponent\u2019s assertion that mandating an independent board chairman is best practice is without       \n  basis. In any event, the Firm\u2019s strong performance with a combined CEO and Chair is evidence to the       \n  contrary with respect to this company.                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nThe Board of Directors considers the determination\nof its leadership structure to be a core Board\nfunction and a key part of fulfilling its fiduciary\nduty to shareholders. The Board is committed to\nrobust corporate governance practices that\nfacilitate its strong independent oversight of the\nFirm and its management. With respect to leadership\nstructure, shareholders benefit most when the Board\nis free to exercise its discretion to determine the\nstructure that it believes is most effective in\nadvancing the interests of the Firm.\n                                                                                                            \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.922024 PROXY STATEMENT                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Table of ContentsSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nThe Board's retention of discretion in reviewing its\nleadership structure evidences its intent to give\ndue consideration to the merits of separating the\nChair and CEO positions. A proper exercise of the\nBoard\u2019s discretion demands careful consideration of\navailable information. A restrictive policy such as\nthat proposed by the proponent is not prudent, as it\ncould prevent the Board from adopting the governance\nstructure that it believes is best able to advance\nthe interests of the Firm and its shareholders.\n\nThe independent directors of the Board evaluate the\nFirm\u2019s leadership structure on an annual basis. For\n2024, the Board determined that its current\nleadership structure, with a combined CEO and Chair\ncounterbalanced by a strong, effective Lead\nIndependent Director will best serve the Firm and\nits shareholders. In determining its leadership\nstructure, the Board considers, among other factors,\nthe composition of the Board, the individuals\nserving in leadership positions, the needs and\nopportunities of the Firm at the time, the Firm's\nlong-term performance and shareholder feedback. A\nfew of these factors are discussed in more detail\nbelow. Such annual evaluation is important because\n\u201cone-size-does-not-fit-all\u201d and there is no clear\nconsensus about ideal leadership structures. A fixed\npolicy requiring separation of the roles fails to\nconsider many factors. Accordingly, leadership\nstructures vary among companies. In fact, Shearman &\nSterling's 2023 Corporate Governance & Executive\nCompensation Survey states that, of the 100 largest\nU.S. public companies listed on the NYSE and Nasdaq,\n54 have a combined CEO/Chair role, and at the 46\ncompanies where the chair and CEO positions are\nseparated, 14 chairs were not independent.\n\nAs part of its annual review of leadership\nstructure, the Board considers the role of the Lead\nIndependent Director, whose responsibilities\ndemonstrate the Board\u2019s commitment to empowering the\nLead Independent Director to serve as a strong,\neffective counterbalance to the CEO. The Lead\nIndependent Director role at the Firm is robust,\nfocusing on the Board\u2019s priorities and processes,\nand his responsibilities include facilitating\nindependent oversight of management and promoting\nopen dialogue among the independent directors during\nBoard meetings, at executive sessions without the\npresence of the CEO, and between Board meetings.\nContrary to the claims of this proposal, our Lead\nIndependent Director has meaningful duties and plays\nan important role in the Board\u2019s, and the Firm\u2019s,\nsuccess. The Board, the Firm, and shareholders\nbenefit from the independence and depth of knowledge\nand skill possessed by our Lead Independent Director\nas well as his continuity of experience that\ncomplements ongoing Board refreshment.\n\nThe current Lead Independent Director, Stephen B.\nBurke, is independent. His tenure has allowed him to\ngain invaluable institutional knowledge, making him\nextremely effective as Lead Independent Director.\nMr. Burke has been overwhelmingly supported by\nshareholders, receiving more than 90% of shareholder\nvotes for each election during his tenure.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s long-term performance is another factor\nthe Board considers in determining its leadership\nstructure. The Firm\u2019s continued strong financial\nperformance and meaningful progress on key\ninitiatives, as described throughout this Proxy\nStatement, demonstrate that the current structure\nallows for effective execution on strategic\npriorities. The proponent asserts that having an\nindependent board chairman \u201cwhenever possible\u201d is\nbest practice, without providing any empirical\nevidence demonstrating a significant relationship\nbetween having separate Chair and CEO roles and\nstrong company performance. In contrast, with Mr.\nDimon serving as both Chairman and CEO, the Firm has\ndelivered ROTCE that has consistently and\nsubstantially outperformed that of our PSU\nperformance group, and an investment made in JPMC 10\nyears ago would have outperformed that of the KBW\nBank and S&P Financials indices. This enduring\noutperformance \u2013 including the Firm reporting the\nhighest earnings in 2023 of any bank in U.S. history\n\u2013 demonstrates the capabilities of the current\nChairman and CEO in overseeing the Firm\u2019s business\nin the combined role and the effectiveness of the\nBoard\u2019s discretion in determining its leadership\nstructure.\n\nIn 2022, the Board enhanced its Corporate Governance\nPrinciples, based on its annual review of its\nleadership structure and in response to shareholder\nfeedback. The Board considered feedback through\nextensive shareholder outreach that identified both\na preference among some shareholders for separate\nChair and CEO positions and strong support for the\ncurrent CEO. As a result, the Board enhanced our\nCorporate Governance Principles to provide, upon the\nnext CEO transition, that the Chair and CEO\npositions will be separate, subject to the Board\u2019s\ndetermination at the time of transition of the Board\nleadership structure that best serves the Firm and\nits shareholders. In exercising its discretion, if\nthe Board determines that retaining the current\nChair, or an otherwise non-independent director as\nChair, would best serve the interest of the Firm, it\nwill also retain a strong Lead Independent Director\nto facilitate independent oversight of management.\nThe Board will continue to evaluate the structure on\nan annual basis even after the transition.\n\nFinally, it is unclear what the proponent intends in\nsuggesting that the Firm adopt a \u201cTemporary\nChairman.\u201d This is not a standard corporate\ngovernance practice and would undermine the\nauthority of the Chair role at JPMorgan Chase.\n                                                                                                            \n  2024 PROXY STATEMENT93JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Table of ContentsSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nThe Board recommends a vote against this proposal\nbecause it promotes an overly restrictive,\nmechanical analysis of the leadership structure of\nthe Board that would prevent the Board from\nexercising its discretion to make the best- informed\ndecision on its leadership structure.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine\nis partially to blame, but the haphazard worldwide transition to so-called 1 \"green\" energy has arguably\ninflicted greater harm via toxic pollution and energy prices: 2 \u2022 According to Fatih Birol, Executive\nDirector of the International Energy Agency, developing nations are the most vulnerable to rising fossil\nfuel prices. 3 \"Birol said those who will be hit hardest include oil-importing nations in Africa, Asia and\nLatin America because of higher import prices and their weaker currencies.\" \u2022 760 million people, primarily\nin Africa and Asia, still don't have access to electricity, according to the IEA. 4 \u2022 Reduced investment in\nfossil fuels disproportionately impacts the poor. 5 \"Reducing poverty is not feasible without access to\ncheap and reliable energy.\" 6 \u2022 Developing nations represent potential sources of business growth\u2014or\ndecline\u2014for JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Morgan Development Finance Institution (JPM DFI) was established in January\n2020 to mobilize finance in support of the UN Sustainable Development Goals in emerging economies.\" JPM's\nclimate policies appear to conflict with its commitment to the SDGs, 12 especially the first goal of \"no\npoverty.\" 13 RESOLVED: Shareholders request the Board of Directors to oversee an audit that analyzes the\nimpacts, both adverse and beneficial, of JPM's climate transition policies regarding the economic and\nhumanitarian effects on emerging nations, which rely heavily on - but have limited access to - fossil fuels\nand other non-\"renewable\" sources of power, such as nuclear. Perspectives from a full spectrum of respected\neconomists, nongovernmental organizations, research firms, and public-interest groups could be considered.\nJPM should avoid one-sided political or viewpoint bias, with the auditor consulting specialists across a\nrange of stances - including those who may rebut prevailing corporate media- and government-driven\nnarratives on climate and energy. Among perspectives that may be considered include experts such as Alex\nEpstein, Michael Shellenberger, Bjorn Lomborg, Robert Bryce, Roy Spencer, John Christy, Roger Pielke, Jr.,\nRichard Lindzen, and others.

We seek to inform our decision-making with input from\nrelevant subject matter experts and stakeholders without regard to their political or social leanings. This\napproach helps enable us to make independent decisions based on business principles. We note that the\nproposal advances views that are skeptical of modern scientific consensus regarding climate change. In\ncontrast, our business principles-based approach is designed to \u201cavoid one-sided political or viewpoint\nbias,\u201d as urged by the proposal.\n\nAt its core, the proposal focuses on one particular view of climate change, and offers no evidence to\nsupport its contention that our commitments relating to climate and development finance are incompatible\nwith each other. We believe our ability to capitalize upon opportunities and manage risk, including those\npresented by a transition to a low-carbon economy, depend on continued focus on facts, without regard to\npolitical or ideological agendas. The Firm\u2019s objectives across our sustainable development activities and\nclimate are complementary. JPMorgan Chase has committed to finance and facilitate $2.5 trillion over 10\nyears \u2014 from 2021 through the end of 2030 \u2014 to advance long-term solutions that address climate change and\ncontribute to sustainable development (\u201cSustainable Development Target\u201d), which we believe will help\naccelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy while also supporting socioeconomic development and\ninclusive growth for people and communities around the world. As this finance target is measured across both\nsustainability and climate, those objectives are by definition complementary. More importantly, we do not\nagree with the implied premise that progress on business-driven climate objectives hinders progress on\nsustainable development, or vice versa. The Firm\u2019s sustainable development activities are focused in three\nareas, one of which is development finance to support socioeconomic development in emerging economies, with\nan emphasis on mobilizing capital to advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (\u201cSDGs\u201d).\nContrary to the proponent\u2019s claim that our policies appear to conflict with the SDGs, in 2021 and 2022, the\nFirm financed and facilitated $482 billion toward its Sustainable Development Target, including $204 billion\nfor development finance. The Firm pursues its sustainable development activities while also supporting\nclients in the energy sector, where our financing activity reflects the need to balance energy transition\nwith energy security, and the reality that the world will continue to require fossil fuels in coming years\nas alternative energy sources scale up. We have consistently recognized the need to work toward achieving\nglobal environmental goals in a way that supports the world\u2019s growing energy demand to power societal and\neconomic progress and fosters equitable energy access, reliability, security and affordability. The Firm\ndoes not have a policy to prohibit fossil fuel finance in developing nations. Rather, JPMorgan Chase\nprovides financial services across industries and geographies, with the ambition to fulfill banking's\nessential purpose of helping people, businesses of all sizes and vital institutions achieve their goals. And\nin fact, third parties regularly recognize the Firm as one of the largest financiers of both clean and\ntraditional energy in the world.

The Energy Mix target\nencompasses a broader view of energy supply that\nbetter captures the system-wide substitution from\noil and natural gas to low-carbon fuels and zero-\ncarbon electricity generation and better reflects\nhow we support the world\u2019s energy transition. Use of\nthe Energy Mix target promotes financing that is\nsensitive to the supply of different types of energy\nwhich is inconsistent with the sort of trade- offs\nthe proposal implies.

WHEREAS: The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous\nPeoples and International Labour Organization Convention\n\n169 concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries are internationally-recognized\nstandards for Indigenous Peoples\u2019 rights. 1 Violation of these rights presents risks for JPMorgan that can\nadversely affect shareholder value, including reputational damage, project disruptions, and civil and\ncriminal liability. 2 JPMorgan has a history of financing projects and companies that violate Indigenous\nrights, including bankrolling the Dakota Access pipeline in 2016 3 and providing $1.8 billion to Enbridge\nbetween 2016 and 2020 to enable the widely opposed Enbridge Line 3 and Line 5 tar sands pipeline reroutes. 4\nIndigenous leaders from the Great Lakes tribes have called Enbridge\u2019s Line 5 pipeline reroute \u201can act of\ncultural genocide.\u201d 5 A 2022 ruling found that Line 5 was operating illegally on Bad River Band territory\nsince 2013. 6 Michigan\u2019s twelve federally recognized Tribal Nations requested President Biden to\ndecommission Line 5 in 2021, 7 noting Enbridge\u2019s deceptive tactics, poor environmental track record, and\nrisk of \u201ccatastrophic damage\u201d to Indigenous rights. 8 Companies like Enbridge, financed by JPMorgan,\nconsistently fail to meet the international standard of free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) with\naffected tribes. 9 JPMorgan is additionally the subject of ongoing protests for its role as the largest\nfinancier of oil and gas operations in the Amazon rainforest that pose \u201can existential threat\u201d to Indigenous\nPeoples. 10 For example, JPMorgan finances Gran Tierra Energy, which has been connected to Indigenous Rights\nviolations of the Inga and Pastos people in Columbia since 2012. 11 Despite making commitments to protect\nUNESCO sites, 12 JPMorgan finances PetroAmazonas, which operates in the Yasuni UNESCO Reserve despite clear\nIndigenous opposition. 13 Ecuadorian courts ruled in 2019 that Waorani Peoples were not adequately\nconsulted. 14 In August 2023, a referendum vote opted to halt drilling in Yasuni Park, which the company\nestimates will cost $1.2 billion in income. 15 JPMorgan faces reputational risk if its climate commitments\nare discredited by its own financing activities. 16 JPMorgan\u2019s human rights and risk management policies do\nnot clearly define FPIC, nor include guidance on how JPMorgan addresses companies with track records of\nviolating Indigenous rights. Though JPMorgan adheres to the Equator Principles to manage environmental and\nsocial risk, Indigenous experts have described them as \u201ccritically weak\u201d and not aligned with international\nhuman rights standards. 17 Effective policies that protect Indigenous rights are critical to managing\nmaterial risk.\n\n1 https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/declaration-on-the-rights-of-indigenous-\npeoples.html; https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:312314\n\n2 https://www.colorado.edu/program/fpw/sites/default/files/attached-\nfiles/social_cost_and_material_loss_0.pdf; https://amazonwatch.org/news/2022/0622-the-business-case-for-\nindigenous-rights\n\n3 https://www.democracynow.org/2016/9/9/who_is_funding_the_dakota_access\n\n4 https://www.ran.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/RAN-Briefing_Line3_KXL.pdf\n\n5 https://www.stopline3.org/news/women-leaders-line5\n\n6 https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/20515906551-1.pdf\n\n7 https://www.baymills.org/_files/ugd/869f65_f8e5288d82084540a9f0e7d5d6c0921f.pdf\n\n8 https://narf.org/nill/documents/20210510BayMills_banish_Enbridge.pdf?_ga=2.239143744.2105983367.1624287541\n-1503385769.1619537483\n\n9 https://www.colorado.edu/program/fpw/2022/06/13/united-nations-responds-second-time-violations-\nanishinaabe-rights-signals-priorities\n\n10 https://amazonwatch.org/news/2021/1111-cop26-frontline-communities-confront-jpmorgan-chase-on-violating-\nindigenous-rights-and-financing-the-climate-crisis\n\n11 https://exitamazonoilandgas.org/ ; https://news.mongabay.com/2022/06/how-colombia-disenfranchised-\nindigenous-inga-communities-in-favor-of-oil/\n\n12 https://whc.unesco.org/en/no-go-commitment/ ; https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-\nchase-and-co/documents/jpmc-esg-report-2022.pdf\n\n13 https://www.ft.com/content/8e1acf14-e467-11e9-b8e0-026e07cbe5b4\n\n14 https://www.ohchr.org/en/stories/2019/09/courts-rather-spears-used-defend-indigenous-territories\n\n15 https://news.mongabay.com/2023/08/ecuador-referendum-halts-oil-extraction-in-yasuni-national-park/\n\n16 https://climatejusticealliance.org/jpmorgan/\n\n17 https://www.colorado.edu/program/fpw/2019/11/19/first-peoples-response-ep4-critically-weak-equator-\nprinciples-puts-global-development\n                                                                                                            \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.962024 PROXY STATEMENT                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Table of ContentsSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nBOARD RESPONSE TO PROPOSAL 7 The Board of Directors\nrecommends that shareholders vote AGAINST this\nproposal for the following reasons:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u2022JPMorgan Chase supports fundamental principles of human rights across all our lines of business and in   \n  each region of the world in which we operate.                                                             \n  \u2022Part of the Firm\u2019s risk management process includes assessing our clients\u2019 approach to, and performance  \n  on, environmental and social (\u201cE&S\u201d) matters, including those related to Indigenous Peoples\u2019 rights,      \n  where appropriate.

The\nFirm\u2019s respect for the protection and preservation\nof human rights is guided by the principles set\nforth in the United Nations Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights and in the United Nations Guiding\nPrinciples for Business and Human Rights. Where\nrelevant, we consider a range of internationally\nrecognized principles to inform the Firm\u2019s approach\nin managing certain E&S risks, including the\nInternational Finance Corporation\u2019s (IFC) E&S\nPerformance Standards, which address the treatment\nof Indigenous Peoples and includes the principle of\nFree, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC). Part of the\nFirm\u2019s risk management process includes, where\nappropriate, assessing our clients\u2019 approach to, and\nperformance on, E&S matters, including those related\nto Indigenous Peoples\u2019 rights. The Firm maintains\nfirmwide policies and standards for the consistent\nidentification, escalation and management of\ntransactions and activities that present increased\nE&S risk, which include an escalation and due\ndiligence process conducted by E&S subject matter\nexperts when a client\u2019s transaction is considered to\nhave material impacts related to Indigenous Peoples.\nWhen material risk and impacts are identified with\nregard to Indigenous Peoples, our policies require\ndue diligence to be undertaken to review and confirm\nhow the projects and transactions demonstrate\neffective stakeholder engagement with affected\ncommunities, workers and, where relevant,\n\nIndigenous Peoples. We recognize that allegations\nmay represent potential risk, including reputation\nrisk, and our due diligence in relation to E&S\nissues includes due diligence and engagement with\nclients or prospective clients, negative media\nscreening and a review of allegations and clients\u2019\nrelated practices. Where negative media and/or\nallegations are identified, the Firm takes steps to\ndetermine materiality, mitigants and disposition.\nFurther, the Firm may engage directly with client\ncompanies to better understand their commitments,\ncapacities and track records pertaining to\nIndigenous Peoples. Some companies that operate in\nmultiple jurisdictions with actual and potential\nimpact to Indigenous Peoples\u2019 land and natural\nresources may take steps to mitigate those impacts\nwith strong policies and procedures regarding\nIndigenous Peoples. If significant issues are not\nresolved, including, specifically, issues pertaining\nto Indigenous Peoples, transactions may be\nescalated, when warranted, to a committee of the\nsenior leaders of the Firm. In its Supporting\nStatement, the proponent inaccurately describes the\nFirm\u2019s financing activities and cites a number of\nallegations against companies and projects, with\nreferences to subjective determinations by sources\nthat are not necessarily aligned with or\nknowledgeable of our shareholders\u2019 long-term\nfinancial interests. In contrast, our approach is to\nassess the substance of allegations, so we can make\ninformed decisions based on facts, as we strive to\nmeet our responsibilities to our clients and our\nshareholders while managing risk appropriately. The\nFirm\u2019s risk-based approach to E&S issues, including\nto those related to Indigenous Peoples, is intended\nto prevent adverse impacts and related reputation\nrisk. The proponent has failed to provide any\ncredible evidence of the ineffectiveness of this\napproach. The requested report would incur\nunnecessary expense and would not provide\nshareholders with meaningful additional information.\n                                       \n  The Board of Directors recommends a  \n  voteAGAINSTthis proposal.            \n                                       \nPROPOSAL 8 \u2014 PROXY VOTING ALIGNMENT The Maryknoll\nSisters of St. Dominic, Inc. has advised us that it\nintends to introduce the following resolution:\nWHEREAS: JPMorgan Asset Management (JPMAM) is a\nrespected global financial services leader. JPMAM\nunderstands the urgency and materiality of climate\nrisk and its negative impact on companies and the\neconomy. Jamie Dimon\u2019s 2023 letter to shareholders\nsays \u201cThe window for action to avert the costliest\nimpacts of global climate change is closing. \u2026 (We)\n\u2014 companies and investors \u2014 need to become more\nactive and involved in proxy issues each year to\nfoster better communication between the investors\nand the board of the companies they own\u201d. 1\n\n1 https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-\nrelations/2022/ar-ceo-letters.htm\n                                                                                                            \n  2024 PROXY STATEMENT97JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Table of ContentsSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nHowever, JPMAM\u2019s voting record on climate-related\nproposals has dropped dramatically putting us far\nbehind other investment firms. According to\nShareAction\u2019s 2022 ranking of the top 68 managers\nvoting record on 252 shareholder proposals, JPMAM\nranked 57 th of 68 asset managers assessed. In 2023\nJPMAM votes declined further on climate and racial\njustice resolutions, for example voting for only 15\nclimate resolutions out of 65 (from NPX filings of\nS&P 500 companies provided by Diligent). This proxy\nvoting record seems inconsistent with JPMAM\u2019s\nmembership in several investing initiatives: \u2022 The\nPrinciples for Responsible Investment (PRI), a\nglobal investor network representing over $120\ntrillion in assets, urges investors to vote on ESG\nissues prioritizing \u201caddressing systemic\nsustainability issues\u201d. \u2022 The Net Zero Asset\nManagers Initiative supports voting policies\nconsistent with net zero emissions by 2050. When\nvoting, JPMAM looks primarily at near-term risk for\na specific company, not risk to the whole portfolio\nwhich we believe is shortsighted. The PRI and the\nChartered Financial Analyst Institute recently\nannounced a new definition of stewardship: \u201cThe use\nof investor rights and influence to protect and\nenhance overall long-term value for clients and\nbeneficiaries, including the common economic,\nsocial, and environmental assets on which their\ninterests depend\u2026 Investor influence does not\nconstitute stewardship unless it is used to protect\nand enhance overall long-term value for clients and\nbeneficiaries. Using influence to promote short-term\nperformance or the performance of individual\ncompanies, industries, or markets, without regard to\noverall value, does not constitute stewardship.\u201d 2\nSimilarly, diversity issues are of material\nimportance to companies and investors. For years\nJPMAM worked to be a diversity leader, yet its proxy\nvoting on diversity issues are misaligned with its\nstated positions. We further believe fiduciary\nresponsibility requires evaluating the impacts of\nclimate and diversity risks on both portfolio\ncompanies and total portfolios. Thus, we request\nthis special review. RESOLVED: Shareowners request\nthe Board of Directors initiate a review of both\nJPMAM\u2019s 2023 proxy voting record and proxy voting\npolicies related to diversity and climate change and\nreport results to shareholders, prepared at\nreasonable cost, omitting proprietary information.\n\nSUPPORTING STATEMENT: Proponents suggest the review\ninclude the following: \u2022 Any misalignment of JPMAM\u2019s\npolicy and voting record with the goals of the Paris\nAgreement, industry initiatives of which JPMAM or\nthe bank is part and JPMAM\u2019s own stated policies. \u2022\nA comparison with the voting records of other major\ninvestment firms and mutual funds. \u2022 Recommendations\nfor strengthening voting guidelines on diversity and\nclimate-related issues. BOARD RESPONSE TO PROPOSAL 8\nThe Board of Directors recommends that shareholders\nvote AGAINST this proposal for the following\nreasons:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u2022J.P. Morgan Asset Management Inc. (\u201cJPMAM\u201d), as a fiduciary to its clients, is committed to voting       \n  proxies solely in the best long-term interests of its clients, without its decisions being constrained    \n  or dictated by its membership in organizations or pursuing other social initiatives or objectives.        \n  \u2022JPMAM already provides, and continues to enhance, detailed reporting through various channels to its     \n  clients concerning its stewardship activities including engagement and proxy voting.                      \n  \u2022Other asset managers\u2019 proxy voting records are irrelevant as JPMAM makes its own fiduciary decisions     \n  for its client accounts. Voting statistics are not determinative of whether JPMAM has acted in the best   \n  long-term interests of its client accounts and do not reflect the assessments JPMAM brings to individual  \n  shareholder proposals.                                                                                    \n  \u2022JPMAM\u2019s proxy voting practices are reasonably designed to appropriately focus on specific long-term      \n  risks and opportunities at individual companies with the objective of encouraging action that enhances    \n  long-term shareholder value for JPMAM\u2019s clients. The proponent asserts that proxy voting should,          \n  instead, be used at an individual company to enhance \u201ccommon economic, social, and environmental          \n  assets.\u201d This approach may cause negative unintended consequences in a wide variety of circumstances as   \n  it could be contrary to investment objectives or harm client accounts.                                    \n  \u2022JPMAM stewardship priorities include climate change and diversity issues, among others, due to the       \n  financially material risks we believe these issues may pose to the companies in which we invest. In       \n  addition, JPMAM already provides voting guidelines applicable to diversity and climate-related issues     \n  that allow JPMAM to review proposals case by case, taking into account what it believes is in the         \n  long-term best interests of its clients.                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \n2 https://www.unpri.org/investment-tools/definitions-for-responsible-investment-approaches/11874.article\n                                                                                                            \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.982024 PROXY STATEMENT                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Table of ContentsSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nJ.P. Morgan Asset Management Inc. (\"JPMAM\") 3 , as a\nfiduciary to its clients, is committed to voting\nproxies solely in the best long-term interests of\nits clients. JPMAM has adopted policies and\nprocedures that are reasonably designed to meet this\nobjective, including JPMAM\u2019s Global Proxy Voting\nGuidelines (the \u201cGuidelines\u201d), which include\ndetailed guidelines and procedures for voting\nproxies on particular types of issues. 4 While the\nGuidelines take into account various regulatory\nframeworks, business cultures, and business\npractices in different regions, all of the\nguidelines have been designed with the objective of\nencouraging action that enhances long-term\nshareholder value for JPMAM's clients.\n\nJPMAM votes proxies solely in what it believes is in\nthe best long-term interests of its client accounts\nwithout its decisions being constrained or dictated\nby its membership in organizations or pursuing other\nsocial initiatives or objectives. As a global asset\nmanager, JPMAM is a participant in a number of\norganizations, including certain regional\norganizations that focus on issues that JPMAM\nbelieves are financially material to our client\naccounts in specific regions. However, JPMAM makes\nits own independent investment and proxy voting\ndecisions, which are not constrained or dictated by\nits membership in organizations. To do otherwise\nwould be contrary to JPMAM\u2019s fiduciary duty to its\nclients.\n\nJPMAM already provides, and continues to enhance,\ndetailed reporting to its clients concerning its\nstewardship activities, including engagement and\nproxy voting. Such reporting includes JPMAM\u2019s annual\nInvestment Stewardship Report, filings on Form N-PX\nfor J.P. Morgan mutual funds and ETFs, and reporting\nto individual clients. This reporting includes\ndetailed information concerning how JPMAM voted\nparticular proxies as well as extensive information\non JPMAM\u2019s engagement on issues that it believes are\nfinancially material to the long-term interests of\nits client accounts, including risks associated with\nclimate change and human capital management. JPMAM\u2019s\ntransparency allows its clients to understand how\nJPMAM implements proxy voting in the best long-term\ninterests of their accounts.\n\nOther asset managers\u2019 proxy voting records are\nirrelevant. JPMAM makes its own fiduciary decisions\nfor its client accounts, including investment and\nproxy voting decisions. Given its fiduciary\nimperative, decisions of other asset managers or\nmutual funds should not inform the decisions that\nJPMAM makes for its clients or the development or\nimplementation of JPMAM\u2019s Guidelines. As a fiduciary\nto its clients, JPMAM does not follow other asset\nmanagers to determine how to best implement the\ninvestment strategies of JPMAM clients. In this\nrespect, we note that the Proponent has cited voting\nstatistics and comparisons with other asset\n\nmanagers for the proposition that JPMAM is looking\nonly at \u201cnear-term risk\u201d for companies held in\nclient accounts. However, voting statistics are not\ndeterminative of whether JPMAM has acted in the best\nlong-term interests of its client accounts. For\nexample, such statistics would not include\nmechanisms by which we can address issues such as\nthrough engagement with company management or voting\nagainst individual directors when it believes that\nthe company has not addressed material risks.\nMoreover, such statistics do not reflect the\nassessments and discretion that JPMAM brings to\nindividual shareholder proposals including\nbackground on engagement with companies.\n\nJPMAM\u2019s proxy voting practices are reasonably\ndesigned to appropriately focus on specific long-\nterm risks and opportunities at individual\ncompanies. The proponent asserts that proxy voting\nshould, instead, be used at an individual company to\nenhance \u201ccommon economic, social, and environmental\nassets.\u201d This approach may cause negative unintended\nconsequences in a wide variety of circumstances as\nit could be contrary to investment objectives or\nharm client accounts. For instance, asking an\nindividual publicly owned company to curtail certain\nactivity could result in the transfer of that\nactivity to other public companies or to privately\nowned or state-owned enterprises, that may have a\npoorer track record of environmental stewardship.\nSuch action would not only result in transfer of\neconomic returns to these other participants, but\ncould potentially lead to worse environmental and\nclimate outcomes and harm the portfolio.\n\nWhile the Proponent suggests \u201c strengthening voting\nguidelines on diversity and climate-related issues,\u201d\n(emphasis added) it is unclear what this entails. If\n\u201cstrengthening\u201d means voting in favor of more\nshareholder proposals and against management, such a\nprescriptive approach would undermine JPMAM\u2019s\nability to vote in the best long-term interests of\nits clients and substitute the judgement of JPMC\nshareholders for that of JPMAM as a fiduciary.\n\nJPMAM stewardship priorities include climate change\nand diversity issues, as part of human capital\nmanagement, due to the financially material risks we\nbelieve these issues pose to the companies in which\nwe invest. In addition, JPMAM already has voting\nguidelines applicable to diversity and climate-\nrelated issues. For many shareholder proposals, such\nguidelines contemplate case by case considerations\ndue to the complexity of the issues involved and the\nspecific facts and circumstances that are relevant\nto an individual company. For example, as reflected\nin the Guidelines specific to companies in North\nAmerica, environmental shareholder proposals are\nconsidered on a case-by-case basis, including the\nrelevance of the proposal to the particular issuer,\nas well as the prescriptiveness of the proposal\nitself.\n\n3 J.P.

For the sake of simplicity, this\nresponse refers to JPMAM.\n\n4 JPMAM has separate guidelines for different\nregions in which the issuer of a security is\norganized. In addition, for certain sustainable\ninvesting strategies, JPMAM has adopted proxy voting\nguidelines that replace Environmental and Social\nShareholder Issues of the North American Proxy\nVoting Guidelines and apply only to proxy voting\nwith respect to shares held in accounts whose owners\nhave chosen to invest in certain sustainable\nstrategies.\n                                                                                                            \n  2024 PROXY STATEMENT99JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Table of ContentsSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nWe believe such guidelines are appropriately\ntailored to allow JPMAM to review shareholder\nproposals considering what it believes is in the\nbest long-term interests of its clients.

WHEREAS: The World Bank estimates\nthat by 2030 nearly two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor will live in settings characterized by fragility,\nconflict, and violence, 1 and thus may have heightened vulnerability to widespread human rights abuses and\nviolations of national or international law. Given the\n\nse endemic risks, the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Equator\nPrinciples call on companies to conduct heightened human rights due diligence 2 and analyze potential\nviolations of international humanitarian law during human rights assessments. 3 CAHRA also include a higher\nprevalence of material risks. The International Finance Corporation reports that companies in conflict-\naffected settings \u201cface business risks that are much greater than those in other emerging markets,\u201d\nincluding destruction of physical capital, deaths and injuries, weak state control, and supply-chain\ndisruptions. 4 A recent survey of executives indicated 97 percent of respondents altered investment plans\nand over one-third relocated operations, due to geopolitical volatility. 5 Multilateral organizations,\nstates, and accounting bodies are passing legislation on mandatory due diligence 6 and sustainable\ninvestment reporting in the European Union, 7 and calling for companies to report on human rights and\nconflict as material risks. 8 In a 2022 report, \u201cconflict risk\u201d was the second leading environmental,\nsocial, and governance criterion among institutional investors representing over $6 trillion assets under\nmanagement. 9 As the world\u2019s largest bank by market capitalization, JPMC has operations and relationships in\nnumerous CAHRA where it has counterparties, partners, or clients that are implicated in corruption, armed\nconflict, violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, and environmental degradation.\nExamples include JPMC providing lending and underwriting services for state agencies and affiliated\ncompanies in China, 10 Guinea, 11 Kazakhstan, 12 Mozambique, 13 Myanmar, 14 Russia, 15 Saudi Arabia, 16 and\nVenezuela 17 \u2013 JPMC\u2019s Human Rights Policy 18 and Environmental and Social Policy Framework 19\nnotwithstanding. JPMC trails peers that adopted measures to mitigate these risks, including ABN AMRO Bank\nN.V., 20 Citi Group, 21 and ANZ. 22\n\n1 https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/fragilityconflictviolence/overview\n\n2 https://www.undp.org/publications/heightened-human-rights-due-diligence-business-conflict-affected-\ncontexts-guide\n\n3 https://equator-principles.com/app/uploads/Human_Rights_Assessment_Sept2020.pdf\n\n4 https://www.ifc.org/content/dam/ifc/doc/mgrt/201902-ifc-fcs-study.pdf\n\n5 https://assets.ey.com/content/dam/ey-sites/ey-com/en_us/topics/ceo/ey-ceo-outlook-pulse-survey-\njanuary-2023-global-report.pdf\n\n6 https://commission.europa.eu/business-economy-euro/doing-business-eu/corporate-sustainability-due-\ndiligence_en\n\n7 https://finance.ec.europa.eu/sustainable-finance/disclosures/sustainability-related-disclosure-financial-\nservices-sector_en\n\n8 http://www.entegreraporlamatr.org/tr//mailing/25122020/images/Reporting-on-enterprise-value_climate-\nprototype_Dec20.pdf\n\n9 https://trends2022highlights.com/\n\n10 https://www.bankingonclimatechaos.org/\n\n11 https://www.banktrack.org/project/lefa_gold_mine\n\n12 https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/from-us/extractives-in-eastern-europe-central-asia/investor-\nsummary/\n\n13 https://www.banktrack.org/project/mozambique_lng\n\n14 https://www.banktrack.org/download/investing_in_the_military_cartel_19_international_banks_invest_over_us\n65_billion_in_companies_linked_to_myanmar_regime_and_atrocities/\n210726_final_investing_in_the_military_cartel_updated_report.pdf\n\n15 https://putin100.org/index.html#ranking\n\n16 https://bankingonclimatechaos.org/\n\n17 https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/global-banks-defy-u-s-crackdowns-by-serving-oligarchs-\ncriminals-and-terrorists/\n\n18 https://www.jpmorganchase.com/about/our-business/human-rights\n\n19 https://www.banktrack.org/download/environmental_and_social_policy_framework_10/211012_environmentalandso\ncialpolicyframeworkdatedoct82021.pdf\n\n20\nhttps://assets.ctfassets.net/1u811bvgvthc/DJ2luR6Luk4gy0vpHqXZp/bbae98ca816b61efe381cd8150b9d740/ABN_AMRO_-\n_Human_Rights_Report_2022.pdf\n\n21 https://www.citigroup.com/rcs/citigpa/storage/public/Global-ESG-Report-2022.pdf\n\n22 https://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/en/knowledge/publications/cac8443e/anz-sets-a-global-precedent-with-\nadoption-of-human-rights-grievance-mechanism\n                                                                                                            \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.1002024 PROXY STATEMENT                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Table of ContentsSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nBOARD RESPONSE TO PROPOSAL 9 The Board of Directors\nrecommends that shareholders vote AGAINST this\nproposal for the following reasons:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u2022JPMorgan Chase supports fundamental principles of human rights across all our lines of business and in   \n  each region of the world where we have a presence.                                                        \n  \u2022JPMorgan Chase considers a range of internationally recognized principles to inform the Firm\u2019s approach  \n  in managing these risks, as indicated in our ESG Report.                                                  \n  \u2022Part of the Firm\u2019s risk management process includes assessing our clients\u2019 approach to environmental     \n  and social (\u201cE&S\u201d) matters, including those related to human rights, where appropriate.

Some\ncompanies and projects within our portfolio may be\nlinked to areas where there are ongoing or potential\nconflicts arising from geo- and socio-political\ninstability. As these conflicts have the potential\nto increase risk, the decision to support companies\nand projects in these areas needs to be considered\nholistically, including the benefit to communities\nof continued financial services and support.\nJPMorgan Chase considers a range of internationally\nrecognized principles to inform the Firm\u2019s approach\nin managing these risks, as indicated in our ESG\nReport. A part of the Firm\u2019s risk management process\nincludes assessing our clients\u2019 approach to\nenvironmental and social (\u201cE&S\u201d) matters, including\nthose related to human rights, where appropriate.

When material\nrisk and impacts related to human rights are\nidentified or due diligence indicates unresolved\nquestions\n\nabout the existence of such practices, the Firm may\nengage directly with clients or prospective clients\nto better understand their commitments, capacities\nand track records. Engagements may focus on the\nmaterial issues around environmental and social risk\nand impacts, including those regarding the client's\noperations, or otherwise affected by the client\u2019s\nactivities.

Further, the proponent claims \u2013\nwithout providing any detail \u2013 that the Firm\u2019s\napproach to human rights lags behind three other\nbanks. We disagree and believe that our approach to\nhuman rights risk management is appropriate and\nindustry-aligned. The Firm conducts its business\nbased on facts as we strive to meet our\nresponsibility to clients and shareholders. Where\nthere are allegations of human rights violations\nassociated with a client or prospective client\u2019s\ntransaction, our policies require that a review is\nundertaken and robust diligence conducted to\ndetermine the accuracy of the allegations. When\nconcerns are identified, steps are taken to\ndetermine factual details, materiality, mitigants\nand disposition. The proponent is requesting a\nreport prepared by an independent third-party, but\nhas not explained how a third- party would prepare\nsuch a report or how such a report would benefit\nshareholders. The Board believes that the Firm has\nalready adopted and implemented appropriate policies\nand practices that meaningfully address the concerns\nraised by the proponent.

The Board shall retain the\noption to seek shareholder approval at an annual\nmeeting after material terms are agreed upon.\nGenerous performance-based pay can sometimes be\njustified but shareholder ratification of golden\nparachutes better aligns management pay with\nshareholder interests. This proposal is relevant\neven if there are current golden parachute limits. A\nlimit on golden parachutes is like a speed limit. A\nspeed limit by itself does not guarantee that the\nspeed limit will never be exceeded. Like this\nproposal the rules associated with a speed limit\nprovide consequences if the limit is exceeded. With\nthis proposal the consequences are a non-binding\nshareholder vote is required for unreasonably high\ngolden parachutes. This proposal places no limit on\nlong-term equity pay or any other type pay. This\nproposal thus has no impact on the ability to\nattract executive talent or discourage the use of\nlong-term equity pay because it places no limit on\ngolden parachutes. It simply requires that extra\nlarge golden parachutes be subject to a non-binding\nshareholder vote at a shareholder meeting already\nscheduled for other matters. This proposal is\nrelevant because the annual say on executive pay\nvote does not have a separate section for approving\nor rejecting golden parachutes.

There are no employment agreements, and Named Executive     \n  Officers (\u201cNEOs\u201d) are not entitled to special severance benefits; all employees participate at the same   \n  level of severance that is capped at 52 weeks of salary or $400,000 for U.S. based employees.             \n  \u2022The key terms of the proposal are not compatible with our Firm's compensation program for our NEOs,      \n  which is designed to effectively align executive interests with shareholder value. Implementing the       \n  proposal would introduce challenges in interpretation and execution, potentially undermining the          \n  well-established balance we have achieved in our executive compensation structure. Specifically, the      \n  proposal would require shareholder approval of severance packages \u201cthat exceed 2.99 times the sum of the  \n  executive\u2019s base salary plus target short-term bonus,\u201d which is not appropriate based on the structure    \n  of our compensation program. We do not have a separate short-term bonus program, nor do we set target     \n  pay levels for our NEOs.                                                                                  \n  \u2022There are further ambiguities and inconsistencies in the proposal on the definition and treatment of     \n  equity awards; the inclusion of equity awards does not align with general market practices, particularly  \n  as it relates to the much broader definition of golden parachute as described in the proposal.            \n  \u2022The Firm\u2019s compensation philosophy promotes a fair and well-governed, long-term approach to              \n  compensation, including pay-for-performance practices that effectively align the interests of executives  \n  and shareholders. Compensation for NEOs is subject to strong Board oversight.                             \n  \u2022The Firm conducts an extensive shareholder outreach and engagement program to directly solicit and       \n  discuss feedback with our shareholders; during which, our shareholders have not raised specific feedback  \n  or concerns relating to the Firm\u2019s severance policies or\u00a0practices.                                       \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.1022024 PROXY STATEMENT                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Table of ContentsSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \n                                                      \n  \u2022In addition to our shareholder engagement          \n  program, shareholders have a detailed view into     \n  our severance policies and have a number of         \n  mechanisms to express their views on the Firm\u2019s     \n  executive compensation program, including an        \n  annual Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation      \n  (\u201cSay on Pay\u201d). Furthermore, the Firm\u2019s Long-Term   \n  Incentive Plan (\u201cLTIP\u201d) is approved by              \n  shareholders and governs the specified provisions   \n  in the equity award agreements on the treatment of  \n  unvested equity awards under certain termination    \n  events.                                             \n                                                      \nAs described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis (\u201cCD&A\u201d) in this proxy statement, the Firm does not\nprovide golden parachute agreements, including any accelerated cash/equity payments or special benefits upon\na change in control. There are no employment agreements, and NEOs are not entitled to special severance\nbenefits; all employees participate at the same level of severance. All employees, including NEOs, are\neligible for the same severance benefits, based on years of service, capped at 52 weeks with a maximum\ncredited salary (i.e., capped at $400,000 for U.S. NEOs, or \u00a3275,000 in the case of Ms. Lake). Moreover,\nNEOs are not entitled to any special benefits upon termination. NEOs\u2019 potential termination payments,\nwhether for death, retirement, or involuntary termination without cause, are disclosed annually in the proxy\nstatement (see \"VII. 2023 Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control\" on page 69), and the\nFirm is required to disclose the material terms of any such agreement and actual termination payments to\nNEOs. Additionally, the Firm is required to disclose the adoption, amendment, or termination of any material\ncompensation contracts or arrangements with an NEO. All such disclosures are to be made through a Form 8-K\nfiling or as an exhibit to the quarterly or annual report. The proposal would require the Board to \u201cretain\nthe option to seek shareholder approval at an annual meeting after material terms are agreed upon.\u201d We\nbelieve this after- the- fact requirement is not as effective as our current practices. The shareholder\nproposal should also be rejected due to its inherent ambiguity, which leaves room for misinterpretation and\nhinders our ability to effectively implement and measure its intended outcomes. This proposal may be\nlimited, as entitled, to \u201cgolden parachute\u201d payments that are traditionally awarded in the uncommon event of\na change of control \u2013 or interpreted to mean that it should apply to payments awarded under any termination\ntrigger, including in the event of retirement, employment termination or resignation. In either case, the\nproposal is impractical and not founded on the Firm\u2019s practices. For example, whenever there was an NEO\ndeparture, the proposal would seemingly require shareholder approval of severance packages \u201cthat exceed 2.99\ntimes the sum of the executive\u2019s base salary plus target short-term bonus.\u201d The proponent does not define\nthe reference to a short-term bonus, and thus, it is uncertain what would actually be factored into the\nproposed 2.99 calculation given that the Firm\u2019s compensation program does\n\nnot include separate short-term bonuses or targets for short- term bonuses, variable compensation or total\ncompensation. These newly conceived bonuses would supplant the pay decisions and processes of the\nCompensation & Management Development Committee (\u201cCMDC\u201d) which first determines Operating Committee (\u201cOC\u201d)\nmembers\u2019 total compensation levels and then establishes the appropriate variable pay mix between an annual\ncash award and long-term equity, including PSUs and RSUs. There are further ambiguities and inconsistencies\nin the proposal on the definition and treatment of equity awards under different termination scenarios. The\ninclusion of equity awards does not align with general market practices, particularly as it relates to the\nmuch broader definition of golden parachute as described in the proposal. The suggestion that this proposal\nhas passed at other companies is misleading given that the four companies referenced by the proponent all\nhave employment agreements in place that provide for additional severance benefits of the type that do not\nexist at JPMorgan Chase. The Firm\u2019s compensation philosophy promotes a fair and well-governed, long-term\napproach to compensation, including pay-for-performance practices that are designed to attract and retain\ntop talent from all backgrounds, to be responsive to and aligned with shareholders, and to encourage a\nculture that supports our Purpose, Values, Business Principles and strategic framework. Our pay-for-\nperformance compensation program is designed to align the long-term interests of our employees with those of\nour shareholders by emphasizing sustained value and reinforcing personal accountability. NEOs\u2019 personal\naccountability is reinforced through sound pay practices, including: pay that is based on performance linked\nto shareholder value; a majority of variable pay in deferred equity; strong clawback provisions; risk,\ncontrols and conduct considerations; and strong shareholding requirements. Further, NEO compensation is\nsubject to strong Board oversight. The CMDC assists the Board in its oversight of the Firm\u2019s compensation\nprinciples and practices, compensation and qualified benefit programs, and OC performance assessments and\ncompensation, among other responsibilities, and the CMDC holds an annual joint session with the Risk\nCommittee to review Firmwide HR and compensation practices. The Firm conducts an extensive shareholder\noutreach and engagement program; during which, our shareholders have not raised specific feedback or\nconcerns relating to the Firm\u2019s severance policies or practices. Shareholders can also voice their support\nor concerns on the Firm\u2019s executive compensation program through the annual Say on Pay vote. Our Board\nvalues the feedback it gets from shareholders through the vote and through engagement, and has a\ndemonstrable history of being responsive. For example, as described in our 2023 Proxy Statement, the Board\nmade several enhancements to our executive compensation program and disclosures in response to our 2022 Say\non Pay vote and shareholder feedback from 172 shareholder meetings with 118 shareholders representing 49% of\nthe\n                                                                                                            \n  2024 PROXY STATEMENT103JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Table of ContentsSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nFirm\u2019s outstanding common stock.

In addition, the Firm\u2019s LTIP\nis approved by shareholders and governs the\nspecified provisions in the equity award agreements\non the treatment of unvested equity awards under\ncertain termination events. The LTIP was last\napproved by 96% of our shareholders at our 2021\nAnnual Meeting. Generally, unvested equity awards\nare forfeited when an employee leaves the Firm.\nUnder limited termination scenarios such as death,\nretirement and involuntary termination without\ncause, unvested equity awards continue to vest in\naccordance with their terms. In very limited\nscenarios where an employee is going to work in a\ngovernment office capacity and the role requires\nthem to divest JPM stock because of potential\nconflicts of interest, the Firm would consider\npotential accelerated vesting. We believe the Firm\u2019s\ncurrent compensation practices effectively align the\nlong-term interests of executives and shareholders.\nOur shareholders have detailed information about NEO\ncompensation and potential and actual termination\npayments, including the fact that there are no\ngolden parachute agreements, including any\naccelerated cash/equity payments or special benefits\nupon a change in control and severance provisions\nspecifically for NEOs. Shareholders have multiple\nopportunities to provide feedback concerning\ncompensation practices, and the Board has\ndemonstrated meaningful responses to feedback. We\nbelieve the proposed policy is unnecessary and would\nprovide no meaningful additional benefits to\nshareholders.\n                                       \n  The Board of Directors recommends a  \n  voteAGAINSTthis proposal.            \n                                       \nPROPOSAL 11 \u2013 REPORT ON RESPECTING WORKFORCE CIVIL LIBERTIES Bowyer Research Inc. on behalf of The Bahnsen\nFamily Trust Dated July 14 th 2003, has advised us that it intends to introduce the following resolution:\nSUPPORTING STATEMENT: JPMorgan Chase is one of the largest companies in the United States and employs over\n240,000 people. As a major employer, Chase should respect the free speech and religious freedom of its\nemployees. Chase is legally required to comply with many laws prohibiting discrimination against employees\non a variety of factors, including religion and sometimes political affiliation.\n\nRespecting diverse views also allows Chase to attract the most qualified talent, promote a healthy and\ninnovative business culture, serve its diverse customer base, and contribute to a healthy economic market\nand marketplace of ideas. Despite this, the 2023 Viewpoint Diversity Index, 1 in which Chase scored a mere\n9%, notes that the Company does not provide its employees with protection against viewpoint discrimination.\nWhile the Company expressly condemns and prohibits discrimination based on a variety of characteristics,\nincluding race, religious beliefs, gender, and others, it maintains no such protection against employees of\ndiverse political beliefs. Many companies also alienate their own employees by taking divisive stances on\npolitical issues. For example, many companies have adopted radical stances and policies on abortion, Chase\nincluded. The Company funds abortion provider Planned Parenthood and has pledged coverage for \u201cmedically\nnecessary transition-related care\u201d for its employees and their children. The 2023 Index also found that 78%\nof scored companies discriminate against religious nonprofits in their charitable giving and 63% give money\nto legislation that undermines fundamental First Amendment freedoms. According to the Freedom at Work\nsurvey, 60% of employees were concerned that their company would punish them for expressing their religious\nor political views at work, and 54% said they feared the same for sharing these views even on their private\nsocial media accounts. 2 These concerns become relevant in the case of Chase. As per the 1792 Exchange\u2019s\n2023 report, 3 Chase has been accused of terminating the accounts of politically 4 conservative 5 customers\n6 without disclosing the rationale for such debanking. Companies may also face additional legal liability\nfor DE&I programs that make distinctions based on race or that discriminate based on religious practices,\nper the recent Supreme Court decisions in Students for Fair Admission v. Harvard and Groff v DeJoy . In\nlight of these risks, the Company must take immediate steps to assess potential shortcomings and act to\nremedy these concerns. RESOLVED: Shareholders request the Board of Directors conduct an evaluation and issue\na civil rights and non- discrimination report within the next year, at reasonable cost and excluding\nproprietary information and disclosure of anything that would constitute an admission of pending litigation,\nevaluating how Chase\u2019s policies and practices impact employees and prospective employees based on their\nreligion (including religious views) or political views, and the risks those impacts present to Chase\u2019s\nbusiness.\n\n1 https://www.viewpointdiversityscore.org/company/jpmorgan-chase\n\n2 https://www.viewpointdiversityscore.org/polling\n\n3 https://1792exchange.com/pdf/?c_id=462\n\n4 https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/chase-bank-allegedly-shutters-bank-account-religious-freedom-\nnonprofit-demands-donor-list\n\n5 https://flvoicenews.com/retail-health-company-has-chase-accounts-suddenly-terminated-owner-critical-of-\ncovid-vaccines-fda/\n\n6 https://missouriindependent.com/2021/11/17/donald-trump-jr-event-canceled-after-chase-bank-ends-deal-with-\nmissouri-conservative-group/\n                                                                                                            \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.1042024 PROXY STATEMENT                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Table of ContentsSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nBOARD RESPONSE TO PROPOSAL 11 The Board of Directors\nrecommends that shareholders vote AGAINST this\nproposal for the following reasons:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u2022We believe that having an inclusive workforce, a supportive and inclusive work environment where         \n  individuals from all backgrounds and geographies feel valued and respected, and creating more equitable   \n  access to opportunities in our business pursuits, makes our company stronger, our business more           \n  profitable and our institution a better global corporate citizen.                                         \n  \u2022The Firm has in place a Code of Conduct, Business Principles and anti-discrimination policies that are   \n  intended to promote equal opportunity and prevent\u00a0discrimination and harassment by or against\u00a0employees.  \n  \u2022The Firm maintains internal processes to create a culture that empowers employees to raise concerns\u00a0and  \n  utilizes various surveys to assess employee\u00a0sentiment.                                                    \n  \u2022There is no evidence of discrimination based on religion or political views.

This starts, first and foremost, with\ntaking a broad lens when sourcing talent and building and fostering an inclusive work environment where our\nemployees are respected, trusted and encouraged to bring their most productive selves to work. Across the\nFirm, we continually work to create and reinforce a culture of respect, equity and inclusion and to leverage\nthe unique perspectives and experiences of our employees to deliver against Firm objectives. In this regard,\nwe are proud of the industry recognition of our culture - including being named one of the Time100 Most\nInfluential Companies of 2023 and being placed in the top five of Fortune\u2019s \u201cWorld\u2019s Most Admired Companies\u201d\nlist for the second consecutive year.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s Code of Conduct (\u201cCode\u201d) 7 , Business Principles and anti-discrimination policies and practices\nmake it clear that the Firm does not tolerate discrimination. In addition, our Code states that diversity\nand inclusion are priorities at the Firm. The Code is based upon a recognition that a workforce that\nincludes individuals with diverse backgrounds and perspectives fosters creativity; and that an inclusive\nwork environment that allows all employees, regardless of background, to bring their most productive selves\nto the workplace\n\nenables the Firm to best address a wide variety of needs and opportunities in the marketplace. It also\nreinforces the Firm\u2019s respect for the right to engage in personal political activity. Our Business\nPrinciples further reflect our culture to strive to build an inclusive work environment that draws on and\ndevelops the best talent. Employees and directors of the Firm are subject to the Code. Everyone is required\nto annually affirm that they have read, understand, and are in compliance with the Code, and they also\nreceive regular conduct and culture trainings. Employees are also required to promptly report any potential\nor actual violations of the Code, Firm policy, law or regulation related to our business. The Firm\u2019s Equal\nOpportunity, Anti-Discrimination and Anti- Harassment Statement (the \"Statement\") also describes our\ncommitment to maintaining a safe, productive, diverse, inclusive, professional, collegial and secure work\nenvironment in which all individuals are treated with respect and dignity. The Statement clearly states that\nthe Firm will not tolerate discrimination, harassment or inappropriate conduct by or against employees.\nGiven the proposal\u2019s concern with religious and political discrimination, we note that the Statement\nspecifically includes \u201ccreed, religion and religious affiliation\u201d among the prohibited bases for\ndiscrimination. In addition, the Firm provides reasonable religious accommodations to enable the expression\nof employees\u2019 religious beliefs, observances and practices, while balancing their work responsibilities and\nrequirements. The Firm maintains internal processes to create a culture that empowers employees to raise\nconcerns. This provides an opportunity for the Firm to gain insight into concerns about its workplace\nenvironment, recognize potential risks, and gauge the effectiveness of policies such as those related to\nanti-discrimination, anti-harassment, and anti-retaliation. The proposal misleadingly cites findings of a\nsurvey, in which the Firm did not participate. The proposal also raises general accusations that \u201cmany\ncompanies\u201d alienate their own employees, without specifying their application to the Firm. At JPMorgan\nChase, we rely on various surveys to assess employee sentiment, such as employee exit surveys and Employee\nOpinion Surveys that gather feedback on areas such as employee engagement, operational excellence, and\ncommitment to integrity, fairness, and responsibility. Through these surveys, the Firm receives additional\ninsight into where things are going well and areas presenting opportunities for improvement. In addition,\nthe Firm is subject to comprehensive supervision of its culture and conduct programs by federal banking\nsupervisory regulators on an ongoing basis. This oversight involves substantive reviews of the Firm\u2019s\npractices related to manager accountability, performance management, compensation impacts, conduct controls,\ncultural expectations, employee compliance programs, and other\n\n7 https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-chase-and-co/documents/code-of-conduct.pdf\n                                                                                                            \n  2024 PROXY STATEMENT105JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Table of ContentsSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nprocesses and procedures. Such oversight adds\nanother layer of accountability for the Firm and its\nemployees and provides additional insights to inform\nour practices. In requesting a report on the Firm\u2019s\nrespect for employees\u2019 religious and political\nviews, the proposal does not provide any credible\nevidence that the Firm\u2019s policies and practices have\nbeen ineffective. The Supporting Statement\nmisleadingly cites survey results and unfounded\nallegations of debanking, and references one aspect\nof our comprehensive employee benefits without any\ncontext. It does not make a compelling case that\nthere are actual concerns regarding employee\ndiscrimination based on religion or political views.\nTo produce the proposed report based on these\nallegations, the Firm would have to divert resources\nfrom the meaningful work the Firm is already doing\nto create a more diverse and inclusive business.

If you have an interest in\nthe JPMorgan Chase Common Stock Fund through the\nPlan, your vote will provide voting instructions to\nthe trustee. If no voting instructions are given,\nthe trustee will vote uninstructed shares in the\nsame proportion as voted shares.\n\nWHICH PROPOSALS ARE CONSIDERED \u201cROUTINE\u201d OR \u201cNON-\nROUTINE\u201d?\n\nThe ratification of the appointment of the\nindependent registered public accounting firm is\nconsidered to be a \u201croutine\u201d matter under NYSE\nrules. A bank, brokerage firm, broker-dealer or\nother similar organization may generally vote in\ntheir discretion on routine matters, if specific\nvoting instructions are not received from a\nbeneficial owner.\n\nAll other proposals are considered \u201cnon-routine\u201d\nunder NYSE rules and are therefore \u201cnon-\ndiscretionary\u201d matters. This\n\nmeans your bank, brokerage firm, broker-dealer or\nother similar organization may not vote your shares\nwithout instructions from you. If the organization\nthat holds your shares does not receive instructions\nfrom you on how to vote on one of these non-routine\nmatters, it will so inform the inspector of\nelection. This is generally referred to as a \u201cbroker\nnon-vote.\u201d\n\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOLDING SHARES AS A\nSHAREHOLDER OF RECORD AND AS A BENEFICIAL OWNER OF\nSHARES HELD IN STREET NAME?\n\nShareholder of Record: If your shares of JPMorgan\nChase common stock are registered directly in your\nname with our transfer agent, Computershare, you are\nconsidered a \u201cshareholder of record\u201d of those\nshares.\n\nBeneficial Owner of Shares Held in Street Name: If\nyour shares are held in an account at a bank,\nbrokerage firm, broker- dealer or other similar\norganization, you are a beneficial owner of shares\nheld in street name. In that case, you will have\nreceived these proxy materials, as well as a voting\ninstruction form, from the organization holding your\nshares and, as a beneficial owner, you have the\nright to direct the organization as to how to vote\nthem.

Unless the Board decides to reject the offer or to postpone the effective date, the\nresignation shall become effective 45 days after the date of the election.\n\n4 The result of the advisory vote on compensation is not binding on the Board, whether or not the resolution\nis passed under the standard described above.\n                                                                                                            \n  2024 PROXY STATEMENT109JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                                    \n  INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL SHAREHOLDER MEETING  \n                                                    \nIS MY VOTE CONFIDENTIAL?\n\nProxy instructions, ballots and voting tabulations\nthat identify individual shareholders are handled in\na manner that protects your voting privacy.

TCE, ROTCE, TBVPS and Pre-tax income ex. LLR are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the\nFirm\u2019s common stockholders\u2019 equity (i.e., total stockholders\u2019 equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and\nidentifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax\nliabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm\u2019s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average\nTCE. TBVPS represents the Firm\u2019s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Pre-tax income\nex. LLR represents income on a managed basis before income tax expense (pre-tax income) excluding the change\nin loan loss reserves. This reflects the exclusion of the portion of the provision for credit losses\nattributable to the change in allowance for credit losses. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as\nwell as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm\u2019s use of equity. Pre-tax income ex. LLR is utilized by\nthe Firm to assess the Firm's operating performance and management believes this information helps investors\nunderstand the effect on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm\u2019s performance.\nThe following tables provide reconciliations and calculations of these measures for the periods presented.\n\n2. In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results on a\n\"managed\" basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews\nthe results of the lines of business on a \u201cmanaged\u201d basis. The Firm\u2019s definition of managed basis starts, in\neach case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net\nrevenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent basis.\nAccordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax- exempt securities is presented in\nthe managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures\nallow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-\nexempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income\ntax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the\nlines of business.\n\nNon-GAAP reconciliations\n
