The addition reflects the increased\nweight placed on the adverse scenarios\nin the current year, due to the ongoing\neffects associated with higher\ninflation, changes in monetary policy,\nand geopolitical risks, including the\nwar in Ukraine, and a modest\ndeterioration in the Firm's\nmacroeconomic forecast . The increase\nin the allowance for loan losses was\nalso driven by loan growth in Card and\nCB in the second quarter of 2022, and\nclient-specific Russia and Russia-\nassociated downgrades in CIB and AWM in\nthe first quarter of 2022.\n                                        15                                        \nThere was a $39 million reduction in\nthe allowance for

more detailed\ndiscussion of loans and the allowance\nfor loan losses.\n\nAccrued interest and accounts\nreceivable increased due to higher\nclient receivables related to client-\ndriven activities in Markets, including\nprime brokerage.\n\nGoodwill, MSRs and other intangibles\nincreased, reflecting:\n\n\u2022 higher MSRs as a result of changes in\nmarket interest rates and net\nadditions, partially offset by the\nrealization of expected cash flows, and\n\n\u2022 higher goodwill associated with the\nacquisitions of Frosch Travel Group,\nLLC in CCB and Volkswagen Payments S.A.\nin CIB.\n\nRefer to Note 14 for additional\ninformation.\n\nOther assets increased largely due to\nthe higher cash collateral placed with\ncounterparties, as well as higher\nsecurities financing

In addition,\nthere is a Corporate segment.\n\nThe business segments are determined\nbased on the products and services\nprovided, or the type of customer\nserved, and they reflect the manner in\nwhich financial information is\ncurrently evaluated by the Firm\u2019s\nOperating Committee. Segment results\nare presented on a managed basis. Refer\nto Explanation and Reconciliation of\nthe Firm\u2019s use of Non-GAAP Financial\nMeasures on pages 18-19 for a\ndefinition of managed basis.\n\nDescription of business segment\nreporting methodology\n\nResults of the business segments are\nintended to present each segment as if\nit were a stand-alone business. The\nmanagement reporting process that\nderives business segment results\nincludes the allocation of certain\nincome and expense items. The Firm\nperiodically assesses the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting\nclassifications used for segment\nreporting, and further refinements may\nbe implemented in future periods. The\nFirm also assesses the level of capital\nrequired for each LOB on at least an\nannual basis. The Firm\u2019s LOBs also\nprovide various business metrics which\nare utilized by the Firm and its\ninvestors and analysts in assessing\nperformance.\n\nRevenue sharing\n\nWhen business segments join efforts to\nsell products and services to the\nFirm\u2019s clients, the participating\nbusiness segments may agree to share\nrevenue from those transactions.\nRevenue is generally recognized in the\nsegment responsible for the related\nproduct or service, with allocations to\nthe other segment(s) involved in the\ntransaction. The segment results\nreflect these revenue-sharing\nagreements.\n\nFunds transfer pricing\n\nFunds transfer pricing (\u201cFTP\u201d) is the\nprocess by which the Firm allocates\ninterest income and expense to the LOBs\nand Other Corporate and transfers the\nprimary interest rate risk and\nliquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.\n\nThe funds transfer pricing process\nconsiders the interest rate risk and\nliquidity risk characteristics of\nassets and liabilities and off-balance\nsheet products. Periodically the\nmethodology and assumptions utilized in\nthe FTP process are adjusted to reflect\neconomic conditions and other factors,\nwhich may impact the allocation of net\ninterest income to the segments.\n\nForeign exchange risk\n\nForeign exchange risk is transferred\nfrom the LOBs and Other Corporate to\nTreasury and CIO for certain revenues\nand expenses. Treasury and CIO manages\nthese risks centrally and reports the\nimpact of foreign exchange rate\nmovements related to the transferred\nrisk in its results.\n\nCapital allocation\n\nThe amount of capital assigned to each\nbusiness segment is referred to as\nequity. Periodically, the assumptions\nand methodologies used to allocate\ncapital are reassessed and as a result,\nthe capital allocated to the LOBs may\nchange. Refer to Line of business\nequity on page 47, and page 93 of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K for\nadditional information on capital\nallocation.\n\nRefer to Business Segment Results

Noninterest revenue was flat at\n$6.3 billion.\n\nRevenue from Asset Management was $4.5\nbillion, up 1%, driven by:\n\n\u2022 higher asset management fees\nreflecting the removal of most money\nmarket fund fee waivers in the second\nquarter of 2022, and strong cumulative\nnet inflows into\n                                        37                                        \nlong-term

prior\nyear.\n\nRevenue from Global Private Bank was\n$4.2 billion, up 11%, driven by:\n\n\u2022 higher loans and wider spreads, and\n\n\u2022 growth in deposits, net of margin\ncompression,\n\npartially offset by\n\n\u2022 lower brokerage fees on reduced\nvolume, and\n\n\u2022 lower performance fees.\n\nNoninterest expense was $5.8 billion,\nup 12%, driven by higher structural\nexpense and investments in the\nbusiness, including compensation, and\nhigher volume- and revenue-related\nexpense.\n\nThe provision for credit losses was\n$198 million, driven by a net addition\nto the allowance for credit losses,\ncompared with a net benefit of $131\nmillion in the prior year.\n                                                                                  \n

The minimum amount of\nregulatory capital that must be held by\nBHCs and banks is determined by\ncalculating risk-weighted assets\n(\u201cRWA\u201d), which are on-balance sheet\nassets and off-balance sheet exposures,\nweighted according to risk. Two\ncomprehensive approaches are prescribed\nfor calculating RWA: a standardized\napproach (\u201cBasel III Standardized\u201d),\nand an advanced approach (\u201cBasel III\nAdvanced\u201d). For each of the risk-based\ncapital ratios, the capital adequacy of\nthe Firm is evaluated against the lower\nof the Standardized or Advanced\napproaches compared to their respective\nregulatory capital ratio requirements.\nThe Firm\u2019s Basel III Standardized-risk-\nbased ratios are currently more binding\nthan the Basel III Advanced-risk-based\nratios.\n\nBasel III also includes a requirement\nfor Advanced Approaches banking\norganizations, including the Firm, to\ncalculate the SLR. The Firm\u2019s SLR is\ncurrently more binding than the Basel\nIII Standardized-risk-based ratios.\nRefer to SLR on page 47 for additional\ninformation.\n\nKey Regulatory Developments\n\nCECL regulatory capital transition. On\nDecember 31, 2021, the CECL capital\ntransition provisions , which delayed\nthe effects of CECL on regulatory\ncapital for two years, expired.\nBeginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9\nbillion CECL capital benefit recognized\nas of December 31, 2021, is being\nphased out at 25% per year over a\nthree-year period. As of June 30, 2022,\nCET1 capital reflected the remaining\n$2.2 billion, benefit associated with\nthe CECL capital transition provisions.\n\nAdditionally, effective January 1,\n2022, the Firm phased out 25% of the\nother relevant CECL capital transition\nprovisions recognized as of December\n31, 2021, from Tier 2 capital, adjusted\naverage assets, and total leverage\nexposure.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on\npages 86-96 and Note 1 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K for further\ninformation on CECL capital transition\nprovisions and the CECL accounting\nguidance.\n\nStandardized Approach for Counterparty\nCredit Risk. On January 1, 2022, the\nFirm adopted \u201cStandardized Approach for\nCounterparty Credit Risk\u201d (\u201cSA-CCR\u201d),\nwhich replaced the Current Exposure\nMethod used to measure derivatives\ncounterparty exposure under the\nStandardized and Advanced approach RWA\nwhere internal models are not used, as\nwell as leverage exposure used to\ncalculate the SLR in the regulatory\ncapital framework. The rule issued by\nthe U.S. banking regulators in November\n2019 applies to Basel III Advanced\nApproaches banking organizations, such\nas the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A.\n\nThe adoption of SA-CCR on January 1,\n2022 increased the Firm\u2019s Standardized\nRWA by approximately $40 billion based\non the Firm's derivatives exposure as\nof December 31, 2021, which resulted in\na decrease of approximately 30 bps to\nthe Firm's CET1 capital ratio and a\nmodest decrease in its total leverage\nexposure. In addition, the adoption of\nSA-CCR increased the Firm's Advanced\nRWA, but to a lesser extent than\nStandardized.\n\nRisk-based Capital Regulatory\nRequirements\n\nThe Firm's current target for its Basel\nIII Standardized CET1 capital ratio is\n12.5% by the end of the fourth quarter\nof 2022. This target is based on the\nBasel III capital rules currently in\neffect, and taking into account the\nexpected increase in the Firm's Stress\nCapital Buffer (\u201cSCB\u201d) requirement.\n                                        44                                        \nThe following tables present the Firm\u2019s risk-based capital metrics under both the\nBasel III Standardized and Advanced approaches and leverage-based capital metrics.\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K\nfor a further discussion of these capital metrics.

(d) Excludes average excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s\naverage LCR decreased during the three months ended June 30, 2022, compared with\nthe three-month period ended March 31, 2022 due to a decrease in JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A.'s HQLA primarily from a reduction in cash from loan growth and a\ndecline in the market value of HQLA-eligible investment securities in\n\nTreasury and CIO. Refer to Note 9 for additional information regarding gross\nunrealized gains and losses on the investment securities portfolio. The Firm and\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR fluctuates from period to period, due to\nchanges in its eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of\nongoing business activity. Other liquidity sources In addition to the assets\nreported in the Firm\u2019s eligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered\nmarketable securities, such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm believes\nwould be available to raise liquidity. This includes excess eligible HQLA\nsecurities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank\naffiliates. The fair value of these securities was approximately $826 billion and\n$914 billion as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, although the\namount of liquidity that could be raised at any particular time would be dependent\non prevailing market conditions. The fair value decreased compared to December 31,\n2021, primarily due to a decrease in excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A., as noted above. The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the\nFederal Home Loan Banks (\u201cFHLBs\u201d) and the discount window at the Federal Reserve\nBank as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately\n$308 billion as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. This borrowing capacity\nexcludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm\u2019s eligible HQLA\nor other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve\nBank discount window and other central banks. Although available, the Firm does\nnot view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and\nthe other central banks as a primary source of liquidity. NSFR The net stable\nfunding ratio (\u201cNSFR\u201d) rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nmaintain an amount of \u201cavailable\u201d stable funding that is sufficient to meet their\n\u201crequired\u201d amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon. As of June 30, 2022,\nthe Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR\nrequirement, based on the Firm's current understanding of the final rule.

However, during periods of\nmarket disruption those trends could be affected.\n\nAverage deposits increased for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to\nthe three months ended June 30, 2021, reflecting the residual impact associated\nwith government actions in the prior year. In CCB, the increase was also driven by\ngrowth from new and existing accounts across both consumer and small business\ncustomers. However, during the second quarter of 2022, there was a decline in\ndeposits, including in CB due to migration of non-operating deposits into higher-\nyielding alternatives, and in CCB as consumer spending continued to grow. Average\ndeposits increased for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2021, reflecting inflows across the LOBs resulting from the\nresidual effect of certain government actions in the prior year. In CCB, the\nincrease was also driven by growth from new and existing accounts across both\nconsumer and small business customers. Increases in Corporate predominantly relate\nto the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives.

          \nThe Firm\u2019s sources of short-term\nsecured funding primarily consist of\nsecurities loaned or sold under\nagreements to repurchase. These\ninstruments are secured predominantly\nby high-quality securities collateral,\nincluding government-issued debt and\nU.S. GSE and government agency MBS.\nSecurities sold under agreements to\nrepurchase increased at June 30, 2022,\ncompared with December 31, 2021, due to\nhigher secured financing of trading\nassets and the impact of netting on\nclient-driven market-making activities\nin Markets, partially offset by lower\nsecured financing of AFS investment\nsecurities in Treasury and CIO.\n\nThe balances associated with securities\nloaned or sold under agreements to\nrepurchase fluctuate over time due to\ninvestment and financing activities of\nclients, the Firm\u2019s demand for\nfinancing, the ongoing management of\nthe mix of the Firm\u2019s liabilities,\nincluding its secured and unsecured\nfinancing (for both the investment\nsecurities and market-making\nportfolios), and other market and\nportfolio factors.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s sources of short-term\nunsecured funding primarily consist of\nissuances of wholesale commercial paper\nand other borrowed funds. The increase\nin commercial paper at June 30, 2022,\nfrom December 31, 2021, and for the\naverage three and six months ended June\n30, 2022 compared to the prior year\nperiod, was due to higher net issuance\nprimarily for short-term liquidity\nmanagement.\n                                        52                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Long-term funding and issuance                                                  \n                                                                                  \nLong-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity\nfor the Firm. The Firm\u2019s long-term funding plan is driven primarily by expected\nclient activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, including\nTLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing\nmarket access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding\nmarkets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan.\n\nThe significant majority of the Firm\u2019s long-term unsecured funding is issued by\nthe Parent Company to provide flexibility in support of both bank and non-bank\nsubsidiary funding needs.

In addition, the Firm\u2019s\npolicy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual\nstatus, as permitted by regulatory guidance.\n\n(k) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response\nto the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n(l) At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, nonaccrual loans excluded $86 million\nand $506 million, respectively, of PPP loans 90 or more days past due and\nguaranteed by the SBA.\n\n(m) Average consumer loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value were $18.2\nbillion and $27.0 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, and were $21.0 billion and $24.2 billion for the six months ended\nJune 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Residential real estate: The\nresidential real estate portfolio,\nincluding loans held-for-sale and loans\nat fair value, predominantly consists\nof prime mortgage loans and home equity\nlines of credit. Retained loans\nincreased compared to December 31,\n2021, reflecting originations, net of\npaydowns. Retained nonaccrual loans\ndecreased from December 31, 2021\nreflecting improved credit performance.\nNet recoveries for the three months\nended June 30, 2022 were lower when\ncompared with the same period in the\nprior year as the current year\nrecoveries were impacted by lower\nprepayments due to higher interest\nrates. Net recoveries for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2022 were\nrelatively flat compared with the same\nperiod in the prior year. Loans at fair\nvalue decreased from December 31, 2021,\nas Home Lending warehouse loan sales\noutpaced originations due to higher\ninterest rates and lower loan purchase\nactivity in CIB. Nonaccrual loans at\nfair value decreased from December 31,\n2021 driven by CIB. The carrying value\nof home equity lines of credit\noutstanding was $16.9 billion at June\n30, 2022. This amount included $5.5\nbillion of HELOCs that have recast from\ninterest-only to fully amortizing\npayments or have been modified and $5.5\nbillion of interest-only balloon\nHELOCs, which primarily mature after\n2030. The Firm manages the risk of\nHELOCs during their revolving period by\nclosing or reducing the undrawn line to\nthe extent permitted by law when\nborrowers are exhibiting a material\ndeterioration in their credit risk\nprofile. At June 30, 2022 and December\n31, 2021, the carrying value of\ninterest-only residential mortgage\nloans were $34.4 billion and $30.0\nbillion, respectively. These loans have\nan interest-only payment period\ngenerally followed by an adjustable-\nrate or fixed-rate fully amortizing\npayment period to maturity and are\ntypically originated as higher-balance\nloans to higher-income borrowers,\npredominantly in AWM. The interest-only\nresidential mortgage loan portfolio\nreflected net charge-offs for the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2022 on a loan\nsale and net recoveries for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2022. The credit\nperformance of this portfolio is\ncomparable with the performance of the\nbroader prime mortgage portfolio.\n\nThe following table provides a summary\nof the Firm\u2019s residential mortgage\nportfolio insured and/or guaranteed by\nU.S. government agencies, predominantly\nloans held-for-sale and loans at fair\nvalue.

Delinquency and net charge-\noff rates continue to benefit from the\nfinancial strength of U.S. consumers.\n\nConsistent with the Firm\u2019s policy, all\ncredit card loans typically remain on\naccrual status until charged off.\nHowever, the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan\nlosses includes the estimated\nuncollectible portion of accrued and\nbilled interest and fee income.

A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm\u2019s\nwholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm\ndistributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the\nmarket as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio\nconcentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in\npart by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and\ntransaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry,\nproduct and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 64-67\nfor further information. The Firm\u2019s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure\nheld in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated exposures held in CCB,\nincluding business banking and auto dealer exposure for which the wholesale\nmethodology is applied when determining the allowance for credit losses. In the\nsix months ended June 30, 2022, credit continued to perform well with charge-offs\nat historically low levels. As of June 30, 2022, the decrease in nonperforming\nexposure was driven by a decline in lending related commitments as a result of net\nportfolio activity, predominantly in CIB, partially offset by an increase in\nnonperforming derivatives. Nonperforming loans were relatively flat and included\npaydowns on exposures to certain Russia and Russia-associated clients that were\ndowngraded in the first quarter of 2022. Refer to Business Developments on page 9\nand Country Risk on pages 80-81 for additional information. As of June 30, 2022,\nretained loans increased $23.9 billion driven by CB and CIB, partially offset by\ndecreases in AWM.\n

hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.\n\n(c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference\nentity and the ratings profile shown is based on the ratings of the reference\nentity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the credit\nderivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used in\ncredit portfolio management activities are executed with investment-grade\ncounterparties. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection against certain\nloans in the retained loan portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes.\n\n(d) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current\npresentation.\n\n(e) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and\nderivative receivables is generally based on remaining contractual maturity.\nDerivative contracts that are in a receivable position at June 30, 2022, may\nbecome payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or changes in\nmarket conditions.\n                                        63                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Wholesale credit exposure \u2013 industry exposures                                  \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures,\nand pays particular attention to industries with actual or potential credit\nconcerns.\n\nExposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators\u2019 definition of\ncriticized exposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard and\ndoubtful categories. Total criticized exposure, excluding loans held-for-sale and\nloans at fair value, was $31.3 billion and $38.2 billion at June 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, representing approximately 2.7% and 3.5% of total wholesale\ncredit exposure, respectively. The decrease in criticized exposure was driven by\nnet portfolio activity and client-specific upgrades, partially offset by client-\nspecific downgrades, with the largest decreases in Consumer & Retail and\nTechnology, Media & Telecommunications. Of the $31.3 billion of criticized\nexposure at June 30, 2022, approximately half was undrawn and $28.3 billion was\nperforming.\n\nThe table below summarizes by industry the Firm\u2019s exposures as of June 30, 2022,\nand December 31, 2021. The industry of risk category is generally based on the\nclient or counterparty\u2019s primary business activity.

lending-related financial\ninstruments, such as commitments\n(including revolving credit facilities)\nand guarantees, to address the\nfinancing needs of its clients. The\ncontractual amounts of these financial\ninstruments represent the maximum\npossible credit risk should the clients\ndraw down on these commitments or when\nthe Firm fulfills its obligations under\nthese guarantees, and the clients\nsubsequently fail to perform according\nto the terms of these contracts. Most\nof these commitments and guarantees\nhave historically been refinanced,\nextended, cancelled, or expired without\nbeing drawn upon or a default\noccurring. As a result, the Firm does\nnot believe that the total contractual\namount of these wholesale lending-\nrelated commitments is representative\nof the Firm\u2019s expected future credit\nexposure or funding requirements. Refer\nto Note 22 for further information on\nwholesale lending-related commitments.\n                                                                                  \n  Receivables from customers                                                      \n                                                                                  \nReceivables from customers reflect\nheld-for-investment margin loans to\nbrokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM\nthat are collateralized by assets\nmaintained in the clients\u2019 brokerage\naccounts (e.g., cash on deposit, and\nliquid and readily marketable debt or\nequity securities). Because of this\ncollateralization, no allowance for\ncredit losses is generally held against\nthese receivables. To manage its credit\nrisk the Firm establishes margin\nrequirements and monitors the required\nmargin levels on an ongoing basis, and\nrequires clients to deposit additional\ncash or other collateral, or to reduce\npositions, when appropriate. These\nreceivables are reported within accrued\ninterest and accounts receivable on the\nFirm\u2019s Consolidated balance sheets.\n                                                                                  \n  Derivative contracts                                                            \n                                                                                  \nDerivatives enable clients and\ncounterparties to manage risk including\ncredit risk and risks arising from\nfluctuations in interest rates, foreign\nexchange and equities and commodities\nprices. The Firm makes markets in\nderivatives in order to meet these\nneeds and uses derivatives to manage\ncertain risks associated with net open\nrisk positions from its market-making\nactivities, including the counterparty\ncredit risk arising from derivative\nreceivables. The Firm also uses\nderivative instruments to manage its\nown credit risk and other market risk\nexposure. The nature of the\ncounterparty and the settlement\nmechanism of the derivative affect the\ncredit risk to which the Firm is\nexposed. For OTC derivatives the Firm\nis exposed to the credit risk of the\nderivative counterparty. For exchange-\ntraded derivatives (\u201cETD\u201d), such as\nfutures and options, and cleared over-\nthe-counter (\u201cOTC-cleared\u201d)\nderivatives, the Firm can also be\nexposed to the credit risk of the\nrelevant central counterparty clearing\nhouse (\u201cCCP\u201d). Where possible, the Firm\nseeks to mitigate its credit risk\nexposures arising from derivative\ncontracts through the use of legally\nenforceable master netting arrangements\nand collateral agreements.\n\nThe percentage of the Firm\u2019s over-the-\ncounter derivative transactions subject\nto collateral agreements \u2014 excluding\nforeign exchange spot trades, which are\nnot typically covered by collateral\nagreements due to their short maturity,\nand centrally cleared trades that are\nsettled daily \u2014 was approximately 87%\nand 88% at June 30, 2022, and December\n31, 2021, respectively. Refer to Note 4\nfor additional information on the\nFirm\u2019s use of collateral agreements and\nfor a further discussion of derivative\ncontracts, counterparties and\nsettlement types.\n\nThe fair value of derivative\nreceivables reported on the\nConsolidated balance sheets were $81.3\nbillion and $57.1 billion at June 30,\n2022, and December 31, 2021,\nrespectively. The increase was driven\nby higher foreign exchange and\ncommodity derivative receivables as a\nresult of market movements. Derivative\nreceivables represent the fair value of\nthe derivative contracts after giving\neffect to legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements and the related cash\ncollateral held by the Firm.\n\nIn addition, the Firm held liquid\nsecurities and other cash collateral\nthat may be used as security when the\nfair value of the client\u2019s exposure is\nin the Firm\u2019s favor. For these\npurposes, the definition of liquid\nsecurities is consistent with the\ndefinition of high quality liquid\nassets as defined in the LCR rule.\n\nIn management\u2019s view, the appropriate\nmeasure of current credit risk should\nalso take into consideration other\ncollateral, which generally represents\nsecurities that do not qualify as high\nquality liquid assets under the LCR\nrule.\n\nThe benefits of these additional\ncollateral amounts for each\ncounterparty are subject to a legally\nenforceable master netting agreement\nand limited to the net amount of the\nderivative receivables for each\ncounterparty.\n\nThe Firm also holds additional\ncollateral (primarily cash, G7\ngovernment securities, other liquid\ngovernment agency and guaranteed\nsecurities, and corporate debt and\nequity securities) delivered by clients\nat the initiation of transactions, as\nwell as collateral related to contracts\nthat have a non-daily call frequency\nand collateral that the Firm has agreed\nto return but has not yet settled as of\nthe reporting date.

The\nallowance for credit losses comprises:\n\u2022 the allowance for loan losses, which\ncovers the Firm\u2019s retained loan\nportfolios (scored and risk-rated) and\nis presented separately on the\nConsolidated balance sheets, \u2022 the\nallowance for lending-related\ncommitments, which is presented on the\nConsolidated balance sheets in accounts\npayable and other liabilities, and \u2022\nthe allowance for credit losses on\ninvestment securities, which is\nreflected in investment securities on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets.\nDiscussion of changes in the allowance\nThe allowance for credit losses as of\nJune 30, 2022 was $20.0 billion, an\nincrease of $1.3 billion from December\n31, 2021, consisting of: $1.0 billion\nin wholesale and $311 million in\nconsumer. The change in allowance\nreflects the increased weight placed on\nthe adverse scenarios in the current\nyear, due to the ongoing effects\nassociated with higher inflation,\nchanges in monetary policy, and\ngeopolitical risks, including the war\nin Ukraine, and a modest deterioration\nin the Firm's macroeconomic forecast.\nThe increase in the allowance was also\ndriven by loan growth in Card and CB in\nthe second quarter of 2022, and client-\nspecific Russia and Russia-associated\ndowngrades in CIB and AWM in the first\nquarter of 2022. The Firm's allowance\nfor credit losses is estimated using a\nweighted average of five internally\ndeveloped macroeconomic scenarios. The\nadverse scenarios incorporate more\npunitive macroeconomic factors than the\ncentral case assumptions provided in\nthe table below, resulting in weighted\naverage U.S. unemployment rates above\n4% through the fourth quarter of 2023,\nand a 1.1% lower U.S. real GDP level\nexiting the fourth quarter of 2023.

The investment securities\nportfolio is predominantly held by\nTreasury and CIO in connection with the\nFirm\u2019s balance sheet and asset-\nliability management objectives.\nPrincipal investments are predominantly\nprivately-held financial instruments\nand are managed in the LOBs and\nCorporate. Investments are typically\nintended to be held over extended\nperiods and, accordingly, the Firm has\nno expectation for short-term realized\ngains with respect to these\ninvestments. Investment securities risk\nInvestment securities risk includes the\nexposure associated with a default in\nthe payment of principal and interest.\nThis risk is mitigated given that the\ninvestment securities portfolio held by\nTreasury and CIO predominantly consists\nof high-quality securities. At June 30,\n2022, the Treasury and CIO investment\nsecurities portfolio, net of allowance\nfor credit losses, was $661.9 billion,\nand the average credit rating of the\nsecurities comprising the portfolio was\nAA+ (based upon external ratings where\navailable, and where not available,\nbased primarily upon internal risk\nratings). Refer to Corporate segment\nresults on pages 41-42 and Note 9 for\nfurther information on the investment\nsecurities portfolio and internal risk\nratings. Refer to Liquidity Risk\nManagement on pages 50-54 for further\ninformation on related liquidity risk.\nRefer to Market Risk Management on\npages 75-79 for further information on\nthe market risk inherent in the\nportfolio.\n\nPrincipal investment risk Principal\ninvestments are typically privately-\nheld financial instruments representing\nownership interests or other forms of\njunior capital. In general, principal\ninvestments include tax-oriented\ninvestments and investments made to\nenhance or accelerate the Firm\u2019s\nbusiness strategies and exclude those\nthat are consolidated on the Firm's\nbalance sheets. These investments are\nmade by dedicated investing businesses\nor as part of a broader business\nstrategy. The Firm\u2019s principal\ninvestments are managed by the LOBs and\nCorporate and are reflected within\ntheir respective financial results. The\nFirm\u2019s investments will continue to\nevolve in line with its strategies,\nincluding the Firm\u2019s commitment to\nsupport underserved communities and\nminority-owned businesses.

This reflects the non-additive nature of\nVaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types.\n\n(b) In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's internal model\ngovernance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was\nremoved from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit spreads for\nthose counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to\nmaintain consistency. This exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based\nmeasures.\n\n(c) During the period ended March 31, 2022, the effects of nickel price increases\nand the associated volatility in the nickel market resulted in elevated average\nand maximum Credit Portfolio VaR. During the period ended June 30, 2022, average\nand maximum Credit Portfolio VaR decreased driven by a reduction in nickel-related\nexposure, although average and maximum Credit Portfolio VaR remained elevated when\ncompared to the prior year period.\n\n(d) The decrease in Corporate and other LOB VaR was driven by lower market values\nfor a legacy private equity position which is publicly traded.\n\n(e) The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different\ntrading days than the components and consequently diversification benefit is not\nmeaningful.\n                                                                                  \n   Quarter over quarter results                                                   \n                                                                                  \nAverage total VaR decreased by $9\nmillion for the three months ended June\n30, 2022 when compared with March 31,\n2022 due to decreases in Credit\nPortfolio VaR predominantly driven by\nchanges in nickel-related counterparty\nexposure, largely offset by increased\nmarket volatility impacting Fixed\nincome.\n                                                                                  \n   Year over year results                                                         \n                                                                                  \nAverage total VaR increased by $11\nmillion for the three months ended June\n30, 2022, compared with the same period\nin the prior year. This increase was\nlargely driven by market volatility\nimpacting Fixed income as well as\nincreases in Credit Portfolio VaR due\nto the effects of nickel price\nincreases and the associated volatility\nin the nickel market observed in March\n2022.\n\nThe following graph presents daily Risk\nManagement VaR for the five trailing\nquarters. The movement in VaR in March\n2022 was driven by changes in nickel-\nrelated counterparty exposure in the\nFirm's Credit portfolio.\n                                                                                  \n                            Daily Risk Management VaR                             \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Second          Third Quarter    Fourth          First Quarter    Second        \n  Quarter         2021             Quarter         2022             Quarter       \n  2021                             2021                             2022          \n                                                                                  \n                                        76                                        \n                                                                                  \n  VaR backtesting                                                                 \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk\nManagement VaR results with the daily gains and losses that are utilized for VaR\nbacktesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below do not\nreflect the Firm\u2019s reported revenue as they exclude select components of total net\nrevenue, such as those associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e.,\nintraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees,\ncommissions, certain valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded\ncomponents of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or loss\non a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is\nconsistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.\n\nA backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily\nRisk Management VaR for the prior day. Under the Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR\nmethodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent with the\nhistorical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR\nbacktesting exceptions on average five times every 100 trading days. The number of\nVaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected\nnumber of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is\nmaterially different from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of\nhistorical data used in the VaR calculation.\n\nFor the 12 months ended June 30, 2022, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 148 of\nthe 261 days, and observed 22 VaR backtesting exceptions. For the three months\nended June 30, 2022, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 37 of the 65 days, and\nobserved three VaR backtesting exceptions.\n\nThe following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains\nand losses for the trailing 12 months and three months ended June 30, 2022. The\ndaily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding daily\nRisk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in\naggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are\ndisplayed within the intervals that are greater than one hundred percent. The\nresults in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the\nMarket Risk section of the Firm\u2019s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital\nDisclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm\u2019s\ncovered positions.\n                Distribution of Daily Backtesting Gains and Losses                \n                                                                                  \n                                        77                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Earnings-at-risk                                                                \n                                                                                  \nThe effect of interest rate exposure on\nthe Firm\u2019s reported net income is\nimportant as interest rate risk\nrepresents one of the Firm\u2019s\nsignificant market risks. Interest rate\nrisk arises not only from trading\nactivities but also from the Firm\u2019s\ntraditional banking activities, which\ninclude extension of loans and credit\nfacilities, taking deposits, issuing\ndebt and the investment securities\nportfolio. Refer to the table on page\n134 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K\nfor a summary by LOB and Corporate,\nidentifying positions included in\nearnings-at-risk. One way the Firm\nevaluates its structural interest rate\nrisk is through earnings-at-risk.\nEarnings-at-risk estimates the Firm\u2019s\ninterest rate exposure for a given\ninterest rate scenario. It is presented\nas a sensitivity to a baseline, which\nincludes net interest income and\ncertain interest rate sensitive fees.\nThe baseline uses market interest rates\nand in the case of deposits, pricing\nassumptions. The Firm conducts\nsimulations of changes to this baseline\nfor interest rate-sensitive assets and\nliabilities denominated in U.S. dollars\nand other currencies (\u201cnon-U.S. dollar\u201d\ncurrencies). These simulations\nprimarily include retained loans,\ndeposits, deposits with banks,\ninvestment securities, long-term debt\nand any related interest rate hedges,\nand funds transfer pricing of other\npositions in risk management VaR and\nother sensitivity-based measures as\ndescribed on page 134 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K. Earnings-at-\nrisk scenarios estimate the potential\nchange to a net interest income\nbaseline, over the following 12 months\nutilizing multiple assumptions. These\nscenarios include a parallel shift\ninvolving changes to both short-term\nand long-term rates by an equal amount;\na steeper yield curve involving holding\nshort-term rates constant and\nincreasing long-term rates; and a\nflatter yield curve involving\nincreasing short-term rates and holding\nlong-term rates constant or holding\nshort-term rates constant and\ndecreasing long-term rates. These\nscenarios consider many different\nfactors, including: \u2022 The impact on\nexposures as a result of instantaneous\nchanges in interest rates from baseline\nrates. \u2022 Forecasted balance sheet, as\nwell as modeled prepayment and\nreinvestment behavior, but excluding\nassumptions about actions that could be\ntaken by the Firm or its clients and\ncustomers in response to any such\ninstantaneous rate changes. Mortgage\nprepayment assumptions are based on the\ninterest rates used in the scenarios\ncompared with underlying contractual\nrates, the time since origination, and\nother factors which are updated\nperiodically based on historical\nexperience. Deposit forecasts used in\nthe baseline and scenarios include\ncertain assumptions relating to the\nreversal of Quantitative Easing. \u2022 The\npricing sensitivity of deposits, known\nas deposit betas, represent the amount\nby which deposit rates paid could\nchange upon a given change in market\ninterest rates.

Refer to Note 2 for additional\ninformation.\n\n(b) In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's internal model\ngovernance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was\nremoved from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit spreads for\nthose counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to\nmaintain consistency.

Country exposure\nincludes activity with both government\nand private-sector entities in a\ncountry.\n\nUnder the Firm\u2019s internal country risk\nmanagement approach, attribution of\nexposure to an individual country is\nbased on the country where the largest\nproportion of the assets of the\ncounterparty, issuer, obligor or\nguarantor are located or where the\nlargest proportion of its revenue is\nderived, which may be different than\nthe domicile (i.e. legal residence) or\ncountry of incorporation.\n\nIndividual country exposures reflect an\naggregation of the Firm\u2019s risk to an\nimmediate default, with zero recovery,\nof the counterparties, issuers,\nobligors or guarantors attributed to\nthat country. Activities which result\nin contingent or indirect exposure to a\ncountry are not included in the country\nexposure measure (for exa mple,\nproviding clearing services or\nsecondary exposure to collateral on\nsecurities financing receivables).\n\nAssumptions are sometimes required in\ndetermining the measurement and\nallocation of country exposure,\nparticularly in the case of certain\nnon-linear or index products, or where\nthe nature of the counterparty, issuer,\nobligor or guarantor is not suitable\nfor attribution to an individual\ncountry. The use of different\nmeasurement approaches or assumptions\ncould affect the amount of reported\ncountry exposure.\n\nUnder the Firm\u2019s internal country risk\nmeasurement framework:\n\n\u2022 Lending exposures are measured at the\ntotal committed amount (funded and\nunfunded), net of the allowance for\ncredit losses and eligible cash and\nmarketable securities collateral\nreceived\n\n\u2022 Deposits are measured as the cash\nbalances placed with central and\ncommercial banks\n\n\u2022 Securities financing exposures are\nmeasured at their receivable balance,\nnet of eligible collateral received\n\n\u2022 Debt and equity securities are\nmeasured at the fair value of all\npositions, including both long and\nshort positions\n\n\u2022 Counterparty exposure on derivative\nreceivables is measured at the\nderivative\u2019s fair value, net of the\nfair value of the eligible collateral\nreceived\n\n\u2022 Credit derivatives exposure is\nmeasured at the net notional amount of\nprotection purchased or sold for the\nsame underlying reference entity,\ninclusive of the fair value of the\nderivative receivable or payable;\nreflecting the manner in which the Firm\nmanages these exposures\n\nThe Firm\u2019s internal country risk\nreporting differs from the reporting\nprovided under the FFIEC bank\nregulatory requirements.\n                                        80                                        \nRisk Reporting The following table presents the Firm\u2019s top 20 exposures by country\n(excluding the U.S.) as of June 30, 2022 and their comparative exposures as of\nDecember 31, 2021. The selection of countries represents the Firm\u2019s largest total\nexposures by individual country, based on the Firm\u2019s internal country risk\nmanagement approach, and does not represent the Firm\u2019s view of any existing or\npotentially adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate from period\nto period due to client activity and market flows. The increase in exposure to\nGermany and the decrease in exposure to the U.K. were primarily due to changes in\ncash placements with the central banks of those countries driven by balance sheet\nand liquidity management activities. The decrease in exposure to Australia was\ndriven by a reduction in cash placed with the central bank of Australia, largely\ndue to client-driven market-making activities and lower client cash deposits\nfollowing recent interest rate increases. As of June 30, 2022, exposure to Russia,\nbased on the Firm's internal country risk measurement framework, was approximately\n$600 million.\n                                                                                  \n  Top                                                                             \n  20                                                                              \n  co\u2026                                                                             \n  ex\u2026                                                                             \n  (e\u2026                                                                             \n  the                                                                             \n  U.\u2026    June                                                   Dec\u2026              \n  (in    30,                                                    31,               \n  bi\u2026    2022                                                   202\u2026              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                     Len\u2026       Trad\u2026                  Total               Total  \n                      and         and       Oth\u2026       expo\u2026               expo\u2026  \n                     dep\u2026       inve\u2026                                             \n  Ge\u2026             $  95.0    $   -0.2    $   0.4    $   95.2            $   61.7  \n  Un\u2026                63.1         9.8        2.3        75.2                96.4  \n  Ki\u2026                                                                             \n  Ja\u2026                39.1         9.7        0.3        49.1                45.5  \n  Au\u2026                12.0         7.2        0.1        19.3                39.1  \n  Fr\u2026                12.3         0.8        5.8        18.9                14.0  \n  Sw\u2026                10.7         1.3        5.1        17.1                20.9  \n  Ch\u2026                 9.8         6.4        0.8        17.0                18.6  \n  Ca\u2026                13.9         2.3        0.2        16.4                16.9  \n  Br\u2026                 8.1         8.2          \u2014        16.3                12.0  \n  Si\u2026                 7.3         3.6        0.7        11.6                12.3  \n  Lu\u2026                10.1         1.3          \u2014        11.4                11.5  \n  Sp\u2026                 9.8         0.4          \u2014        10.2                10.1  \n  Ne\u2026                 9.4           \u2014        0.6        10.0                 6.8  \n  Be\u2026                 8.8         1.2          \u2014        10.0                 6.8  \n  In\u2026                 5.3         3.8        0.2         9.3                14.7  \n  So\u2026                 4.8         4.1        0.3         9.2                 8.7  \n  Ko\u2026                                                                             \n  Sa\u2026                 6.4         2.6          \u2014         9.0                 9.1  \n  Ar\u2026                                                                             \n  Ho\u2026                                                                             \n  Ko\u2026                 3.5         1.5        0.5         5.5                 5.9  \n  SAR                                                                             \n  Ir\u2026                 4.2         0.9          \u2014         5.1                 2.7  \n  Me\u2026                 4.6         0.5          \u2014         5.1                 4.9  \n                                                                                  \n(a) Country exposures presented in the\ntable reflect 88% and 87% of total\nFirmwide non-U.S. exposure, where\nexposure is attributed to an individual\ncountry, at June 30, 2022 and December\n31, 2021, respectively.

Operational Risk includes\ncompliance, conduct, legal, and\nestimations and model risk. Operational\nrisk is inherent in the Firm\u2019s\nactivities and can manifest itself in\nvarious ways, including fraudulent\nacts, business disruptions (including\nthose caused by extraordinary events\nbeyond the Firm's control),\ncyberattacks, inappropriate employee\nbehavior, failure to comply with\napplicable laws, rules and regulations\nor failure of vendors or other third\nparty providers to perform in\naccordance with their agreements.\nOperational Risk Management attempts to\nmanage operational risk at appropriate\nlevels in light of the Firm\u2019s financial\nposition, the characteristics of its\nbusinesses, and the markets and\nregulatory environments in which it\noperates. Refer to Operational Risk\nManagement on pages 143-149 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion\nof the Firm\u2019s Operational Risk\nManagement. Details on other select\nexamples of operational risks are\nprovided below.\n\nIn response to the war in Ukraine,\nnumerous sanctions have been imposed on\nRussia and Russia-associated entities\nand individuals by various governments\naround the world, including the\nauthorities in the U.S., the U.K. and\nthe EU. These sanctions are complex and\ncontinue to evolve. The Firm continues\nto face increased operational risk\nassociated with interpreting and\nmaintaining these complex compliance\nprograms. To manage this increased\nrisk, the Firm implemented additional\ncontrols reasonably designed to\nmitigate the risk of non-compliance and\nto prevent dealing with sanctioned\npersons or in property subject to\nsanctions, as well as to block or\nrestrict payments as required by the\napplicable regulations.\n\nBusiness and technology resiliency risk\n\nDisruptions can occur due to forces\nbeyond the Firm\u2019s control such as the\nspread of infectious diseases or\npandemics, severe weather, power or\ntelecommunications loss, failure of a\nthird party to provide expected\nservices, cyberattacks and terrorism.\nThe Firmwide Business Resiliency\nProgram is designed to enable the Firm\nto prepare for, adapt to, withstand and\nrecover from business disruptions\nincluding occurrence of an\nextraordinary event beyond its control\nthat may impact critical business\nfunctions and supporting assets (i.e.,\nstaff, technology, facilities and third\nparties). The program includes\ngovernance, awareness training,\nplanning and testing of recovery\nstrategies, as well as strategic and\ntactical initiatives to identify,\nassess, and manage business\ninterruption and public safety risks.\n\nCybersecurity Risk\n\nThe Firm continues to face increased\nrisk of cyber attacks due to potential\nretaliation for the sanctions imposed\nas a result of the war in Ukraine. The\nFirm implemented additional\nprecautionary measures and controls\nreasonably designed to address this\nincreased risk, such as enhanced threat\nmonitoring. There can be no assurance\nthat the measures taken by the Firm to\nprotect against cybersecurity breaches\nwill provide absolute security against\ncyber attacks.\n                                        82                                        \n                                                  \n  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM  \n                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s accounting policies\nand use of estimates are integral to\nunderstanding its reported results. The\nFirm\u2019s most complex accounting\nestimates require management\u2019s judgment\nto ascertain the appropriate carrying\nvalue of assets and liabilities. The\nFirm has established policies and\ncontrol procedures intended to ensure\nthat estimation methods, including any\njudgments made as part of such methods,\nare well-controlled, independently\nreviewed and applied consistently from\nperiod to period. The methods used and\njudgments made reflect, among other\nfactors, the nature of the assets or\nliabilities and the related business\nand risk management strategies, which\nmay vary across the Firm\u2019s businesses\nand portfolios. In addition, the\npolicies and procedures are intended to\nensure that the process for changing\nmethodologies occurs in an appropriate\nmanner. The Firm believes its estimates\nfor determining the carrying value of\nits assets and liabilities are\nappropriate. The following is a brief\ndescription of the Firm\u2019s critical\naccounting estimates involving\nsignificant judgments.\n                                                                                  \n  Allowance for credit losses                                                     \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses\nrepresents management\u2019s estimate of\nexpected credit losses over the\nremaining expected life of the Firm\u2019s\nfinancial assets measured at amortized\ncost and certain off-balance sheet\nlending-related commitments. The\nallowance for credit losses comprises:\n\n\u2022 The allowance for loan losses, which\ncovers the Firm\u2019s retained loan\nportfolios (scored and risk-rated),\n\n\u2022 The allowance for lending-related\ncommitments, and\n\n\u2022 The allowance for credit losses on\ninvestment securities.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses\ninvolves significant judgment on a\nnumber of matters including development\nand weighting of macroeconomic\nforecasts, incorporation of historical\nloss experience, assessment of risk\ncharacteristics, assignment of risk\nratings, valuation of collateral, and\nthe determination of remaining expected\nlife. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 of\nJPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for\nfurther information on these judgments\nas well as the Firm\u2019s policies and\nmethodologies used to determine the\nFirm\u2019s allowance for credit losses; and\nrefer to Allowance for credit losses on\npages 71-73 and Note 12 of this Form\n10-Q for further information.\n\nOne of the most significant judgments\ninvolved in estimating the Firm\u2019s\nallowance for credit losses relates to\nthe macroeconomic forecasts used to\nestimate credit losses over the eight-\nquarter forecast period within the\nFirm\u2019s methodology. The eight-quarter\nforecast incorporates hundreds of MEVs\nthat are relevant for exposures across\nthe Firm, with modeled credit losses\nbeing driven primarily by a subset of\nless than twenty variables. The\nspecific variables that have the\ngreatest effect on the modeled losses\nof each portfolio vary by portfolio and\ngeography.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio\ninclude U.S. unemployment, HPI and U.S.\nreal GDP.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio\ninclude U.S. real GDP, U.S.\nunemployment, U.S. equity prices,\ncorporate credit spreads, oil prices,\ncommercial real estate prices and HPI.\n\nChanges in the Firm\u2019s assumptions and\nforecasts of economic conditions could\nsignificantly affect its estimate of\nexpected credit losses in the portfolio\nat the balance sheet date or lead to\nsignificant changes in the estimate\nfrom one reporting period to the next.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate how\npotential changes in any one factor or\ninput might affect the overall\nallowance for credit losses because\nmanagement considers a wide variety of\nfactors and inputs in estimating the\nallowance for credit losses. Changes in\nthe factors and inputs considered may\nnot occur at the same rate and may not\nbe consistent across all geographies or\nproduct types, and changes in factors\nand inputs may be directionally\ninconsistent, such that improvement in\none factor or input may offset\ndeterioration in others.\n\nTo consider the impact of a\nhypothetical alternate macroeconomic\nforecast, the Firm compared the modeled\ncredit losses determined using its\ncentral and relative adverse\nmacroeconomic scenarios, which are two\nof the five scenarios considered in\nestimating the allowances for loan\nlosses and lending-related commitments.\nThe central and relative adverse\nscenarios each included a full suite of\nMEVs, but differed in the levels, paths\nand peaks/troughs of those variables\nover the eight-quarter forecast period.\n\nFor example, compared to the Firm\u2019s\ncentral scenario shown on page 71 and\nin Note 12, the Firm\u2019s relative adverse\nscenario assumes an elevated U.S.\nunemployment rate, averaging\napproximately 2.2% higher\n\nover the eight-quarter forecast, with a\npeak difference of\n\napproximately 3.7% in the second\nquarter of 2023; lower\n\nU.S. real GDP with a slower recovery,\nremaining nearly\n\n2.9% lower at the end of the eight-\nquarter forecast, with a\n\npeak difference of approximately 5.8%\nin the second\n\nquarter of 2023; and lower national HPI\nwith a peak\n\ndifference of 17.6% in the first\nquarter of 2024.\n\nThis analysis is not intended to\nestimate expected future changes in the\nallowance for credit losses, for a\nnumber of reasons, including:\n\n\u2022 The allowance as of June 30, 2022,\nreflects credit losses beyond those\nestimated under the central scenario\ndue to the weight placed on the adverse\nscenarios.\n\n\u2022 The impacts of changes in many MEVs\nare both interrelated and nonlinear, so\nthe results of this analysis cannot be\nsimply extrapolated for more severe\nchanges in macroeconomic variables.\n                                        83                                        \n\u2022 Expectations of future changes in\nportfolio composition and borrower\nbehavior can significantly affect the\nallowance for credit losses. To\ndemonstrate the sensitivity of credit\nloss estimates to macroeconomic\nforecasts as of June 30, 2022, the Firm\ncompared the modeled estimates under\nits relative adverse scenario to its\ncentral scenario. Without considering\noffsetting or correlated effects in\nother qualitative components of the\nFirm\u2019s allowance for credit losses, the\ncomparison between these two scenarios\nfor the exposures below reflect the\nfollowing differences: \u2022 An increase of\napproximately $600 million for\nresidential real estate loans and\nlending-related commitments \u2022 An\nincrease of approximately $2.0 billion\nfor credit card loans \u2022 An increase of\napproximately $3.0 billion for\nwholesale loans and lending-related\ncommitments This analysis relates only\nto the modeled credit loss estimates\nand is not intended to estimate changes\nin the overall allowance for credit\nlosses as it does not reflect any\npotential changes in other adjustments\nto the quantitative calculation, which\nwould also be influenced by the\njudgment management applies to the\nmodeled lifetime loss estimates to\nreflect the uncertainty and imprecision\nof these modeled lifetime loss\nestimates based on then-current\ncircumstances and conditions.\nRecognizing that forecasts of\nmacroeconomic conditions are inherently\nuncertain, particularly in light of the\nrecent economic conditions, the Firm\nbelieves that its process to consider\nthe available information and\nassociated risks and uncertainties is\nappropriately governed and that its\nestimates of expected credit losses\nwere reasonable and appropriate for the\nperiod ended June 30, 2022.\n\nFair value JPMorgan Chase carries a\nportion of its assets and liabilities\nat fair value. The majority of such\nassets and liabilities are measured at\nfair value on a recurring basis,\nincluding derivatives, structured note\nproducts and certain securities\nfinancing agreements.

The level 3 balances would\nbe reduced if netting were applied,\nincluding the netting benefit\nassociated with cash collateral.\n                                        84                                        \nValuation\nEstimating fair value requires the\napplication of judgment. The type and\nlevel of judgment required is largely\ndependent on the amount of observable\nmarket information available to the\nFirm. For instruments valued using\ninternally developed valuation models\nand other valuation techniques that use\nsignificant unobservable inputs and are\ntherefore classified within level 3 of\nthe fair value hierarchy, judgments\nused to estimate fair value are more\nsignificant than those required when\nestimating the fair value of\ninstruments classified within levels 1\nand 2.\n\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair\nvalue for an instrument within level 3,\nmanagement must first determine the\nappropriate valuation model or other\nvaluation technique to use. Second, the\nlack of observability of certain\nsignificant inputs requires management\nto assess relevant empirical data in\nderiving valuation inputs including,\nfor example, transaction details, yield\ncurves, interest rates, prepayment\nspeed, default rates, volatilities,\ncorrelations, prices (such as\ncommodity, equity or debt prices),\nvaluations of comparable instruments,\nforeign exchange rates and credit\ncurves. Refer to Note 2 for a further\ndiscussion of the valuation of level 3\ninstruments, including unobservable\ninputs used.\n\nFor instruments classified in levels 2\nand 3, management judgment must be\napplied to assess the appropriate level\nof valuation adjustments to reflect\ncounterparty credit quality, the Firm\u2019s\ncreditworthiness, market funding rates,\nliquidity considerations, unobservable\nparameters, and for portfolios that\nmeet specified criteria, the size of\nthe net open risk position. The\njudgments made are typically affected\nby the type of product and its specific\ncontractual terms, and the level of\nliquidity for the product or within the\nmarket as a whole. In periods of\nheightened market volatility and\nuncertainty judgments are further\naffected by the wider variation of\nreasonable valuation estimates,\nparticularly for positions that are\nless liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a\nfurther discussion of valuation\nadjustments applied by the Firm.\n\nImprecision in estimating unobservable\nmarket inputs or other factors can\naffect the amount of gain or loss\nrecorded for a particular position.\nFurthermore, while the Firm believes\nits valuation methods are appropriate\nand consistent with those of other\nmarket participants, the methods and\nassumptions used reflect management\njudgment and may vary across the Firm\u2019s\nbusinesses and portfolios.\n\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and\nassumptions in the determination of\nfair value. The use of methodologies or\nassumptions different than those used\nby the Firm could result in a different\nestimate of fair value at the reporting\ndate.

Chase & Co. (\u201cJPMorgan Chase\u201d\nor the \u201cFirm\u201d), a financial holding\ncompany incorporated under Delaware law\nin 1968, is a leading financial\nservices firm based in the U.S., with\noperations worldwide. The Firm is a\nleader in investment banking, financial\nservices for consumers and small\nbusinesses, commercial banking,\nfinancial transaction processing and\nasset management. Refer to Note 25 for\na further discussion of the Firm\u2019s\nbusiness segments. The accounting and\nfinancial reporting policies of\nJPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries\nconform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally,\nwhere applicable, the policies conform\nto the accounting and reporting\nguidelines prescribed by regulatory\nauthorities. The unaudited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements prepared in\nconformity with U.S. GAAP require\nmanagement to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets, liabilities, revenue\nand expense, and the disclosures of\ncontingent assets and liabilities.\nActual results could be different from\nthese estimates. In the opinion of\nmanagement, all normal, recurring\nadjustments have been included such\nthat this interim financial information\nis fairly stated. These unaudited\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nshould be read in conjunction with the\naudited Consolidated Financial\nStatements, and related notes thereto,\nincluded in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2021 Form\n10-K. Certain amounts reported in prior\nperiods have been reclassified to\nconform with the current presentation.\n\nConsolidation The Consolidated\nFinancial Statements include the\naccounts of JPMorgan Chase and other\nentities in which the Firm has a\ncontrolling financial interest. All\nmaterial intercompany balances and\ntransactions have been eliminated.\nAssets held for clients in an agency or\nfiduciary capacity by the Firm are not\nassets of JPMorgan Chase and are not\nincluded on the Consolidated balance\nsheets. The Firm determines whether it\nhas a controlling financial interest in\nan entity by first evaluating whether\nthe entity is a voting interest entity\nor a variable interest entity. Refer to\nNotes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2021\nForm 10-K for a further description of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s accounting policies\nregarding consolidation. Offsetting\nassets and liabilities\n\nU.S. GAAP permits entities to present\nderivative receivables and derivative\npayables with the same counterparty and\nthe related cash collateral receivables\nand payables on a net basis on the\nConsolidated balance sheets when a\nlegally enforceable master netting\nagreement exists. U.S. GAAP also\npermits securities financing activities\nto be presented on a net basis when\nspecified conditions are met, including\nthe existence of a legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreement. The Firm has\nelected to net such balances where it\nhas determined that the specified\nconditions are met.

70.0billion and $ 73.9billion, respectively, which were mortgage-related.\n\n(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of\ncost or net realizable value. \u201cNet realizable value\u201d is a term defined in U.S.\nGAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (\u201ctransaction costs\u201d).\nTransaction costs for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories are either not\napplicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable\nvalue approximates fair value for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories.\nWhen fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below\ncost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because\nunder fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair\nvalue. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of the Firm\u2019s hedge accounting\nrelationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all\nphysical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.\n                                        96                                        \n(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the\namount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).\n\n(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value\nper share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be\nclassified in the fair value hierarchy. At June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021,\nthe fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private\nequity funds, real estate and other funds, were $ 856million and $ 801million,\nrespectively. Included in these balances at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021,\nwere trading assets of $ 45million and $ 51million, respectively, and other assets\nof $ 811million and $ 750million, respectively.\n\n(e) At June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, included $ 13.5billion and $\n26.2billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $ 7.7billion\nand $ 8.2billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential\nmortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to\nsell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $ 4.4billion and $ 13.6billion,\nrespectively.\n\n(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative\nreceivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and\npaid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3\nbalances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit\nassociated with cash collateral.\n\nLevel 3 valuations\n\nRefer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K for further information on the\nFirm\u2019s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair\nvalue for individual financial instruments. The following table presents the\nFirm\u2019s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to\nmeasure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant\nunobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or\narithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an\ninstrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs\nto the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically\ninclude observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and\ncan be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components.\nThe level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the\nFirm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial\ninstruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within\nlevels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of values presented in the\ntable is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the\nsignificant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification.\nWhere provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table\nare calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being\nused to value. In the Firm\u2019s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic\naverage values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of\nthe reasonableness of the Firm\u2019s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect\nthe characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative\ndistribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two\noption contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation\nuncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels\nbecause the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices.\nThe input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-\nperiod and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments\nheld by the Firm at each balance sheet date.\n                                        97                                        \n

The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the\nderivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable\ninputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.\n(f) Includes equity securities of $ 918million including $ 257million in Other\nAssets, for which quoted prices are not readily available and the fair value is\ngenerally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA multiples and\ncomparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant\nboth individually and in aggregate.\n(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted\nmarket prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price-\nbased internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par\nvalue of $ 100.\n(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.\n(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where\narithmetic averages are used.\n                                        98                                        \nChanges in and ranges of unobservable\ninputs Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion\nof the impact on fair value of changes\nin unobservable inputs and the\nrelationships between unobservable\ninputs as well as a description of\nattributes of the underlying\ninstruments and external market factors\nthat affect the range of inputs used in\nthe valuation of the Firm\u2019s positions.\nChanges in level 3 recurring fair value\nmeasurements The following tables\ninclude a rollforward of the\nConsolidated balance sheets amounts\n(including changes in fair value) for\nfinancial instruments classified by the\nFirm within level 3 of the fair value\nhierarchy for the three and six months\nended June 30, 2022 and 2021. When a\ndetermination is made to classify a\nfinancial instrument within level 3,\nthe determination is based on the\nsignificance of the unobservable inputs\nto the overall fair value measurement.\nHowever, level 3 financial instruments\ntypically include, in addition to the\nunobservable or level 3 components,\nobservable components (that is,\ncomponents that are actively quoted and\ncan be validated to external sources);\naccordingly, the gains and losses in\nthe table below include changes in fair\nvalue due in part to observable factors\nthat are part of the valuation\nmethodology. Also, the Firm risk-\nmanages the observable components of\nlevel 3 financial instruments using\nsecurities and derivative positions\nthat are classified within level 1 or 2\nof the fair value

Transfers between levels for\ninstruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis For the three months ended\nJune 30, 2022, there were no significant transfers from level 2 into level 3. For\nthe three months ended June 30, 2022, significant transfers from level 3 into\nlevel 2 included the following: \u2022 $ 930million of gross interest rate derivative\nreceivables as a result of an increase in observability and a decrease in the\nsignificance of unobservable inputs. For the six months ended June 30, 2022,\nsignificant transfers from level 2 into level 3 included the following: \u2022 $\n1.6billion of total debt and equity instruments, largely due to equity securities\nof $ 959million driven by a decrease in observability predominantly as a result of\nrestricted access to certain markets. \u2022 $ 1.3billion of gross equity derivative\npayables as a result of a decrease in observability and an increase in the\nsignificance of unobservable inputs. For the six months ended June 30, 2022,\nsignificant transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the following: \u2022 $\n965million of gross interest rate derivative receivables as a result of an\nincrease in observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable\ninputs. \u2022 $ 920million and $ 1.4billion of gross equity derivative receivables and\ngross equity derivative payables, respectively, as a result of an increase in\nobservability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. For the\nthree and six months ended June 30, 2021, there were no significant transfers from\nlevel 2 into level 3. For the three months ended June 30, 2021, significant\ntransfers from level 3 into level 2 included the following: \u2022 $ 1.0billion of\ngross equity derivative receivables as a result of an increase in observability\nand a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. For the six months\nended June 30, 2021, significant transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the\nfollowing: \u2022 $ 800million of total debt and equity instruments, largely trading\nloans, driven by an increase in observability. \u2022 $ 1.3billion and $ 1.1billion of\ngross equity derivative receivables and gross equity derivative payables,\nrespectively, as a result of an increase in observability and a decrease in the\nsignificance of unobservable inputs. All transfers are based on changes in the\nobservability and/or significance of the valuation inputs and are assumed to occur\nat the beginning of the quarterly reporting period in which they occur.\n                                       104                                        \nGains and losses The following\ndescribes significant components of\ntotal realized/unrealized\ngains/(losses) for instruments measured\nat fair value on a recurring basis for\nthe periods indicated.

For certain loans, the fair value is\nmeasured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the\nloan takes into account the loan\u2019s allowance for loan losses, which represents the\nloan\u2019s expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference\nbetween the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally\nattributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market\nliquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do\nnot affect its carrying value.\nThe majority of the Firm\u2019s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis on the Consolidated balance sheets.

The\neffective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and\naccretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-\nequivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes\nunscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of\nsecurities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain\nsecurities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the\naverage yield is calculated to the earliest call date.\n(b) Substantially all of the Firm\u2019s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized\nmortgage obligations are due in 10years or more, based on contractual maturity.\nThe estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future\nprepayments, is approximately eight yearsfor agency residential MBS, seven\nyearsfor agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and six yearsfor\nnonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.\n                                       132                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Note 10 \u2013 Securities financing activities                                       \n                                                                                  \nRefer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting\npolicies relating to securities financing activities. Refer to Note 3 for further\ninformation regarding securities borrowed and securities lending agreements for\nwhich the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 23 for further\ninformation regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities\nfinancing agreements. The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the\nFirm\u2019s securities financing agreements as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\nWhen the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master\nnetting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria\nunder U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the\nbalances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same\ncounterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral\nwith its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but\nsuch collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation.\nWhere the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the\ncounterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with securities\nfinancing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S.\nGAAP, is presented in the table below as \u201cAmounts not nettable on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets,\u201d and reduces the \u201cNet amounts\u201d presented. Where a legal opinion\nhas not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are\npresented gross in the \u201cNet amounts\u201d below. In transactions where the Firm is\nacting as the lender in a securities-for-securities lending agreement and receives\nsecurities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, the Firm recognizes the\nsecurities received at fair value within other assets and the obligation to return\nthose securities within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets.\n

real estate loans that are charged\ndown to the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm\nreports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans\nthat have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the\nborrower (\u201cChapter 7 loans\u201d) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless\nof their delinquency status. At June 30, 2022, approximately 5% of Chapter 7\nresidential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.\n\n(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with\nregulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-\ndependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value\nof their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying\ncollateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be\nnegative.\n\n(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $ 45million\nand $ 41million and $ 90million and $ 86million for the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n(d) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response\nto the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n(e) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed\nby U.S government agencies. Typically the principal balance of the loans is\ninsured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to\nmeeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\nthese balances were no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing\nguidelines. There were noloans that were not guaranteed by U.S. government\nagencies that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at June 30,\n2022 and December 31, 2021.\n\n(f) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the\nestimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a\nminimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized\nhome price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent\navailable and forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current\nestimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available\nlien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.\n\n(g) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower\u2019s most recent credit score,\nwhich is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.\n\n(h) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did\nnot have a refreshed FICO score. These loans have been included in a FICO band\nbased on management\u2019s estimation of the borrower\u2019s credit quality.\n\n(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.\n\n(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the\nmagnitude of the corresponding loan balances at June 30, 2022.\n\n(k) At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, included mortgage loans insured by\nU.S. government agencies of $ 62million and $ 66million, respectively. These\namounts have been excluded from the geographic regions presented based upon the\ngovernment guarantee.\n                                       139                                        \nLoan modifications Modifications of residential real estate loans where the Firm\ngrants concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty are\ngenerally accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term or other\ninsignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs. The\ncarrying value of new TDRs was $ 115million and $ 307million for the three months\nended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 233million and $ 558million for\nthe six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There were no\nadditional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans\nhave been modified in TDRs. Nature and extent of modifications The Firm\u2019s\nproprietary modification programs as well as government programs, including U.S.\nGSE programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled\nborrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment\nextensions and delays of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise\nhave been required under the terms of the original agreement. The following table\nprovides information about how residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs\nunder the Firm\u2019s loss mitigation programs described above during the periods\npresented.

default occurred\nwithin one yearof the modification. The dollar amounts presented represent the\nbalance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such loans\ndefaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is\ndeemed to occur when the loan becomes twocontractual payments past due. In the\nevent that a modified loan redefaults, it will generally be liquidated through\nforeclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of\nloans modified within the last twelve monthsmay not be representative of ultimate\nredefault levels.\nAt June 30, 2022, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential\nreal estate loans permanently modified in TDRs were six years.

If the value of the underlying\ncollateral improves subsequent to the charge down, the related allowance may be\nnegative.\n\n(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not\nmaterial for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 .\n\n(d) The geographic regions presented in this table are ordered based on the\nmagnitude of the corresponding loan balances at June 30, 2022.\n\nLoan modifications Certain auto and other loan modifications are considered to be\nTDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing\nfinancial difficulty.

             \nLoan modifications The Firm may offer\nloan modification programs granting\nconcessions to credit card borrowers\nwho are experiencing financial\ndifficulty. The Firm grants concessions\nfor most of the credit card loans under\nlong-term programs. These modifications\ninvolve placing the customer on a fixed\npayment plan, generally for 60months,\nand typically include reducing the\ninterest rate on the credit card.\nSubstantially all modifications under\nthe Firm\u2019s long-term programs are\nconsidered to be TDRs. Loans with\nshort-term or other insignificant\nmodifications that are not considered\nconcessions are not TDRs. If the\ncardholder does not comply with the\nmodified payment terms, then the credit\ncard loan continues to age and will\nultimately be charged-off in accordance\nwith the Firm\u2019s standard charge-off\npolicy. In most cases, the Firm does\nnot reinstate the borrower\u2019s line of\ncredit.\n\nFinancial effects of modifications and\nredefaults\n\nThe following table provides\ninformation about the financial effects\nof the concessions granted on credit\ncard loans modified in TDRs and\nredefaults for the periods presented.\nFor all periods disclosed, new\nenrollments were less than 1% of total\nretained credit card loans.\n                                                                                  \n  (in               Three                               Six                       \n  milli\u2026           months                            months                       \n  except            ended                             ended                       \n  weigh\u2026             June                              June                       \n  data)   2022        30,  2021            2022         30,  2021                 \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Balan\u2026                                                                          \n  of new        $            81  $           90  $            163  $         233  \n  TDRs(\u2026                                                                          \n  Weigh\u2026                                                                          \n  inter\u2026                                                                          \n  rate                                                                            \n  of                18.94     %     17.92     %       18.47     %     17.81    %  \n  loans                                                                           \n  \u2013                                                                               \n  before                                                                          \n  TDR                                                                             \n  Weigh\u2026                                                                          \n  inter\u2026                                                                          \n  rate                                                                            \n  of                 4.62            5.15              4.75            5.20       \n  loans                                                                           \n  \u2013                                                                               \n  after                                                                           \n  TDR                                                                             \n  Balan\u2026                                                                          \n  of                                                                              \n  loans                                                                           \n  that                                                                            \n  redef\u2026        $             8  $           13  $             17  $          32  \n  within                                                                          \n  one                                                                             \n  year                                                                            \n  of                                                                              \n  modif\u2026                                                                          \n                                                                                  \n(a) Represents the outstanding balance\nprior to modification.\n\n(b) Represents loans modified in TDRs\nthat experienced a payment default in\nthe periods presented, and for which\nthe payment default occurred within one\nyearof the modification.

New TDRs\nfor the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 reflected extending maturity\ndates and covenant waivers primarily in the Commercial and Industrial loan class.\nNew TDRs for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 reflected modifications\nthat included extending maturity dates and covenant waivers for both periods as\nwell as the receipt of assets in partial satisfaction of the loan in 2021\npredominantly in the Commercial and Industrial loan class . The impact of these\nmodifications resulting in new TDRs was not material to the Firm for the three and\nsix months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.\n\nThe carrying value of TDRs was $ 852million and $ 607million as of June 30, 2022,\nand December 31, 2021, respectively.\n                                       148                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Note 12 \u2013 Allowance for credit losses                                           \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses\nrepresents management's estimate of\nexpected credit losses over the\nremaining expected life of the Firm's\nfinancial assets measured at amortized\ncost and certain off-balance sheet\nlending-related commitments.

The change in allowance\nreflects the increased weight placed on\nthe adverse scenarios in the current\nyear, due to the ongoing effects\nassociated with higher inflation,\nchanges in monetary policy, and\ngeopolitical risks, including the war\nin Ukraine, and a modest deterioration\nin the Firm's macroeconomic forecast.\nThe increase in the allowance was also\ndriven by loan growth in Card and CB in\nthe second quarter of 2022, and client-\nspecific Russia and Russia-associated\ndowngrades in CIB and AWM in the first\nquarter of 2022. The Firm's allowance\nfor credit losses is estimated using a\nweighted average of five internally\ndeveloped macroeconomic scenarios. The\nadverse scenarios incorporate more\npunitive macroeconomic factors than the\ncentral case assumptions provided in\nthe table below, resulting in weighted\naverage U.S. unemployment rates above\n4% through the fourth quarter of 2023,\nand a 1.1% lower U.S. real GDP level\nexiting the fourth quarter of 2023.\nThe Firm\u2019s central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and U.S.\nreal GDP as follows:\n                                                                                  \n                                Assumptions at June 30,                           \n                                                   2022                           \n                                                   4Q22       2Q23       4Q23     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. unemployment                                 3.6  %     3.6  %     3.7  %  \n  rate(a)                                                                         \n  YoY growth in U.S. real                           1.3  %     1.7  %     1.2  %  \n  GDP(b)                                                                          \n                                Assumptions at December                           \n                                               31, 2021                           \n                                                   2Q22       4Q22       2Q23     \n  U.S. unemployment                                 4.2  %     4.0  %     3.9  %  \n  rate(a)                                                                         \n  YoY growth in U.S. real                           3.1  %     2.8  %     2.1  %  \n  GDP(b)                                                                          \n                                                                                  \n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate.\n(b) As of June 30, 2022, the year over\nyear growth in U.S. real GDP in the\nforecast horizon of the central\nscenario is calculated as the percent\nchange in U.S. real GDP levels from the\nprior year.

The assets and liabilities\ninclude third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and exclude\nintercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.\n(e) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated\nVIEs are classified in the line item on the Consolidated balance sheets titled,\n\u201cBeneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs\u201d. The holders of these\nbeneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of\nJPMorgan Chase. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term\nbeneficial interests of $ 1.9billion and $ 2.6billion at June 30, 2022, and\nDecember 31, 2021, respectively.\n(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets.\nVIEs sponsored by third parties\n\nThe Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These\ninclude, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider,\ninvestor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian.\nThese transactions are conducted at arm\u2019s-length, and individual credit decisions\nare based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the\nquality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct\nthe activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic\nperformance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the\nFirm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these\npositions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record\nand report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. Tax credit\nvehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which\nare limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable\nhousing, energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs.\nA third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control\nover the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the\nFirm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these\npartnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt\nof tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented\nby equity investments and funding commitments, was $ 27.5billion and $\n26.8billion, of which $ 9.8billion and $ 9.4billion was unfunded at June 30, 2022\nand December 31, 2021, respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce\nthe risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the\nproject qualifies for tax credits.

In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity\nprovider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In\nthose transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to\nthe third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any\nintent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying\nmunicipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm\ndoes not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the municipal bond vehicle.

Refer to Note 15 of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K for a\nfurther discussion of the Firm\u2019s\ngoodwill impairment testing.\nUnanticipated declines in business\nperformance, increases in credit\nlosses, increases in capital\nrequirements, as well as deterioration\nin economic or market conditions,\nadverse regulatory or legislative\nchanges or increases in the estimated\nmarket cost of equity, could cause the\nestimated fair values of the Firm\u2019s\nreporting units to decline in the\nfuture, which could result in a\nmaterial impairment charge to earnings\nin a future period related to some\nportion of the associated goodwill. As\nof June 30, 2022, the Firm reviewed\ncurrent economic conditions, estimated\nmarket cost of equity, as well as\nactual business results and projections\nof business performance. Based on such\nreviews, the Firm has concluded that\ngoodwill was not impaired as of June\n30, 2022, or December 31, 2021, nor was\ngoodwill written off due to impairment\nduring the six months ended June 30,\n2022 or 2021.\n                                       158                                        \nMortgage servicing rights\n\nMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing\nservicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future\nservicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the\nloans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received,\neffectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary\nfee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale\nor securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and\n15 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K for a further description of the MSR asset,\ninterest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs.\nThe following table summarizes MSR activity for the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2022 and 2021.\n                                                                                  \n                 As of

The Firm\u2019s credit risk associated with these servicer\nadvances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to\nall cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop\npayment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance.\nHowever, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were\nnot made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.\n                                       159                                        \nThe following table presents the components

The\ncontractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible\ncredit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or\nthe Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the\ncustomer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the\ncontract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been\nrefinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default\noccurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not,\nin the Firm\u2019s view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or\nfunding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K for a\nfurther discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm\u2019s\nrelated accounting policies. To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale\nand certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses\non lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further\ninformation regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related\ncommitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying\nvalues of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and\nother commitments at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021. The amounts in the\ntable below for credit card, home equity and certain scored business banking\nlending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these\nproducts. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all\navailable lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time.\nThe Firm can reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business banking\nlines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by\nlaw, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when\nthe borrower is 60days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when\nthere are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when\nthere has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.\n                                       169                                        \n                                                                                  \n         \u2026

Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of credit\nderivatives.\n\nMerchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment networks, the Firm, in its role\nas a merchant acquirer, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed\ncredit and debit card transactions that result in a charge-back to the merchant.\nIf a dispute is resolved in the cardholder\u2019s favor, Merchant Services will\n(through the cardholder\u2019s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the\ncardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If Merchant\nServices is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, Merchant Services will\nbear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. Merchant\nServices mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash\nreserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, Merchant Services\nrecognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk to\nthe Firm related to charge-backs.\n                                       171                                        \nLoan sales- and securitization-related\nindemnifications In connection with the\nFirm\u2019s mortgage loan sale and\nsecuritization activities with GSEs the\nFirm has made representations and\nwarranties that the loans sold meet\ncertain requirements, and that may\nrequire the Firm to repurchase mortgage\nloans and/or indemnify the loan\npurchaser if such representations and\nwarranties are breached by the Firm.\nThe liability related to repurchase\ndemands associated with private label\nsecuritizations is separately evaluated\nby the Firm in establishing its\nlitigation reserves. Refer to Note 24\nof this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K for\nadditional information regarding\nlitigation. Sponsored member repo\nprogram The Firm acts as a sponsoring\nmember to clear eligible overnight and\nterm resale and repurchase agreements\nthrough the Government Securities\nDivision of the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation (\u201cFICC\u201d) on behalf of\nclients that become sponsored members\nunder the FICC\u2019s rules. The Firm also\nguarantees to the FICC the prompt and\nfull payment and performance of its\nsponsored member clients\u2019 respective\nobligations under the FICC\u2019s rules. The\nFirm minimizes its liability under\nthese guarantees by obtaining a\nsecurity interest in the cash or high-\nquality securities collateral that the\nclients place with the clearing house\ntherefore the Firm expects the risk of\nloss to be remote. The Firm\u2019s maximum\npossible exposure, without taking into\nconsideration the associated\ncollateral, is included in the Exchange\n& clearing house guarantees and\ncommitments line on page 170. Refer to\nNote 11 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2021 Form\n10-K for additional information on\ncredit risk mitigation practices on\nresale agreements and the types of\ncollateral pledged under repurchase\nagreements. Guarantees of subsidiaries\nThe Parent Company has guaranteed\ncertain long-term debt and structured\nnotes of its subsidiaries, including\nJPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC\n(\u201cJPMFC\u201d), a 100%-owned finance\nsubsidiary.

The\nlitigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class\naction lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations and\nregulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by\nboth governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal\nproceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation,\nand involve each of the Firm\u2019s lines of business and several geographies and a\nwide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and\nstatutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which\npresent novel legal theories. The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate\nrange of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its\nlegal proceedings is from $ 0to approximately $ 1.2billion at June 30, 2022. This\nestimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information\navailable as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an\nestimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm\ndoes not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm\u2019s\nestimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant\njudgment, given: \u2022 the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings,\nincluding the fact that many are in preliminary stages, \u2022 the existence in many\nsuch proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of\nliability (if any) has yet to be determined, \u2022 the numerous yet-unresolved issues\nin many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the\nscope of many of the claims, and \u2022 the attendant uncertainty of the various\npotential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made\nassumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about\nthe behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those\nassumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular\nproceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its\nestimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote.\nAccordingly, the Firm\u2019s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible\nlosses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly.\nSet forth below are descriptions of the Firm\u2019s material legal proceedings.\nAmrapali . India\u2019s Enforcement Directorate (\u201cED\u201d) is investigating J.P. Morgan\nIndia Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by\ntwooffshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential\nhousing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (\u201cAmrapali\u201d). In 2017, numerous\ncreditors filed civil claims against Amrapali, including petitions brought by home\nbuyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units.\nThe home buyers\u2019 petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India and\nare ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India\nPrivate Limited approximately $ 31.5million. The Firm is appealing the order and\nthe fine. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order\nmaking preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified\nJPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects,\nviolated certain currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordering\nthe ED to conduct a further inquiry under India\u2019s Prevention of Money Laundering\nAct (\u201cPMLA\u201d) and Foreign Exchange Management Act (\u201cFEMA\u201d). In May 2020, the ED\nattached approximately $ 25million from J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in\nconnection with the criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and\ncooperating with the PMLA investigation. Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation.\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the\nFederal Government of Nigeria (\u201cFGN\u201d) and two major international oil companies.\nThe account held approximately $ 1.1billion in connection with a dispute among the\nclients over rights to an oil field. Following the settlement of the dispute,\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in\naccordance with directions received from its clients. In November 2017, the\nFederal Republic of Nigeria (\u201cFRN\u201d) commenced a claim in the English High Court\nfor approximately $ 875million in payments made out of the accounts. The FRN\nalleged that the payments were instructed as part of a complex fraud not involving\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or should have\nbeen on notice that the payments may be fraudulent. A trial was held between\nFebruary and April 2022. In June 2022, the Court decided the case in favor of\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dismissed it in full. The FRN has requested\npermission to appeal the decision relating solely to the 2013 payment of\napproximately $ 75million. Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The\nFirm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating\nto its foreign exchange (\u201cFX\u201d) sales and trading activities and controls related\nto those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded\n                                       173                                        \nguilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The Department of Labor\ngranted the Firm a five-yearexemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and\nits affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager\nexemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d) until\nJanuary 2023. The Firm will need the Department of Labor to approve a further\nexemption to cover the remainder of the ten-yeardisqualification period following\nthe antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a South\nAfrica Competition Commission matter which is currently pending before the South\nAfrica Competition Tribunal. With respect to civil litigation matters, in August\n2018, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York\ngranted final approval to the Firm\u2019s settlement of a consolidated class action\nbrought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of federal\nantitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates\nand also sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures and\noptions on futures. Certain members of the settlement class filed requests to the\nCourt to be excluded from the class, and certain of them filed a complaint against\nthe Firm and other foreign exchange dealers in November 2018. A number of these\nactions remain pending. Further, a putative class action has been filed against\nthe Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who\npurchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates. Another putative class\naction was brought against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf\nof purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments. In 2020, the Court approved a\nsettlement by the Firm and 11other defendants of that class action for a total of\n$ 10million. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative class actions\nbased on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S.,\nincluding in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. In a\nputative class action pending before the U.K. Competition Appeal Tribunal, the\ntribunal has denied a request by the proposed class representatives for class\ncertification on an opt-out basis. Inquiries Concerning Preservation Requirements\n. In December 2021 certain of the Firm\u2019s subsidiaries entered into resolutions\nwith the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and the U.S. Commodity\nFutures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) to resolve their respective civil\ninvestigations of compliance with records preservation requirements applicable to\nbroker-dealer firms, swap dealers and futures commission merchants. The SEC and\nCFTC found that J.P. Morgan Securities LLC did not maintain copies of certain\ncommunications required to be maintained under their respective record keeping\nrules, where such communications were sent or received by employees over\nelectronic messaging channels that had not been approved for employee use by the\nFirm. The CFTC resolution also included JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan\nSecurities plc as swap dealers. The SEC and CFTC also found related supervision\nfailures. Under these resolutions, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC paid a $ 125million\ncivil monetary penalty to the SEC, and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities plc paid a total $ 75million civil monetary\npenalty to the CFTC. The Firm continues to respond to requests for information and\nother material from certain authorities concerning its compliance with records\npreservation requirements in connection with business communications sent over\nelectronic messaging channels that have not been approved by the Firm. The Firm is\ncooperating with these inquiries. In March 2022, a shareholder derivative action\nwas filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York\nagainst the Firm\u2019s Board of Directors asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and\nviolation of federal securities laws based on the Board\u2019s alleged failure to\nexercise adequate oversight over compliance with records preservation\nrequirements. The complaint seeks damages, restitution, disgorgement and corporate\ngovernance reforms. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint. Interchange\nLitigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class\naction complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks,\nconspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted\nrelated rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially\nsettled the cases for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card\ninterchange, and modifications to certain credit card network rules. In 2017,\nafter the approval of that settlement was reversed on appeal, the case was\nremanded to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York\nfor further proceedings consistent with the appellate decision. The original class\naction was divided into twoseparate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief\nand the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties\nto the monetary class action finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes\nthe prior settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants\ncollectively contributed an additional $ 900million to the approximately $\n5.3billion previously held in escrow from the original settlement. In December\n2019, the amended settlement agreement was approved by the District Court. Certain\nmerchants appealed the District Court\u2019s approval order, and those appeals are\npending. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended class\nsettlement, $ 700million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement\nescrow in accordance with the settlement agreement. The injunctive class action\ncontinues separately, and in September 2021, the District Court granted\nplaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion in part.\nIn addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions raising similar\nallegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other\nbanks, and some of those actions remain pending.\n                                       174                                        \nLIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has\nresponded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around the\nworld relating primarily to the British Bankers Association\u2019s (\u201cBBA\u201d) London\nInterbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) for various currencies and the European Banking\nFederation\u2019s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cEURIBOR\u201d). The Swiss Competition\nCommission\u2019s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other\nbank remain subject, continues. In December 2016, the European Commission issued a\ndecision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European\nantitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision\nwith the European General Court, and that appeal is pending. In addition, the Firm\nhas been named as a defendant along with other banks in various individual and\nputative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In\nactions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by\nthe BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain\nother actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York has granted class\ncertification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold\ndirectly by the defendants, including the Firm. A consolidated putative class\naction related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was administered by ICE\nBenchmark Administration has been dismissed. In addition, a group of individual\nplaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and\nother defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR\nand conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit\ncards. Defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. In December 2021, the\ncourt denied plaintiffs\u2019 motions for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin\ndefendants from setting U.S. dollar LIBOR and enforcing any financial instruments\nthat rely on U.S. dollar LIBOR. The Firm\u2019s settlements of putative class actions\nrelated to Swiss franc LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the\nSingapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate remain\nsubject to court approval. Metals and U.S. Treasuries Investigations and\nLitigation and Related Inquiries. The Firm previously reported that it and/or\ncertain of its subsidiaries had entered into resolutions with the U.S. Department\nof Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d), the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) and the\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), which, collectively, resolved\nthose agencies\u2019 respective investigations relating to historical trading practices\nby former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related\nconduct from 2008 to 2016. The Firm entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement\n(\u201cDPA\u201d) with the DOJ in which it agreed to the filing of a criminal information\ncharging JPMorgan Chase & Co. with twocounts of wire fraud and agreed, along with\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to certain terms and\nobligations as set forth therein. Under the terms of the DPA, the criminal\ninformation will be dismissed after three years, provided that JPMorgan Chase &\nCo., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC fully comply with\nall of their obligations. Across the threeresolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC,\nJPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC\nagreed to pay a total monetary amount of approximately $ 920million. A portion of\nthe total monetary amount includes victim compensation payments. Several putative\nclass action complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for\nthe Southern District of New York against the Firm and certain former employees,\nalleging a precious metals futures and options price manipulation scheme in\nviolation of the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust\nenrichment and deceptive acts or practices under the General Business Law of the\nState of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class actions, and, in\nJuly 2022, the Court granted final approval of a settlement among the parties. In\naddition, several putative class actions were filed in the United States District\nCourts for the Northern District of Illinois and Southern District of New York\nagainst the Firm, alleging manipulation of U.S. Treasury futures and options, and\nbringing claims under the Commodity Exchange Act. The actions in the Northern\nDistrict of Illinois were transferred to the Southern District of New York. The\nCourt consolidated these putative class actions, and, in June 2022, the Court\ngranted final approval of a settlement among the parties. In Canada, plaintiffs\nhave commenced putative class action proceedings based on similar alleged\nunderlying conduct related to precious metals. In October 2020, twoputative class\naction complaints were filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the Firm\nand certain individual defendants on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares\nduring the putative class period alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm\nwere materially false or misleading in that they did not disclose certain\ninformation relating to the above-referenced investigations. The Court\nconsolidated these putative class actions in January 2021. Plaintiffs filed their\nsecond amended complaint in May 2021, which additionally alleged that certain\norders in precious metals futures contracts placed by precious metals futures\ntraders during the putative class period were materially false and misleading.\nDefendants have moved to dismiss. In May 2022, a shareholder derivative suit\npurporting to act on behalf of the Firm, was filed in the Supreme Court of the\nState of New York asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims\nagainst certain current and former officers and directors of the Firm. The\ncomplaint claims the Firm\u2019s Board of Directors wrongfully rejected the\nshareholder\u2019s demand to commence litigation and seeks\n                                       175                                        \ndamages, disgorgement and corporate governance reforms on the basis of alleged\nsupervisory failures with regard to certain historical spoofing-related conduct\nthat was the subject of the Firm\u2019s resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC in\nSeptember 2020, as well as certain fiduciary activities that were separately the\nsubject of a resolution between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in November\n2020. Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation . JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P.\nMorgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic\nSecurities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class action filed\nin the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The\ncomplaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law and New York State common\nlaw in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous\nexchange trading for securities lending transactions. Defendants\u2019 motion to\ndismiss the complaint was denied. Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this\naction, which defendants are opposing. * * * In addition to the various legal\nproceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as\ndefendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal\nproceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted\nagainst it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend\nitself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time\nin the future. The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its\ncurrently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S.\nGAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when\nit is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss\ncan be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings\neach quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such\nreserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on management\u2019s best judgment\nafter consultation with counsel. The Firm\u2019s legal expense was $ 73million and $\n185million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $\n192million and $ 213million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. There is no assurance that the Firm\u2019s litigation reserves will not\nneed to be adjusted in the future. In view of the inherent difficulty of\npredicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek\nvery large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal\ntheories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery,\nthe Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the\ncurrently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual\nlosses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase\nbelieves, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel,\nconsideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking\ninto account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of\npossible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it\nshould not have a material adverse effect on the Firm\u2019s consolidated financial\ncondition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in\nsuch proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these\nmatters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or\nthat a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the\noutcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operating\nresults for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of\nthe loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s income for that\nperiod.\n                                       176                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Note 25 \u2013 Business segments                                                     \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are fourmajor reportable business\nsegments - Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial\nBanking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment.\nThe business segments are determined based on the products and services provided,\nor the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial\ninformation is currently evaluated by the Firm\u2019s Operating Committee. Segment\nresults are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results below, and Note\n32 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbusiness segments. Segment results The following table provides a summary of the\nFirm\u2019s segment results as of or for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022\nand 2021, on a managed basis. The Firm\u2019s definition of managed basis starts with\nthe reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present\ntotal net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on\nan FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and\ntax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to\ntaxable investments and securities.

Capital allocation\nThe amount of capital assigned to each business segment is referred to as equity.\nPeriodically, the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are\nreassessed and as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change.

These\nMSA-level home price indices consist of\nactual data to the extent available and\nforecasted data where actual data is\nnot available. As a result, the\nestimated collateral values used to\ncalculate these ratios do not represent\nactual appraised loan-level collateral\nvalues; as such, the resulting LTV\nratios are necessarily imprecise and\nshould therefore be viewed as\nestimates.\n                                                                                  \n  Combined LTV ratio                                                              \n                                                                                  \nThe LTV ratio considering all available\nlien positions, as well as unused\nlines, related to the property.\nCombined LTV ratios are used for junior\nlien home equity products.\n\nMacro businesses: the macro businesses\ninclude Rates, Currencies and Emerging\nMarkets, Fixed Income Financing and\nCommodities in CIB's Fixed Income\nMarkets.\n\nManaged basis: A non-GAAP presentation\nof Firmwide financial results that\nincludes reclassifications to present\nrevenue on a fully taxable-equivalent\nbasis.

A\nsubstantial proportion of the Firm\u2019s\nAlt-A loans are those where a borrower\ndoes not provide complete documentation\nof his or her assets or the amount or\nsource of his or her income.\n\nOption ARMs\n\nThe option ARM real estate loan product\nis an adjustable-rate mortgage loan\nthat provides the borrower with the\noption each month to make a fully\namortizing, interest-only or minimum\npayment. The minimum payment on an\noption ARM loan is based on the\ninterest rate charged during the\nintroductory period. This introductory\nrate is usually significantly below the\nfully indexed rate. The fully indexed\nrate is calculated using an index rate\nplus a margin. Once the introductory\nperiod ends, the contractual interest\nrate charged on the loan increases to\nthe fully indexed rate and adjusts\nmonthly to reflect movements in the\nindex. The minimum payment is typically\ninsufficient to cover interest accrued\nin the prior month, and any unpaid\ninterest is deferred and added to the\nprincipal balance of the loan. Option\nARM loans are subject to payment\nrecast, which converts the loan to a\nvariable-rate fully amortizing loan\nupon meeting specified loan balance and\nanniversary date triggers.\n\nPrime\n\nPrime mortgage loans are made to\nborrowers with good credit records who\nmeet specific underwriting\nrequirements, including prescriptive\nrequirements related to income and\noverall debt levels.

A\n5-star rating is the best rating and\nrepresents the top 10% of industry-wide\nranked funds. A 4-star rating\nrepresents the next 22.5% of industry-\nwide ranked funds. A 3-star rating\nrepresents the next 35% of industry-\nwide ranked funds. A 2-star rating\nrepresents the next 22.5% of industry-\nwide ranked funds.

An overall Morningstar rating is\nderived from a weighted average of the\nperformance associated with a fund\u2019s\nthree-, five- and ten- year (if\napplicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.\nFor U.S.-domiciled funds, separate star\nratings are provided at the individual\nshare class level. The Nomura \u201cstar\nrating\u201d is based on three-year risk-\nadjusted performance only. Funds with\nfewer than three years of history are\nnot rated and hence excluded from these\nrankings. All ratings, the assigned\npeer\n                                       189                                        \ncategories and the asset values used to\nderive these rankings are sourced from\nthe applicable fund rating provider.\nWhere applicable, the fund rating\nproviders redenominate asset values\ninto U.S. dollars. The percentage of\nAUM is based on star ratings at the\nshare class level for U.S.-domiciled\nfunds, and at a \u201cprimary share class\u201d\nlevel to represent the star rating of\nall other funds, except for Japan, for\nwhich Nomura provides ratings at the\nfund level. The performance data may\nhave been different if all share\nclasses had been included. Past\nperformance is not indicative of future\nresults.\n\nPercentage of mutual fund assets under\nmanagement in funds ranked in the 1st\nor 2nd quartile (one, three, and five\nyears): All quartile rankings, the\nassigned peer categories and the asset\nvalues used to derive these rankings\nare sourced from the fund rating\nproviders. Quartile rankings are based\non the net-of-fee absolute return of\neach fund. Where applicable, the fund\nrating providers redenominate asset\nvalues into U.S. dollars. The\npercentage of AUM is based on fund\nperformance and associated peer\nrankings at the share class level for\nU.S.-domiciled funds, at a \u201cprimary\nshare class\u201d level to represent the\nquartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg\nand Hong Kong funds and at the fund\nlevel for all other funds. The\nperformance data may have been\ndifferent if all share classes had been\nincluded. Past performance is not\nindicative of future results.\n\n\u201c Primary share class \u201d means the C\nshare class for European funds and Acc\nshare class for Hong Kong and Taiwan\nfunds.
