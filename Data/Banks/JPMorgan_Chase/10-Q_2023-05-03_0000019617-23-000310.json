Comparisons noted in the sections below are for the\nfirst quarter of 2023 versus the first quarter of 2022, unless otherwise specified. Firmwide overview For\nthe first quarter of 2023, JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $12.6 billion, up 52%, earnings per share\nof $4.10, ROE of 18% and ROTCE of 23%. \u2022 Total net revenue was $38.3 billion, up 25%, reflecting: \u2013 Net\ninterest income of $20.7 billion, up 49%, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower Markets net\ninterest income and lower average deposit balances. Net interest income excluding Markets was $20.9 billion,\nup 78%. \u2013 Noninterest revenue was $17.6 billion, up 5%, driven by higher principal transactions revenue in\nMarkets, predominantly offset by higher net investment\n\nsecurities losses in Treasury and CIO, lower Investment Banking fees, lower auto operating lease income and\nlower production revenue in Home Lending. \u2013 Total Markets revenue declined reflecting lower Markets NII,\npredominantly offset by higher NIR. \u2022 Noninterest expense was $20.1 billion, up 5%, driven by higher\nstructural expense and continued investments in the business, primarily compensation expense reflecting\nheadcount growth and wage inflation, as well as the impact of the increase in the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (\" FDIC\") assessment that was announced in 2022 , partially offset by lower auto lease\ndepreciation. \u2022 The provision for credit losses was $2.3 billion, reflecting a net addition of $1.1 billion\nto the allowance for credit losses and $1.1 billion of net c harge-offs. T he net addition to the allowance\nfor credit losses was predominantly driven by a deterioration in the Firm's weighted-average economic\noutlook, including the impact from changes to the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios and increased probability\nof a moderate recession due to tightening financial conditions, and consisted of: \u2013 $726 million in\nwholesale, which also reflected net downgrade activity, and $416 million in consumer. Net c harge-offs were\nup $555 million predominan tly driven by CCB, reflecting continued normalization in delinquencies. The prior\nyear included a $902 million net addition to the allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs of $582\nmillion. \u2022 The total allowance for credit losses was $22.8 billion at March 31, 2023. The Firm had an\nallowance for loan losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 1.85%, compared with 1.69% in the prior year.\n\u2022 The Firm\u2019s nonperforming assets totaled $7.4 billion at March 31, 2023, a net decrease of $1.2 billion,\npredominantly driven by lower consumer nonaccrual loans, reflecting paydowns and loan sales, and lower\nnonperforming derivative receivables. \u2022 Firmwide average loans of $1.1 trillion were up 6%, driven by higher\nloans in CB, CCB and CIB, partially offset by lower loans in AWM. \u2022 Firmwide average deposits of $2.3\ntrillion were down 8%, predominantly driven by: \u2013 declines in CIB and CB due to attrition and in AWM due to\nmigration into higher-yielding investments as a result of the rising interest rate environment, partially\noffset by net issuances of structured notes in CIB , \u2013 a decline in CCB from existing accounts primarily due\nto migration to higher-yielding investments and increased customer spending, and\n                                                     5                                                      \n\u2013 an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's\nongoing international consumer initiatives .\n\nPeriod-end deposits were up reflecting inflows in\nMarch 2023 as a result of disruptions in the market\nrelated to recent bank failures.\n                                                                                                            \n  Selected capital and other metrics                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n\u2022 CET1 capital was $227 billion, and the\nStandardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 13.8%\nand 13.9%, respectively.\n\n\u2022 SLR was 5.9%.\n\n\u2022 TBVPS grew 10%, ending the first quarter of 2023\nat $76.69.\n\n\u2022 As of March 31, 2023, the Firm had average\neligible High Quality Liquid Assets (\u201cHQLA\u201d) of\napproximately $732 billion and unencumbered\nmarketable securities with a fair value of\napproximately $700 billion, resulting in\napproximately $1.4 trillion of liquidity sources.\nRefer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 42-47\nfor additional information.\n\nRefer to Consolidated Results of Operations and\nConsolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 10-12\nand pages 13-14, respectively, for a further\ndiscussion of the Firm's results.\n\nPre-provision profit, ROTCE, TCE, TBVPS, NII and\nNIR excluding Markets, and total net revenue on a\nmanaged basis are non-GAAP financial measures.\nRefer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the\nFirm\u2019s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages\n16-17 for a further discussion of each of these\nmeasures.\n                                                     6                                                      \nBusiness segment highlights Selected business\nmetrics for each of the Firm\u2019s four lines of\nbusiness (\"LOB\") are presented below for the first\nquarter of 2023.\n                                                                                                            \n         \u2022Average deposits down 4%; client investment assets down 1%                                        \n  CCB    \u2022Average loans up 5% year-over-year (\"YoY\") and flat quarter-over-quarter (\"QoQ\"); Card Services   \n  ROE    net charge-off rate of 2.07%                                                                       \n  40%    \u2022Debit and credit card sales volume(a)up 10%                                                       \n         \u2022Active mobile customers(b)up 9%                                                                   \n  CIB    \u2022#1 ranking for Global Investment Banking fees with 8.7%                                           \n  ROE    \u2022Total Markets revenue of $8.4 billion, down 4%, with Fixed Income Markets flat and Equity         \n  16%    Markets down 12%                                                                                   \n  CB     \u2022Gross Investment Banking revenue of $881 million, up 21%                                          \n  ROE    \u2022Average loans up 13% YoY and 1% QoQ; average deposits down 16%                                    \n  18%                                                                                                       \n  AWM    \u2022Assets under management (\"AUM\") of $3.0 trillion, up 2%                                           \n  ROE    \u2022Average loans down 1% YoY and QoQ; average deposits down 22%                                      \n  34%                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \n(a) Excludes Commercial Card.

The Firm expects\nthat these estimates will be further refined over\nthe purchase accounting measurement period.\n\nThe Firm will repay the $25 billion of deposits\nplaced by large U.S. banks with First Republic Bank\non March 16, 2023.

Quarterly results Investment banking fees decreased in CIB, reflecting lower debt\nunderwriting fees as challenging market conditions resulted in lower issuance activity. Refer to C IB\nsegment results on pages 23-27 and Note 5 for additional information. Principal transactions revenue\nincreased, reflecting: \u2022 higher net revenue in Fixed Income Markets, driven by Rates benefiting from\nfavorable market conditions early in the quarter and elevated volatility in March 2023 , as well as in\nSecuritized Products and Fixed Income Financing, partially offset by lower revenue in Currencies & Emerging\nMarkets compared to a strong prior year , \u2022 in Equity Markets, higher revenue in principal transactions,\nparticularly in Prime Finance and Equity Derivatives, which was more than offset by losses in net interest\nincome, \u2022 a loss of $153 million in Credit Adjustments & Other in CIB, compared with a loss of $524 million\nin the prior year, and \u2022 net gains on certain legacy private equity investments in Corporate, compared with\nnet losses in the prior year. Principal transactions revenue in CIB generally has offsets across other\nrevenue lines, including net interest income. The Firm assesses the performance of its CIB Markets business\non a total net revenue basis. Refer to CIB and Corporate segment results on pages 23-27 and pages 33-34,\nrespectively, and Note 5 for additional information.\n\nLending- and deposit-related fees decr eased due to lower cash management fees in CB and CIB associated with\nthe higher level of credits earned by clients that reduce such fees. Refer to CIB and CB segment results on\npages 23-27, pages 28-29 and Note 5 for additional information. Asset management fees decreased driven by\nlower average market levels and lower performance fees, partially offset by the removal of most money market\nfund fee waivers in AWM, and to a lesser extent, the impact of lower market levels in CCB. Refer to AWM\nsegment results on pages 30-32 and Note 5 for additional information. Commissions and other fees: refer to\nCIB and AWM segment results on pages 23-27 and pages 30-32 and Note 5 for additional information. Investment\nsecurities losses reflected higher net losses on sales of U.S. GSE and government agency MBS and U.S.\nTreasuries, associated with repositioning the investment securities portfolio in Treasury and CIO. R efer to\nCorporate segment results on pages 33-34 and Note 9 for additional information. Mortgage fees and related\nincome decreased driven by Home Lending, reflecting lower production revenue from a decline in volume, and\nlower net mortgage servicing revenue due to a net loss compared with a net gain in the prior year in MSR\nrisk management. Refer to CCB segment results on pages 20-22 and Notes 5 and 14 for additional information.\nCard income increased driven by: \u2022 higher net interchange income largely due to a reduction in rewards costs\nand partner payments related to a periodic tax refund on airline miles redeemed, and higher annual fees,\npartially offset by higher amortization related to new account origination costs in CCB, and \u2022 higher\npayments-related revenue on volume growth in Commercial Card in CIB. Refer to CCB and CIB segment results on\npages 20-22 and pages 23-27 and Note 5 for additional information. Other income de creased reflecting: \u2022 the\nabsence of a gain on an equity investment in the prior year in CIB, \u2022 lower auto operating lease income in\nCCB from a decline in volume, and \u2022 the absence of proceeds from an insurance settlement in the prior year,\npartially offset by \u2022 a gain of $339 million in AWM on the original minority interest in CIFM upon the\nFirm's acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in the entity.\n                                                     10                                                     \nNet interest income increased driven by higher rates , partially offset by lower Markets net interest income\nand lower average deposit balances. The Firm\u2019s average interest-earning assets were $3.2 trillion, down $185\nbillion, and the yield was 4.68%, up 282 basis points (\u201cbps\u201d). The net yield on these assets, on an FTE\nbasis, was 2.63%, an increase of 96 bps. The net yield excluding Markets was 3.80%, up 185 bps.

Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for additional\ninformation.\n\nInvestment securities decreased primarily due to\nmaturities and paydowns of U.S. Treasuries and U.S.\nGSE and government agency MBS in both available-\nfor-sale (\u201cAFS\u201d) and held-to-maturity (\u201cHTM\u201d)\nsecurities.

There are four\nmajor reportable business segments \u2013 Consumer &\nCommunity Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank,\nCommercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management.\nIn addition, there is a Corporate segment.\n\nThe business segments are determined based on the\nproducts and services provided, or the type of\ncustomer served, and they reflect the manner in\nwhich financial information is currently evaluated\nby the Firm\u2019s Operating Committee. Segment results\nare presented on a managed basis. Refer to\nExplanation and Reconciliation of the Firm\u2019s use of\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 16-17 for a\ndefinition of managed basis.\n\nDescription of business segment reporting\nmethodology\n\nResults of the business segments are intended to\npresent each segment as if it were a stand-alone\nbusiness. The management reporting process that\nderives business segment results includes the\nallocation of certain income and expense items. The\nFirm periodically assesses the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications used\nfor segment reporting, and further refinements may\nbe implemented in future periods. The Firm also\nassesses the level of capital required for each LOB\non at least an annual basis. The Firm\u2019s LOBs also\nprovide various business metrics which are utilized\nby the Firm and its investors and analysts in\nassessing performance.\n\nRevenue sharing\n\nWhen business segments join efforts to sell\nproducts and services to the Firm\u2019s clients and\ncustomers, the participating business segments may\nagree to share revenue from those transactions.\nRevenue is generally recognized in the segment\nresponsible for the related product or service,\nwith allocations to the other segment(s) involved\nin the transaction. The segment results reflect\nthese revenue-sharing agreements.\n\nFunds transfer pricing\n\nFunds transfer pricing (\u201cFTP\u201d) is the process by\nwhich the Firm allocates interest income and\nexpense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and\ntransfers the primary interest rate risk and\nliquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.\n\nThe funds transfer pricing process considers the\ninterest rate risk and liquidity risk\ncharacteristics of assets and liabilities and off-\nbalance sheet products. Periodically the\nmethodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP\nprocess are adjusted to reflect economic conditions\nand other factors, which may impact the allocation\nof net interest income to the segments.\n\nForeign exchange risk\n\nForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs\nand Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain\nrevenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages\nthese risks centrally and reports the impact of\nforeign exchange rate movements related to the\ntransferred risk in its results. Refer to Market\nRisk Management on pages 67-72 for additional\ninformation.\n\nCapital allocation\n\nThe amount of capital assigned to each business\nsegment is referred to as equity. At least\nannually, the assumptions, judgments and\nmethodologies used to allocate capital are\nreassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated\nto the LOBs may change.\n\nRefer to Line of business equity on page 39, and\npage 93 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for\nadditional information on capital allocation.\n\nRefer to Business Segment Results \u2013 Description of\nbusiness segment reporting methodology on pages\n61-62 and Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form\n10-K for a further discussion of those\nmethodologies.\n                                                     18

(b)\nIncluded depreciation expense on leased assets of $407 million and $694 million for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. (c) Included MSR risk management results of $(12) million and $109\nmillion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. (d) In the first quarter of 2023,\nthe allocations of revenue and expense to CCB associated with a Merchant Services revenue sharing agreement\nwere discontinued and are now retained in Payments in CIB. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform\nwith the current presentation.\n\nQuarterly results Net income was $5.2 billion, up 80%. Net revenue was $16.5 billion, an increase of 35%.\nNet interest income was $12.8 billion, up 54%, driven by: \u2022 deposit margin expansion on higher rates,\npartially offset by lower average deposits in Banking & Wealth Management (\u201cBWM\u201d), and \u2022 higher revolving\nloans in Card Services, partially offset by \u2022 tighter loan spreads in Home Lending. Noninterest revenue was\n$3.6 billion, down 6%, driven by: \u2022 lower auto operating lease income as a result of a decline in volume,\nand \u2022 in Home Lending lower production revenue from a decline in volume and lower net mortgage servicing\nrevenue, reflecting a net loss compared with a net gain in the prior year in MSR risk management, largely\noffset by \u2022 an increase in card income driven by higher net interchange largely due to a reduction in\nrewards costs and partner payments related to a periodic tax refund on airline miles redeemed, and higher\nannual fees, partially offset by higher amortization related to new account origination costs, and \u2022 higher\ntravel-related commissions in Card Services. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on card income,\nasset management fees, and commissions and other fees. Refer to Note 14 for further information regarding\nchanges in the value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and mortgage fees and related income. Noninterest\nexpense was $8.1 billion, up 5%, largely driven by: \u2022 higher compensation expense driven by wage inflation\nand headcount growth, as well as investments in the business, largely offset by \u2022 lower auto lease\ndepreciation on lower auto lease assets. The provision for credit losses was $1.4 billion, and included: \u2022\nnet charge-offs of $1.1 billion, up $499 million, predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting\ncontinued normalization in delinquencies, and \u2022 a $350 million net addition to the allowance for credit\nlosses, driven by a deterioration in the Firm\u2019s weighted-average economic outlook, including $300 million in\nCard Services and $50 million in Home Lending. The prior year included a $125 million addition to the\nallowance for credit losses across CCB.

(b) In the first\nquarter of 2023, the allocations of revenue and\nexpense to CCB associated with a Merchant Services\nrevenue sharing agreement were discontinued and are\nnow retained in Payments in CIB. Prior-period\namounts have been revised to conform with the\ncurrent presentation. Quarterly results Net income\nwas $4.4 billion, up 1%. Net revenue was $13.6\nbillion, flat compared to the prior year. Banking\nrevenue was $4.2 billion, down 1%. \u2022 Investment\nBanking revenue was $1.6 billion, down 24%,\npredominantly driven by lower Investment Banking\nfees, down 19%, reflecting lower debt underwriting\nfees. The Firm ranked #1 for Global Investment\nBanking fees, according to Dealogic. \u2013 D ebt\nunderwriting fees were $663 million, down 34%, and\nEquity underwriting fees were $235 million, down\n6%, as challenging market conditions resulted in\nlower issuance activity. \u2013 Advisory fees were $756\nmillion, down 6%, compared to a strong prior year,\ndriven by a lower level of announced deals. \u2022\nPayments revenue was $2.4 billion, up 26% and\nincluded a gain on an equity investment in the\nprior year. Excluding the net impact of equity\ninvestments, Payments revenue was up 55%, driven by\ndeposit margin expansion on higher rates, partially\noffset by lower average deposits. \u2022 Lending revenue\nwas $267 million, down 17%, and included $103\nmillion of fair value losses on hedges of retained\nloans.\n                                                     23                                                     \nMarkets & Securities Services revenue was $9.4 billion, up 1%. Markets revenue was $8.4 billion, down 4%. \u2022\nFixed Income Markets revenue was $5.7 billion, flat compared to the prior year, reflecting: \u2013 lower revenue\nin Currencies & Emerging Markets compared to a strong prior year, and \u2013 higher revenue in Rates with\nfavorable market conditions early in the quarter and elevated volatility in March 2023, as well as higher\nrevenue in Credit Trading from higher client flows. \u2022 Equity Markets revenue was $2.7 billion, down 12%,\ndriven by lower revenue in Equity Derivatives and Cash Equities, compared to a strong first quarter in the\nprior year. \u2022 Securities Services revenue was $1.1 billion, up 7%, driven by deposit margin expansion on\nhigher rates, partially offset by lower average deposits and lower average market values of assets under\ncustody. \u2022 Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $153 million, driven by losses on certain components of\nfair value option elected liabilities, compared with a loss of $524 million in the prior year. Noninterest\nexpense was $7.5 billion, up 2%, largely driven by higher compensation, including headcount growth and wage\ninflation, largely offset by lower revenue-related compensation. The provision for credit losses was $58\nmillion, predominantly driven by net charge-offs of $50 million. The net addition to the allowance for\ncredit losses was driven by net downgrade activity and a deterioration in the Firm's weighted-average\neconomic outlook, largely offset by a reduction in the allowance for client-specific exposures.

Quarterly results Net income was $1.3\nbillion, up 58%. Net revenue was $3.5 billion, up\n46%. Net interest income was $2.7 billion, up 78%,\ndriven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates,\npartially offset by lower average deposits.\nNoninterest revenue was $781 million, down 10%,\ndriven by lower deposit-related fees due to the\nhigher level of credits earned by clients that\nreduce such fees, partially offset by higher\ninvestment banking revenue. Noninterest expense was\n$1.3 billion, up 16%, largely driven by higher\ncompensation, including headcount growth, as well\nas higher volume-related expense.

Revenue from Asset Management\nwas $2.4 billion, up 5%, driven by: \u2022 a gain of $339 million on the original minority interest in CIFM upon\nthe Firm's acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in the entity, partially offset by \u2022 lower performance\nfees, and \u2022 lower management fees reflecting a decline in market levels, predominantly offset by the removal\nof most money market fund fee waivers. Revenue from Global Private Bank was $2.4 billion, up 17%, driven by:\n\u2022 deposit margin expansion reflecting higher rates on lower average deposit balances, partially offset by \u2022\nan investment valuation loss, and \u2022 tighter spreads on lower average loans. Noninterest expense was $3.1\nbillion, up 8%, predominantly driven by higher compensation due to headcount growth, higher revenue-related\ncompensation and the impact of acquisitions. The provision for credit losses was $28 million.

Noninterest revenue was a loss of $755 million, compared with a\nloss of $345 million in the prior year, driven by: \u2022 higher net investment securities losses on sales of\nU.S. GSE and government agency MBS and U.S. Treasuries, associated with repositioning the investment\nsecurities portfolio, and \u2022 the absence of proceeds from an insurance settlement in the prior year partially\noffset by \u2022 higher net gains on certain legacy private equity investments, compared with net losses in the\nprior year. Noninterest expense of $160 million was down $24 million. The provision for credit losses was\n$370 million, reflecting an addition to the allowance for credit losses, including an allowance for credit\nlosses associated with Other assets. Refer to Note 9 for additional information on the investment securities\nportfolio, and Note 12 for additional information on the allowance for credit losses. The change in the\ncurrent period tax expense was driven by the level and mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal\nand state and local taxes that also impacted the Firm's tax reserves.

When the Firm extends a\nconsumer or wholesale loan, advises customers and\nclients on their investment decisions, makes\nmarkets in securities, or offers other products or\nservices, the Firm takes on some degree of risk.\nThe Firm\u2019s overall objective is to manage its\nbusiness, and the associated risks, in a manner\nthat balances serving the interests of its clients,\ncustomers and investors, and protecting the safety\nand soundness of the Firm. The Firm believes that\neffective risk management requires, among other\nthings: \u2022 Acceptance of responsibility, including\nidentification and escalation of risks by all\nindividuals within the Firm; \u2022 Ownership of risk\nidentification, assessment, data and management\nwithin each of the LOBs and Corporate; and \u2022 A\nFirmwide risk governance and oversight structure.\nThe Firm follows a disciplined and balanced\ncompensation framework with strong internal\ngovernance and independent oversight by the Board\nof Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d). The impact of risk and\ncontrol issues is carefully considered in the\nFirm\u2019s performance evaluation and incentive\ncompensation processes. Risk governance framework\nThe Firm\u2019s risk governance framework involves\nunderstanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and\nimpacts of risks.

The minimum amount of\nregulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and\nbanks is determined by calculating risk-weighted\nassets (\"RWA\"), which are on-balance sheet assets\nand off-balance sheet exposures, weighted according\nto risk. Two comprehensive approaches are\nprescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized\napproach (\u201cBasel III Standardized\u201d), and an\nadvanced approach (\u201cBasel III Advanced\u201d). For each\nof the risk-based capital ratios, the capital\nadequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower\nof the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared\nto their respective regulatory capital ratio\nrequirements. The Firm\u2019s Basel III Standardized\nrisk-based ratios are currently more binding than\nthe Basel III Advanced risk-based ratios.\n\nBasel III also includes a requirement for Advanced\nApproaches banking organizations, including the\nFirm, to calculate its SLR. Refer to SLR on page 39\nfor additional information.\n\nKey Regulatory Developments\n\nCECL regulatory capital transition\n\nBeginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9 billion CECL\ncapital benefit, provided by the Federal Reserve in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic, is being phased\nout at 25% per year over a three-year period. As of\nMarch 31, 2023, the Firm's CET1 capital reflected\nthe remaining $1.4 billion benefit associated with\nthe CECL capital transition provisions.\n\nAdditionally, effective January 1, 2023, the Firm\nphased out 50% of the other CECL capital transition\nprovisions which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted\naverage assets, total leverage exposure and RWA, as\napplicable.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 and\nNote 1 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for\nfurther information on CECL capital transition\nprovisions and the CECL accounting guidance.\n\nRisk-based Capital Targets\n\nThe Firm\u2019s current target for its Basel III\nStandardized CET1 capital ratio is 13.0%, which the\nFirm surpassed in both the fourth quarter of 2022\nand the first quarter of 2023. With consideration\nfor an increase in the global systemically\nimportant banks (\"GSIB\") surcharge in 2024, the\nFirm has maintained a target ratio of 13.5% for the\nfirst quarter of 2024, which assumes no change in\nthe Stress Capital Buffer (\"SCB\"). The Firm\u2019s\nquarterly capital ratios may vary from these\ntargets dependent on market conditions.

Refer to pages 97-104 of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K and the Firm\u2019s U.S.\nLCR Disclosure reports, which are available on the\nFirm\u2019s website, for a further discussion of the\nFirm\u2019s liquidity risk. LCR and HQLA The LCR rule\nrequires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is\nsufficient to meet their respective estimated total\nnet cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-\nday period of significant stress. Under the LCR\nrule, the amount of eligible HQLA held by JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand-\nalone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not\ntransferable to non-bank affiliates, must be\nexcluded from the Firm\u2019s reported eligible HQLA.\nThe LCR for both the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. is required to be a minimum of 100%.

The Firm\u2019s average LCR increased during the three months\nended March 31, 2023, compared with the three months period ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to a\nreturn of funds from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as a result of a dividend payment to the Parent Company.\n\nThe Firm's average LCR increased during the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared with the prior year\nperiod largely driven by an increase in HQLA from long-term debt issuances. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s\naverage LCR decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared with the three months ended\nDecember 31, 2022 reflecting a decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s HQLA, primarily due to a reduction in\ncash associated with a decline in average deposits, a dividend payment to the Parent Company, and higher\naverage loans. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s average LCR for the three months ended March 31, 2023 decreased\nwhen compared with the same period in the prior year, reflecting a decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s\nHQLA as a result of a reduction in cash from a decline in deposits and loan growth, as well as lower market\nvalues of HQLA-eligible investment securities. Refer to Note 9 for additional information on the Firm's\ninvestment securities portfolio. Each of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR fluctuates\nfrom period to period due to changes in their respective eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a\nresult of ongoing business activity. Refer to page 98 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K and the Firm\u2019s U.S.\nLCR Disclosure reports for additional information on HQLA and net cash outflows. Internal stress testing The\nFirm conducts internal liquidity stress testing that is intended to ensure that the Firm and its material\nlegal entities have sufficient liquidity under a variety of adverse scenarios, including scenarios analyzed\nas part of the Firm\u2019s resolution and recovery planning. Internal Stress scenarios are produced on a regular\nbasis, and other stress tests are performed in response to specific market events or concerns. Results of\nstress tests are considered in the formulation of the Firm\u2019s funding plan and assessment of its liquidity\nposition. The Firm maintains liquidity at the Parent Company, the IHC, and operating subsidiaries at levels\nsufficient to comply with liquidity risk tolerances and minimum liquidity requirements, and to manage\nthrough periods of stress when access to normal funding sources may be disrupted. Other liquidity sources In\naddition to the assets reported in the Firm\u2019s eligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered\nmarketable securities, such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm believes would be available to\nraise liquidity. This includes excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not\ntransferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair value of these securities was approximately $700 billion and\n$694 billion as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, although the amount of liquidity that\ncould be raised at any particular time would be dependent on prevailing market conditions.\n                                                     42                                                     \nThe Firm also had available borrowing capacity at\nthe Federal Home Loan Banks (\u201cFHLBs\u201d) and the\ndiscount window at the Federal Reserve Banks as a\nresult of collateral pledged by the Firm to such\nbanks of approximately $330 billion and $323\nbillion as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nrespectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the\nbenefit of cash and securities reported in the\nFirm\u2019s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered\nsecurities that are currently pledged at the\nFederal Reserve Banks discount window and other\ncentral banks. Although available, the Firm does\nnot view this borrowing capacity at the Federal\nReserve Banks discount window and the other central\nbanks as a primary source of liquidity.\n                                                                                                            \n  NSFR                                                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nThe net stable funding ratio (\u201cNSFR\u201d) is a\nliquidity requirement for large banking\norganizations that is intended to measure the\nadequacy of \u201cavailable\u201d stable funding that is\nsufficient to meet their \u201crequired\u201d amounts of\nstable funding over a one-year horizon.\n\nAs of March 31, 2023, the Firm and JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. were compliant with the 100% minimum\nNSFR requirement, based on the Firm's current\ninterpretation of the final rule.

Deposits\nare the primary funding source for JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A.

However, during periods of market disruption those trends could be affected.\n\nAverage deposits were lower for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2022. The decrease was predominantly driven by: \u2022 declines in CIB and CB due to attrition and in\nAWM due to migration into higher-yielding investments as a result of the rising interest rate environment,\npartially offset by net issuances of structured notes in CIB, \u2022 a decline in CCB from existing accounts\nprimarily due to migration to higher-yielding investments and increased customer spending, and \u2022 an increase\nin Corporate related to the Firm's ongoing international consumer initiatives. Period-end deposits\nincreased, reflecting inflows in March 2023, primarily in CCB and CB, as a result of disruptions in the\nmarket related to recent bank failures, which changed the outflow trend that started in the second half of\n2022. AWM also experienced deposit inflows in March which were more than offset by migration to higher-\nyielding investments by month end. The increase in period-end deposits also reflected: \u2022 net issuances of\nstructured notes in CIB as a result of client demand, and \u2022 an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's\nongoing international consumer initiatives.

sold\nunder agreements to repurchase. These instruments\nare secured predominantly by high-quality\nsecurities collateral, including government-issued\ndebt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS.\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase\nincreased at March 31, 2023, compared with December\n31, 2022, due to higher secured financing of\ntrading assets and the impact of a lower level of\nnetting on client-driven market-making activities\nin Markets.\n\nThe balances associated with securities loaned or\nsold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over\ntime due to investment and financing activities of\nclients, the Firm\u2019s demand for financing, the\nongoing management of the mix of the Firm\u2019s\nliabilities, including its secured and unsecured\nfinancing (for both the investment securities and\nmarket-making portfolios), and other market and\nportfolio factors.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s sources of short-term unsecured funding\nprimarily consist of issuances of wholesale\ncommercial paper and other borrowed funds.\n\nThe decrease in commercial paper at March 31, 2023\nfrom December 31, 2022, and for the average three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior\nyear period, was due to lower net issuance levels\nresulting from short-term liquidity management.\n\nThe decrease in average unsecured other borrowed\nfunds for the three months ended March 31, 2023\ncompared to the prior year period was due to lower\nlevels of overdrafts as well as net maturities of\nstructured notes classified as other borrowed funds\nin CIB.\n                                                     45                                                     \nLong-term funding and issuance Long-term funding\nprovides an additional source of stable funding and\nliquidity for the Firm. The Firm\u2019s long-term\nfunding plan is driven primarily by expected client\nactivity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory\nrequirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding\nobjectives include maintaining diversification,\nmaximizing market access and optimizing funding\ncosts. The Firm evaluates various funding markets,\ntenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-\nterm funding plan. The significant majority of the\nFirm\u2019s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the\nParent Company to provide flexibility in support of\nthe funding needs of both bank and non-bank\nsubsidiaries. The Parent Company advances\nsubstantially all net funding proceeds to its\nsubsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to\nexternal counterparties.

On January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted changes to the\nTDR accounting guidance, which eliminated the accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs including the\nrequirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession. The new\nguidance requires disclosure for loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty\nconsisting of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, other-than-insignificant payment delay, term\nextension or a combination of these modifications. The Firm has defined these types of modifications as\nfinancial difficulty modifications (\"FDMs\"). As a result of the elimination of the requirement to assess\nwhether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession, the population of loans considered\nFDMs will differ from those previously considered TDRs.

Retained loans decreased compared to\nDecember 31, 2022, reflecting paydowns, net of\noriginations. Net recoveries were lower for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the\nsame period in the prior year driven by lower\nprepayments due to higher interest rates. Loans at\nfair value increased from December 31, 2022, driven\nby an increase in Home Lending as originations\noutpaced warehouse loan sales, largely offset by\nlower CIB loans as sales outpaced purchases. The\ncarrying value of home equity lines of credit\noutstanding was $14.9 billion at March 31, 2023.\nThis amount included $4.8 billion of HELOCs that\nhave recast from interest-only to fully amortizing\npayments or have been modified and $4.8 billion of\ninterest-only balloon HELOCs, which primarily\nmature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk of\nHELOCs during their revolving period by closing or\nreducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted\nby law when borrowers are exhibiting a material\ndeterioration in their credit risk profile. At\nMarch 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the carrying\nvalue of interest-only residential mortgage loans\nwas $36.4 billion and $36.3 billion, respectively.\nThese loans have an interest-only payment period\ngenerally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-\nrate fully amortizing payment period to maturity\nand are typically originated as higher-balance\nloans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly in\nAWM. The credit performance of this portfolio is\ncomparable with the performance of the broader\nprime mortgage portfolio.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the\nFirm\u2019s residential mortgage portfolio insured\nand/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies,\npredominantly loans held-for-sale and loans at fair\nvalue.

Modified\nresidential real estate loans For the three months\nended March 31, 2023, residential real estate FDMs\nwere $38 million. In addition to FDMs, the Firm\nalso had $23 million of loans subject to trial\nmodification where the terms of the loans have not\nbeen permanently modified, as well as $2 million of\nloans subject to discharge under Chapter 7\nbankruptcy proceedings (\"Chapter 7 loans\"). The\nchanges to the TDR accounting guidance eliminated\nthe TDR reasonably expected and concession\nassessment criteria. Accordingly, trial\nmodifications and Chapter 7 loans were considered\nTDRs, but not FDMs. Refer to Note 1 and Note 11 for\nfurther information. For the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2022, residential real estate TDRs were\n$118 million.

The portfolio increased when\ncompared to December 31, 2022 due to originations\nof scored Auto loans, predominantly offset by\npaydowns. Net charge-offs for the three months\nended March 31, 2023 increased compared to the same\nperiod in the prior year due to higher scored Auto\ncharge-offs as delinquency levels increased and\nvehicle valuations declined.

Net charge-offs\nincreased for the three months ended March 31, 2023\ncompared to the same period in the prior year\nreflecting continued normalization in\ndelinquencies.\n\nConsistent with the Firm\u2019s policy, all credit card\nloans typically remain on accrual status until\ncharged off. However, the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan\nlosses includes the estimated uncollectible portion\nof accrued and billed interest and fee income.\nRefer to Note 11 for further information about this\nportfolio, including information about\ndelinquencies.\n\nGeographic and FICO composition of credit card\nloans\n\nRefer to Note 11 for information on the geographic\nand FICO composition of the Firm\u2019s credit card\nloans.\n                                                                                                            \n  Modifications of credit card loans                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023, credit\ncard FDMs were $163 million. In addition to FDMs,\nthe Firm also had $24 million of loans subject to\ntrial modification where the terms of the loans\nhave not been permanently modified. The changes to\nthe TDR accounting guidance eliminated the TDR\nreasonably expected and concession assessment\ncriteria. Accordingly, trial modifications were\nconsidered TDRs, but not FDMs.\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2022, credit\ncard TDRs were $82 million.\n\nRefer to Note 1 and Note 11 for further\ninformation.\n                                                     53                                                     \n                              \n  WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO  \n                              \nIn its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending,\nmarket-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various\noperating services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and\ncash placed with banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm\u2019s wholesale businesses is\ngenerally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it\noriginates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations\nand credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth\nreviews of client credit quality and transaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of\nindustry, product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 56-59 for further\ninformation. The Firm\u2019s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as\nwell as risk-rated BWM and auto dealer exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied\nwhen determining the allowance for loan losses. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, credit continued\nto perform well with charge-offs remaining low. As of March 31, 2023, the increase in nonperforming exposure\nwas driven by loans, resulting from client-specific downgrades in CIB and CB, partially offset by a\nreduction in lending-related commitments. As of March 31, 2023, retained loans increased $654 million driven\nby CB, largely offset by a decline in AWM. Lending-related commitments increased $12.6 billion driven by net\nportfolio activity in CB and CIB, including an increase in held-for-sale positions in the bridge financing\nportfolio in CB.\n

Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at\nMarch 31, 2023, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or changes in market\nconditions.\n                                                     55                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Wholesale credit exposure \u2013 industry exposures                                                            \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular\nattention to industries with actual or potential credit concerns.\n\nExposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators\u2019 definition of criticized exposures,\nwhich consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure,\nexcluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value was $34.4 billion and $31.3 billion at March 31, 2023\nand December 31, 2022, representing approximately 3.0% and 2.7% of total wholesale credit exposure,\nrespectively. C riticized exposure increased, driven by client-specific downgrades largely in Real Estate,\nConsumer and Retail, Industrials, and Healthcare, partially offset by client-specific upgrades. Of the $34.4\nbillion of criticized exposure at March 31, 2023, approximately half was undrawn and $31.5 billion was\nperforming.\n\nThe table below summarizes by industry the Firm\u2019s exposures as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Because of\nthis collateralization, no allowance for credit\nlosses is generally held against these receivables.\nTo manage its credit risk the Firm establishes\nmargin requirements and monitors the required\nmargin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires\nclients to deposit additional cash or other\ncollateral, or to reduce positions, when\nappropriate.

The\nFirm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet\nthese needs and uses derivatives to manage certain\nrisks associated with net open risk positions from\nits market-making activities, including the\ncounterparty credit risk arising from derivative\nreceivables. The Firm also uses derivative\ninstruments to manage its own credit risk and other\nmarket risk exposure. The nature of the\ncounterparty and the settlement mechanism of the\nderivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm\nis exposed. For over-the-counter (\"OTC\")\nderivatives the Firm is exposed to the credit risk\nof the derivative counterparty. For exchange-traded\nderivatives (\u201cETD\u201d), such as futures and options,\nand cleared over-the-counter (\u201cOTC-cleared\u201d)\nderivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the\ncredit risk of the relevant central counterparty\nclearing house (\u201cCCP\u201d). Where possible, the Firm\nseeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising\nfrom derivative contracts through the use of\nlegally enforceable master netting arrangements and\ncollateral agreements.\n\nThe percentage of the Firm\u2019s over-the-counter\nderivative transactions subject to collateral\nagreements \u2014 excluding foreign exchange spot\ntrades, which are not typically covered by\ncollateral agreements due to their short maturity,\nand centrally cleared trades that are settled daily\n\u2014 was approximately 89% and 87% at March 31, 2023,\nand December 31, 2022, respectively. Refer to Note\n4 for additional information on the Firm\u2019s use of\ncollateral agreements and for a further discussion\nof derivative contracts, counterparties and\nsettlement types.\n\nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported\non the Consolidated balance sheets was $59.3\nbillion and $70.9 billion at March 31, 2023, and\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively. The decrease was\nprimarily driven by market movements in CIB\nMarkets. Derivative receivables represent the fair\nvalue of the derivative contracts after giving\neffect to legally enforceable master netting\nagreements and the related cash collateral held by\nthe Firm.\n\nIn addition, the Firm held liquid securities and\nother cash collateral that may be used as security\nwhen the fair value of the client\u2019s exposure is in\nthe Firm\u2019s favor. For these purposes, the\ndefinition of liquid securities is consistent with\nthe definition of high quality liquid assets as\ndefined in the LCR rule.\n\nIn management\u2019s view, the appropriate measure of\ncurrent credit risk should also take into\nconsideration other collateral, which generally\nrepresents securities that do not qualify as high\nquality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The\nbenefits of these additional collateral amounts for\neach counterparty are subject to a legally\nenforceable master netting agreement and limited to\nthe net amount of the derivative receivables for\neach counterparty.\n\nThe Firm also holds additional collateral\n(primarily cash, G7 government securities, other\nliquid government agency and guaranteed securities,\nand corporate debt and equity securities) delivered\nby clients at the initiation of transactions, as\nwell as collateral related to contracts that have a\nnon-daily call frequency and collateral that the\nFirm has agreed to return but has not yet settled\nas of the reporting date. Although this collateral\ndoes not reduce the balances and is not included in\nthe tables below, it is available as security\nagainst potential exposure that could arise should\nthe fair value of the client\u2019s derivative contracts\nmove in the Firm\u2019s favor.

The allowance for credit losses\ngenerally consists of : \u2022 the allowance for loan\nlosses, which covers the Firm\u2019s retained loan\nportfolios (scored and risk-rated), \u2022 the allowance\nfor lending-related commitments, which is reflected\nin accounts payable and other liabilities on the\nConsolidated balance sheets, and \u2022 the allowance\nfor credit losses on investment securities, which\nis reflected in investment securities on the\nConsolidated balance sheets. Discussion of changes\nin the allowance The allowance for credit losses as\nof March 31, 2023 was $22.8 billion, reflecting a\nnet addition of $1.1 billion from December 31,\n2022. The net addition to the allowance for credit\nlosses was predominantly driven by a deterioration\nin the Firm's weighted-average economic outlook,\nincluding the impact from changes to the Firm\u2019s\nmacroeconomic scenarios, and the additional weight\nplaced on the relative adverse scenario. The\nadditional weight placed on the relative adverse\nscenario reflects an increased probability of a\nmoderate recession due to tightening financial\nconditions, including higher inflation, changes in\nmonetary policy, and geopolitical risks. The net\naddition to the allowance consisted of: \u2022 $726\nmillion in wholesale , which also reflected net\ndowngrade activity, and an addition to the\nallowance for credit losses associated with Other\nassets in Corporate, and \u2022 $416 million in consumer\n. The allowance for credit losses also reflected a\nreduction of $587 million as a result of the\nadoption of changes to the TDR accounting guidance.\nRefer to Note 1 for further information. The Firm's\nallowance for credit losses is estimated using a\nweighted average of five internally developed\nmacroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios\nincorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors\nthan the central case assumptions provided in the\ntable below, resulting in a weighted average U.S.\nunemployment rate peaking at 5.8% in the third\nquarter of 2024, and a 1.2% lower U.S. real GDP\nexiting the second quarter of 2024.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s central case assumptions reflected U.S.\nunemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:\n                                                                                               \n                                       Assumptions at March 31, 2023                           \n                                                                2Q23       4Q23       2Q24     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. unemployment rate(a)                                      3.5  %     4.1  %     4.9  %  \n  YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                                 2.0  %     0.4  %       \u2014  %  \n                                    Assumptions at December 31, 2022                           \n                                                                2Q23       4Q23       2Q24     \n  U.S. unemployment rate(a)                                      3.8  %     4.3  %     5.0  %  \n  YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                                 1.5  %     0.4  %       \u2014  %  \n                                                                                               \n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S.\nunemployment rate.

1, 2023. The adoption of this guidance eliminated the existing accounting and\ndisclosure requirements for TDRs, including the requirement to measure the allowance using a discounted cash\nflow (\"DCF\") methodology. The Firm elected to change from an asset-specific allowance approach to its non-\nDCF, portfolio-based allowance approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers for all portfolios except\ncollateral-dependent loans and nonaccrual risk-rated loans, for which the asset-specific allowance approach\nwill continue to apply. Refer to Note 1 for further information.\n\n(b) Includes collateral-dependent loans, including those for which foreclosure is deemed probable, and\nnonaccrual risk-rated loans for all periods presented. Prior periods also include non collateral-dependent\nTDRs or reasonably expected TDRs and modified purchased credit deteriorated (\"PCD\") loans.\n\n(c) At March 31, 2023, in addition to the allowance for credit losses in the table above, the Firm also had\nan allowance for credit losses of $241 million associated with Other assets in Corporate and $20 million\nassociated with certain accounts receivable in CIB.\n\n(d) The Firm\u2019s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as\npermitted by regulatory guidance.\n                                                     64                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Allocation of allowance for loan losses                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \nThe table below presents a breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan class.

The investment securities portfolio is\npredominantly held by Treasury and CIO in\nconnection with the Firm\u2019s balance sheet and asset-\nliability management objectives. Principal\ninvestments are predominantly privately-held\nfinancial instruments and are managed in the LOBs\nand Corporate. Investments are typically intended\nto be held over extended periods and, accordingly,\nthe Firm has no expectation for short-term realized\ngains with respect to these investments. Investment\nsecurities risk Investment securities risk includes\nthe exposure associated with a default in the\npayment of principal and interest. This risk is\nmitigated given that the investment securities\nportfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly\nconsists of high-quality securities. At March 31,\n2023, the Treasury and CIO investment securities\nportfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses,\nwas $608.1 billion, and the average credit rating\nof the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+\n(based upon external ratings where available, and\nwhere not available, based primarily upon internal\nrisk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results\non pages 33-34 and Note 9 for further information\non the investment securities portfolio and internal\nrisk ratings. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on\npages 42-47 for further information on related\nliquidity risk. Refer to Market Risk Management on\npages 67-72 for further information on the market\nrisk inherent in the portfolio.\n\nPrincipal investment risk Principal investments are\ntypically privately-held financial instruments\nrepresenting ownership interests or other forms of\njunior capital. In general, principal investments\ninclude tax-oriented investments and investments\nmade to enhance or accelerate the Firm\u2019s business\nstrategies and exclude those that are consolidated\non the Firm's balance sheets. These investments are\nmade by dedicated investing businesses or as part\nof a broader business strategy.

The Firm has a single VaR\nframework used as a basis for calculating Risk\nManagement VaR and Regulatory VaR.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR is calculated\nassuming a one-day holding period and an expected\ntail-loss methodology which approximates a 95%\nconfidence level. For risk management purposes, the\nFirm believes this methodology provides a daily\nmeasure of risk that is closely aligned to risk\nmanagement decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate\nand, along with other market risk measures,\nprovides the appropriate information needed to\nrespond to risk events. The Firm calculates\nseparately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance\nwith regulatory rules (\u201cRegulatory VaR\u201d), which is\nused to derive the Firm\u2019s regulatory VaR-based\ncapital requirements under Basel III.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s VaR model calculations are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in response to changes in\nthe composition of the Firm\u2019s portfolios, changes\nin market conditions, improvements in the Firm\u2019s\nmodeling techniques and measurements, and other\nfactors.

This VaR does not include the retained loan\nportfolio, which is not reported at fair value. In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's\ninternal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed\nfrom Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated\nlevels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now reflected in\nother sensitivity-based measures.\n\n(c) For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the effects of nickel price increases and the associated\nvolatility in the nickel market resulted in elevated average and maximum Credit Portfolio VaR. For the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023, average and maximum Credit Portfolio VaR have decreased driven by a reduction\nin nickel-related exposure when compared to the same period in the prior year.\n\n(d) The increase in CCB VaR is driven by interest rate volatility impacting Home Lending warehouse loans,\nMSR, and related hedges.\n\n(e) The increase in Corporate and other LOB VaR is driven by higher market values for a legacy private\nequity position in Corporate which is publicly traded.\n\n(f) The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the\ncomponents and consequently diversification benefit is not meaningful.\n                                                                                                            \n   Quarter over quarter results                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \nAverage total VaR decreased by $14 million for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2023 when compared\nwith December 31, 2022, reflecting reductions in\nexposure across fixed income, equities, and\ncommodities.\n                                                                                                            \n   Year over year results                                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \nAverage total VaR decreased by $16 million for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2023, compared with\nthe same period in the prior year predominantly due\nto a reduction in the nickel-related counterparty\nexposure in Credit Portfolio VaR.\n\nThe following graph presents daily Risk Management\nVaR for the five trailing quarters.

The gains and losses depicted in the\nchart below do not reflect the Firm\u2019s reported revenue as they exclude certain components of total net\nrevenue, such as those associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven\ntrading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, other valuation adjustments and net\ninterest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or\nloss on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the\nrequirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.\n\nA backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the\nprior day. Under the Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are\nconsistent with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR\nbacktesting exceptions five times every 100 trading days on average. The number of VaR backtesting\nexceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the\ncurrent level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility during the 12\nmonths of historical data used in the VaR calculation.\n\nFor the 12 months ended March 31, 2023, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 137 of the 259 days, and\nobserved 16 VaR backtesting exceptions. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Firm posted\nbacktesting gains on 44 of the 64 days, and observed two VaR backtesting exceptions.\n\nThe following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the\ntrailing 12 months and three months ended March 31, 2023. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a\npercentage of the corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are\nshown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the\nintervals that are greater than one hundred percent.

Interest rate risk arises not only\nfrom trading activities but also from the Firm\u2019s\ntraditional banking activities, which include\nextension of loans and credit facilities, taking\ndeposits, issuing debt and the investment\nsecurities portfolio. One way that the Firm\nevaluates its structural interest rate risk is\nthrough earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk\nestimates the Firm\u2019s interest rate exposure for a\ngiven interest rate scenario. It is presented as a\nsensitivity to a baseline, which includes net\ninterest income and certain interest rate sensitive\nfees. The baseline uses market interest rates and\nin the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The\nFirm conducts simulations of changes to this\nbaseline for interest rate-sensitive assets and\nliabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other\ncurrencies (\u201cnon-U.S. dollar\u201d currencies). These\nsimulations primarily include retained loans,\ndeposits, deposits with banks, investment\nsecurities, long-term debt and any related interest\nrate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of other\npositions in risk management VaR and other\nsensitivity-based measures as described on page 132\nof JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K. Earnings-at-\nrisk scenarios estimate the potential change to a\nnet interest income baseline, over the following 12\nmonths utilizing multiple assumptions. These\nscenarios include a parallel shift involving\nchanges to both short-term and long-term rates by\nan equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving\nholding short-term rates constant and increasing\nlong-term rates; and a flatter yield curve\ninvolving increasing short-term rates and holding\nlong-term rates constant or holding short-term\nrates constant and decreasing long-term rates.\nThese scenarios consider many different factors,\nincluding: \u2022 The impact on exposures as a result of\ninstantaneous changes in interest rates from\nbaseline rates. \u2022 Forecasted balance sheet, as well\nas modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior,\nbut excluding assumptions about actions that could\nbe taken by the Firm or its clients and customers\nin response to instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage\nprepayment assumptions are based on the interest\nrates used in the scenarios compared with\nunderlying contractual rates, the time since\norigination, and other factors which are updated\nperiodically based on historical experience.\nDeposit forecasts are a key assumption in the\nFirm's earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects\ncertain assumptions relating to the reversal of\nQuantitative Easing that are highly uncertain and\nrequire management judgment. Therefore, the actual\namount of deposits held by the Firm, at any\nparticular time, could be impacted by actions the\nFederal Reserve may take as part of monetary\npolicy, including through the use of the Reverse\nRepurchase Facility. In addition, there are other\nfactors that impact the amount of deposits held at\nthe Firm such\n\nas the level of loans across the industry and\ncompetition for deposits. \u2022 The pricing sensitivity\nof deposits, known as deposit betas, represent the\namount by which deposit rates paid could change\nupon a given change in market interest rates. The\ndeposit rates paid in these scenarios differ from\nactual deposit rates paid, due to repricing lags\nand other factors. The Firm\u2019s earnings-at-risk\nscenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced\nin response to changes in the composition of the\nFirm\u2019s balance sheet, changes in market conditions,\nimprovements in the Firm\u2019s simulation and other\nfactors. The Firm is currently evaluating the\nmodeling of repricing lags for deposits in its\nearnings-at-risk scenarios. Incorporating repricing\nlags, in the current environment, would\nsignificantly affect the U.S. dollar interest rate\nscenarios, with higher interest rate scenarios\nexpected to result in a positive sensitivity, and\nlower interest rate scenarios expected to result in\na negative sensitivity, on the Firm\u2019s earnings-at-\nrisk. While a relevant measure of the Firm\u2019s\ninterest rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk\nanalysis does not represent a forecast of the\nFirm\u2019s net interest income.

Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to\nmarket risk on page 138 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on the positions\ncaptured in other sensitivity-based measures.\n\nThe table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-\nsensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used\nfor hedging purposes are reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the\ntable below may not be representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at March 31,\n2023 and December 31, 2022, as the movement in market parameters across maturities may vary and are not\nintended to imply management\u2019s expectation of future changes in these sensitivities.\n

The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various\nportfolios which may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the Firm\u2019s exposures\nare diversified given the Firm\u2019s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country. Refer to pages 139-140\nof JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm\u2019s country risk management. Risk\nReporting The following table presents the Firm\u2019s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of\nMarch 31, 2023 and their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2022. The selection of countries\nrepresents the Firm\u2019s largest total exposures by individual country, based on the Firm\u2019s internal country\nrisk management approach, and does not represent the Firm\u2019s view of any existing or potentially adverse\ncredit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to client activity and market\nflows. The increase in exposure to Germany was predominantly driven by increases in cash placed with the\ncentral bank of Germany and in debt securities, due to client-driven market-making activities. The decrease\nin exposure to Australia was predominantly driven by a reduction in cash placed with the central bank of\nAustralia due to client-driven activities resulting from changes in interest rates. The Firm continues to\nmonitor potential impacts to the Firm associated with the war in Ukraine. As of March 31, 2023, exposure to\nRussia was approximately $500 million. This amount excludes certain deposits placed on behalf of clients at\nthe Depository Insurance Agency of Russia.\n

The Firm\u2019s most complex\naccounting estimates require management\u2019s judgment\nto ascertain the appropriate carrying value of\nassets and liabilities. The Firm has established\npolicies and control procedures intended to ensure\nthat estimation methods, including any judgments\nmade as part of such methods, are well-controlled,\nindependently reviewed and applied consistently\nfrom period to period. The methods used and\njudgments made reflect, among other factors, the\nnature of the assets or liabilities and the related\nbusiness and risk management strategies, which may\nvary across the Firm\u2019s businesses and portfolios.\nIn addition, the policies and procedures are\nintended to ensure that the process for changing\nmethodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The\nFirm believes its estimates for determining the\ncarrying value of its assets and liabilities are\nappropriate. The following is a brief description\nof the Firm\u2019s critical accounting estimates\ninvolving significant judgments.\n                                                                                                            \n  Allowance for credit losses                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement\u2019s estimate of expected credit losses\nover the remaining expected life of the Firm\u2019s\nfinancial assets measured at amortized cost and\ncertain off-balance sheet lending-related\ncommitments. The allowance for credit losses\ngenerally consists of:\n\n\u2022 The allowance for loan losses, which covers the\nFirm\u2019s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-\nrated).\n\n\u2022 The allowance for lending-related commitments,\nwhich is reflected in accounts payable and other\nliabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, and\n\n\u2022 The allowance for credit losses on investment\nsecurities, which is reflected in investment\nsecurities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses involves\nsignificant judgment on a number of matters\nincluding development and weighting of\nmacroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of\nhistorical loss experience, assessment of risk\ncharacteristics, assignment of risk ratings,\nvaluation of collateral, and the determination of\nremaining expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note\n13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for further\ninformation on these judgments as well as the\nFirm\u2019s policies and methodologies used to determine\nthe Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses; and refer\nto Allowance for credit losses on pages 63-65 and\nNote 12 of this Form 10-Q for further information.\n\nOne of the most significant judgments involved in\nestimating the Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses\nrelates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to\nestimate credit losses over the eight-quarter\nforecast period within the Firm\u2019s methodology. The\neight-quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of\nmacroeconomic variables (\"MEVs\") that are relevant\nfor exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit\nlosses being driven primarily by a subset of less\nthan twenty\n\nvariables. The specific variables that have the\ngreatest effect on the modeled losses of each\nportfolio vary by portfolio and geography.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include\nregional U.S. unemployment and HPI.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S.\nunemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices,\nU.S. interest rates, corporate credit spreads, oil\nprices, commercial real estate prices and HPI.\n\nChanges in the Firm\u2019s assumptions and forecasts of\neconomic conditions could significantly affect its\nestimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio\nat the balance sheet date or lead to significant\nchanges in the estimate from one reporting period\nto the next.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes\nin any one factor or input might affect the overall\nallowance for credit losses because management\nconsiders a wide variety of factors and inputs in\nestimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes\nin the factors and inputs considered may not occur\nat the same rate and may not be consistent across\nall geographies or product types, and changes in\nfactors and inputs may be directionally\ninconsistent, such that improvement in one factor\nor input may offset deterioration in others.\n\nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate\nmacroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the\nmodeled credit losses determined using its central\nand relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which\nare two of the five scenarios considered in\nestimating the allowances for loan losses and\nlending-related commitments. The central and\nrelative adverse scenarios each included a full\nsuite of MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths\nand peaks/troughs of those variables over the\neight-quarter forecast period.\n\nFor example, compared to the Firm\u2019s central\nscenario shown on page 63 and in Note 12, the\nFirm\u2019s relative adverse scenario assumes an\nelevated U.S. unemployment rate, averaging\napproximately 1.9% higher\n\nover the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak\ndifference of\n\n2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023; lower\n\nU.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining\napproximately 3.0% lower at the end of the eight-\nquarter forecast, with a peak difference of\napproximately 3.3% in the first quarter of 2024;\nand lower national HPI with a peak difference of\napproximately 9.3% in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThis analysis is not intended to estimate expected\nfuture changes in the allowance for credit losses,\nfor a number of reasons, including:\n\n\u2022 The allowance as of March 31, 2023, reflects\ncredit losses beyond those estimated under the\ncentral scenario due to the weight placed on the\nadverse scenarios.\n\n\u2022 The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both\ninterrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this\nanalysis\n                                                     74                                                     \ncannot be simply extrapolated for more severe\nchanges in macroeconomic variables. \u2022 Expectations\nof future changes in portfolio composition and\nborrower behavior can significantly affect the\nallowance for credit losses. To demonstrate the\nsensitivity of credit loss estimates to\nmacroeconomic forecasts as of March 31, 2023, the\nFirm compared the modeled estimates under its\nrelative adverse scenario to its central scenario.\nWithout considering offsetting or correlated\neffects in other qualitative components of the\nFirm\u2019s allowance for credit losses, the comparison\nbetween these two scenarios for the exposures below\nreflect the following differences: \u2022 An increase of\napproximately $650 million for residential real\nestate loans and lending-related commitments \u2022 An\nincrease of approximately $2.5 billion for credit\ncard loans \u2022 An increase of approximately $3.9\nbillion for wholesale loans and lending-related\ncommitments This analysis relates only to the\nmodeled credit loss estimates and is not intended\nto estimate changes in the overall allowance for\ncredit losses as it does not reflect any potential\nchanges in other adjustments to the quantitative\ncalculation, which would also be influenced by the\njudgment management applies to the modeled lifetime\nloss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and\nimprecision of these modeled lifetime loss\nestimates based on then-current circumstances and\nconditions. Recognizing that forecasts of\nmacroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain,\nparticularly in light of the recent economic\nconditions, the Firm believes that its process to\nconsider the available information and associated\nrisks and uncertainties is appropriately governed\nand that its estimates of expected credit losses\nwere reasonable and appropriate for the period\nended March 31, 2023.\n\nFair value JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its\nassets and liabilities at fair value.

The type and level of judgment required\nis largely dependent on the amount of observable\nmarket information available to the Firm. For\ninstruments valued using internally developed\nvaluation models and other valuation techniques\nthat use significant unobservable inputs and are\ntherefore classified within level 3 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair\nvalue are more significant than those required when\nestimating the fair value of instruments classified\nwithin levels 1 and 2.\n\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an\ninstrument within level 3, management must first\ndetermine the appropriate valuation model or other\nvaluation technique to use. Second, the lack of\nobservability of certain significant inputs\nrequires management to assess relevant empirical\ndata in deriving valuation inputs including, for\nexample, transaction details, yield curves,\ninterest rates, prepayment speed, default rates,\nvolatilities, correlations, prices (such as\ncommodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of\ncomparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and\ncredit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further\ndiscussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments,\nincluding unobservable inputs used.\n\nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3,\nmanagement judgment must be applied to assess the\nappropriate level of valuation adjustments to\nreflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm\u2019s\ncreditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity\nconsiderations, unobservable parameters, and for\nportfolios that meet specified criteria, the size\nof the net open risk position. The judgments made\nare typically affected by the type of product and\nits specific contractual terms, and the level of\nliquidity for the product or within the market as a\nwhole. In periods of heightened market volatility\nand uncertainty judgments are further affected by\nthe wider variation of reasonable valuation\nestimates, particularly for positions that are less\nliquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of\nvaluation adjustments applied by the Firm.\n\nImprecision in estimating unobservable market\ninputs or other factors can affect the amount of\ngain or loss recorded for a particular position.\nFurthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation\nmethods are appropriate and consistent with those\nof other market participants, the methods and\nassumptions used reflect management judgment and\nmay vary across the Firm\u2019s businesses and\nportfolios.\n\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions\nin the determination of fair value. The use of\nmethodologies or assumptions different than those\nused by the Firm could result in a different\nestimate of fair value at the reporting date.

\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (\u201cJPMorgan Chase\u201d or the \u201cFirm\u201d), a financial holding company incorporated under\nDelaware law in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The\nFirm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial\nbanking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 25 for a further discussion of\nthe Firm\u2019s business segments. The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its\nsubsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting\nand reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. The unaudited Consolidated Financial\nStatements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent\nassets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion of\nmanagement, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included such that this interim financial\ninformation is fairly stated. These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in\nconjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K. Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been revised to conform with\nthe current presentation. Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of\nJPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material\nintercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Assets held for clients in an agency or\nfiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets. The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first\nevaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity. Refer to Notes 1\nand 14 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for a further description of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s accounting policies\nregarding consolidation. Offsetting assets and liabilities U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative\nreceivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables\nand payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting\nagreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities financing activities to be presented on a net basis when\nspecified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The\nFirm has elected to net such balances where it has determined that the specified conditions are met. Refer\nto Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for further information on offsetting assets and liabilities.\nAccounting standards adopted January 1, 2023 Derivatives and Hedging: Fair Value Hedging \u2013 Portfolio Layer\nMethod The adoption of this guidance expanded the ability to hedge a portfolio of prepayable assets to allow\nmore of the portfolio to be hedged. Non-prepayable assets can also be included in the same portfolio, thus\nincreasing the size of the portfolio and the amount available to be hedged. This guidance also clarified the\ntypes of derivatives that can be used as hedges, and the balance sheet presentation and disclosure\nrequirements for the hedge accounting adjustments. As permitted by the guidance, the Firm elected to\ntransfer HTM securities to AFS and designate those securities in a portfolio layer method hedge upon\nadoption. The adoption impact of the transfer on retained earnings was not material. Refer to Note 4 and\nNote 9 for additional information. Financial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings and\nVintage Disclosures The adoption of this guidance eliminated the accounting and disclosure requirements for\nTDRs, including the requirement to measure the allowance using a discounted cash flow (\u201cDCF\u201d) methodology,\nand allowed the option of a non-DCF portfolio-based approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers. If a\nDCF methodology is still applied for these modified loans, the discount rate must be the post-modification\neffective interest rate, instead of the pre-modification effective interest rate. The Firm elected to apply\nits non-DCF, portfolio-based allowance approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers for all portfolios\nexcept modified nonaccrual risk-rated loans which the Firm elected to continue applying a DCF methodology.\nRefer to Note 12 for a description of the portfolio-based allowance approach and the asset-specific\nallowance approach.\n                                                     84                                                     \nThis guidance was adopted under the modified\nretrospective method which resulted in a net\ndecrease to the allowance for credit losses of $\n587million and an increase to retained earnings of\n$ 446million, after-tax predominantly driven by\nresidential real estate and credit card. The\nadoption of this guidance eliminated the disclosure\nrequirements for TDRs including the requirement to\nassess whether a modification is reasonably\nexpected or involves a concession. The new guidance\nrequires disclosure for loan modifications to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty\nconsisting of principal forgiveness, interest rate\nreduction, other-than-insignificant payment delay,\nterm extension or a combination of these\nmodifications. The Firm has defined these types of\nmodifications as financial difficulty modifications\n(\"FDMs\"). As a result of the elimination of the\nrequirement to assess whether a modification is\nreasonably expected or involves a concession, the\npopulation of loans considered FDMs will differ\nfrom those previously considered TDRs. This\nguidance also requires disclosure of current period\ngross charge-offs by vintage origination year.\nRefer to Note 11 for further information.\n

78.9billion and $\n73.8billion, respectively, which were mortgage-related.\n\n(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable\nvalue. \u201cNet realizable value\u201d is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell\n(\u201ctransaction costs\u201d). Transaction costs for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories are either not\napplicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair\nvalue for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net\nrealizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because\nunder fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 4 for\na further discussion of the Firm\u2019s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value\ndisclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.\n                                                     88                                                     \n(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical\nsecurities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).\n\n(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its\nequivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At March\n31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds,\nprivate equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $ 976million and $ 950million, respectively.\nIncluded in these balances at March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, were trading assets of $ 40million and\n$ 43million, respectively, and other assets of $ 936million and $ 907million, respectively.\n\n(e) At March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, included $ 10.2billion and $ 9.7billion, respectively, of\nresidential first-lien mortgages, and $ 6.4billion and $ 6.8billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien\nmortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell\nto U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $ 3.6billion and $ 2.4billion, respectively.\n\n(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables\nand the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement\nexists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit\nassociated with cash collateral.\n\nLevel 3 valuations\n\nRefer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm\u2019s valuation process\nand a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. The\nfollowing table presents the Firm\u2019s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to\nmeasure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of\nvalues for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to\nclassify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall\nfair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is,\ncomponents that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the\nunobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the\nFirm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and\nderivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of\nvalues presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the\nsignificant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted\naverages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the\ninstruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm\u2019s view, the input range, weighted and\narithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the\nreasonableness of the Firm\u2019s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the\nvarious instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of\ncharacteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and\nvaluation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option\ncontracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted average values\nwill therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the\ninstruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.\n                                                     89                                                     \n

Furthermore, the inputs presented for each\nvaluation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the\ntechnique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ.\n\n(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $ 732million, nonagency securities of $ 5million\nand non-trading loans of $ 958million.\n\n(c) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $ 25million, nonagency securities of $ 10million,\ntrading loans of $ 72million and non-trading loans of $ 325million.\n\n(d) Comprises trading loans of $ 854million and non-trading loans of $ 196million.\n\n(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are\nfinancial instruments that typically contain embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of\nstructured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant\nunobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.\n\n(f) Includes equity securities of $ 796million including $ 215million in Other assets, for which quoted\nprices are not readily available and the fair value is generally based on internal valuation techniques such\nas EBITDA multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant both\nindividually and in aggregate.\n\n(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not\nreadily available, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal valuation techniques. The price\ninput is expressed assuming a par value of $ 100.\n\n(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.\n\n(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are\nused.\n                                                     90                                                     \nChanges in and ranges of unobservable inputs Refer\nto Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for a\ndiscussion of the impact on fair value of changes\nin unobservable inputs and the relationships\nbetween unobservable inputs as well as a\ndescription of attributes of the underlying\ninstruments and external market factors that affect\nthe range of inputs used in the valuation of the\nFirm\u2019s positions. Changes in level 3 recurring fair\nvalue measurements The following tables include a\nrollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets\namounts (including changes in fair value) for\nfinancial instruments classified by the Firm within\nlevel 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. When a\ndetermination is made to classify a financial\ninstrument within level 3, the determination is\nbased on the significance of the unobservable\ninputs to the overall fair value measurement.\nHowever, level 3 financial instruments typically\ninclude, in addition to the unobservable or level 3\ncomponents, observable components (that is,\ncomponents that are actively quoted and can be\nvalidated to external sources); accordingly, the\ngains and losses in the table below include changes\nin fair value due in part to observable factors\nthat are part of the valuation methodology. Also,\nthe Firm risk-manages the observable components of\nlevel 3 financial instruments using securities and\nderivative positions that are classified within\nlevel 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these\nlevel 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are\nnot included below, the gains or losses in the\nfollowing tables do not reflect the effect of the\nFirm\u2019s risk management

Refer to Assets and liabilities measured at\nfair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 95 for\nfurther information on changes impacting items\nmeasured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.\nThree months ended March 31, 2023 Level 3 assets\nwere $ 23.8billion at March 31, 2023, relatively\nflat compared to December 31, 2022, with no\nindividually significant movements. Refer to the\nsections below for additional information.\nTransfers between levels for instruments carried at\nfair value on a recurring basis For the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023, there were no\nsignificant transfers from level 2 into level 3.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023,\nsignificant transfers from level 3 into level 2\nincluded the following: \u2022 $ 953million of gross\nequity derivative receivables as a result of an\nincrease in observability and a decrease in the\nsignificance of unobservable inputs. For the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2022, significant transfers\nfrom level 2 into level 3 included the following: \u2022\n$ 1.2billion of total debt and equity instruments,\nlargely due to equity securities of $ 853million\ndriven by a decrease in observability as a result\nof restricted access to certain markets. For the\nthree months ended March 31, 2022, there were no\nsignificant transfers from level 3 into level 2.\nAll transfers are based on changes in the\nobservability and/or significance of the valuation\ninputs and are assumed to occur at the beginning of\nthe quarterly reporting period in which they occur.\nGains and losses The following describes\nsignificant components of total realized/unrealized\ngains/(losses) for instruments measured at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis for the periods\nindicated. These amounts exclude any effects of the\nFirm\u2019s risk management activities where the\nfinancial instruments are classified as level 1 and\n2 of the fair value hierarchy.

These shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa\nClass A common shares (\u201cVisa A shares\u201d) at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain\nlitigation matters involving Visa. The conversion rate of Visa B shares into Visa A shares was 1.5991at\nMarch 31, 2023, and the conversion rate may be adjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the\nlitigation matters. The outcome of those litigation matters, and the effect that the resolution of those\nmatters may have on the conversion rate, is unknown. Accordingly, as of March 31, 2023, there is significant\nuncertainty regarding when the transfer restrictions on Visa B shares may be terminated and what the final\nconversion rate for the Visa B shares will be. As a result of these considerations, as well as differences\nin voting rights, Visa B shares are not considered to be similar to Visa A shares, and they continue to be\nheld at their nominal carrying value.\n\nIn connection with prior sales of Visa B shares, the Firm has entered into derivative instruments with the\npurchasers of the shares under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the conversion\nrate. Under the terms of the derivative instruments, the Firm will (a) make or receive payments based on\nsubsequent changes in the conversion rate and (b) make periodic interest payments to the purchasers of the\nVisa B shares. The payments under the derivative instruments will continue as long as the Visa B shares\nremain subject to transfer restrictions. The derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value using a\ndiscounted cash flow methodology based upon the Firm\u2019s estimate of the timing and magnitude of final\nresolution of the litigation matters. The derivative instruments are recorded in trading liabilities, and\nchanges in fair value are recognized in other income. As of March 31, 2023, the Firm held derivative\ninstruments associated with 23million Visa B shares that the Firm had previously sold, which are all subject\nto similar terms and conditions.\n

underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual\nfees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and\nprimary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the\nvalue of the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan\u2019s allowance for\nloan losses, which represents the loan\u2019s expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The\ndifference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to\nchanges in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that\naffect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value.\nThe majority of the Firm\u2019s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-\nrelated commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.\n                                                                                                            \n           Ma\u2026                                               De\u2026                                            \n           31,                                               31,                                            \n           20\u2026                                               20\u2026                                            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                     Es\u2026                                               Es\u2026                                  \n                     fa\u2026                                               fa\u2026                                  \n                     va\u2026                                               va\u2026                                  \n                     hi\u2026                                               hi\u2026                                  \n           Ca\u2026                                     To\u2026       Ca\u2026                                      Tot\u2026  \n  (\u2026       va\u2026       Le\u2026       Le\u2026       Le\u2026       es\u2026       va\u2026       Le\u2026       Lev\u2026       Le\u2026       est\u2026  \n  b\u2026       (b)       1         2           3       fa\u2026       (b)       1         2            3       fair  \n                                                   va\u2026                                                val\u2026  \n  W\u2026                                                                                                        \n  l\u2026    $  2.3    $  \u2014      $  \u2014      $  3.2    $  3.2    $  2.3    $  \u2014      $  \u2014       $  3.2    $   3.2  \n  c\u2026                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n(a) Excludes the current carrying values of the guarantee liability and the offsetting asset, each of which\nis recognized at fair value at the inception of the guarantees.\n(b) Includes the wholesale allowance for lending-related commitments.\nThe Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.

has been elected are recorded in OCI, while realized gains/(losses) are recorded in\nprincipal transactions revenue. Realized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk recorded in\nprincipal transactions revenue were not material for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022.\n(b) Long-term debt measured at fair value predominantly relates to structured notes. Although the risk\nassociated with the structured notes is actively managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this table do not\ninclude the income statement impact of the risk management instruments used to manage such risk.\n(c) Reported in mortgage fees and related income.\n(d) Reported in other income.\n(e) Changes in fair value exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest\nexpense for all instruments other than certain hybrid financial instruments in CIB. Refer to Note 6 for\nfurther information regarding interest income and interest expense.\n                                                     98

However, investors are exposed to the credit\nrisk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.\n(d) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the\ncontractual principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm\u2019s\nnext call date.\nAt March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which\nthe fair value option was elected was $ 9.4billion and $ 7.6billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair\nvalue of $ 12million and $ 24million, respectively.

Derivatives contracts generally\nrequire additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined rating\nthreshold is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a\npreexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in\nadditional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a\nratings downgrade), nor in termination payment requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated\nbased upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative\ncontract.\n                                                                                                            \n  Liquidity                                                                                                 \n  impact of                                                                                                 \n  downgrade                                                                                                 \n  triggers                                                                                                  \n  on OTC and                                                                                                \n  OTC-cleared                                                          December 31,                         \n  derivatives           March 31, 2023                                         2022                         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (in millions)           Single-notch              Two-notch          Single-notch              Two-notch  \n                             downgrade              downgrade             downgrade              downgrade  \n  Amount of                                                                                                 \n  additional                                                                                                \n  collateral to     $              112    $             1,216    $              128    $             1,293  \n  be                                                                                                        \n  posted upon                                                                                               \n  downgrade(a)                                                                                              \n  Amount                                                                                                    \n  required to                                                                                               \n  settle                                                                                                    \n  contracts with                    84                    744                    88                    925  \n  termination                                                                                               \n  triggers upon                                                                                             \n  downgrade(b)                                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \n(a) Includes the additional collateral to be posted for initial margin.\n(b) Amounts represent fair values of derivative payables, and do not reflect collateral posted.\nDerivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset\n\nIn certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains\nthe economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in\ncontemplation of the initial transfer.

As a result of\nthe application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing\nunrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is\nno incremental impact to net income in future periods.\n(b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis\nadjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future\nperiods.

For cash flow\nhedges that have been terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in\nAOCI will be recognized in earnings is approximately seven years, corresponding to the timing of the\noriginally hedged forecasted cash flows. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which\nforecasted transactions are hedged is approximately seven years. The Firm\u2019s longer-dated forecasted\ntransactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities.\n\nNet investment hedge gains and losses\nThe following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge\naccounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the three months\nended March 31, 2023 and 2022.\n                                                                                                            \n                  Gains/(losse\u2026                                                                             \n                  recorded in                                                                               \n                  income and                                                                                \n                  other                                                                                     \n                  comprehensive                                                                             \n  Three months    income/(loss)                                                                             \n  ended March     2023                                         2022                                         \n  31,             Amounts                           Amounts    Amounts                             Amounts  \n  (in             recorded in                   recorded in    recorded in                     recorded in  \n  millions)       income(a)(b)                          OCI    income(a)(b)                            OCI  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Foreign                                                                                                   \n  exchange                         $  84    $        -1,004                     $  -131    $           338  \n  derivatives                                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n(a) Certain components of hedging derivatives are permitted to be excluded from the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness, such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts.

the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period,\nweighted based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon,\namortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives,\nincluding closed portfolio hedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield\nexcludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from\ntheir contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable\ndebt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.\n(b) For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the allowance\nfor credit losses of $( 29) million and the portfolio layer fair value hedge basis adjustments of $\n21million at March 31, 2023. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities also excludes the allowance\nfor credit losses of $( 61) million at March 31, 2023.\n(c) Substantially all of the Firm\u2019s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in\n10years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects\nanticipated future prepayments, is approximately seven yearsfor agency residential MBS, and six yearsfor\nboth agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and nonagency residential collateralized\nmortgage obligations.\n                                                    119                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Note 10 \u2013 Securities financing activities                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \nRefer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting policies relating to\nsecurities financing activities.

In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its\ncounterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for\nnet Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with\nrespect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with securities financing\nbalances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table\nbelow as \u201cAmounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,\u201d and reduces the \u201cNet amounts\u201d presented.\nWhere a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are\npresented gross in the \u201cNet amounts\u201d below. In transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a\nsecurities-for-securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as\ncollateral, the Firm recognizes the securities received at fair value within other assets and the obligation\nto return those securities within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n

2023, and December 31, 2022, the Firm held $ 871million and $ 692million, respectively, of\nfinancial assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not\nqualify as a sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized\nfinancing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the\ncorresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in short-term borrowings on the Consolidated balance\nsheets.\n                                                    121                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Note 11 \u2013 Loans                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \nLoan accounting framework\n\nThe accounting for a loan depends on management\u2019s strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based\non the following categories:\n\n\u2022 Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., \u201cretained\u201d)\n\n\u2022 Loans held-for-sale\n\n\u2022 Loans at fair value\n\nRefer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting\npolicies. Refer to Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value\naccounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 of this Form 10-Q for information on loans carried\nat fair value and classified as trading assets.\n\nOn January 1, 2023 the Firm adopted the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings\nand Vintage Disclosures accounting guidance as discussed in Note 1. The adoption of this guidance eliminated\nthe existing accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs, and implemented additional disclosure\nrequirements for FDMs. The disclosure requirements for FDMs are effective for periods beginning on or after\nJanuary 1, 2023. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion on loan\nmodifications prior to January 1, 2023, which were accounted for and reported as TDRs. This new guidance\nalso requires disclosure of current period gross charge-offs by vintage origination year, effective for\nperiods beginning on or after January 1, 2023.\n\nLoan portfolio\nThe Firm\u2019s loan portfolio is divided into threeportfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the\nFirm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and\nWholesale. Within each portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following\nclasses of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class.\n                                                                                      \n  Consumer, excluding             Credit card            Wholesale(c)(d)              \n  credit card                                                                         \n  \u2022 Residential real estate(a)                           \u2022 Secured by real estate     \n  \u2022 Auto and other(b)             \u2022 Credit card loans    \u2022 Commercial and industrial  \n                                                         \u2022 Other(e)                   \n                                                                                      \n(a) Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored mortgage loans held in\nCIB and Corporate.\n(b) Includes scored auto and business banking loans and overdrafts.\n(c) Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM, Corporate as well as risk-rated BWM and auto dealer loans held in\nCCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses.\n(d) The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the bank\nregulatory agencies, based on the loan's collateral, purpose, and type of borrower.\n(e) Includes loans to financial institutions, states and political subdivisions, SPEs, nonprofits, personal\ninvestment companies and trusts, as well as loans to individuals and individual entities (predominantly\nGlobal Private Bank clients within AWM and J.P.

That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for\nthose products is higher than the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving\nperiod.\n                                                    125                                                     \nNonaccrual loans and other credit quality indicators\n\nThe following table provides information on nonaccrual and other credit quality indicators for retained\nresidential real estate loans.\n                                                                                                   \n  (in millions, except weighted-average                                                            \n  data)                                          March 31, 2023        December 31, 2022           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Nonaccrual loans(a)(b)(c)(d)(e)             $           3,710     $              3,745           \n  Current estimated LTV ratios(f)(g)(h)                                                            \n  Greater than 125% and refreshed FICO                                                             \n  scores:                                                                                          \n  Equal to or greater than 660                $               4     $                  2           \n  Less than 660                                               2                        \u2014           \n  101% to 125% and refreshed FICO scores:                                                          \n  Equal to or greater than 660                              196                      174           \n  Less than 660                                               5                        6           \n  80% to 100% and refreshed FICO scores:                                                           \n  Equal to or greater than 660                           12,774                   12,034           \n  Less than 660                                             250                      184           \n  Less than 80% and refreshed FICO scores:                                                         \n  Equal to or greater than 660                          213,157                  215,096           \n  Less than 660                                           8,823                    8,659           \n  No FICO/LTV available                                     904                    1,406       -k  \n  Total retained loans                        $         236,115     $            237,561           \n  Weighted average LTV ratio(f)(i)                           51  %                    51  %        \n  Weighted average FICO(g)(i)                               770                      769           \n  Geographic region(j)(k)                                                                          \n  California                                  $          72,610     $             73,112           \n  New York                                               34,271                   34,471           \n  Florida                                                18,877                   18,870           \n  Texas                                                  14,899                   14,968           \n  Illinois                                               11,133                   11,296           \n  Colorado                                                9,979                    9,968           \n  Washington                                              9,043                    9,060           \n  New Jersey                                              7,013                    7,108           \n  Massachusetts                                           6,352                    6,380           \n  Connecticut                                             5,408                    5,432           \n  All other                                              46,530                   46,896           \n  Total retained loans                        $         236,115     $            237,561           \n                                                                                                   \n(a) I ncludes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of\nthe underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance,\nresidential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the\nborrower (\u201cChapter 7 loans\u201d) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual loans, regardless of their delinquency\nstatus. At March 31, 2023, approximately 9% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more\npast due.\n\n(b) Mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies excluded from nonaccrual loans were not material at\nMarch 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\n(c) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance,\ncertain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of\namortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the\nunderlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.\n\n(d) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $ 45million for both the three months\nended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n(e) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n(f) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property\nvalue. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using\nnationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available\nand forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home\nequity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.\n\n(g) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower\u2019s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm\non at least a quarterly basis.\n\n(h) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO\nscore. These loans have been included in a FICO band based on management\u2019s estimation of the borrower\u2019s\ncredit quality.\n\n(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.\n\n(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding\nloan balances at March 31, 2023.\n\n(k) Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation.\n                                                    126                                                     \nLoan modifications The Firm grants certain\nmodifications of residential real estate loans to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which\neffective January 1, 2023, are reported as FDMs.\nThe Firm's proprietary modification programs as\nwell as government programs, including U.S. GSE\nprograms, generally provide various modifications\nto borrowers experiencing financial difficulty\nincluding, but not limited to, interest rate\nreductions, term extensions, other-than-\ninsignificant payment delay and principal\nforgiveness that would otherwise have been required\nunder the terms of the original agreement, are\nconsidered FDMs. For the three months ended March\n31, 2023, residential real estate FDMs were $\n38million. The financial effects of the FDMs, which\nwere largely in the form of term extensions and\ninterest rate reductions, included extending the\nweighted-average life of the loans up to 24years,\nand reducing the weighted-average contractual\ninterest rate from 5.84% to 3.57%. There were\nnoadditional commitments to lend to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty whose loans have\nbeen modified as FDMs. In addition to FDMs, the\nFirm also had $ 23million of loans subject to a\ntrial modification, and $ 2million of Chapter 7\nloans. The changes to the TDR accounting guidance\neliminated the TDR reasonably expected and\nconcession assessment criteria. Accordingly, trial\nmodifications and Chapter 7 loans were considered\nTDRs, but not FDMs. For periods ending prior to\nJanuary 1, 2023, modifications of residential real\nestate loans where the Firm granted concessions to\nborrowers who were experiencing financial\ndifficulty were generally accounted for and\nreported as TDRs. For the three months ended March\n31, 2022, new TDRs were $ 118million. There were no\nadditional commitments to lend to borrowers whose\nresidential real estate loans have been modified in\nTDRs.

difficulty,\nwhich effective January 1, 2023, are reported as FDMs. These modifications involve placing the customer on a\nfixed payment plan, generally for 60months, and typically include reducing

borrowers experiencing financial difficulty whose\nCommercial and industrial loans have been modified as FDMs were $ 909million. FDMs to borrowers in the Other\nloan class were $ 63million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The financial effect of FDMs extended\nthe loans by a weighted-average of four monthsand were generally in the form of term extensions. There were\nnoadditional commitments to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty whose loans have been modified as\nFDMs. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, Secured by real estate FDMs were notmaterial and there were\nnoadditional commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty whose loans have been\nmodified as FDMs.\n\nPrior to January 1, 2023, certain loan modifications were considered TDRs. F or the three months ended March\n31, 2022, n ew TDRs were $ 418million and reflected the extension of maturity dates, covenant waivers,\nreceipt of assets in partial satisfaction of the loan and deferral of principal and interest payments,\npredominantly in the Commercial and Industrial and Other loan classes. For the three months ended March 31,\n2022, the impact of these modifications were not material to the Firm. As a result of the elimination of the\nrequirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession, the population\nof loans considered FDMs is greater than those previously considered TDRs.\n                                                    136                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Note 12 \u2013 Allowance for credit losses                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement's estimate of expected credit losses\nover the remaining expected life of the Firm's\nfinancial assets measured at amortized cost and\ncertain off-balance sheet lending-related\ncommitments. On January 1, 2023 the Firm adopted\nthe Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled\nDebt Restructurings accounting guidance as\ndescribed in Note 1. The adoption of this guidance\neliminated the requirement to measure the allowance\nfor TDRs using a DCF methodology and allowed the\noption of a non-DCF portfolio-based approach for\nmodified loans to borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty. If a DCF methodology is still applied\nfor these modified loans, the discount rate must be\nthe post-modification effective interest rate,\ninstead of the pre-modification effective interest\nrate. The Firm elected to change from an asset-\nspecific allowance approach to its non-DCF,\nportfolio-based allowance approach for modified\nloans to troubled borrowers for all portfolios\nexcept collateral-dependent loans and nonaccrual\nrisk-rated loans, for which the asset-specific\nallowance approach will continue to apply. This\nguidance was adopted under the modified\nretrospective method which resulted in a net\ndecrease to the allowance for credit losses of $\n587million and an increase to retained earnings of\n$ 446million, after-tax predominantly driven by\nresidential real estate and credit card.

March 31, 2023, in addition to the allowance for credit losses in the table above, the Firm also had\nan allowance for credit losses of $ 241million associated with Other assets in Corporate and $ 20million\nassociated with certain accounts receivable in CIB.\n(c) Includes collateral-dependent loans, including those for which foreclosure is deemed probable, and\nnonaccrual risk-rated loans for all periods presented. Prior periods also include non collateral-dependent\nTDRs or reasonably expected TDRs and modified PCD loans.\n(d) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets.\n(e) At March 31, 2023 and 2022, lending-related commitments excluded $ 16.0billion and $ 15.3billion,\nrespectively, for the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment; $ 861.2billion and $ 757.3billion,\nrespectively, for the credit card portfolio segment; and $ 17.5billion and $ 32.9billion, respectively, for\nthe wholesale portfolio segment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-related commitments.\n                                                    138                                                     \nDiscussion of changes in the allowance\n\nThe allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2023 was $ 22.8billion, reflecting a net addition of $\n1.1billion from December 31, 2022. The net addition to the allowance for credit losses was predominantly\ndriven by a deterioration in the Firm's weighted-average economic outlook, including the impact from changes\nto the Firm\u2019s macroeconomic scenarios, and the additional weight placed on the relative adverse scenario.\nThe additional weight placed on the relative adverse scenario reflects an increased probability of a\nmoderate recession due to tightening financial conditions, including higher inflation, changes in monetary\npolicy, and geopolitical risks. The net addition to the allowance consisted of: \u2022 $ 726million in wholesale\n, which also reflected net downgrade activity, and an addition to the allowance for credit losses associated\nwith Other assets in Corporate, and \u2022 $ 416million in consumer . The allowance for credit losses also\nreflected a reduction of $ 587million as a result of the adoption of changes to the TDR accounting guidance.\nRefer to Note 1 for further information. The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a\nweighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate\nmore punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the table below, resulting\nin a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.8% in the third quarter of 2024, and a 1.2% lower\nU.S. real GDP exiting the second quarter of 2024.\nThe Firm\u2019s central case assumptions reflected U.S.\nunemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:\n                                                                                               \n                                       Assumptions at March 31, 2023                           \n                                                                2Q23       4Q23       2Q24     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. unemployment rate(a)                                      3.5  %     4.1  %     4.9  %  \n  YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                                 2.0  %     0.4  %       \u2014  %  \n                                    Assumptions at December 31, 2022                           \n                                                                2Q23       4Q23       2Q24     \n  U.S. unemployment rate(a)                                      3.8  %     4.3  %     5.0  %  \n  YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                                 1.5  %     0.4  %       \u2014  %  \n                                                                                               \n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S.\nunemployment rate.\n(b) The year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in\nthe forecast horizon of the central scenario is\ncalculated as the percentage change in U.S. real\nGDP levels from the prior year.

securitizations in\nCIB.\n(c) Includes assets classified as cash and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n(d) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the\nliabilities of those entities. The assets and liabilities include third-party assets and liabilities of\nconsolidated VIEs and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.\n(e) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the\nline item on the Consolidated balance sheets titled, \u201cBeneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs\u201d. The\nholders of these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan\nChase. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $ 1.1billion and\n$ 2.1billion at March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively.\n(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance\nsheets.\nVIEs sponsored by third parties\n\nThe Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting\nas a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent,\ntrustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm\u2019s-length, and individual credit decisions are\nbased on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets.\nWhere the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact\nthe VIE\u2019s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm\ngenerally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated\nbalance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party\ntransaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are\nlimited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other\nprojects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or\nmanaging member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly\nthe Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a\nlimited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects.\nThe maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $ 30.2billion at\nboth March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, of which $ 10.7billion and $ 10.6billion was unfunded at March\n31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk of\nloss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits.\nRefer to Note 25 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for further information on affordable housing tax\ncredits and Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.\n                                                    143                                                     \nCustomer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts,\nincluding remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the\nFirm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those\ntransactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders\nfor any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on\nany of the underlying municipal bonds.

These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the\npurpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit\nenhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae\nguidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does\nnot consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary\nbeneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk\nassociated with the sold loans with the purchaser.

Refer to\nNote 15 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for a\nfurther discussion of the Firm\u2019s goodwill\nimpairment testing. Unanticipated declines in\nbusiness performance, increases in credit losses,\nincreases in capital requirements, as well as\ndeterioration in economic or market conditions,\nadverse regulatory or legislative changes or\nincreases in the estimated market cost of equity,\ncould cause the estimated fair values of the Firm\u2019s\nreporting units to decline in the future, which\ncould result in a material impairment charge to\nearnings in a future period related to some portion\nof the associated goodwill. As of March 31, 2023,\nthe Firm reviewed current economic conditions,\nestimated market cost of equity, as well as actual\nbusiness results and projections of business\nperformance. Based on such reviews, the Firm has\nconcluded that goodwill was not impaired as of\nMarch 31, 2023, or December 31, 2022, nor was\ngoodwill written off due to impairment during the\nthree months ended March 31, 2023 or 2022.\n                                                    146                                                     \nMortgage servicing rights\n\nMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others.\nThe fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to\nservice the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively\namortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased\nfrom third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained.\nRefer to Notes 2 and 15 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for

The contractual amount of these financial instruments\nrepresents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the\ncommitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or\nclient subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and\nguarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a\ndefault occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm\u2019s\nview, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and\nthe Firm\u2019s related accounting policies. To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain\nconsumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is\nmaintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-\nrelated commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-\nbalance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at March 31, 2023, and\nDecember 31, 2022. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain scored business\nbanking lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has\nnot experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be\nutilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business banking\nlines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In\naddition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60days or more past due. The Firm\nmay reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or\nwhen there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.\n                                                    156                                                     \n

Refer to Note 4 for a further\ndiscussion of credit derivatives.\n\nMerchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment networks, in its role as a merchant acquirer, the Firm's\nMerchant Services business in CIB Payments, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed credit and\ndebit card transactions that result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the\ncardholder\u2019s favor, the Firm will (through the cardholder\u2019s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the\ncardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If the Firm is unable to collect the amount\nfrom the merchant, the Firm will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. The\nFirm mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining\nother collateral. In addition, the Firm recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or\nperformance risk related to charge-backs.\n                                                    158                                                     \nLoan sales and securitization-related\nindemnifications In connection with the Firm\u2019s\nmortgage loan sale and securitization activities\nwith GSEs the Firm has made representations and\nwarranties that the loans sold meet certain\nrequirements, and that may require the Firm to\nrepurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan\npurchaser if such representations and warranties\nare breached by the Firm. The liability related to\nrepurchase demands associated with private label\nsecuritizations is separately evaluated by the Firm\nin establishing its litigation reserves. Refer to\nNote 24 of this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information\nregarding litigation. Sponsored member repo program\nThe Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear\neligible overnight and term resale and repurchase\nagreements through the Government Securities\nDivision of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation\n(\u201cFICC\u201d) on behalf of clients that become sponsored\nmembers under the FICC\u2019s rules. The Firm also\nguarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment\nand performance of its sponsored member clients\u2019\nrespective obligations under the FICC\u2019s rules. The\nFirm minimizes its liability under these guarantees\nby obtaining a security interest in the cash or\nhigh-quality securities collateral that the clients\nplace with the clearing house therefore the Firm\nexpects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm\u2019s\nmaximum possible exposure, without taking into\nconsideration the associated collateral, is\nincluded in the Exchange & clearing house\nguarantees and commitments line on page 157.

The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits\nwith potentially millions of class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement matters involve both\nformal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These\nlegal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of\nthe Firm\u2019s lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort\nand contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which\npresent novel legal theories. The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible\nlosses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $ 0to approximately $\n1.2billion at March 31, 2023. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon\ninformation available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of\nreasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate\ncan be made, as of that date. The Firm\u2019s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses\ninvolves significant judgment, given: \u2022 the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including\nthe fact that many are in preliminary stages, \u2022 the existence in many such proceedings of multiple\ndefendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, \u2022 the numerous\nyet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the\nscope of many of the claims, and \u2022 the uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings,\nincluding where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator,\nor about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions\nprove to be incorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm\ndid not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be\nremote. Accordingly, the Firm\u2019s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change\nfrom time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly. Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm\u2019s\nmaterial legal proceedings. 1MDB Litigation . J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a defendant in a civil\nlitigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (\u201c1MDB\u201d), a Malaysian state-owned\nand controlled investment fund. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was served in August 2022. The claim alleges\n\u201cdishonest assistance\u201d against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in relation to payments of $ 300million and $\n500million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan\nSuisse (SA) held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings\n(Cayman) Limited. In September 2022, the Firm filed an application challenging the validity of service and\nthe Malaysian Court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear the claim. In April 2023, 1MDB discontinued its claim against\nJ.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA, but requested permission of the Court to refile in the future, which the Court took\nunder consideration. Amrapali . India\u2019s Enforcement Directorate (\u201cED\u201d) is investigating J.P. Morgan India\nPrivate Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by twooffshore funds formerly managed\nby JPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (\u201cAmrapali\u201d).\nIn 2017, numerous creditors filed civil claims against Amrapali, including petitions brought by home buyers\nrelating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers\u2019 petitions have\nbeen overseen by the Supreme Court of India and are ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining\nJ.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $ 31.5million. The Firm is appealing the order and the fine.\nRelatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that\nAmrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had\ninvested in the projects, violated certain currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordering\nthe ED to conduct a further inquiry under India\u2019s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (\u201cPMLA\u201d) and Foreign\nExchange Management Act (\u201cFEMA\u201d). In May 2020, the ED attached approximately $ 25million from J.P. Morgan\nIndia Private Limited in connection with the criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and\ncooperating with the PMLA investigation. Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously\nreported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (\u201cFX\u201d) sales and\ntrading activities and controls related to those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm\npleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The Department of Labor (\"DOL\") granted the\nFirm exemptions that permit the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional\nAsset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d)\n                                                    160                                                     \nthrough the ten-yeardisqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related\ngovernmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter which is currently pending before the\nSouth Africa Competition Tribunal. With respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the United\nStates District Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval to the Firm\u2019s settlement\nof a consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of\nfederal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought\ndamages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures and options on futures. Although certain members\nof the settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, an agreement to resolve\ntheir claims was reached in December 2022. The District Court denied certification of a putative class\naction against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain parties who purchased\nforeign currencies at allegedly inflated rates and granted summary judgment against the named plaintiffs in\nMarch 2023. Those plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal. In addition, some FX-related individual and\nputative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S.,\nincluding in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. An agreement to resolve one of the UK\nactions was reached in December 2022. In a putative class action pending before the U.K. Competition Appeal\nTribunal, proposed class representatives have appealed the tribunal's denial of a request for class\ncertification on an opt-out basis. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached in the putative\nclass action, which remains subject to court approval. Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and\nretail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as\ncertain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related\nrules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases for a cash payment,\nbut that settlement was reversed on appeal and remanded to the United States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of New York. The original class action was divided into twoseparate actions, one seeking primarily\nmonetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties to the\nmonetary class action finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement.\nPursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an additional $ 900million to the\napproximately $ 5.3billion previously held in escrow from the original settlement. In December 2019, the\namended settlement agreement was approved by the District Court. In March 2023, the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the District Court\u2019s approval of the settlement, and two merchants\nhave filed petitions for rehearing of the Appellate Court\u2019s approval. Based on the percentage of merchants\nthat opted out of the amended class settlement, $ 700million has been returned to the defendants from the\nsettlement escrow in accordance with the settlement agreement. The injunctive class action continues\nseparately, and in September 2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification in\npart, and denied the motion in part. Of the merchants who opted out of the amended damages class settlement,\ncertain merchants filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well\nas against the Firm and other banks. While some of those actions remain pending, the defendants have reached\nsettlements with the merchants who opted out representing approximately 65% of the combined Mastercard-\nbranded and Visa-branded payment card sales volume. Jeffrey Epstein Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is\nnamed as a defendant in twolawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of\nNew York which allege that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. knowingly facilitated Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s sex trafficking\nand other unlawful conduct by providing banking services to Epstein until 2013. One case, which was filed in\nNovember 2022, is a putative class action filed by an alleged sex-trafficking victim of Epstein, and the\nother case, which was filed in December 2022, was brought on behalf of the government of the United States\nVirgin Islands and also alleges certain Virgin Islands statutory claims. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. moved to\ndismiss both complaints. In March 2023, the Court granted in part and denied in part JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A.\u2019s motions to dismiss, allowing some claims to proceed in both lawsuits. Also in March 2023, JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. filed third-party complaints impleading the Firm\u2019s former employee, James Edward Staley,\ninto the twolawsuits, asserting claims for indemnification, contribution, breach of fiduciary duty and\nviolation of the faithless servant doctrine. In April 2023, Staley moved to dismiss the complaints. Also in\nApril 2023, the putative class action plaintiff filed a motion for class certification seeking to represent\na class of alleged sex-trafficking victims of Epstein. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. intends to oppose both\nmotions. LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to\ninquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British\nBankers Association\u2019s (\u201cBBA\u201d) London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) for various currencies and the\nEuropean Banking Federation\u2019s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cEURIBOR\u201d). The Swiss Competition Commission\u2019s\ninvestigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain subject, continues. In\nDecember 2016, the European Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an\ninfringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision\nwith the European General Court, and that appeal is pending.\n                                                    161                                                     \nIn addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in various individual and\nputative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S.\ndollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of\ncertain actions and resolved certain other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of New York has granted class certification of\nantitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, including the\nFirm. A consolidated putative class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was administered by\nICE Benchmark Administration has been dismissed. In addition, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a\nlawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful\nagreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and\ncredit cards. In September 2022, the Court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint in its entirety, and plaintiffs\nfiled an amended complaint asserting similar antitrust claims, which defendants have moved to dismiss. The\nFirm\u2019s settlements of putative class actions related to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the\nSingapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate received final court approval in\nNovember 2022, while the settlement related to Swiss franc LIBOR remains subject to court approval.\nSecurities Lending Antitrust Litigation . JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan\nPrime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class\naction filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint\nasserts violations of federal antitrust law and New York State common law in connection with an alleged\nconspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange trading for securities lending transactions.\nDefendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint was denied. Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this\naction, which defendants have opposed. Shareholder Litigation . Several shareholder putative class actions,\nas well as shareholder derivative actions purporting to act on behalf of the Firm, have been filed against\nthe Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its current and former officers. Certain of these\nshareholder suits relate to historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S.\ntreasuries markets and related conduct which were the subject of the Firm\u2019s resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC\nand SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary activities that were separately the subject of a resolution between\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in November 2020. One of these shareholder derivative suits was filed\nin the Supreme Court of the State of New York in May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust\nenrichment claims relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct and fiduciary activities\nwhich were the subject of the resolutions described above. In December 2022, the court granted defendants\u2019\nmotion to dismiss this action in full, and in January 2023, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal, which\nremains pending. A second shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for\nthe Eastern District of New York in December 2022 relating to the historical trading practices and related\nconduct, which asserts breach of fiduciary duty and contribution claims and alleges that the shareholder is\nexcused from making a demand to commence litigation because such a demand would have been futile. In\naddition, a consolidated putative class action is pending in the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of New York on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares of JPMorgan Chase common stock\nduring the putative class period, alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially false or\nmisleading because they did not disclose certain information relating to the historical trading practices\nand conduct. Defendants have moved to dismiss the amended complaint in this action. A separate shareholder\nderivative suit was filed in March 2022 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of federal securities laws based on the alleged\nfailure of the Board of Directors to exercise adequate oversight over the Firm\u2019s compliance with records\npreservation requirements which were the subject of resolutions between certain of the Firm\u2019s subsidiaries\nand the SEC and the CFTC. Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the amended complaint is pending. * * * In addition\nto the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as\ndefendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes\nit has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings\nand it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time\nin the future. The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal\nproceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a\nlitigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of\nthe loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to\nassess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate,\nbased on management\u2019s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm\u2019s legal expense was $\n176million and $ 119million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There is no\nassurance that the Firm\u2019s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future. In view of the\ninherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek\nvery large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters\n                                                    162                                                     \npresent novel legal theories, involve a large\nnumber of parties or are in early stages of\ndiscovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence\nwhat will be the eventual outcomes of the currently\npending matters, the timing of their ultimate\nresolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties\nor consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan\nChase believes, based upon its current knowledge\nand after consultation with counsel, consideration\nof the material legal proceedings described above\nand after taking into account its current\nlitigation reserves and its estimated aggregate\nrange of possible losses, that the other legal\nproceedings currently pending against it should not\nhave a material adverse effect on the Firm\u2019s\nconsolidated financial condition. The Firm notes,\nhowever, that in light of the uncertainties\ninvolved in such proceedings, there is no assurance\nthat the ultimate resolution of these matters will\nnot significantly exceed the reserves it has\ncurrently accrued or that a matter will not have\nmaterial reputational consequences. As a result,\nthe outcome of a particular matter may be material\nto JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operating results for a\nparticular period, depending on, among other\nfactors, the size of the loss or liability imposed\nand the level of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s income for that\nperiod.\n                                                    163                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Note 25 \u2013 Business segments                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are fourmajor reportable business segments - Consumer & Community\nBanking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there\nis a Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or\nthe type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently\nevaluated by the Firm\u2019s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to\nSegment results below, and Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s business segments. Segment results The following table provides a summary of the Firm\u2019s segment\nresults as of or for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, on a managed basis. The Firm\u2019s\ndefinition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain\nreclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments)\non an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is\npresented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. Refer to Note\n32 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm\u2019s managed basis. Capital\nallocation The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is referred to as equity. At least\nannually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a\nresult, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change.

The\nminimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on\nthe interest rate charged during the introductory\nperiod. This introductory rate is usually\nsignificantly below the fully indexed rate. The\nfully indexed rate is calculated using an index\nrate plus a margin. Once the introductory period\nends, the contractual interest rate charged on the\nloan increases to the fully indexed rate and\nadjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index.\nThe minimum payment is typically insufficient to\ncover interest\n                                                    170                                                     \naccrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest\nis deferred and added to the principal balance of\nthe loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment\nrecast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate\nfully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan\nbalance and anniversary date triggers.\n\nPrime\n\nPrime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with\ngood credit records who meet specific underwriting\nrequirements, including prescriptive requirements\nrelated to income and overall debt levels. New\nprime mortgage borrowers provide full documentation\nand generally have reliable payment histories.\n\nSubprime\n\nSubprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008,\nwere offered to certain customers with one or more\nhigh risk characteristics, including but not\nlimited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment\nhistories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than\n80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance);\n(iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an\noccupancy type for the loan is other than the\nborrower\u2019s primary residence; or (v) a history of\ndelinquencies or late payments on the loan.\n\nMREL : Minimum requirements for own funds and\neligible liabilities\n\nMSR : Mortgage servicing rights\n\nNA : Data is not applicable or available for the\nperiod presented.\n\nNet Capital Rule: Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934.\n\nNet charge-off/(recovery) rate: represents net\ncharge-offs/(recoveries) (annualized) divided by\naverage retained loans for the reporting period.\n\nNet interchange income includes the following\ncomponents:\n\n\u2022 Interchange income: Fees earned by credit and\ndebit card issuers on sales transactions.\n\n\u2022 Rewards costs: The cost to the Firm for points\nearned by cardholders enrolled in credit card\nrewards programs generally tied to sales\ntransactions.\n\n\u2022 Partner payments: Payments to co-brand credit\ncard partners based on the cost of loyalty program\nrewards earned by cardholders on credit card\ntransactions.\n\nNet yield on interest-earning assets: The average\nrate for interest-earning assets less the average\nrate paid for all sources of funds.\n\nNFA: National Futures Association\n\nNM : Not meaningful\n\nNonaccrual loans : Loans for which interest income\nis not recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other\nthan credit card loans and certain consumer loans\ninsured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on\nnonaccrual status when full payment of principal\nand interest is not expected, regardless of\ndelinquency status, or when principal and\n\ninterest has been in default for a period of 90\ndays or more unless the loan is both well-secured\nand in the process of collection. Collateral-\ndependent loans are typically maintained on\nnonaccrual status.\n\nNonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include\nnonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and\ncertain assets acquired in loan satisfactions,\npredominantly real estate owned and other\ncommercial and personal property.\n\nNSFR: Net Stable Funding Ratio\n\nOCC : Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\n\nOCI : Other comprehensive income/(loss)\n\nOPEB : Other postretirement employee benefit\n\nOTC : \u201cOver-the-counter derivatives\u201d: Derivative\ncontracts that are negotiated, executed and settled\nbilaterally between two derivative counterparties,\nwhere one or both counterparties is a derivatives\ndealer.\n\nOTC cleared : \u201cOver-the-counter cleared\nderivatives\u201d: Derivative contracts that are\nnegotiated and executed bilaterally, but\nsubsequently settled via a central clearing house,\nsuch that each derivative counterparty is only\nexposed to the default of that clearing house.\n\nOverhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage\nof total net revenue.\n\nParent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nParticipating securities: represents unvested\nshare-based compensation awards containing\nnonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend\nequivalents (collectively, \u201cdividends\u201d), which are\nincluded in the earnings per share calculation\nusing the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase grants\nrestricted stock and RSUs to certain employees\nunder its share-based compensation programs, which\nentitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable\ndividends during the vesting period on a basis\nequivalent to the dividends paid to holders of\ncommon stock.

The Firm believes\nthat this financial measure is useful in assessing\nthe ability of a lending institution to generate\nincome in excess of its provision for credit\nlosses.\n\nPrincipal transactions revenue : Principal\ntransactions revenue is driven by many factors,\nincluding the bid-offer spread, which is the\ndifference between the price at which the Firm is\nwilling to buy a financial or other instrument and\nthe price at which the Firm is willing to sell that\ninstrument. It also consists of realized (as a\nresult of closing out or termination of\ntransactions, or interim cash payments) and\nunrealized (as a result of changes in valuation)\ngains and losses on financial and other instruments\n(including those accounted for under the fair value\noption) primarily used in client-driven market-\nmaking activities and on private equity\ninvestments. In connection with its client-driven\nmarket-making activities, the Firm transacts in\ndebt and equity instruments, derivatives and\ncommodities (including physical commodities\ninventories and financial instruments that\nreference commodities). Principal transactions\nrevenue also includes certain realized and\nunrealized gains and losses related to hedge\naccounting and specified risk-management\nactivities, including: (a) certain derivatives\ndesignated in qualifying hedge accounting\nrelationships (primarily fair value hedges of\ncommodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain\nderivatives used for specific risk management\npurposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and\nforeign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.\n\nPSU(s) : Performance share units\n\nRegulatory VaR: Daily aggregated VaR calculated in\naccordance with regulatory rules.\n\nREO: Real estate owned\n\nReported basis: Financial statements prepared under\nU.S. GAAP, which excludes the impact of taxable-\nequivalent adjustments.\n\nRetained loans : Loans that are held-for-investment\n(i.e. excludes loans held-for-sale and loans at\nfair value).\n\nRevenue wallet: Total fee revenue based on\nestimates of investment banking fees generated\nacross the industry (i.e., the revenue wallet) from\ninvestment banking transactions in M&A, equity and\ndebt underwriting, and loan syndications.

Key differences in the\ncalculation of credit risk RWA between the\nStandardized and Advanced approaches are that for\nBasel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on\nrisk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the\nuse of internal credit models and parameters,\nwhereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA\nis generally based on supervisory risk-weightings\nwhich vary primarily by counterparty type and asset\nclass.

There can be no assurance that the Acquisition will have the anticipated positive       \u2502\n\u2502  results, including with respect to:\u2022the total cost of integration\u2022the time required to complete the     \u2502\n\u2502  integration\u2022the amount of longer-term cost savings\u2022the overall performance of the assets and            \u2502\n\u2502  liabilities acquired in the Acquisition, or\u2022an improved price for JPMorgan Chase\u2019s common               \u2502\n\u2502  stock.Integration of an acquired business can be complex and costly, and typically will involve the     \u2502\n\u2502  combination of relevant accounting and data processing systems and management controls, as well as      \u2502\n\u2502  managing relevant relationships with employees, clients, suppliers and other business partners.         \u2502\n\u2502  Integration efforts could divert management attention and resources, which could adversely affect       \u2502\n\u2502  JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations or results. In addition, JPMorgan Chase could incur unanticipated costs or  \u2502\n\u2502  losses in connection with the Acquisition and its integration efforts.Acquisitions may also result in   \u2502\n\u2502  business disruptions that cause JPMorgan Chase to lose clients and customers, or cause clients and      \u2502\n\u2502  customers to move their business to competing financial institutions. It is possible that the           \u2502\n\u2502  integration process could result in the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in          \u2502\n\u2502  standards, controls, procedures and policies that could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to    \u2502\n\u2502  maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees. In addition, the loss of key  \u2502\n\u2502  employees in connection with the Acquisition could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to         \u2502\n\u2502  successfully conduct its business.Supervision and regulationRefer to the Supervision and regulation     \u2502\n\u2502  section on pages 4\u20138 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for information on Supervision and              \u2502\n\u2502  Regulation.Item 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.The Firm did not      \u2502\n\u2502  have any unregistered sale of equity securities during the three months ended March\u00a031,                 \u2502\n\u2502  2023.Repurchases under the common share repurchase programRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages     \u2502\n\u2502  36-41 of this Form 10-Q and pages 86-96 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for information regarding    \u2502\n\u2502  repurchases under the Firm\u2019s common share repurchase program.The Firm is authorized to purchase up to   \u2502\n\u2502  $30\u00a0billion under its common share repurchase program previously approved by the Board of Directors.    \u2502\n\u2502                                                                                                          \u2502\n\u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256f\n                                                    177                                                     \nShares repurchased pursuant to the common share repurchase program during the three months ended March 31,\n2023 were as follows.\n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                           Dollar value of  \n                                                                          Aggregate              remaining  \n                      Total number of          Average price         purchase price             authorized  \n  Three months              shares of               paid per        of common stock             repurchase  \n  ended March 31,        common stock        share of common            repurchases                    (in  \n  2023                    repurchased               stock(a)       (in millions)(a)        millions)(a)(b)  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  January                           \u2014    $                 \u2014    $                 \u2014    $                 \u2014  \n  February                  3,393,245                 141.29                    479                 29,154  \n  March                    18,602,008                 132.27                  2,461                 26,693  \n  First quarter            21,995,253    $            133.67    $             2,940    $            26,693  \n                                                                                                            \n(a) Excludes excise tax and commissions cost.
