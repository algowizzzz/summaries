The Firm\nreported ROE of 18% and ROTCE of 23%.\nThe Firm's results for the second\nquarter of 2021 included a reduction in\nthe allowance for credit losses of $3.0\nbillion compared to an increase in the\nallowance for credit losses of $8.9\nbillion in the prior year.\n\n\u2022 Net income was $11.9 billion, up $7.3\nbillion.\n\n\u2022 Total net revenue was down 8%.\n\n\u2013 Noninterest revenue was $17.7\nbillion, down 8%, driven by lower CIB\nMarkets revenue, largely offset by\nhigher Investment Banking fees in CIB,\nhigher Card income and higher\nmanagement fees in AWM.\n\n\u2013 The prior year included $678 million\nof mark-ups on held-for-sale positions\nin the bridge financing portfolio in\nCIB and CB.\n\n\u2013 Net interest income was $12.7\nbillion, down 8%, predominantly driven\nby CIB Markets and lower loans in Card.\n\n\u2022 Noninterest expense was $17.7\nbillion, up 4%, largely driven by\ncontinued investments in the business,\nincluding technology and front office\nhiring, as well as higher volume-\nrelated brokerage expense in CIB and\ndistribution expense in AWM.\n\n\u2022 The provision for credit losses was a\nnet benefit of $2.3 billion driven by\nnet reductions in the allowance for\ncredit losses of $3.0 billion, compared\nto an expense of $10.5 billion in the\nprior year predominantly driven by net\nadditions to the allowance for credit\nlosses of $8.9 billion.\n\n\u2022 The total allowance for credit losses\nwas $22.6 billion at June 30, 2021. The\nFirm had an allowance for loan losses\nto retained loans coverage ratio of\n2.02%, compared with 2.42% in the first\nquarter of 2021, and 3.27% in the prior\nyear; the decrease from the first\nquarter of 2021 was driven by net\nreductions in the allowance for loan\nlosses due to improvements in the\nFirm's economic outlook.\n\n\u2022 The Firm\u2019s nonperforming assets\ntotaled $9.8 billion at June 30, 2021,\nrelatively flat versus the prior year.\nNonperforming assets were down $455\nmillion from March 31, 2021, driven by\nlower nonaccrual loans in the consumer\nand wholesale portfolios, reflecting\nimproved credit performance, partially\noffset by higher derivative\nreceivables.\n                                        5                                         \n\u2022 Firmwide average loans of $1.0\ntrillion were flat versus the prior\nyear, as lower loans in CB and CCB were\noffset by the net origination of\nPaycheck Protection Program (\"PPP\")\nloans, as well as growth in AWM and\nCIB.\n\n\u2022 Firmwide average deposits of $2.3\ntrillion were up 23%, reflecting\nsignificant inflows across the LOBs\nprimarily driven by the effect of\ncertain government actions in response\nto the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u2022 As of June 30, 2021, the Firm had\naverage eligible High Quality Liquid\nAssets (\u201cHQLA\u201d) of approximately $717\nbillion and unencumbered marketable\nsecurities with a fair value of\napproximately $854 billion, resulting\nin approximately $1.6 trillion of\nliquidity sources.

Refer to Notes 2 and\n4 for additional information.\n\nAccounts payable and other liabilities\nincreased predominantly due to the\nimpact of securities financing\ntransactions and higher client payables\nrelated to client-driven activities,\nboth in CIB prime brokerage. Refer to\nNote 10 for additional information on\nsecurities financing transactions.\n\nBeneficial interests issued by\nconsolidated VIEs decreased\npredominantly driven by maturities of\ncredit card securitizations in Treasury\nand CIO.

In addition,\nthere is a Corporate segment.\n\nThe business segments are determined\nbased on the products and services\nprovided, or the type of customer\nserved, and they reflect the manner in\nwhich financial information is\ncurrently evaluated by the Firm\u2019s\nOperating Committee. Segment results\nare presented on a managed basis. Refer\nto Explanation and Reconciliation of\nthe Firm\u2019s use of Non-GAAP Financial\nMeasures on pages 19-20 for a\ndefinition of managed basis.\n\nDescription of business segment\nreporting methodology\n\nResults of the business segments are\nintended to present each segment as if\nit were a stand-alone business. The\nmanagement reporting process that\nderives business segment results\nincludes the allocation of certain\nincome and expense items. The Firm\nperiodically assesses the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting\nclassifications used for segment\nreporting, and further refinements may\nbe implemented in future periods. The\nFirm also assesses the level of capital\nrequired for each LOB on at least an\nannual basis. The Firm\u2019s LOBs also\nprovide various business metrics which\nare utilized by the Firm and its\ninvestors and analysts in assessing\nperformance.\n\nRevenue sharing\n\nWhen business segments join efforts to\nsell products and services to the\nFirm\u2019s clients, the participating\nbusiness segments may agree to share\nrevenue from those transactions.\nRevenue is generally recognized in the\nsegment responsible for the related\nproduct or service, with allocations to\nthe other segment(s) involved in the\ntransaction. The segment results\nreflect these revenue-sharing\nagreements.\n\nCapital allocation\n\nThe amount of capital assigned to each\nsegment is referred to as equity.\nPeriodically, the assumptions and\nmethodologies used to allocate capital\nare reassessed and as a result, the\ncapital allocated to the LOBs may\nchange. Refer to Line of business\nequity on page 48, and page 98 of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for\nadditional information on capital\nallocation.\n\nRefer to Business Segment Results

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT  \n                            \nRisk is an inherent part of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s business activities. When the\nFirm extends a consumer or wholesale\nloan, advises customers and clients on\ntheir investment decisions, makes\nmarkets in securities, or offers other\nproducts or services, the Firm takes on\nsome degree of risk. The Firm\u2019s overall\nobjective is to manage its businesses,\nand the associated risks, in a manner\nthat balances serving the interests of\nits clients, customers and investors\nand protects the safety and soundness\nof the Firm. The Firm believes that\neffective risk management requires,\namong other things: \u2022 Acceptance of\nresponsibility, including\nidentification and escalation of risks\nby all individuals within the Firm; \u2022\nOwnership of risk identification,\nassessment, data and management within\neach of the LOBs and Corporate; and \u2022\nFirmwide structures for risk\ngovernance. The Firm follows a\ndisciplined and balanced compensation\nframework with strong internal\ngovernance and independent oversight by\nthe Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d).\nThe impact of risk and control issues\nis carefully considered in the Firm\u2019s\nperformance evaluation and incentive\ncompensation processes.

The minimum amount of\nregulatory capital that must be held by\nBHCs and banks is determined by\ncalculating risk-weighted assets\n(\u201cRWA\u201d), which are on-balance sheet\nassets and off-balance sheet exposures,\nweighted according to risk. Two\ncomprehensive approaches are prescribed\nfor calculating RWA: a standardized\napproach (\u201cBasel III Standardized\u201d),\nand an advanced approach (\u201cBasel III\nAdvanced\u201d). For each of the risk-based\ncapital ratios, the capital adequacy of\nthe Firm is evaluated against the lower\nof the Standardized or Advanced\napproaches compared to their respective\nminimum capital ratios.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s Basel III Standardized-risk-\nbased ratios are currently more binding\nthan the Basel III Advanced-risk-based\nratios.\n\nBasel III also includes a requirement\nfor Advanced Approach banking\norganizations, including the Firm, to\ncalculate the SLR. The Firm\u2019s SLR is\ncurrently more binding than the Basel\nIII Standardized-risk-based ratios.\nRefer to SLR on page 48 for additional\ninformation.\n\nKey Regulatory Developments\n\nCECL regulatory capital transition\ndelay. As part of their response to the\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the\nfederal banking agencies issued a final\nrule that provided the option beginning\nJanuary 1, 2020 to delay the effects of\nCECL on regulatory capital for two\nyears, followed by a\n\nthree-year transition period beginning\nJanuary 1, 2022 (\u201cCECL capital\ntransition provisions\u201d).\n\nThe Firm has elected to apply the CECL\ncapital transition provisions, and\naccordingly, for the period ended June\n30, 2021, the capital metrics of the\nFirm exclude $3.8 billion, which is the\n$2.7 billion day 1 impact to retained\nearnings and 25% of the $4.0 billion\nincrease in the allowance for credit\nlosses from January 1, 2020 (excluding\nallowances on PCD loans).\n\nThe impacts of the CECL capital\ntransition provisions have also been\nincorporated into Tier 2 capital,\nadjusted average assets, and total\nleverage exposure. Refer to Capital\nRisk Management on pages 91-101 and\nNote 1 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form\n10-K for further information on CECL\ncapital transition provisions and the\nCECL accounting guidance.\n\nPPP. On April 13, 2020, the federal\nbanking agencies issued an interim\nfinal rule (issued as final on\nSeptember 29, 2020) to neutralize the\nregulatory capital effects of\nparticipating in the PPP on risk-based\ncapital ratios by applying a zero\npercent risk weight to loans originated\nunder the program. The Firm does not\nexpect to realize material credit\nlosses on PPP loans, because the loans\nare guaranteed by the SBA. As of June\n30, 2021, the Firm had approximately\n$23 billion of loans remaining under\nthe program.\n\nTotal leverage exposure for purposes of\ncalculating the SLR includes PPP loans\nas the Firm did not participate in the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s Paycheck Protection\nProgram Lending Facility, which would\nhave allowed the Firm to exclude them\nunder the final rule.\n\nTLAC Holdings rule . On October 20,\n2020, the federal banking agencies\nissued a final rule prescribing the\nregulatory capital treatment for\nholdings of Total Loss-Absorbing\nCapacity (\"TLAC\") debt instruments by\ncertain large banking organizations,\nsuch as the Firm and JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. This rule expands the scope\nof the existing capital deductions rule\naround the holdings of capital\ninstruments of financial institutions\nto also include TLAC debt instruments\nissued by systemically important\nbanking organizations. The final rule\nbecame effective April 1, 2021 and did\nnot have a material impact on the\nFirm\u2019s risk-based capital metrics.\n                                        45

(d) Excludes average excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The Firm\u2019s\naverage LCR increased during the three months ended June 30, 2021, compared with\nthe three-month period ended March 31, 2021, due to an increase in HQLA from long-\nterm debt issuances.\n\nThe Firm's average LCR decreased during the three months ended June 30, 2021,\ncompared with the prior year period due to client driven activities in the CIB as\nwell as the relative impact on net cash outflows from the significant increase in\ndeposits. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s average LCR increased during the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2021, compared with both the three month periods ended March\n31, 2021 and June 30, 2020 primarily due to growth in deposits. Deposits continued\nto increase in the second quarter primarily driven by the effect of certain\ngovernment actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in excess\nliquidity in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is excluded from the Firm\u2019s reported LCR\nunder the LCR rule. The Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR\nfluctuates from period to period, due to changes in its eligible HQLA and\nestimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity. Other\nliquidity sources In addition to the assets reported in the Firm\u2019s eligible HQLA\nabove, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt\nsecurities, that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. This\nincludes securities included as part of the excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair value of\nthese securities was approximately $854 billion and $740 billion as of June 30,\n2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, although the amount of liquidity that\ncould be raised would be dependent on prevailing market conditions. The fair value\nincreased compared to December 31, 2020, due to an increase in CIB trading assets\nas well as an increase in excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. which\nwas primarily a result of increased deposit s. The Firm also had available\nborrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Banks (\"FHLBs\") and the discount\nwindow at the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm\nto such banks of approximately $297 billion and $307 billion as of June 30, 2021\nand December 31, 2020, respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit\nof cash and securities reported in the Firm\u2019s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered\nsecurities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window\nand other central banks. Although available, the Firm does not view this borrowing\ncapacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and the other central banks\nas a primary source of liquidity. NSFR The net stable funding ratio (\u201cNSFR\u201d) is a\nliquidity requirement for large banking organizations that is intended to measure\nthe adequacy of \u201cavailable\u201d and \u201crequired\u201d amounts of stable funding over a one-\nyear horizon. On October 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final\nNSFR rule under which large banking\n                                        51                                        \norganizations such as the Firm and\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. will be\nrequired to maintain an NSFR of at\nleast 100% on an ongoing basis. The\nfinal NSFR rule became effective on\nJuly 1, 2021, and the Firm will be\nrequired to publicly disclose its\nquarterly average NSFR semi-annually\nbeginning in 2023.\n\nThe Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nare compliant with the 100% minimum\nNSFR, based on the Firm's current\nunderstanding of the final rule.\n                                                                                  \n  Funding                                                                         \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Sources of funds                                                                \n                                                                                  \nManagement believes that the Firm\u2019s\nunsecured and secured funding capacity\nis sufficient to meet its on- and off-\nbalance sheet obligations.\n\nThe Firm funds its global balance sheet\nthrough diverse sources of funding\nincluding stable deposits, secured and\nunsecured funding in the capital\nmarkets and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nDeposits are the primary funding source\nfor JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nAdditionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nmay also access funding through short-\nor long-term secured borrowings,\nthrough the issuance of\n\nunsecured long-term debt, or from\nborrowings from the Parent Company or\nthe Intermediate Holding Company\n(\u201cIHC\u201d).

However, during periods of\nmarket disruption those trends could be affected. Average deposits increased for\nthe three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the three and six months\nended June 30, 2020, reflecting significant inflows across the LOBs primarily\ndriven by the effect of certain government actions in response to the COVID-19\npandemic. In CCB, the increase was also driven by growth from existing and new\naccounts across both consumer and small business customers.

These\ninstruments are secured predominantly\nby high-quality securities collateral,\nincluding government-issued debt and\nU.S. GSE and government agency MBS.\nSecurities sold under agreements to\nrepurchase increased at June 30, 2021,\ncompared with December 31, 2020,\nreflecting the impact of client\nactivities and higher secured financing\nof trading assets in CIB, partially\noffset by lower secured financing of\nAFS investment securities in Treasury\nand CIO.\n\nThe balances associated with securities\nloaned or sold under agreements to\nrepurchase fluctuate over time due to\ninvestment and financing activities of\nclients, the Firm\u2019s demand for\nfinancing, the ongoing management of\nthe mix of the Firm\u2019s liabilities,\nincluding its secured and unsecured\nfinancing (for both the investment\nsecurities and market-making\nportfolios), and other market and\nportfolio factors.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s sources of short-term\nunsecured funding consist of other\nborrowed funds and issuance of\nwholesale commercial paper. The\ndecrease in commercial paper at June\n30, 2021, from December 31, 2020, and\nfor the\n\naverage three and six months ended June\n30, 2021 compared to the prior year\nperiod, was due to lower net issuance\nprimarily for short-term liquidity\nmanagement.\n\nThe increase in unsecured other\nborrowed funds at June 30, 2021, from\nDecember 31, 2020, and for the average\nthree and six months ended June 30,\n2021 compared to the prior year period,\nwas primarily due to net issuances of\nstructured notes in CIB Markets.\n                                        53                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Long-term funding and issuance                                                  \n                                                                                  \nLong-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity\nfor the Firm. The Firm\u2019s long-term funding plan is driven primarily by expected\nclient activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, including\nTLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing\nmarket access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding\nmarkets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan.\n\nThe significant majority of the Firm\u2019s long-term unsecured funding is issued by\nthe Parent Company to provide flexibility in support of both bank and non-bank\nsubsidiary funding needs. The Parent Company advances substantially all net\nfunding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to\nexternal counterparties.

The majority of the Firm\u2019s COVID-19\nrelated loan modifications have not been considered troubled debt restructurings (\n\u201c TDRs \u201d ). Assistance provided in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could delay\nthe recognition of delinquencies, nonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for those\ncustomers and clients who would have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual\nstatus. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 58-62 and Wholesale Credit\nPortfolio on pages 63-72 for information on loan modifications as of June 30,\n2021. Refer to Notes 12 and 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further\ninformation on the Firm\u2019s accounting policies for loan modifications and the\nallowance for credit losses. Paycheck Protection Program The PPP ended on May 31,\n2021 for new applications. Since inception of the Program, the Firm funded\napproximately $40 billion of loans. At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the\nFirm had approximately $23 billion and $27 billion of loans remaining,\nrespectively, including $17 billion and $19 billion in the consumer portfolio,\nrespectively, and $6 billion and $8 billion in the wholesale portfolio,\nrespectively. The Firm continues to process forgiveness applications, and through\nJune 30, 2021, approximately $18 billion of loans were forgiven by the SBA. This\nresulted in accelerated recognition of the associated deferred processing fees in\ninterest income, primarily in CCB.

The Firm\u2019s focus is on serving\nprimarily the prime segment of the consumer credit market. The macroeconomic\nenvironment continued to improve in the first half of 2021, with the credit\nperformance of the consumer portfolio, including net charge-offs, benefiting from\ngovernment stimulus programs, payment deferral programs and increasing home\nprices.

The Firm continues to monitor the credit\nrisk associated with loans subject to payment deferrals throughout the deferral\nperiod and on an ongoing basis after the borrowers are required to resume making\nregularly scheduled payments and considers expected losses of principal and\naccrued interest on these loans in its allowance for credit losses.\n

Residential real estate: The\nresidential real estate portfolio,\nincluding loans held-for-sale and loans\nat fair value, predominantly consists\nof prime mortgage loans and home equity\nlines of credit. Retained loans\ndeclined from December 31, 2020 due to\npaydowns outpacing originations of\nprime mortgage loans in Home Lending,\npartially offset by growth in AWM.\nRetained nonaccrual loans decreased\nfrom December 31, 2020 reflecting\nimproved credit performance . Net\nrecoveries for the three months ended\nJune 30, 2021 were higher when compared\nwith the same period in the prior year\nas the current year had a greater\nbenefit from improved HPI and reversals\nof prior write-downs due to loan\nprepayments as a result of the low rate\nenvironment. Net recoveries for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2021 were\nrelatively flat when compared with the\nsame period in the prior year as the\ncurrent year had a greater benefit from\nimproved HPI and reversals of prior\nwrite-downs due to loan prepayments,\nwhile the prior year included a\nrecovery on a loan sale. Loans at fair\nvalue increased from December 31, 2020,\nreflecting loan purchase activity in\nCIB driven by higher client demand, as\nwell as increased originations in Home\nLending due to the continued low rate\nenvironment and seasonality. Nonaccrual\nloans at fair value decreased from\nDecember 31, 2020 largely due to sales\nin CIB. The carrying value of home\nequity lines of credit outstanding was\n$20.9 billion at June 30, 2021. This\namount included $8.2 billion of HELOCs\nthat have recast from interest-only to\nfully amortizing payments or have been\nmodified and $7.0 billion of interest-\nonly balloon HELOCs, which primarily\nmature after 2030. The Firm manages the\nrisk of HELOCs during their revolving\nperiod by closing or reducing the\nundrawn line to the extent permitted by\nlaw when borrowers are exhibiting a\nmaterial deterioration in their credit\nrisk profile. At June 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, the carrying value\nof interest-only residential mortgage\nloans were $26.5 billion and $25.6\nbillion, respectively.

(b) Includes loans to\ncustomers that have exited COVID-19\npayment deferral programs and are 90 or\nmore days past due, predominantly all\nof which were considered collateral-\ndependent at time of exit from COVID-19\npayment deferral programs and charged\ndown to the lower of amortized cost or\nfair value of the underlying collateral\nless costs to sell.\n                                        61                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Credit card                                                                     \n                                                                                  \nTotal credit card loans decreased from\nDecember 31, 2020 reflecting higher\npayments, predominantly offset by\nstrong sales volume in the second\nquarter. The June 30, 2021 30+ and 90+\nday delinquency rates of 1.01% and\n0.54%, respectively, decreased compared\nto the December 31, 2020 30+ and 90+\nday delinquency rates of 1.68% and\n0.92%, respectively. The delinquency\nrates were positively impacted by\ngovernment stimulus and borrowers who\nparticipated in payment assistance\nprograms. Net charge-offs decreased for\nthe three and six months ended June 30,\n2021 compared with the same period in\nthe prior year reflecting lower charge-\noffs and higher recoveries as consumer\ncash balances remained elevated\nbenefiting from the ongoing impact of\ngovernment stimulus and payment\nassistance programs.\n\nConsistent with the Firm\u2019s policy, all\ncredit card loans typically remain on\naccrual status until charged off.\nHowever, the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan\nlosses includes the estimated\nuncollectible portion of accrued and\nbilled interest and fee income. Refer\nto Note 11 for further information\nabout this portfolio, including\ninformation about delinquencies.\n\nGeographic and FICO composition of\ncredit card loans\n\nRefer to Note 11 for information on the\ngeographic and FICO composition of the\nFirm\u2019s credit card loans.\n                                                                                  \n  Modifications of credit card loans                                              \n                                                                                  \nAt June 30, 2021, the Firm had $1.2\nbillion of credit card loans\noutstanding that have been modified in\nTDRs, which does not include loans with\nshort-term or other insignificant\nmodifications that are not considered\nTDRs, compared to $1.4 billion at\nDecember 31, 2020.

A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm\u2019s\nwholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm\ndistributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the\nmarket as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio\nconcentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in\npart by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and\ntransaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry,\nproduct and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 65-69\nfor further information. The Firm\u2019s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure\nheld in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated exposures held in CCB,\nincluding business banking and auto dealer exposure for which the wholesale\nmethodology is applied when determining the allowance for credit losses. In the\nfirst half of 2021, the credit environment continued to improve following the\nbroad-based deterioration in 2020 that resulted from the impacts of the COVID-19\npandemic. As of June 30, 2021, retained loans increased $9.9 billion driven by CIB\nand AWM largely offset by decreases in CB and CCB. Lending related commitments\nincreased $52.8 billion, predominantly driven by net portfolio activity in CIB and\nCB, including an increase in held for sale commitments intended to be syndicated.\nIn the six months ended June 30, 2021, the investment- grade percentage of the\ncredit portfolio decreased from 71% to 70% driven by net portfolio activity,\nincluding new commitments. Criticized exposure increased $3.4 billion from $41.6\nbillion at December 31, 2020 to $45.0 billion at June 30, 2021, driven by select\ndowngrades, largely offset by select upgrades and net portfolio activity.\nNonperforming exposure remained flat at $4.9 billion and net charge off activity\nwas $63 million.\n                                                                                  \n

Predominantly all clients that\nexited deferral are current or have paid down their loans, and the Firm has not\nexperienced meaningful new payment deferral requests. The Firm continues to\nmonitor the credit risk associated with loans subject to deferrals throughout the\ndeferral period and on an ongoing basis after the borrowers are required to resume\nmaking regularly scheduled payments and considers expected losses of principal and\naccrued interest on these loans in its allowance for credit losses.\n\nIn addition, the Firm granted assistance in the form of covenant modifications.\nThese types of assistance, both payment deferrals and covenant modifications, are\ngenerally not reported as TDRs, either because the modifications were\ninsignificant or they qualified for the option to suspend the application of\naccounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the\nConsolidated Appropriations Act. Loans under assistance continue to be risk-rated\nin accordance with the Firm\u2019s overall credit risk management framework. As of June\n30, 2021, predominantly all of these loans were considered performing.\n\nWholesale credit exposure \u2013 maturity and ratings profile\n\nThe following tables present the maturity and internal risk ratings profiles of\nthe wholesale credit portfolio as of June 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020.

Total criticized exposure excluding loans held-for-sale and\nloans at fair value, was $45.0 billion at June 30, 2021, compared with $41.6\nbillion at December 31, 2020, representing approximately 4.1% and 4.0% of total\nwholesale credit exposure, respectively. The increase in total criticized exposure\nwas driven by select downgrades, largely offset by select upgrades and net\nportfolio activity. The total criticized exposure at June 30, 2021 was largely\nundrawn and $40.9 billion was performing.\n                                        65                                        \nThe table below summarizes by industry the Firm\u2019s exposures as of June 30, 2021,\nand December 31, 2020.

lending-related financial\ninstruments, such as commitments\n(including revolving credit facilities)\nand guarantees, to address the\nfinancing needs of its clients. The\ncontractual amounts of these financial\ninstruments represent the maximum\npossible credit risk should the clients\ndraw down on these commitments or when\nthe Firm fulfills its obligations under\nthese guarantees, and the clients\nsubsequently fail to perform according\nto the terms of these contracts. Most\nof these commitments and guarantees\nhave historically been refinanced,\nextended, cancelled, or expired without\nbeing drawn upon or a default\noccurring. As a result, the Firm does\nnot believe that the total contractual\namount of these wholesale lending-\nrelated commitments is representative\nof the Firm\u2019s expected future credit\nexposure or funding requirements. Refer\nto Note 22 for further information on\nwholesale lending-related commitments.\n                                                                                  \n  Receivables from customers                                                      \n                                                                                  \nReceivables from customers reflect\nheld-for-investment margin loans to\nbrokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM\nthat are collateralized by assets\nmaintained in the clients\u2019 brokerage\naccounts (e.g., cash on deposit, liquid\nand readily marketable debt or equity\nsecurities). Because of this\ncollateralization, no allowance for\ncredit losses is generally held against\nthese receivables. To manage its credit\nrisk the Firm establishes margin\nrequirements and monitors the required\nmargin levels on an ongoing basis, and\nrequires clients to deposit additional\ncash or other collateral, or to reduce\npositions, when appropriate. These\nreceivables are reported within accrued\ninterest and accounts receivable on the\nFirm\u2019s Consolidated balance sheets.\n                                                                                  \n  Derivative contracts                                                            \n                                                                                  \nDerivatives enable clients and\ncounterparties to manage risks\nincluding credit risk and risks arising\nfrom fluctuations in interest rates,\nforeign exchange, equities, and\ncommodities. The Firm makes markets in\nderivatives in order to meet these\nneeds and uses derivatives to manage\ncertain risks associated with net open\nrisk positions from its market-making\nactivities, including the counterparty\ncredit risk arising from derivative\nreceivables. The Firm also uses\nderivative instruments to manage its\nown credit risk and other market risk\nexposure. The nature of the\ncounterparty and the settlement\nmechanism of the derivative affect the\ncredit risk to which the Firm is\nexposed. For OTC derivatives the Firm\nis exposed to the credit risk of the\nderivative counterparty. For exchange-\ntraded derivatives (\u201cETD\u201d), such as\nfutures and options, and cleared over-\nthe-counter (\u201cOTC-cleared\u201d)\nderivatives, the Firm can also be\nexposed to the credit risk of the\nrelevant CCP. Where possible, the Firm\nseeks to mitigate its credit risk\nexposures arising from derivative\ncontracts through the use of legally\nenforceable master netting arrangements\nand collateral agreements.\n\nThe percentage of the Firm\u2019s over-the-\ncounter derivative transactions subject\nto collateral agreements \u2014 excluding\nforeign exchange spot trades, which are\nnot typically covered by collateral\nagreements due to their short maturity\nand centrally cleared trades that are\nsettled daily \u2014 was approximately 88%\nat both June 30, 2021, and December 31,\n2020. Refer to Note 4 for additional\ninformation on the Firm\u2019s use of\ncollateral agreements. Refer to Note 4\nfor a further discussion of derivative\ncontracts, counterparties and\nsettlement types.\n\nThe fair value of derivative\nreceivables reported on the\nConsolidated balance sheets were $70.7\nbillion and $79.6 billion at June 30,\n2021, and December 31, 2020,\nrespectively, with decreases in CIB\nresulting from market movements.\nDerivative receivables represent the\nfair value of the derivative contracts\nafter giving effect to legally\nenforceable master netting agreements\nand the related cash collateral held by\nthe Firm.\n\nIn addition, the Firm held liquid\nsecurities and other cash collateral\nthat the Firm believes is legally\nenforceable and may be used as security\nwhen the fair value of the client\u2019s\nexposure is in the Firm\u2019s favor. For\nthe purpose of this disclosure, the\ndefinition of liquid securities is\nconsistent with the definition of high\nquality liquid assets as defined in the\nLCR rule.\n\nIn management\u2019s view, the appropriate\nmeasure of current credit risk should\nalso take into consideration other\ncollateral, which generally represents\nsecurities that do not qualify as high\nquality liquid assets under the LCR\nrule, but that the Firm believes is\nlegally enforceable. The collateral\namounts for each counterparty are\nlimited to the net derivative\nreceivables for the counterparty.\n\nThe Firm also holds additional\ncollateral (primarily cash, G7\ngovernment securities, other liquid\ngovernment agency and guaranteed\nsecurities, and corporate debt and\nequity securities) delivered by clients\nat the initiation of transactions, as\nwell as collateral related to contracts\nthat have a non-daily call frequency\nand collateral that the Firm has agreed\nto return but has not yet settled as of\nthe reporting date.

The\nallowance for credit losses comprises:\n\u2022 the allowance for loan losses, which\ncovers the Firm\u2019s retained loan\nportfolios (scored and risk-rated) and\nis presented separately on the\nConsolidated balance sheets, \u2022 the\nallowance for lending-related\ncommitments, which is presented on the\nConsolidated balance sheets in accounts\npayable and other liabilities, and \u2022\nthe allowance for credit losses on\ninvestment securities, which covers the\nFirm\u2019s HTM and AFS securities and is\nreflected within Investment Securities\non the Consolidated balance sheets.\nDiscussion of changes in the allowance\nThe allowance for credit losses as of\nJune 30, 2021 decreased when compared\nto December 31, 2020, consisting of: \u2022\na $7.1 billion reduction in consumer,\npredominantly in the credit card\nportfolio, reflecting improvements in\nthe Firm's economic outlook; and in the\nresidential real estate portfolio,\nprimarily due to continued improvements\nin HPI expectations, and \u2022 a $1.1\nbillion net reduction in wholesale,\nacross the LOBs, reflecting\nimprovements in the Firm's economic\noutlook. The COVID-19 pandemic has\nstressed many macroeconomic variables\n(\u201cMEVs\u201d) used in the Firm's allowance\nestimate which has created challenges\nin the use of modeled credit loss\nestimates, increased the reliance on\nmanagement judgment, and resulted in\nadjustments to appropriately address\nthe economic circumstances. These\nadjustments continued through the\nsecond quarter of 2021, although to a\nlesser extent than experienced during\n2020. The U.S. economy has continued to\nimprove with the benefits of\nvaccination and as more businesses have\nreopened, thereby reducing certain\npandemic-related macroeconomic\nuncertainties. However, uncertainties\nremain, including the pace of\nvaccination progress, the impact of\nadditional waves and new virus strains,\nthe health of underlying labor markets,\nand the potential for changes in\nconsumer behavior that could have\nlonger term impacts on certain sectors.\nAs a result of these uncertainties, the\nFirm retained meaningful weighting on\nits adverse scenarios, albeit to a\nlesser extent than the first quarter of\n2021 and fourth quarter of 2020. The\nadverse scenarios incorporate more\npunitive macroeconomic factors than the\ncentral case assumptions outlined\nbelow, resulting in weighted average\nU.S. unemployment rates rising above\nseven percent in 2021 and falling just\nbelow six percent throughout the second\nquarter of 2022 with U.S. gross\n\ndomestic product (\"GDP\") returning to\npre-pandemic levels in 4Q21.

The investment securities\nportfolio is predominantly held by\nTreasury and CIO in connection with the\nFirm\u2019s balance sheet or asset-liability\nmanagement objectives. Principal\ninvestments are predominantly\nprivately-held non-traded financial\ninstruments and are managed in the LOBs\nand Corporate. Investments are\ntypically intended to be held over\nextended periods and, accordingly, the\nFirm has no expectation for short-term\nrealized gains with respect to these\ninvestments. Investment securities risk\nInvestment securities risk includes the\nexposure associated with a default in\nthe payment of principal and interest.\nThis risk is mitigated given that the\ninvestment securities portfolio held by\nTreasury and CIO is predominantly\ninvested in high-quality securities. At\nJune 30, 2021, the Treasury and CIO\ninvestment securities portfolio, net of\nallowance for credit losses, was $571.6\nbillion, and the average credit rating\nof the securities comprising the\nportfolio was AA+ (based upon external\nratings where available and where not\navailable, based primarily upon\ninternal risk ratings). Refer to\nCorporate segment results on pages\n42-43 and Note 9 for further\ninformation on the investment\nsecurities portfolio and internal risk\nratings. Refer to Market Risk\nManagement on pages 76-80 for further\ninformation on the market risk inherent\nin the portfolio. Refer to Liquidity\nRisk Management on pages 51-55 for\nfurther information on related\nliquidity risk.\n\nPrincipal investment risk Principal\ninvestments are typically privately\nheld non-traded financial instruments\nrepresenting ownership or other forms\nof junior capital and span multiple\nasset classes. These investments are\nmade by dedicated investing businesses\nor as part of a broader business\nstrategy. In general, principal\ninvestments include tax-oriented\ninvestments and investments made to\nenhance or accelerate the Firm\u2019s\nbusiness strategies. The Firm\u2019s\ninvestments will continue to evolve in\nline with its strategies, including the\nFirm\u2019s commitment to support\nunderserved communities and minority-\nowned businesses.

These excluded\ncomponents of total net revenue may more than offset backtesting gains and losses\non a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is\nconsistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.\n\nFor the 12 months ended June 30, 2021, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 157 of\nthe 259 days, and observed four VaR backtesting exceptions. For the three months\nended June 30, 2021, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 30 of the 65 days, and\nobserved four VaR backtesting exceptions.\n\nThe following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains\nand losses for the trailing 12 months and three months ended June 30, 2021. The\ndaily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding daily\nRisk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in\naggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals. A backtesting exception occurs\nwhen the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the\nprior day. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are\ngreater than one hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the\nresults of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm\u2019s Basel\nIII Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory\nVaR applied to the Firm\u2019s covered positions.\n\nDistribution of Daily Backtesting Gains and Losses\n                                        78                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Earnings-at-risk                                                                \n                                                                                  \nThe effect of interest rate exposure on\nthe Firm\u2019s reported net income is\nimportant as interest rate risk\nrepresents one of the Firm\u2019s\nsignificant market risks. Interest rate\nrisk arises not only from trading\nactivities but also from the Firm\u2019s\ntraditional banking activities, which\ninclude extension of loans and credit\nfacilities, taking deposits and issuing\ndebt as well as from the investment\nsecurities portfolio. Refer to the\ntable on page 136 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n2020 Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and\nCorporate, identifying positions\nincluded in earnings-at-risk. One way\nthe Firm evaluates its structural\ninterest rate risk is through earnings-\nat-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the\nFirm\u2019s interest rate exposure for a\ngiven interest rate scenario. It is\npresented as a sensitivity to a\nbaseline, which includes net interest\nincome and certain interest rate\nsensitive fees. The baseline uses\nmarket interest rates and in the case\nof deposits, pricing assumptions. The\nFirm conducts simulations of changes to\nthis baseline for interest rate-\nsensitive assets and liabilities\ndenominated in U.S. dollars and other\ncurrencies (\u201cnon-U.S. dollar\u201d\ncurrencies). These simulations\nprimarily include retained loans,\ndeposits, deposits with banks,\ninvestment securities, long-term debt\nand any related interest rate hedges,\nand funds transfer pricing of other\npositions in risk management VaR and\nother sensitivity-based measures as\ndescribed on page 136 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K. Earnings-at-\nrisk scenarios estimate the potential\nchange to a net interest income\nbaseline, over the following 12 months\nutilizing multiple assumptions. These\nscenarios include a parallel shift\ninvolving changes to both short-term\nand long-term rates by an equal amount;\na steeper yield curve involving holding\nshort-term rates constant and\nincreasing long-term rates; and a\nflatter yield curve involving\nincreasing short-term rates and holding\nlong-term rates constant. These\nscenarios consider many different\nfactors, including: \u2022 The impact on\nexposures as a result of instantaneous\nchanges in interest rates from baseline\nrates. \u2022 Forecasted balance sheet, as\nwell as modeled prepayment and\nreinvestment behavior, but do not\ninclude assumptions about actions that\ncould be taken by the Firm or its\nclients and customers in response to\nany such instantaneous rate changes.\nMortgage prepayment assumptions are\nbased on the interest rates used in the\nscenarios compared with underlying\ncontractual rates, the time since\norigination, and other factors which\nare updated periodically based on\nhistorical experience. \u2022 The pricing\nsensitivity of deposits, known as\ndeposit betas, represent the amount by\nwhich deposit rates paid could change\nupon a given change in market interest\nrates. The deposit rates paid in these\nscenarios may differ from actual\ndeposit rates paid, due to repricing\nlags and other factors.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s earnings-at-risk scenarios\nare periodically evaluated and enhanced\nin response to changes in the\ncomposition of the Firm\u2019s balance\nsheet, changes in market conditions,\nimprovements in the Firm\u2019s simulation\nand other factors. While a relevant\nmeasure of the Firm\u2019s interest rate\nexposure, the earnings at risk analysis\ndoes not represent a forecast of the\nFirm\u2019s net interest income (Refer to\nOutlook on page 8 for additional\ninformation).

The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the\nvarious portfolios which may be impacted by these developments and measures the\nextent to which the Firm\u2019s exposures are diversified given the Firm\u2019s strategy and\nrisk tolerance relative to a country. Country Risk Management continues to monitor\nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individual countries. Refer to pages\n143-144 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm\u2019s\ncountry risk management. Risk Reporting The following table presents the Firm\u2019s\ntop 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of June 30, 2021 and their\ncomparative exposures as of December 31, 2020. The selection of countries\nrepresents the Firm\u2019s largest total exposures by individual country, based on the\nFirm\u2019s internal country risk management approach, and does not represent the\nFirm\u2019s view of any existing or potentially adverse credit conditions. Country\nexposures may fluctuate from period to period due to client activity and market\nflows. The increase in exposure to Australia was due to increased cash placements\nwith the central bank of Australia, driven by client activity following policy\ndecisions in the country and growth in client deposits.\n                                                                                  \n  Top                                                                             \n  20                                                                              \n  co\u2026                                                                             \n  ex\u2026                                                                             \n  (e\u2026                                                                             \n  the                                                                             \n  U.\u2026    June                                                   Dec\u2026              \n  (in    30,                                                    31,               \n  bi\u2026    2021                                                   202\u2026              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                     Len\u2026       Trad\u2026                  Total               Total  \n                      and         and       Oth\u2026       expo\u2026               expo\u2026  \n                     dep\u2026       inve\u2026                                             \n  Ge\u2026             $  123\u2026    $    3.1    $   0.4    $  126.6            $  127.2  \n  Un\u2026                55.8        14.7        1.9        72.4                68.4  \n  Ki\u2026                                                                             \n  Ja\u2026                35.5         9.3        0.3        45.1                45.6  \n  Au\u2026                23.5         4.7          \u2014        28.2                15.9  \n  Ch\u2026                 9.8         7.9        2.1        19.8                21.2  \n  Sw\u2026                12.6         0.5        5.5        18.6                18.7  \n  Ca\u2026                15.8         1.2        0.2        17.2                14.5  \n  Fr\u2026                12.2         1.5        2.6        16.3                18.8  \n  Br\u2026                 4.6         9.7          \u2014        14.3                10.8  \n  Sp\u2026                 9.7         3.2          \u2014        12.9                 5.8  \n  Ne\u2026                 9.3         1.4        1.7        12.4                 7.7  \n  Lu\u2026                10.9         1.1          \u2014        12.0                12.4  \n  It\u2026                 4.8         6.4        0.2        11.4                 9.7  \n  In\u2026                 5.3         4.4        1.3        11.0                10.5  \n  So\u2026                 4.3         5.9        0.4        10.6                10.1  \n  Ko\u2026                                                                             \n  Si\u2026                 5.3         2.8        1.0         9.1                 8.7  \n  Ho\u2026                                                                             \n  Ko\u2026                 5.1         1.8        0.4         7.3                 6.2  \n  SAR                                                                             \n  Sa\u2026                 5.3         1.7          \u2014         7.0                 5.8  \n  Ar\u2026                                                                             \n  Be\u2026                 2.4         1.5        0.1         4.0                 4.0  \n  Sw\u2026                 4.0        -0.2          \u2014         3.8                 4.3  \n                                                                                  \n(a) Country exposures presented in the\ntable reflect 90% of total Firmwide\nnon-U.S. exposure, where exposure is\nattributed to an individual country, at\nboth June 30, 2021 and December 31,\n2020.

Operational\nrisk is inherent in the Firm\u2019s\nactivities and can manifest itself in\nvarious ways, including fraudulent\nacts, business interruptions, cyber\nattacks, inappropriate employee\nbehavior, failure to comply with\napplicable laws and regulations or\nfailure of vendors to perform in\naccordance with their agreements.\nOperational Risk Management attempts to\nmanage operational risk at appropriate\nlevels in light of the Firm\u2019s financial\nposition, the characteristics of its\nbusinesses, and the markets and\nregulatory environments in which it\noperates.

Details on other\nselect examples of operational risks\nare provided below.\n\nBusiness and technology resiliency risk\n\nBusiness disruptions can occur due to\nforces beyond the Firm\u2019s control such\nas the spread of infectious diseases or\npandemics, severe weather, power or\ntelecommunications loss, accidents,\nfailure of a third party to provide\nexpected services, cyberattack,\nflooding, transit strikes, terrorism\nand health emergencies. The safety of\nthe Firm\u2019s employees and customers is\nof the highest priority. The Firmwide\nresiliency program is intended to\nenable the Firm to recover its critical\nbusiness functions and supporting\nassets (i.e., staff, technology and\nfacilities) in the event of a business\ninterruption. The program includes\ngovernance, awareness training, and\ntesting of recovery strategies, as well\nas strategic and tactical initiatives\nto identify, assess, and manage\nbusiness interruption and public safety\nrisks. The strength and proficiency of\nthe Firmwide resiliency program has\nplayed an integral role in maintaining\nthe Firm\u2019s business operations during\nand after various events.\n\nCybersecurity Risk\n\nDue to the ongoing impact of COVID-19,\nthe Firm continues to leverage use of\nremote access and video conferencing\nsolutions provided by third parties to\nfacilitate remote work. As a result,\nthe Firm has deployed additional\nprecautionary measures to mitigate\ncybersecurity risks.\n\nPayment Fraud Risk\n\nThe risk of payment fraud remains at a\nheightened level across the industry,\nparticularly during the COVID-19\npandemic due to the use of contingent\nforms of payment authentication methods\nand the perpetuation of scams involving\nthe pandemic, including an increase in\nthe level of fraud attempts against\nconsumers. The complexities of these\nincidents and the strategies used by\nperpetrators continue to evolve. The\nFirm employs various controls for\nmanaging payment fraud risk as well as\nproviding employee and client education\nand awareness trainings.\n                                        82                                        \n                                         \n  ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT  \n                                         \nEstimations and Model risk, a\nsubcategory of operational risk, is the\npotential for adverse consequences from\ndecisions based on incorrect or misused\nestimation outputs.\n\nThe Firm uses models and other\nanalytical and judgment- based\nestimations across various businesses\nand functions. The estimation methods\nare of varying levels of sophistication\nand are used for many purposes, such as\nthe valuation of positions and\nmeasurement of risk, assessing\nregulatory capital requirements,\nconducting stress testing, and making\nbusiness decisions.\n\nWhile models are inherently imprecise,\nthe degree of imprecision or\nuncertainty can be heightened by the\nmarket or economic environment. This is\nparticularly true when the current and\nforecasted environment is significantly\ndifferent from the historical\nmacroeconomic environments upon which\nthe models were trained, as the Firm\nhas experienced during the COVID-19\npandemic. This uncertainty may\nnecessitate a greater degree of\njudgment and analytics to inform\nadjustments to model outputs than in\ntypical periods.\n\nRefer to Critical Accounting Estimates\nUsed by the Firm on pages 84-86 and\nNote 2 of this Form 10-Q, and\nEstimations and Model Risk Management\nsection on page 151 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n2020 Form 10-K for a summary of model-\nbased valuations and other valuation\ntechniques.\n                                        83                                        \n                                                  \n  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM  \n                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s accounting policies\nand use of estimates are integral to\nunderstanding its reported results. The\nFirm\u2019s most complex accounting\nestimates require management\u2019s judgment\nto ascertain the appropriate carrying\nvalue of assets and liabilities. The\nFirm has established policies and\ncontrol procedures intended to ensure\nthat estimation methods, including any\njudgments made as part of such methods,\nare well-controlled, independently\nreviewed and applied consistently from\nperiod to period. The methods used and\njudgments made reflect, among other\nfactors, the nature of the assets or\nliabilities and the related business\nand risk management strategies, which\nmay vary across the Firm\u2019s businesses\nand portfolios. In addition, the\npolicies and procedures are intended to\nensure that the process for changing\nmethodologies occurs in an appropriate\nmanner. The Firm believes its estimates\nfor determining the carrying value of\nits assets and liabilities are\nappropriate. The following is a brief\ndescription of the Firm\u2019s critical\naccounting estimates involving\nsignificant judgments.\n                                                                                  \n  Allowance for credit losses                                                     \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses\nrepresents management\u2019s estimate of\nexpected credit losses over the\nremaining expected life of the Firm\u2019s\nfinancial assets measured at amortized\ncost and certain off-balance sheet\nlending-related commitments. The\nallowance for credit losses comprises:\n\n\u2022 The allowance for loan losses, which\ncovers the Firm\u2019s retained loan\nportfolios (scored and risk-rated),\n\n\u2022 The allowance for lending-related\ncommitments, and\n\n\u2022 The allowance for credit losses on\ninvestment securities, which covers the\nFirm\u2019s HTM and AFS securities.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses\ninvolves significant judgment on a\nnumber of matters including development\nand weighting of macroeconomic\nforecasts, incorporation of historical\nloss experience, assessment of risk\ncharacteristics, assignment of risk\nratings, valuation of collateral, and\nthe determination of remaining expected\nlife. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 of\nJPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for\nfurther information on these judgments\nas well as the Firm\u2019s policies and\nmethodologies used to determine the\nFirm\u2019s allowance for credit losses; and\nrefer to Allowance for credit losses on\npages 73-74 and Note 12 of this Form\n10-Q for further information.\n\nOne of the most significant judgments\ninvolved in estimating the Firm\u2019s\nallowance for credit losses relates to\nthe macroeconomic forecasts used to\nestimate credit losses over the eight-\nquarter forecast period within the\nFirm\u2019s methodology. The eight-quarter\nforecast incorporates hundreds of MEVs\nthat are relevant for exposures across\nthe Firm, with modeled credit losses\nbeing driven primarily by a subset of\nless than twenty variables. The\nspecific variables that have the\ngreatest effect on the modeled losses\nof each portfolio vary by portfolio and\ngeography.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio\ninclude U.S. unemployment, HPI and U.S.\nreal GDP.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio\ninclude U.S. real GDP, U.S.\nunemployment, U.S. equity prices,\ncorporate credit spreads, oil prices,\ncommercial real estate prices and HPI.\n\nChanges in the Firm\u2019s assumptions and\nforecasts of economic conditions could\nsignificantly affect its estimate of\nexpected credit losses in the portfolio\nat the balance sheet date or lead to\nsignificant changes in the estimate\nfrom one reporting period to the next.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a\nweak labor market and weak overall\neconomic conditions that affected\nborrowers across the Firm\u2019s consumer\nand wholesale lending portfolios. The\nU.S. economy has continued to improve\nwith the benefits of vaccination and as\nmore businesses have reopened, thereby\nreducing certain pandemic-related\nmacroeconomic uncertainties. However,\nuncertainties remain, including the\npace of vaccination progress, the\nimpact of additional waves and new\nvirus strains, the health of underlying\nlabor markets, and the potential for\nchanges in consumer behavior that could\nhave longer term impacts on certain\nsectors. Further, judgment is still\nrequired to estimate the speed and\ntrajectory of the economic recovery.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate how\npotential changes in any one factor or\ninput might affect the overall\nallowance for credit losses because\nmanagement considers a wide variety of\nfactors and inputs in estimating the\nallowance for credit losses. Changes in\nthe factors and inputs considered may\nnot occur at the same rate and may not\nbe consistent across all geographies or\nproduct types, and changes in factors\nand inputs may be directionally\ninconsistent, such that improvement in\none factor or input may offset\ndeterioration in others.\n\nTo consider the impact of a\nhypothetical alternate macroeconomic\nforecast, the Firm compared the modeled\ncredit losses determined using its\ncentral and relative adverse\nmacroeconomic scenarios, which are two\nof the five scenarios considered in\nestimating the allowances for loan\nlosses and lending-related commitments.\nThe central and relative adverse\nscenarios each included a full suite of\nMEVs, but differed in the levels, paths\nand peaks/troughs of those variables\nover the eight-quarter forecast period.\n\nFor example, compared to the Firm\u2019s\ncentral scenario described on page 73\nand in Note 12, the Firm\u2019s relative\nadverse scenario assumes a\nsignificantly elevated U.S.\nunemployment rate through 2021,\naveraging approximately 2.4% higher\nover the eight-quarter forecast, with a\npeak difference of approximately 4.2%\nin the fourth quarter of 2021; lower\nU.S. real GDP with a slower recovery,\nremaining nearly 2.5% lower at the end\nof the eight-quarter forecast, with a\npeak difference of approximately 6.9%\nin the fourth quarter of 2021; and\n                                        84                                        \nlower national HPI with a peak\ndifference of nearly 11.2% and\nforecasted trough, both in the third\nquarter of 2022. This analysis is not\nintended to estimate expected future\nchanges in the allowance for credit\nlosses, for a number of reasons,\nincluding: \u2022 the Firm continues to\nplace meaningful weighting on its\nadverse scenarios in estimating its\nallowance for credit losses as of June\n30, 2021, and accordingly, the existing\nallowance already reflects credit\nlosses beyond those estimated under the\ncentral scenario \u2022 the impacts of\nchanges in many MEVs are both\ninterrelated and nonlinear, so the\nresults of this analysis cannot be\nsimply extrapolated for more severe\nchanges in macroeconomic variables \u2022\nthe COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many\nMEVs used in the Firm's allowance\nestimate, which has created challenges\nin the use of modeled credit loss\nestimations \u2022 significant changes in\nthe expected severity and duration of\nthe economic downturn caused by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, effects of\ngovernment support and customer\nassistance, and speed and trajectory of\nthe subsequent recovery could\nsignificantly affect the Firm\u2019s\nestimate of expected credit losses\nirrespective of the estimated\nsensitivities described below. To\ndemonstrate the sensitivity of credit\nloss estimates to macroeconomic\nforecasts as of June 30, 2021, the Firm\ncompared the modeled estimates under\nits relative adverse scenario to its\ncentral scenario. Without considering\nthe additional weight the Firm has\nplaced on its adverse scenarios or any\nother offsetting or correlated effects\nin other qualitative components of the\nFirm\u2019s allowance for credit losses for\nthese lending exposures, the comparison\nbetween these two scenarios reflects\nthe following differences: \u2022 An\nincrease of approximately $300 million\nfor residential real estate loans and\nlending-related commitments \u2022 An\nincrease of approximately $2.8 billion\nfor credit card loans \u2022 An increase of\napproximately $1.7 billion for\nwholesale loans and lending-related\ncommitments This analysis relates only\nto the modeled credit loss estimates\nand is not intended to estimate changes\nin the overall allowance for credit\nlosses as it does not reflect any\npotential changes in other adjustments\nto the quantitative calculation, which\nwould also be influenced by the\njudgment management applies to the\nmodeled lifetime loss estimates to\nreflect the uncertainty and imprecision\nof these modeled lifetime loss\nestimates based on then-current\ncircumstances and conditions.\nRecognizing that forecasts of\nmacroeconomic conditions are inherently\nuncertain, particularly in light of the\nrecent economic conditions, the Firm\nbelieves that its process to consider\nthe available information and\nassociated risks and uncertainties is\nappropriately governed and that its\n\nestimates of expected credit losses\nwere reasonable and appropriate for the\nperiod ended June 30, 2021.

The type and\nlevel of judgment required is largely\ndependent on the amount of observable\nmarket information available to the\nFirm. For instruments valued using\ninternally developed valuation models\nand other valuation techniques that use\nsignificant unobservable inputs and are\ntherefore classified within level 3 of\nthe valuation hierarchy, judgments used\nto estimate fair value are more\nsignificant than those required when\nestimating the fair value of\ninstruments classified within levels 1\nand 2.\n\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair\nvalue for an instrument within level 3,\nmanagement must first determine the\nappropriate valuation model or other\nvaluation technique to use. Second, the\nlack of observability of certain\nsignificant inputs requires management\nto assess all relevant empirical data\nin deriving valuation inputs including,\nfor example, transaction details, yield\ncurves, interest rates, prepayment\nspeed, default rates, volatilities,\ncorrelations, prices (such as\ncommodity, equity or debt prices),\nvaluations of comparable instruments,\nforeign exchange rates and credit\ncurves. Refer to Note 2 for a further\ndiscussion of the valuation of level 3\ninstruments, including unobservable\ninputs used.\n\nFor instruments classified in levels 2\nand 3, management judgment must be\napplied to assess the appropriate level\nof valuation adjustments to reflect\ncounterparty credit quality, the Firm\u2019s\ncreditworthiness, market funding rates,\nliquidity considerations, unobservable\nparameters, and for portfolios that\nmeet specified criteria, the size of\nthe net open risk position. The\njudgments made are typically affected\nby the type of product and its specific\ncontractual terms, and the level of\nliquidity for the product or within the\nmarket as a whole. In periods of\nheightened market volatility and\nuncertainty judgments are further\naffected by the wider variation of\nreasonable valuation estimates,\nparticularly for positions that are\nless liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a\nfurther discussion of valuation\nadjustments applied by the Firm.\n\nImprecision in estimating unobservable\nmarket inputs or other factors can\naffect the amount of gain or loss\nrecorded for a particular position.\nFurthermore, while the Firm believes\nits valuation methods are appropriate\nand consistent with those of other\nmarket participants, the methods and\nassumptions used reflect management\njudgment and may vary across the Firm\u2019s\nbusinesses and portfolios.\n\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and\nassumptions in the determination of\nfair value. The use of methodologies or\nassumptions different than those used\nby the Firm could result in a different\nestimate of fair value at the reporting\ndate. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed\ndiscussion of the Firm\u2019s valuation\nprocess and hierarchy, and its\ndetermination of fair value for\nindividual financial instruments.\n                                                                                  \n  Goodwill impairment                                                             \n                                                                                  \nManagement applies significant judgment\nwhen testing goodwill for impairment.\nThe goodwill associated with each\nbusiness combination is allocated to\nthe related reporting units for\ngoodwill impairment testing.

(\u201cJPMorgan Chase\u201d or the \u201cFirm\u201d), a financial holding company\nincorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services\nfirm in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment\nbanking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial\nbanking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 25\nfor a further discussion of the Firm\u2019s business segments. The accounting and\nfinancial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to\nU.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting\nand reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. The unaudited\nConsolidated Financial Statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets\nand liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the\nopinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included such\nthat this interim financial information is fairly stated. These unaudited\nConsolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited\nConsolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K. Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been\nreclassified to conform with the current presentation, including certain deferred\ninvestment tax credits. In the first quarter of 2021 the Firm reclassified certain\ndeferred investment tax credits from accounts payable and other liabilities to\nother assets to be a reduction to the carrying value of the associated tax-\noriented investments. The reclassification also resulted in an increase in income\ntax expense and a corresponding increase in other income, with no effect on net\nincome. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current\npresentation, including the Firm\u2019s effective income tax rate. The reclassification\ndid not change the Firm\u2019s results of operations on a managed basis. Consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and\nother entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All\nmaterial intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Assets held\nfor clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of\nJPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm\ndetermines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first\nevaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest\nentity. Refer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for a further\ndescription of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s accounting policies regarding consolidation.\nOffsetting assets and liabilities U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative\nreceivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related\ncash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S.\nGAAP also permits securities financing activities to be presented on a net basis\nwhen specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally\nenforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances\nwhen the specified conditions are met.

of\ncost or net realizable value. \u201cNet realizable value\u201d is a term defined in U.S.\nGAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (\u201ctransaction costs\u201d).\nTransaction costs for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories are either not\napplicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable\nvalue approximates fair value for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories.\nWhen fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below\ncost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because\nunder fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair\nvalue. Refer to Note 4 for a further\n                                        97                                        \ndiscussion of the Firm\u2019s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent\nfair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been\nincluded in each period presented.\n\n(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the\namount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).\n\n(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value\nper share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be\nclassified in the fair value hierarchy. At June 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020,\nthe fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private\nequity funds, real estate and other funds, were $ 688million and $ 670million,\nrespectively. Included in these balances at June 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020,\nwere trading assets of $ 56million and $ 52million, respectively, and other assets\nof $ 632million and $ 618million, respectively.\n\n(e) At June 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, included $ 29.8billion and $\n15.1billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $ 7.9billion\nand $ 6.3billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential\nmortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to\nsell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $ 15.4billion and $ 8.4billion,\nrespectively.\n\n(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative\nreceivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and\npaid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3\nbalances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit\nassociated with cash collateral.\n\n(g) The prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period\npresentation.\n\nLevel 3 valuations\n\nRefer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for further information on the\nFirm\u2019s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair\nvalue for individual financial instruments. The following table presents the\nFirm\u2019s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to\nmeasure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant\nunobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or\narithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an\ninstrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs\nto the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically\ninclude observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and\ncan be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components.\nThe level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the\nFirm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial\ninstruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within\nlevels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of values presented in the\ntable is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the\nsignificant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification.\nWhere provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table\nare calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being\nused to value. In the Firm\u2019s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic\naverage values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of\nthe reasonableness of the Firm\u2019s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect\nthe characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative\ndistribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two\noption contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation\nuncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels\nbecause the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices.\nThe input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-\nperiod and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments\nheld by the Firm at each balance sheet date.\n                                        98                                        \n

upon the\nproduct type, which may differ from their classification on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in\nthe table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the\ntechnique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ.\n(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $ 329million, nonagency\nsecurities of $ 16million and non-trading loans of $ 699million.\n(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $ 10million, trading loans of $ 41million\nand non-trading loans of $ 219million.\n(d) Comprises trading loans of $ 754million and non-trading loans of $ 816million.\n(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes\nissued by the Firm that are financial instruments that typically contain embedded\nderivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the\nderivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable\ninputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.\n(f) Includes equity securities of $ 1.3billion including $ 564million in Other\nAssets, for which quoted prices are not readily available and the fair value is\ngenerally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA multiples and\ncomparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant\nboth individually and in aggregate.\n(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted\nmarket prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price-\nbased internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par\nvalue of $ 100.\n(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.\n(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where\narithmetic averages are used.\n                                        99                                        \nChanges in and ranges of unobservable\ninputs Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion\nof the impact on fair value of changes\nin unobservable inputs and the\nrelationships between unobservable\ninputs as well as a description of\nattributes of the underlying\ninstruments and external market factors\nthat affect the range of inputs used in\nthe valuation of the Firm\u2019s positions.\nChanges in level 3 recurring fair value\nmeasurements The following tables\ninclude a rollforward of the\nConsolidated balance sheets amounts\n(including changes in fair value) for\nfinancial instruments classified by the\nFirm within level 3 of the fair value\nhierarchy for the three and six months\nended June 30, 2021 and 2020. When a\ndetermination is made to classify a\nfinancial instrument within level 3,\nthe determination is based on the\nsignificance of the unobservable inputs\nto the overall fair value measurement.\nHowever, level 3 financial instruments\ntypically include, in addition to the\nunobservable or level 3 components,\nobservable components (that is,\ncomponents that are actively quoted and\ncan be validated to external sources);\naccordingly, the gains and losses in\nthe table below include changes in fair\nvalue due in part to observable factors\nthat are part of the valuation\nmethodology. Also, the Firm risk-\nmanages the observable components of\nlevel 3 financial instruments using\nsecurities and derivative positions\nthat are classified within level 1 or 2\nof the fair value hierarchy; as these\nlevel 1 and level 2 risk management\ninstruments are not included below, the\ngains or losses in the following tables\ndo not reflect the effect of the Firm\u2019s\nrisk

Refer to Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a\nnonrecurring basis on page 107 for further information on changes impacting items\nmeasured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Three and six months ended June\n30, 2021 Level 3 assets were $ 15.9billion at June 30, 2021, reflecting a decrease\nof $ 1.5billion from March 31, 2021 and a decrease of $ 526million from December\n31, 2020. The decrease for the three months ended June 30, 2021 was largely driven\nby a $ 979million decrease in gross equity derivative receivables due to\nsettlements and transfers net of gains. The decrease for the six months ended June\n30, 2021 was driven by: \u2022 $ 458million decrease in gross interest rate derivative\nreceivables and $ 490million decrease in gross equity derivative receivables due\nto settlements and transfers net of gains, and \u2022 $ 571million decrease in non-\ntrading loans predominantly due to settlements, predominantly offset by \u2022 $\n1.3billion increase in MSRs.

For certain loans, the fair value is\nmeasured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the\nloan takes into account the loan\u2019s allowance for loan losses, which represents the\nloan\u2019s expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference\nbetween the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally\nattributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market\nliquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do\nnot affect its carrying value.\nThe majority of the Firm\u2019s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis on the Consolidated balance sheets.

The\neffective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and\naccretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-\nequivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes\nunscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of\nsecurities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain\nsecurities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the\naverage yield is calculated to the earliest call date.\n(b) Substantially all of the Firm\u2019s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized\nmortgage obligations are due in 10years or more, based on contractual maturity.\nThe estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future\nprepayments, is approximately 6years for agency residential MBS, 4years for agency\nresidential collateralized mortgage obligations and 3years for nonagency\nresidential collateralized mortgage obligations.\n                                       132                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Note 10 \u2013 Securities financing activities                                       \n                                                                                  \nRefer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting\npolicies relating to securities financing activities.

The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the\nFirm\u2019s securities financing agreements as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\nWhen the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master\nnetting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria\nunder U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the\nbalances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same\ncounterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral\nwith its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but\nsuch collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation.\nWhere the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the\ncounterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with securities\nfinancing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S.\nGAAP, is presented in the table below as \u201cAmounts not nettable on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets,\u201d and reduces the \u201cNet amounts\u201d presented.

In addition, the sale of loans may also\nresult in write downs, recoveries or changes in the allowance recognized in the\nprovision for credit losses. Loan modifications The Firm has granted various forms\nof assistance to customers and clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic,\nincluding payment deferrals and covenant modifications. The majority of the Firm\u2019s\nCOVID-19 related loan modifications have not been considered TDRs because: \u2022 they\nrepresent short-term or other insignificant modifications, whether under the\nFirm\u2019s regular loan modification assessments or as permitted by regulatory\nguidance, or \u2022 the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application\nof accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the\nConsolidated Appropriations Act. To the extent that certain modifications do not\nmeet any of the above criteria, the Firm accounts for them as TDRs. As permitted\nby regulatory guidance, the Firm does not place loans with deferrals granted due\nto COVID-19 on nonaccrual status where such loans are not otherwise reportable as\nnonaccrual. The Firm considers expected losses of principal and accrued interest\nassociated with all COVID-19 related loan modifications in its allowance for\ncredit losses.

real estate loans that are charged\ndown to the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm\nreports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans\nthat have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the\nborrower (\u201cChapter 7 loans\u201d) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless\nof their delinquency status. At June 30, 2021, approximately 7% of Chapter 7\nresidential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.\n\n(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with\nregulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-\ndependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value\nof their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying\ncollateral has subsequently improved, the related allowance may be negative.\n\n(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $ 41million\nand $ 37million and $ 86million and $ 80million for the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n(d) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response\nto the COVID-19 pandemic. Includes loans to customers that have exited COVID-19\npayment deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly all of\nwhich were considered collateral-dependent at time of exit from COVID-19 payment\ndeferral programs and charged down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of\nthe underlying collateral less costs to sell.\n\n(e) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed\nby U.S government agencies. Typically the principal balance of the loans is\ninsured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to\nmeeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020,\nthese balances were no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing\nguidelines. There were noloans that were not guaranteed by U.S. government\nagencies that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at June 30,\n2021 and December 31, 2020.\n\n(f) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the\nestimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a\nminimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized\nhome price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent\navailable and forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current\nestimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available\nlien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.\n\n(g) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower\u2019s most recent credit score,\nwhich is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.\n\n(h) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current\npresentation.\n\n(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.\n\n(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the\nmagnitude of the corresponding loan balances at June 30, 2021.\n\n(k) At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, included mortgage loans insured by\nU.S. government agencies of $ 72million and $ 76million, respectively. These\namounts have been excluded from the geographic regions presented based upon the\ngovernment guarantee.\n                                       139                                        \nLoan modifications Modifications of residential real estate loans where the Firm\ngrants concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty are\ngenerally accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term or other\ninsignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs nor\nare loans for which the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the\napplication of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and\nextended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The carrying value of new TDRs\nwas $ 307million and $ 196million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and\n2020, respectively, and $ 558million and $ 338million for the six months ended\nJune 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There were no additional commitments to lend\nto borrowers whose residential real estate loans have been modified in TDRs.\nNature and extent of modifications The Firm\u2019s proprietary modification programs as\nwell as government programs, including U.S. GSE programs, generally provide\nvarious concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited\nto, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and delays of principal\nand/or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms\nof the original agreement.

the modification. The dollar amounts presented represent the\nbalance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such loans\ndefaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is\ndeemed to occur when the loan becomes twocontractual payments past due. In the\nevent that a modified loan redefaults, it will generally be liquidated through\nforeclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of\nloans modified within the last twelve monthsmay not be representative of ultimate\nredefault levels.\nAt June 30, 2021, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential\nreal estate loans permanently modified in TDRs were 5years. The estimated\nremaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and\ninvoluntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).\n\nActive and suspended foreclosure\n\nAt June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Firm had residential real estate\nloans, excluding those insured by U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value\nof $ 743million and $ 846million, respectively, that were not included in REO, but\nwere in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm has temporarily suspended certain\nforeclosure activities. This could delay recognition of foreclosed properties\nuntil the foreclosure moratoriums are lifted.\n                                       141                                        \nAuto and other\n\nThe following tables provide information on delinquency, which is the primary\ncredit quality indicator for retained auto and other consumer loans.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                              \u2026                   \n                                                              \u2026                   \n                                                       \u2026      \u2026                   \n                                 \u2026                     \u2026      \u2026                   \n                                                       \u2026      \u2026                   \n                                                       \u2026      \u2026                   \n                                                                                  \n                                      $    \u2026                       $    \u2026         \n                                           \u2026                            \u2026         \n                                           1                            9         \n                                      $    \u2026                       $    \u2026         \n                                 \u2026         %    \u2026             \u2026         %    \u2026    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                              \u2026                   \n                                                              \u2026                   \n                                                       \u2026      \u2026                   \n                                                       \u2026      \u2026                   \n                                                       \u2026      \u2026                   \n                                                       \u2026      \u2026                   \n                                                                                  \n                                                                   $    \u2026         \n                                                                        \u2026         \n                                                                        8         \n                                                                   $    \u2026         \n                                                              \u2026         %    \u2026    \n                                                                                  \n(a) At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, loans under payment deferral programs\noffered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which are still within their deferral\nperiod and performing according to their modified terms are generally not\nconsidered delinquent.\n\n(b) At June 30, 2021, included $ 9.9billion of loans originated in 2021 and $\n6.8billion of loans originated in 2020 in Business Banking under the PPP.

If the value of the underlying\ncollateral has subsequently improved, the related allowance may be negative.\n\n(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not\nmaterial for the three and six months ended months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 .\n\n(d) The geographic regions presented in this table are ordered based on the\nmagnitude of the corresponding loan balances at June 30, 2021.\n\nLoan modifications Certain auto and other loan modifications are considered to be\nTDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing\nfinancial difficulty.

             \nLoan modifications The Firm may offer\none of a number of loan modification\nprograms granting concessions to credit\ncard borrowers who are experiencing\nfinancial difficulty. The Firm grants\nconcessions for most of the credit card\nloans under long-term programs. These\nmodifications involve placing the\ncustomer on a fixed payment plan,\ngenerally for 60months, and typically\ninclude reducing the interest rate on\nthe credit card. Substantially all\nmodifications under the Firm\u2019s long-\nterm programs are considered to be\nTDRs. Loans with short-term or other\ninsignificant modifications that are\nnot considered concessions are not\nTDRs. If the cardholder does not comply\nwith the modified payment terms, then\nthe credit card loan continues to age\nand will ultimately be charged-off in\naccordance with the Firm\u2019s standard\ncharge-off policy. In most cases, the\nFirm does not reinstate the borrower\u2019s\nline of credit.\n\nFinancial effects of modifications and\nredefaults\n\nThe following table provides\ninformation about the financial effects\nof the concessions granted on credit\ncard loans modified in TDRs and\nredefaults for the periods presented.\nFor all periods disclosed, new\nenrollments were less than 1% of total\nretained credit card loans.\n                                                                                  \n  (in               Three                               Six                       \n  milli\u2026           months                            months                       \n  except            ended                             ended                       \n  weigh\u2026             June                              June                       \n  data)   2021        30,  2020            2021         30,  2020                 \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Balan\u2026                                                                          \n  of new        $            90  $          151  $            233  $         428  \n  TDRs(\u2026                                                                          \n  Weigh\u2026                                                                          \n  inter\u2026                                                                          \n  rate                                                                            \n  of                17.92     %     17.93     %       17.81     %     18.50    %  \n  loans                                                                           \n  \u2013                                                                               \n  before                                                                          \n  TDR                                                                             \n  Weigh\u2026                                                                          \n  inter\u2026                                                                          \n  rate                                                                            \n  of                 5.15            5.16              5.20            4.42       \n  loans                                                                           \n  \u2013                                                                               \n  after                                                                           \n  TDR                                                                             \n  Balan\u2026                                                                          \n  of                                                                              \n  loans                                                                           \n  that                                                                            \n  redef\u2026        $            13  $           25  $             32  $          61  \n  within                                                                          \n  one                                                                             \n  year                                                                            \n  of                                                                              \n  modif\u2026                                                                          \n                                                                                  \n(a) Represents the outstanding balance\nprior to modification.\n\n(b) Represents loans modified in TDRs\nthat experienced a payment default in\nthe periods presented, and for which\nthe payment default occurred within one\nyearof the modification.

to be\nrisk-rated in accordance with the Firm\u2019s overall credit risk management framework.\nAs of June 30, 2021, predominantly all of these loans were considered performing.\n(b) When the discounted cash flows or collateral value equals or exceeds the\namortized cost of the loan, the loan does not require an allowance. This typically\noccurs when the loans have been partially charged off and/or there have been\ninterest payments received and applied to the loan balance.\n(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not\nmaterial for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020.\nLoan modifications\n\nCertain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various\nconcessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with\nshort-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered\nconcessions are not TDRs nor are loans for which the Firm has elected to apply the\noption to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by\nthe CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The carrying\nvalue of TDRs was $ 1.1billion and $ 954million as of June 30, 2021, and December\n31, 2020, respectively. The carrying value of new TDRs was $ 224million and $\n88million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $\n652million and $ 164million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively. The new TDRs for the three months ended June 30, 2021 were primarily\nfrom Commercial and Industrial and Other loan modifications that generally\nincluded extending maturity dates. The new TDRs for the six months ended June 30,\n2021 were primarily from Commercial and Industrial loan modifications that\nincluded extending maturity dates and the receipt of assets in partial\nsatisfaction of the loan. The impact of these modifications resulting in new TDRs\nwas not material to the Firm for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and\n2020.\n                                       148                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Note 12 \u2013 Allowance for credit losses                                           \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses\nrepresents management's estimate of\nexpected credit losses over the\nremaining expected life of the Firm's\nfinancial assets measured at amortized\ncost and certain off-balance sheet\nlending-related commitments.

30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n(b) Includes collateral dependent loans, including those considered TDRs and those\nfor which foreclosure is deemed probable, modified PCD loans and non-collateral\ndependent loans that have been modified or are reasonably expected to be modified\nin a TDR. Also includes risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual\nstatus for the wholesale portfolio segment. The asset-specific credit card\nallowance for loans modified, or reasonably expected to be modified, in a TDR is\ncalculated based on the loans\u2019 original contractual interest rates and does not\nconsider any incremental penalty rates.\n(c) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable\nand other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n(d) At June 30, 2021 and 2020, lending-related commitments excluded $ 20.8billion\nand $ 9.9billion, respectively, for the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio\nsegment; $ 682.5billion and $ 673.8billion, respectively, for the credit card\nportfolio segment; and $ 42.7billion and $ 21.5billion, respectively, for the\nwholesale portfolio segment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-\nrelated commitments.\n(e) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current\npresentation.\n                                       150                                        \nDiscussion of changes in the allowance The allowance for credit losses as of June\n30, 2021 decreased when compared to December 31, 2020, consisting of: \u2022 a $7.1\nbillion reduction in consumer, predominantly in the credit card portfolio,\nreflecting improvements in the Firm's economic outlook; and in the residential\nreal estate portfolio, primarily due to continued improvements in HPI\nexpectations, and \u2022 a $1.1 billion net reduction in wholesale, across the LOBs,\nreflecting improvements in the Firm's economic outlook. The COVID-19 pandemic has\nstressed many MEVs used in the Firm's allowance estimate which has created\nchallenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates, increased the reliance on\nmanagement judgment, and resulted in adjustments to appropriately address the\neconomic circumstances. These adjustments continued through the second quarter of\n2021, although to a lesser extent than experienced during 2020. The U.S. economy\nhas continued to improve with the benefits of vaccination and as more businesses\nhave reopened, thereby reducing certain pandemic-related macroeconomic\nuncertainties. However, uncertainties remain, including the pace of vaccination\nprogress, the impact of additional waves and new virus strains, the health of\nunderlying labor markets, and the potential for changes in consumer behavior that\ncould have longer term impacts on certain sectors. As a result of these\nuncertainties, the Firm retained meaningful weighting on its adverse scenarios,\nalbeit to a lesser extent than the first quarter of 2021 and fourth quarter of\n2020. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than\nthe central case assumptions outlined below, resulting in weighted average U.S.\nunemployment rates rising above seven percent in 2021 and falling just below six\npercent throughout the second quarter of 2022 with U.S. GDP returning to pre-\npandemic levels in 4Q21.\nThe Firm\u2019s central case assumptions\nreflected U.S. unemployment rates and\nU.S. real GDP as follows :\n                                                                                  \n                                Assumptions at June 30,                           \n                                                   2021                           \n                                                   4Q21       2Q22       4Q22     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. unemployment                                 4.7  %     4.0  %     3.8  %  \n  rate(a)                                                                         \n  Cumulative change in                                                            \n  U.S. real GDP from                                4.3  %     6.0  %     7.3  %  \n  12/31/2019                                                                      \n                                Assumptions at December                           \n                                               31, 2020                           \n                                                   2Q21       4Q21       2Q22     \n  U.S. unemployment                                 6.8  %     5.7  %     5.1  %  \n  rate(a)                                                                         \n  Cumulative change in                                                            \n  U.S. real GDP from                               -1.9  %     0.6  %     2.0  %  \n  12/31/2019                                                                      \n                                                                                  \n(a) Reflects quarterly average of\nforecasted U.S. unemployment rate.\nSubsequent changes to this forecast and\nrelated estimates will be reflected in\nthe provision for credit losses in\nfuture periods.\n                                       151                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Note 13 \u2013 Variable interest entities                                            \n                                                                                  \nRefer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for a further description of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s accounting policies regarding consolidation of VIEs.

Depending on the particular transaction,\nas well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of\nthe loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts.\n                                       152                                        \nThe following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in\nFirm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in which the\nFirm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by the Firm.\nContinuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or\nsubordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit\nrisk retention rules), recourse or guarantee arrangements, and derivative\ncontracts. In certain instances, the Firm\u2019s only continuing involvement is\nservicing the loans. The Firm\u2019s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased\ninterests is the carrying value of these interests.\n

Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets\nare long-term beneficial interests of $ 2.7billion and $ 5.2billion at June 30,\n2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively.\n(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets.\nVIEs sponsored by third parties\n\nThe Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These\ninclude, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider,\ninvestor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian.\nThese transactions are conducted at arm\u2019s-length, and individual credit decisions\nare based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the\nquality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct\nthe activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic\nperformance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the\nFirm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these\npositions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record\nand report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. Tax credit\nvehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which\nare limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable\nhousing, energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs.\nA third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control\nover the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the\nFirm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these\npartnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt\nof tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented\nby equity investments and funding commitments, was $ 23.2billion and $\n23.6billion, of which $ 7.5billion and $ 8.7billion was unfunded at June 30, 2021\nand December 31, 2020, respectively. The prior-period maximum loss exposure amount\nhas been revised to conform with the current presentation. The Firm assesses each\nproject and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its\ncapital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits.

In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity\nprovider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In\nthose transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to\nthe third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any\nintent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying\nmunicipal bonds.

Unanticipated declines\nin business performance, increases in\ncredit losses, increases in capital\nrequirements, as well as deterioration\nin economic or market conditions,\nadverse regulatory or legislative\nchanges or increases in the estimated\nmarket cost of equity, could cause the\nestimated fair values of the Firm\u2019s\nreporting units to decline in the\nfuture, which could result in a\nmaterial impairment charge to earnings\nin a future period related to some\nportion of the associated goodwill. As\nof June 30, 2021, the Firm reviewed\ncurrent economic conditions, including\nthe potential impacts of the COVID-19\npandemic on business performance,\nestimated market cost of equity, as\nwell as actual business results and\nprojections of business performance for\nall its reporting units. The Firm has\nconcluded that the goodwill allocated\nto its reporting units was not impaired\nas of June 30, 2021, or December 31,\n2020, nor was goodwill written off due\nto impairment during the six months\nended June 30, 2021 or 2020.\n                                       158                                        \nMortgage servicing rights\n\nMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing\nservicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future\nservicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the\nloans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received,\neffectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary\nfee income.

In each transaction, a portion of\nthe SMBS was acquired by third parties at the transaction date; the Firm acquired\nthe remaining balance of those SMBS as trading securities.\n(b) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to\nchanges in market interest rates, and the difference between actual and expected\nprepayments.\n(c) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in\nmarket interest rates.\n(d) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal\nand interest, taxes and insurance), which will generally be reimbursed within a\nshort period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the trust or\nthe underlying loans. The Firm\u2019s credit risk associated with these servicer\nadvances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to\nall cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop\npayment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance.\nHowever, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were\nnot made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.\n                                       159                                        \nThe following table presents the components

The\ncontractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible\ncredit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or\nthe Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the\ncustomer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the\ncontract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been\nrefinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default\noccurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not,\nin the Firm\u2019s view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or\nfunding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for a\nfurther discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm\u2019s\nrelated accounting policies. To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale\nand certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses\non lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further\ninformation regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related\ncommitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying\nvalues of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and\nother commitments at June 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020. The amounts in the\ntable below for credit card, home equity and certain scored business banking\nlending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these\nproducts. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all\navailable lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time.\nThe Firm can reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business banking\nlines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by\nlaw, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when\nthe borrower is 60days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when\nthere are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when\nthere has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the

If Merchant\nServices is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, Merchant Services will\nbear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. Merchant\nServices mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash\nreserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, Merchant Services\nrecognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk to\nthe Firm related to charge-backs.\n                                       170                                        \nLoan sales- and securitization-related\nindemnifications In connection with the\nFirm\u2019s mortgage loan sale and\nsecuritization activities with GSEs the\nFirm has made representations and\nwarranties that the loans sold meet\ncertain requirements, and that may\nrequire the Firm to repurchase mortgage\nloans and/or indemnify the loan\npurchaser if such representations and\nwarranties are breached by the Firm.\nThe liability related to repurchase\ndemands associated with private label\nsecuritizations is separately evaluated\nby the Firm in establishing its\nlitigation reserves. Refer to Note 24\nof this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for\nadditional information regarding\nlitigation. Sponsored member repo\nprogram The Firm acts as a sponsoring\nmember to clear eligible overnight\nresale and repurchase agreements\nthrough the Government Securities\nDivision of the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation (\u201cFICC\u201d) on behalf of\nclients that become sponsored members\nunder the FICC\u2019s rules. The Firm also\nguarantees to the FICC the prompt and\nfull payment and performance of its\nsponsored member clients\u2019 respective\nobligations under the FICC\u2019s rules. The\nFirm minimizes its liability under\nthese overnight guarantees by obtaining\na security interest in the cash or\nhigh-quality securities collateral that\nthe clients place with the clearing\nhouse therefore the Firm expects the\nrisk of loss to be remote. The Firm\u2019s\nmaximum possible exposure, without\ntaking into consideration the\nassociated collateral, is included in\nthe Exchange & clearing house\nguarantees and commitments line on page\n169. Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for additional\ninformation on credit risk mitigation\npractices on resale agreements and the\ntypes of collateral pledged under\nrepurchase agreements.

The\nlitigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class\naction lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations and\nregulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by\nboth governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal\nproceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation,\nand involve each of the Firm\u2019s lines of business and several geographies and a\nwide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and\nstatutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which\npresent novel legal theories. The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate\nrange of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its\nlegal proceedings is from $ 0to approximately $ 1.5billion at June 30, 2021. This\nestimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information\navailable as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an\nestimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm\ndoes not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm\u2019s\nestimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant\njudgment, given: \u2022 the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings,\nincluding the fact that many are in preliminary stages, \u2022 the existence in many\nsuch proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of\nliability (if any) has yet to be determined, \u2022 the numerous yet-unresolved issues\nin many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the\nscope of many of the claims, and \u2022 the attendant uncertainty of the various\npotential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made\nassumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about\nthe behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those\nassumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular\nproceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its\nestimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote.\nAccordingly, the Firm\u2019s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible\nlosses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly.\nSet forth below are descriptions of the Firm\u2019s material legal proceedings.\nAmrapali . India\u2019s Enforcement Directorate (\u201cED\u201d) is investigating JPMorgan India\nPrivate Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by\ntwooffshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential\nhousing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (\u201cAmrapali\u201d). In 2017, numerous\ncreditors filed civil claims against Amrapali including petitions brought by home\nbuyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units.\nThe home buyers\u2019 petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India since\n2017 pursuant to its jurisdiction over public interest litigation. In July 2019,\nthe Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that\nAmrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the\noffshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain currency\ncontrol and money laundering provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further\ninquiry under India\u2019s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (\u201cPMLA\u201d) and Foreign\nExchange Management Act (\u201cFEMA\u201d). Approximately $ 25million from JPMorgan India\nPrivate Limited was attached by the ED in May 2020 in connection with the criminal\nPMLA investigation. These funds were subsequently disbursed pursuant to an order\nby the Supreme Court of India for completing outstanding construction of the\nprojects. A separate civil proceeding relating to alleged FEMA violations is\nongoing. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the investigation. Federal\nRepublic of Nigeria Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. operated an escrow and\ndepository account for the Federal Government of Nigeria (\u201cFGN\u201d) and two major\ninternational oil companies. The account held approximately $ 1.1billion in\nconnection with a dispute among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following\nthe settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in\nthe account in 2011 and 2013 in accordance with directions received from its\nclients. In November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (\u201cFRN\u201d) commenced a\nclaim in the English High Court for approximately $ 875million in payments made\nout of the accounts. The FRN, claiming to be the same entity as the FGN, alleges\nthat the payments were instructed as part of a complex fraud not involving\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or should have\nbeen on notice that the payments may be fraudulent. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\napplied for summary judgment and was unsuccessful. The claim is ongoing and a\ntrial has been scheduled to commence in February 2022. Foreign Exchange\nInvestigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with\ncertain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (\u201cFX\u201d) sales and\ntrading activities and controls related to those activities. Among those\nresolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded\n                                       172                                        \nguilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. In January 2017, the Firm\nwas sentenced, with judgment entered thereafter and a term of probation ending in\nJanuary 2020. The term of probation has concluded, with the Firm remaining in good\nstanding throughout the probation period. The Department of Labor granted the Firm\na five-yearexemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and its affiliates\nto continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under\nthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d) until January 2023. The Firm\nwill need to reapply in due course for a further exemption to cover the remainder\nof the ten-yeardisqualification period. A South Africa Competition Commission\nmatter is the remaining FX-related governmental inquiry, and is currently pending\nbefore the South Africa Competition Tribunal. In August 2018, the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval to the\nFirm\u2019s settlement of a consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs,\nwhich principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged\nconspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf\nof persons who transacted in FX futures and options on futures. Certain members of\nthe settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class,\nand certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm and other foreign exchange\ndealers in November 2018. A number of these actions remain pending. Further, a\nputative class action has been filed against the Firm and other foreign exchange\ndealers on behalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at\nallegedly inflated rates. Another putative class action was brought against the\nFirm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of purported indirect purchasers\nof FX instruments. In 2020, the Court approved a settlement by the Firm and\n11other defendants of that class action for a total of $ 10million. In addition,\nsome FX-related individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged\nunderlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel\nand Australia. Inquiries Concerning Preservation Requirements . The Firm has been\nresponding to requests for information and other material from certain of its\nregulators concerning its compliance with records preservation requirements in\nconnection with business communications sent over electronic messaging channels\nthat have not been approved by the Firm. The Firm is cooperating with these\ninquiries and is currently engaged in certain resolution discussions. There is no\nassurance that the discussions will result in a resolution. Interchange\nLitigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class\naction complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks,\nconspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted\nrelated rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially\nsettled the cases for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card\ninterchange, and modifications to certain credit card network rules. In 2017,\nafter the approval of that settlement was reversed on appeal, the case was\nremanded to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York\nfor further proceedings consistent with the appellate decision. The original class\naction was divided into twoseparate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief\nand the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties\nto the class action seeking monetary relief finalized an agreement which amends\nand supersedes the prior settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the\ndefendants collectively contributed an additional $ 900million to the\napproximately $ 5.3billion previously held in escrow from the original settlement.\nIn December 2019, the amended agreement was approved by the District Court.\nCertain merchants appealed the District Court\u2019s approval order, and those appeals\nare pending. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended\nclass settlement, $ 700million has been returned to the defendants from the\nsettlement escrow in accordance with the settlement agreement. The class action\nseeking primarily injunctive relief continues separately. In addition, certain\nmerchants have filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa\nand Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks, and some of those\nactions remain pending. LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and\nLitigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various governmental\nagencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers\nAssociation\u2019s (\"BBA\") London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) for various\ncurrencies and the European Banking Federation\u2019s Euro Interbank Offered Rate\n(\u201cEURIBOR\u201d). The Swiss Competition Commission\u2019s investigation relating to EURIBOR,\nto which the Firm and other banks are subject, continues. In December 2016, the\nEuropean Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an\ninfringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed\nan appeal of that decision with the European General Court, and that appeal is\npending. In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other\nbanks in various individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates,\nincluding U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the\nperiod that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of\ncertain actions and resolved certain other actions, and others are in various\nstages of litigation. The United States District Court for the Southern District\nof New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds\nand interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. In a\nconsolidated putative class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR\nwas administered by ICE Benchmark Administration, the District Court granted the\nmotion by defendants, including the Firm, to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, and\nthe plaintiffs have\n                                       173                                        \nappealed. In addition, in August 2020, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a\nlawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants\nwere engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to\nmonopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards. In November\n2020 and May 2021, plaintiffs filed motions for a preliminary injunction each\nseeking to enjoin defendants from setting U.S. dollar LIBOR and to prohibit\ndefendants from enforcing any financial instruments that rely on U.S. dollar\nLIBOR. The court has scheduled a hearing to address these motions in September\n2021. The Firm\u2019s settlements of putative class actions related to Swiss franc\nLIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and\nthe Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate remain subject to court approval.\nMetals and U.S. Treasuries Investigations and Litigation and Related Inquiries.\nThe Firm previously reported that it and/or certain of its subsidiaries had\nentered into resolutions with the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d), the U.S.\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (\u201cSEC\u201d), which, collectively, resolved those agencies\u2019 respective\ninvestigations relating to historical trading practices by former employees in the\nprecious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct from 2008 to 2016.\nThe Firm entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (\u201cDPA\u201d) with the DOJ in\nwhich it agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging JPMorgan Chase &\nCo. with twocounts of wire fraud and agreed, along with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nand J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to certain terms and obligations as set forth\ntherein. Under the terms of the DPA, the criminal information will be dismissed\nafter three years, provided that JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nand J.P. Morgan Securities LLC fully comply with all of their obligations. Across\nthe threeresolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC, JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC agreed to pay a total monetary\namount of approximately $ 920million. A portion of the total monetary amount\nincludes victim compensation payments. Several putative class action complaints\nhave been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of\nNew York against the Firm and certain former employees, alleging a precious metals\nfutures and options price manipulation scheme in violation of the Commodity\nExchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust enrichment and deceptive\nacts or practices under the General Business Law of the State of New York. The\nCourt consolidated these putative class actions in February 2019, and the\nconsolidated action is stayed through December 2021. In July 2021, the parties\ninformed the Court that they have entered into a settlement to resolve the action.\nIn Canada, plaintiffs have moved to commence putative class action proceedings\nbased on similar alleged underlying conduct for precious metals. In addition,\nseveral putative class actions were filed in the United States District Courts for\nthe Northern District of Illinois and Southern District of New York against the\nFirm, alleging manipulation of U.S. Treasury futures and options, and bringing\nclaims under the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust\nenrichment. The actions in the Northern District of Illinois have been transferred\nto the Southern District of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class\nactions in October 2020 and plaintiffs filed their consolidated amended complaint\nin April 2021. In May 2021, the parties informed the Court that they have entered\ninto a settlement to resolve the action. In October 2020, twoputative class action\ncomplaints were filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the United\nStates District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the Firm and\ncertain individual defendants on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares during\nthe putative class period alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were\nmaterially false or misleading in that they did not disclose certain information\nrelating to the above-referenced investigations. The Court consolidated these\nputative class actions in January 2021. Plaintiffs filed their second amended\ncomplaint in May 2021, which additionally alleged that certain orders in precious\nmetals futures contracts placed by precious metals futures traders during the\nputative class period were materially false and misleading. Defendants have moved\nto dismiss. Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation . JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic\nSecurities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class action filed\nin the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The\ncomplaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law and New York State common\nlaw in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous\nexchange trading for securities lending transactions. Defendants\u2019 motion to\ndismiss the complaint was denied. Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this\naction, which defendants are opposing. Wendel. Since 2012, the French criminal\nauthorities have been investigating a series of transactions entered into by\nsenior managers of Wendel Investissement (\u201cWendel\u201d) during the period from 2004\nthrough 2007 to restructure their shareholdings in Wendel. JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A., Paris branch provided financing for the transactions to a number of managers\nof Wendel in 2007. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. cooperated with the investigation.\nThe investigating judges issued an ordonnance de renvoi in November 2016,\nreferring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel for\nalleged complicity in tax fraud. In January 2018, the Paris Court of Appeal issued\na decision cancelling the mise en examen of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Court of\nCassation, France\u2019s highest court, ruled in September 2018 that a mise en examen\nis a\n                                       174                                        \nprerequisite for an ordonnance de renvoi and in January 2020 ordered the annulment\nof the ordonnance de renvoi referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French\ntribunal correctionnel . The Court of Appeal found in January 2021 that it had no\npower to take further action against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. following the Court\nof Cassation\u2019s ruling. At the opening of a trial of the managers of Wendel in\nJanuary 2021, the tribunal correctionnel directed the criminal authorities to\nclarify whether a further investigation should be opened against JPMorgan Chase,\npending which the trial was postponed. In April 2021, the Court of Cassation\ndeclined to hear JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s appeal of the January 2021 decision\nof the tribunal correctionnel at this stage of the proceedings. JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. continues to cooperate in this matter and is engaged with the French\ncriminal authorities. In addition, a number of the managers have commenced civil\nproceedings against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The claims are separate, involve\ndifferent allegations and are at various stages of proceedings. * * * In addition\nto the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its\nsubsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial\nnumber of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses\nto the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings\nand it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be\ninitiated from time to time in the future. The Firm has established reserves for\nseveral hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with\nthe provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-\nrelated liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and\nthe amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its\noutstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and\nmakes adjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on\nmanagement\u2019s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm\u2019s legal\nexpense was $ 185million and $ 118million for the three months ended June 30, 2021\nand 2020, respectively, and $ 213million and $ 315million for the six months ended\nJune 30, 2021 and 2020. There is no assurance that the Firm\u2019s litigation reserves\nwill not need to be adjusted in the future. In view of the inherent difficulty of\npredicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek\nvery large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal\ntheories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery,\nthe Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the\ncurrently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual\nlosses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase\nbelieves, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel,\nconsideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking\ninto account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of\npossible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it\nshould not have a material adverse effect on the Firm\u2019s consolidated financial\ncondition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in\nsuch proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these\nmatters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or\nthat a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the\noutcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operating\nresults for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of\nthe loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s income for that\nperiod.\n                                       175                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Note 25 \u2013 Business segments                                                     \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are fourmajor reportable business\nsegments - Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial\nBanking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment.\nThe business segments are determined based on the products and services provided,\nor the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial\ninformation is currently evaluated by the Firm\u2019s Operating Committee. Segment\nresults are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results below, and Note\n32 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbusiness segments. Segment results The following table provides a summary of the\nFirm\u2019s segment results as of or for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021\nand 2020, on a managed basis. The Firm\u2019s definition of managed basis starts with\nthe reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present\ntotal net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on\nan FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and\ntax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to\ntaxable investments and securities.

The current estimated LTV ratios\nare calculated using estimated\ncollateral values derived from a\nnationally recognized home price index\nmeasured at the metropolitan\nstatistical area (\u201cMSA\u201d) level. These\nMSA-level home price indices consist of\nactual data to the extent available and\nforecasted data where actual data is\nnot available. As a result, the\nestimated collateral values used to\ncalculate these ratios do not represent\nactual appraised loan-level collateral\nvalues; as such, the resulting LTV\nratios are necessarily imprecise and\nshould therefore be viewed as\nestimates.\n                                                                                  \n  Combined LTV ratio                                                              \n                                                                                  \nThe LTV ratio considering all available\nlien positions, as well as unused\nlines, related to the property.\nCombined LTV ratios are used for junior\nlien home equity products.\n\nManaged basis: A non-GAAP presentation\nof Firmwide financial results that\nincludes reclassifications to present\nrevenue on a fully taxable-equivalent\nbasis.

Alt-A lending\ncharacteristics may include one or more\nof the following: (i) limited\ndocumentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio;\n(iii) loans secured by non-owner\noccupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-\nincome ratio above normal limits. A\nsubstantial proportion of the Firm\u2019s\nAlt-A loans are those where a borrower\ndoes not provide complete documentation\nof his or her assets or the amount or\nsource of his or her income.\n\nOption ARMs\n\nThe option ARM real estate loan product\nis an adjustable-rate mortgage loan\nthat provides the borrower with the\noption each month to make a fully\namortizing, interest-only or minimum\npayment. The minimum payment on an\noption ARM loan is based on the\ninterest rate charged during the\nintroductory period. This introductory\nrate is usually significantly below the\nfully indexed rate. The fully indexed\nrate is calculated using an index rate\nplus a margin. Once the introductory\nperiod ends, the contractual interest\nrate charged on the loan increases to\nthe fully indexed rate and adjusts\nmonthly to reflect movements in the\nindex. The minimum payment is typically\ninsufficient to cover interest accrued\nin the prior month, and any unpaid\ninterest is deferred and added to the\nprincipal balance of the loan. Option\nARM loans are subject to payment\nrecast, which converts the loan to a\nvariable-rate fully amortizing loan\nupon meeting specified loan balance and\nanniversary date triggers.\n                                       183                                        \nPrime\n\nPrime mortgage loans are made to\nborrowers with good credit records who\nmeet specific underwriting\nrequirements, including prescriptive\nrequirements related to income and\noverall debt levels.

It also consists of\nrealized (as a result of closing out or\ntermination of transactions, or interim\ncash payments) and unrealized (as a\nresult of changes in valuation) gains\nand losses on financial and other\ninstruments (including those accounted\nfor under the fair value option)\nprimarily used in client-driven market-\nmaking activities and on private equity\ninvestments. In connection with its\nclient-driven market-making activities,\nthe Firm transacts in debt and equity\ninstruments, derivatives and\ncommodities (including physical\ncommodities inventories and financial\ninstruments that reference\ncommodities). Principal transactions\nrevenue also includes certain realized\nand unrealized gains and losses related\nto hedge accounting and specified risk-\nmanagement activities, including: (a)\ncertain derivatives designated in\nqualifying hedge accounting\nrelationships (primarily fair value\nhedges of commodity and foreign\nexchange risk), (b) certain derivatives\nused for specific risk management\npurposes, primarily to mitigate credit\nrisk and foreign exchange risk, and (c)\nother derivatives.\n\nPSU(s) : Performance share units\n\nRegulatory VaR: Daily aggregated VaR\ncalculated in accordance with\nregulatory rules.\n\nREO: Real estate owned\n\nReported basis: Financial statements\nprepared under U.S. GAAP, which\nexcludes the impact of taxable-\nequivalent adjustments.\n\nRetained loans : Loans that are held-\nfor-investment (i.e. excludes loans\nheld-for-sale and loans at fair value).\n\nRevenue wallet: Total fee revenue based\non estimates of investment banking fees\ngenerated across the industry (i.e.,\nthe revenue wallet) from investment\nbanking transactions in M&A, equity and\ndebt underwriting, and loan\nsyndications.

Key\ndifferences in the calculation of\ncredit risk RWA between the\nStandardized and Advanced approaches\nare that for Basel III Advanced, credit\nrisk RWA is based on risk-sensitive\n\napproaches which largely rely on the\nuse of internal credit models and\nparameters, whereas for Basel III\nStandardized, credit risk RWA is\ngenerally based on supervisory risk-\nweightings which vary primarily by\ncounterparty type and asset class.\nMarket risk RWA is calculated on a\ngenerally consistent basis between\nBasel III Standardized and Basel III\nAdvanced.\n\nScored portfolios: Consumer loan\nportfolios that predominantly include\nresidential real estate loans, credit\ncard loans, auto loans to individuals\nand certain small business loans.\n\nS&P : Standard and Poors\n\nSAR(s) : Stock appreciation rights\n\nSCB : Stress capital buffer\n\nSEC : U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission\n\nSeed capital: Initial JPMorgan capital\ninvested in products, such as mutual\nfunds, with the intention of ensuring\nthe fund is of sufficient size to\nrepresent a viable offering to clients,\nenabling pricing of its shares, and\nallowing the manager to develop a track\nrecord.

Risk           \u2502\n\u2502  Factors.The following discussion supplements the discussion of riskfactors    \u2502\n\u2502  affecting the Firm as set forth in Part I, Item 1A:Risk Factors on pages      \u2502\n\u2502  8-32 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K. The discussion of risk factors, as   \u2502\n\u2502  so supplemented, sets forth the material risk factors that could affect       \u2502\n\u2502  JPMorgan Chase\u2019s financial condition and operations. Readers should not       \u2502\n\u2502  consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all         \u2502\n\u2502  potential risks that could affect the Firm.The COVID-19 pandemic has caused   \u2502\n\u2502  and is causing significant harm to the global economy and could further       \u2502\n\u2502  negatively affect certain of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses.On March 11, 2020,   \u2502\n\u2502  the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a strain of novel      \u2502\n\u2502  coronavirus disease, COVID-19, to be a global pandemic. The COVID-19          \u2502\n\u2502  pandemic and governmental responses to the pandemic led to the institution    \u2502\n\u2502  of social distancing and shelter-in-place requirements in certain areas of    \u2502\n\u2502  the U.S. and other countries resulting in ongoing severe impacts on global    \u2502\n\u2502  economic conditions, including:\u2022significant disruption and volatility in the  \u2502\n\u2502  financial markets\u2022significant disruption of global supply chains,             \u2502\n\u2502  and\u2022closures of many businesses, leading to loss of revenues and increased    \u2502\n\u2502  unemployment.A prolongation or worsening of the pandemic, or the emergence    \u2502\n\u2502  of other diseases that give rise to similar effects, could deepen the         \u2502\n\u2502  adverse impact on the global economy.The adverse economic conditions caused   \u2502\n\u2502  by the pandemic have had a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s     \u2502\n\u2502  businesses and results of operations, including:\u2022reduction in demand for      \u2502\n\u2502  certain products and services from JPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients and customers,    \u2502\n\u2502  resulting in lower revenue, and\u2022increases in the allowance for credit         \u2502\n\u2502  losses.Certain models used by JPMorgan Chase in connection with the           \u2502\n\u2502  determination of the allowance for credit losses have heightened performance  \u2502\n\u2502  risk in the economic environment precipitated by the effects of the COVID-19  \u2502\n\u2502  pandemic and government stimulus. There can be no assurance that, even after  \u2502\n\u2502  adjustments have been made to model outputs, JPMorgan Chase will not          \u2502\n\u2502  recognize unexpected losses arising from the model uncertainty that has       \u2502\n\u2502  resulted from these developments.                                             \u2502\n\u2502                                                                                \u2502\n\u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256f\n                                       190                                        \nA prolongation or worsening of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and the negative\neconomic impacts of the pandemic could\nhave other significant adverse effects\non JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses, results\nof operations and financial condition,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 recognition of credit losses and\nfurther increases in the allowance for\ncredit losses, especially to the extent\nthat businesses remain closed,\nunemployment continues at elevated\nlevels, clients and customers draw on\ntheir lines of credit or significant\nnumbers of people relocate from\nmetropolitan areas\n\n\u2022 material impacts on the value of\nsecurities, derivatives and other\nfinancial instruments which JPMorgan\nChase owns or in which it makes markets\n\n\u2022 downgrades in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit\nratings\n\n\u2022 constraints on liquidity or capital\ndue to elevated levels of deposits,\nincreases in risk-weighted assets\n(\u201cRWA\u201d) related to supporting client\nactivities, downgrades in client credit\nratings, regulatory actions or other\nfactors, any or all of which could\nrequire JPMorgan Chase to take or\nrefrain from taking actions that it\notherwise would under its liquidity and\ncapital management strategies, and\n\n\u2022 the possibility that significant\nportions of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s workforce\nare unable to work effectively,\nincluding because of illness,\nquarantines, shelter-in-place\narrangements, government actions or\nother restrictions in connection with\nthe pandemic.\n\nThe extent to which the COVID-19\npandemic negatively affects JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s businesses, results of\noperations and financial condition, as\nwell as its regulatory capital and\nliquidity ratios, will depend on future\ndevelopments that are highly uncertain\nand cannot be predicted, including the\nultimate scope and duration of the\npandemic, the effectiveness of\nvaccination programs and actions taken\nby governmental authorities and other\nthird parties in response to the\npandemic. Those negative effects,\nincluding the possible recognition of\ncharge-offs, may be delayed\n\nbecause of the impact of prior and\npotential future government stimulus\nactions or payment assistance provided\nto clients and customers.\n\nIn addition, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nparticipation directly or indirectly,\nincluding on behalf of customers and\nclients or by affiliated entities, in\nU.S. government programs designed to\nsupport individuals, households and\nbusinesses impacted by the economic\ndisruptions caused by the COVID-19\npandemic could be criticized and\nsubject JPMorgan Chase to:\n\n\u2022 increased governmental and regulatory\nscrutiny\n\n\u2022 negative publicity, and\n\n\u2022 increased exposure to litigation,\n\nany or all of which could increase\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational, legal and\ncompliance costs and damage its\nreputation. To the extent that the\nCOVID-19 pandemic adversely affects\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business, results of\noperations and financial condition, it\nmay also have the effect of heightening\nmany of the other risks described in\nRisk Factors in the 2020 Form 10-K.\n                                                                                  \n  Supervision and regulation                                                      \n                                                                                  \nRefer to the Supervision and regulation\nsection on pages 3\u20137 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for information\non Supervision and Regulation.\n\nItem 2.
