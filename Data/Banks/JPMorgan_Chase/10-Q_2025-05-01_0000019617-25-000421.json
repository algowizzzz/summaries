(d) Markets consists of CIB's Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets businesses.

As a result of the agreement, the\nFirm made a payment of $609 million to the FDIC on January 31, 2025 and reduced its additional payable to\nthe FDIC, which resulted in a gain of $588 million recorded in other income in the first quarter of 2025.\nRefer to Note 5 of this Form 10-Q and Note 34 on pages 319-321 of the Firm\u2019s 2024 Form 10-K for additional\ninformation. Comparisons noted in the sections below are for the first quarter of 2025 versus the first\nquarter of 2024, unless otherwise specified. Firmwide overview For the first quarter of 2025, JPMorganChase\nreported net income of $14.6 billion, up 9%, earnings per share of $5.07, ROE of 18% and ROTCE of 21%. The\nFirm's results included a $588 million First Republic-related gain in Corporate. \u2022 Total net revenue was\n$45.3 billion, up 8%, reflecting: \u2013 Net interest income (\"NII\") of $23.3 billion, up 1%, driven by higher\nMarkets net interest income, higher revolving balances in Card Services, the impact of securities activity\nincluding from prior quarters, and higher wholesale deposit balances. These factors were predominantly\noffset by the impact of lower rates and deposit margin compression, as well as lower average deposit\nbalances in CCB. NII excluding Markets was $22.6 billion, down 2%. \u2013 Noninterest revenue (\"NIR\") was $22.0\nbillion, up 17%, predominantly driven by higher Markets noninterest revenue, a $588 million First Republic-\nrelated gain, higher asset management fees in AWM and CCB, lower net investment securities losses in\nTreasury and CIO, and higher investment banking fees. \u2022 Noninterest expense was $23.6 billion, up 4%, driven\nby higher compensation expense, including higher revenue-related compensation and growth in the number of\nemployees. The increase in expense was also driven by higher brokerage expense and distribution fees, and\ncontinued investments in technology and marketing, as well as the absence of a legal benefit from the prior\nyear. These factors were largely offset by the impact of an FDIC special assessment accrual release of $323\nmillion compared with an accrual increase of $725 million in the prior year. \u2022 The provision for credit\nlosses was $3.3 billion. Net charge-offs were $2.3 billion, up $376 million, predominantly driven by Card\nServices, reflecting\n                                                     5                                                      \nthe seasoning of vintages originated in recent\nyears. The net addition to the allowance for credit\nlosses was $973 million and included $549 million\nin wholesale and $441 million in consumer , and was\nlargely driven by changes in the weighted-average\nmacroeconomic outlook.\n\nIn the prior year, the provision was $1.9 billion,\nnet charge-offs were $2.0 billion and the net\nreduction in the allowance for credit losses was\n$72 million.\n\n\u2022 The total allowance for credit losses was $27.8\nbillion at March 31, 2025 . The Firm had an\nallowance for loan losses to retained loans\ncoverage ratio of 1.94%, compared with 1.77% in the\nprior year.\n\nRefer to Consolidated Results of Operations and\nConsolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 9-11\nand pages 12-13, respectively, for a further\ndiscussion of the Firm's results, including the\nprovision for credit losses.\n\nPre-provision profit, ROTCE, TCE, TBVPS, NII and\nNIR excluding Markets, and total net revenue on a\nmanaged basis are non-GAAP financial measures.\nRefer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the\nFirm\u2019s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages\n15-16 for a further discussion of each of these\nmeasures.\n\n\u2022 The Firm\u2019s nonperforming assets totaled $9.1\nbillion at March 31, 2025 , up 10%, driven by\nhigher wholesale nonaccrual loans, largely in Real\nEstate, concentrated in Multifamily and Lodging,\nreflecting downgrades, partially offset by lower\nconsumer nonaccrual loans, which included loan\nsales. Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio and\nConsumer Credit Portfolio on pages 52-60 and pages\n49-51, respectively, for additional information.\n\n\u2022 Firmwide average loans of $1.3 trillion were up\n2%, predominantly driven by higher loans in CIB and\nAWM.\n\n\u2022 Firmwide average deposits of $2.4 trillion were\nup 2%, reflecting:\n\n\u2013 net inflows in Payments and Securities Services,\nand\n\n\u2013 growth in balances in new and existing client\naccounts in AWM,\n\npartially offset by\n\n\u2013 a decline in CCB primarily driven by a decrease\nin balances in existing accounts due to migration\ninto higher-yielding investments and increased\ncustomer spending.\n\nRefer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 40-46\nfor additional information.\n                                                                                                            \n  Selected capital and other metrics                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n\u2022 CET1 capital was $280 billion, and the\nStandardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 15.4%\nand 15.6%, respectively.\n\n\u2022 SLR was 6.0%.\n\n\u2022 TBVPS grew 13%, ending the first quarter of 2025\nat $100.36.\n\n\u2022 As of March 31, 2025 , the Firm had eligible end-\nof-period High Quality Liquid Assets (\u201cHQLA\u201d) of\napproximately $881 billion and unencumbered\nmarketable securities with a fair value of\napproximately $635 billion, resulting in\napproximately $1.5 trillion of liquidity sources.\nRefer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 40-46\nfor additional information.\n                                                     6                                                      \nBusiness segment highlights Selected business\nmetrics for each of the Firm\u2019s lines of business\n(\"LOB\") are presented below for the first quarter\nof 2025.\n                                                                                                            \n             \u2022Average deposits down 2%; client investment assets up 7%                                      \n  CCB        \u2022Average loans up 1%; Card Services net charge-off rate of 3.58%                               \n  ROE 31%    \u2022Debit and credit card sales volume(a)up 7%                                                    \n             \u2022Active mobile customers(b)up 8%                                                               \n             \u2022Investment Banking fees up 12%; #1 ranking for Global Investment Banking fees with 9.0%       \n  CIB        wallet share in 1Q25                                                                           \n  ROE 18%    \u2022Markets revenue up 21%, with Fixed Income Markets up 8% and Equity Markets up 48%             \n             \u2022Average Banking & Payments loans(c)down 3%; average client deposits(d)up 11%                  \n  AWM        \u2022Assets under management (\"AUM\") of $4.1 trillion, up 15%                                      \n  ROE 39%    \u2022Average loans up 5% YoY; average deposits up 7%                                               \n                                                                                                            \n(a) Excludes Commercial Card.

Refer to Note 5 for additional information. Quarterly results Investment banking fees\nincreased, reflecting in CIB : \u2022 higher debt underwriting fees predominantly driven by elevated refinancing\nactivity, particularly in leveraged finance, and \u2022 higher advisory fees predominantly driven by the closing\nof deals announced in 2024, partially offset by \u2022 lower equity underwriting fees as challenging market\nconditions resulted in lower fees. Refer to CIB segment results on pages 22-26 and Note 5 for additional\ninformation. Principal transactions revenue increased, reflecting in CIB: \u2022 higher Equity Markets revenue,\nparticularly in Equity Derivatives, and \u2022 higher Fixed Income Markets revenue, reflecting higher revenue in\nRates, predominantly offset by lower revenue in Currencies & Emerging Markets, and Securitized Products.\nPrincipal transactions revenue in CIB generally has offsets across other revenue lines, including net\ninterest income. The Firm assesses the performance of its Markets business on a total net revenue basis.\n\nRefer to CIB segment results on pages 22-26 and Note 5 for additional information. Lending- and deposit-\nrelated fees increased due to: \u2022 a reduction in client credits applied to deposit-related fees as well as\nincreased volumes resulting in higher cash management fees in Payments, partially offset by \u2022 a decline in\nthe amortization of the fair value discount on certain acquired lending-related commitments associated with\nFirst Republic, primarily in AWM, as certain of the commitments have expired. Refer to CIB and AWM segment\nresults on pages 22-26 and pages 27-29, respectively, and Note 5 for additional information. Asset\nmanagement fees increased as a result of net inflows in AWM and higher average market levels in AWM and CCB.\nRefer to CCB and AWM segment results on pages 19-21 and pages 27-29, respectively, and Note 5 for additional\ninformation. Commissions and other fees increased, largely due to higher brokerage commissions and fees on\nhigher volume, in both CIB and AWM. Refer to CIB and AWM segment results on pages 22-26 and pages 27-29,\nrespectively, and Note 5 for additional information. Investment securities losses decreased, reflecting\nlower net losses compared to the prior year, which included sales of securities, primarily U.S. GSE and\ngovernment agency MBS and U.S. Treasuries, associated with repositioning the investment securities portfolio\nin Treasury and CIO. Refer to Corporate results on pages 30-31 and Note 9 for additional information.\nMortgage fees and related income : refer to Note 14 for additional information. Card income was flat,\nreflecting, primarily in CCB, lower net interchange income and an increase in amortization related to new\naccount origination costs, offset by higher annual fees. Refer to CCB segment results on pages 19-21 and\nNote 5 for additional information.\n                                                     9                                                      \nOther income increased, reflecting: \u2022 a $588 million First Republic-related gain in Corporate, and \u2022 higher\nauto operating lease income due to an increase in origination volume in CCB. Refer to CCB and Corporate\nresults on pages 19-21 and pages 30-31, respectively, for additional information; and Note 5 for additional\ninformation on the First Republic-related gain. Net interest income increased driven by higher Markets net\ninterest income, higher revolving balances in Card Services, the impact of securities activity including\nfrom prior quarters, and higher wholesale deposit balances. These factors were predominantly offset by the\nimpact of lower rates and deposit margin compression, as well as lower average deposit balances in CCB. The\nFirm\u2019s average interest-earning assets were $3.7 trillion, up $223 billion, and the yield was 5.19%, down 36\nbasis points (\u201cbps\u201d).

The net addition to the allowance for\ncredit losses was largely driven by changes in the\nweighted-average macroeconomic outlook, and\nconsisted of: \u2022 $549 million in wholesale , which\nalso reflected changes in credit quality on client-\nspecific exposures and the impact of new lending-\nrelated commitments, and \u2022 $441 million in consumer\n, predominantly driven by Card Services. In the\nprior year, the provision was $1.9 billion, net\ncharge-offs were $2.0 billion and the net reduction\nin the allowance for credit losses was $72 million.\nRefer to CCB, CIB and AWM segment and Corporate\nresults on pages 19-21, pages 22-26, pages 27-29,\nand pages 30-31, respectively; Allowance for Credit\nLosses on pages 61-63; Critical Accounting\nEstimates Used by the Firm on pages 72\u201375; and\nNotes 11 and 12 for additional information on the\ncredit portfolio and the allowance for credit\nlosses.\n                                                     10                                                     \n                                                                                                           \n  Noninterest expense                                 Three months                                         \n  (in millions)                           2025     ended March 31,    2024               Change            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Compensation expense                          $           14,093          $  13,118                7  %  \n  Noncompensation expense:                                                                                 \n  Occupancy                                                  1,302              1,211                8     \n  Technology, communications and                             2,578              2,421                6     \n  equipment(a)                                                                                             \n  Professional and outside services                          2,839              2,548               11     \n  Marketing                                                  1,304              1,160               12     \n  Other expense                                              1,481              2,299              -36     \n  Total noncompensation expense                              9,504              9,639               -1     \n  Total noninterest expense                     $           23,597          $  22,757                4  %  \n  Certain components of other expense(b)                                                                   \n  FDIC-related expense                          $              -11          $     973                      \n  Operating losses                                             386                299                      \n                                                                                                           \n(a) Includes depreciation expense associated with\nauto operating lease assets.

Quarterly results\nCompensation expense increased driven by: \u2022 higher\nrevenue-related compensation, particularly in CIB\nand AWM, and \u2022 growth in the number of employees\nacross the LOBs and Corporate, primarily in front\noffice and technology. Noncompensation expense\ndecreased as a result of: \u2022 lower FDIC-related\nexpense, which included the impact of an FDIC\nspecial assessment accrual release of $323 million\nin Corporate, compared with an accrual increase of\n$725 million in the prior year, and \u2022 the absence\nof restructuring and integration costs associated\nwith First Republic recorded in the prior year,\noffset by \u2022 higher legal expense, particularly in\nCIB, largely due to the absence of a legal benefit\nfrom the prior year, \u2022 higher brokerage expense in\nCIB and higher distribution fees in AWM, \u2022 higher\ninvestments in marketing, predominantly in CCB, as\nwell as in technology across the Firm; and to a\nlesser extent, \u2022 higher occupancy expense, higher\noperating losses, largely in CCB, and higher\ndepreciation expense on higher auto lease assets.\nRefer to Note 5 for additional information on other\nexpense.\n                                                                                                        \n  Income tax expense                                                                                    \n  (in millions)                             Three months                                                \n  2025                                   ended March 31,       2024                    Change           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Income before income tax expense    $           18,408               $  17,293                  6  %  \n  Income tax expense                               3,765                   3,874                 -3     \n  Effective tax rate                                20.5  %                 22.4  %                     \n                                                                                                        \nQuarterly results The effective tax rate decreased\npredominantly driven by higher benefits related to\nthe vesting of employee share-based awards in the\ncurrent period as a result of the Firm\u2019s higher\nshare price, and changes in the mix of income and\nexpenses subject to U.S. federal, state and local\ntaxes.\n                                                     11                                                     \n                                              \n  CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND CASH FLOWS  \n  ANALYSIS                                    \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Consolidated balance sheets analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nThe following is a discussion of the significant changes between March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.

Lending as loan sales and\npaydowns outpaced originations.\n\nThe allowance for loan losses increased, reflecting\na net addition to the allowance for loan losses of\n$863 million, largely driven by changes in the\nweighted-average macroeconomic outlook, and\nconsisted of:\n\n\u2022 $451 million in consumer , predominantly driven\nby Card Services, and\n\n\u2022 $412 million in wholesale , which also reflected\nchanges in credit quality on client-specific\nexposures.\n\nThere was also a $125 million net addition to the\nallowance for lending-related commitments\nrecognized in other

market-\nmaking activities, higher secured financing of\ntrading assets and the impact of lower levels of\nnetting, as well as when compared with seasonally\nlower levels at year-end.\n\nShort-term

There are\nthree reportable business segments \u2013 Consumer &\nCommunity Banking, Commercial & Investment Bank,\nand Asset & Wealth Management \u2013 with the remaining\nactivities in Corporate.\n\nThe business segments are determined based on the\nproducts and services provided, or the type of\ncustomer served, and they reflect the manner in\nwhich financial information is evaluated by the\nFirm\u2019s Operating Committee, whose members act\ncollectively as the Firm\u2019s chief operating decision\nmaker. Segment results are presented on a managed\nbasis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of\nthe Firm\u2019s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on\npages 15-16 for a definition of managed basis.\n\nDescription of business segment reporting\nmethodology\n\nResults of the reportable business segments are\nintended to present each segment as if it were a\nstand-alone business. The management reporting\nprocess that derives business segment results\nincludes the allocation of certain income and\nexpense items. The Firm periodically assesses the\nassumptions, methodologies and reporting\nclassifications used for segment reporting, and\ntherefore further refinements may be implemented in\nfuture periods. The Firm also assesses the level of\ncapital required for each LOB on at least an annual\nbasis. The Firm\u2019s LOBs also provide various\nbusiness metrics which are utilized by the Firm and\nits investors and analysts in assessing\nperformance.\n\nRevenue sharing\n\nWhen business segments or businesses within each\nsegment join efforts to sell products and services\nto the Firm\u2019s clients and customers, the\nparticipating businesses may agree to share revenue\nfrom those transactions. Revenue is generally\nrecognized in the segment responsible for the\nrelated product or service, with allocations to the\nother segments or businesses involved in the\ntransaction. The segment and business results\nreflect these revenue-sharing agreements.\n\nFunds transfer pricing\n\nFunds transfer pricing (\u201cFTP\u201d) is the process by\nwhich the Firm allocates interest income and\nexpense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and\ntransfers the primary interest rate risk and\nliquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.\n\nThe funds transfer pricing process considers the\ninterest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of\nassets and liabilities and off-balance sheet\nproducts. Periodically, the methodology and\nassumptions utilized in the FTP process are\nadjusted to reflect economic conditions and other\nfactors, which may impact the allocation of net\ninterest income to the segments. Effective in the\nfourth quarter of 2024, the Firm updated its FTP\nwith respect to consumer deposits, which resulted\nin an increase in the funding benefit reflected\nwithin CCB\u2019s net interest income that is fully\noffset in Corporate, with no effect on the Firm\u2019s\nnet interest income.\n\nAs a result of lower average interest rates in the\ncurrent period, the cost of funding for assets and\nthe funding benefit earned for liabilities\ngenerally decreased compared with the prior year.\n\nForeign exchange risk\n\nForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs\nand Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain\nrevenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages\nthese risks centrally and reports the impact of\nforeign exchange rate movements related to the\ntransferred risk in its results. Refer to Market\nRisk Management on pages 65-70 for additional\ninformation.\n\nCapital allocation\n\nThe amount of capital assigned to each LOB and\nCorporate is referred to as equity. At least\nannually, the assumptions, judgments and\nmethodologies used to allocate capital are\nreassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated\nto the LOBs and Corporate may change. Refer to Line\nof business and Corporate equity on page 36, and\npage 104 of JPMorganChase\u2019s 2024 Form 10-K for\nadditional information on capital allocation.\n\nRefer to Business Segment & Corporate Results \u2013\nDescription of business segment reporting\nmethodology on pages 70\u201390 and Note 32 of\nJPMorganChase\u2019s 2024 Form 10-K for a further\ndiscussion of those

Net revenue was $18.3 billion, up 4%. Net interest\nincome was $14.1 billion, up 3%, driven by: \u2022 higher Card Services NII, predominantly driven by higher\nrevolving balances, partially offset by \u2022 lower NII in Banking & Wealth Management (\"BWM\"), driven by lower\naverage deposit balances. Noninterest revenue was $4.2 billion, up 6%, driven by: \u2022 higher auto operating\nlease income as a result of higher lease origination volume, and \u2022 higher asset management fees reflecting\nhigher average market levels, partially offset by \u2022 in BWM, the absence of other service fees associated\nwith First Republic recorded in the prior year, as well as \u2022 lower card income, driven by lower net\ninterchange and an increase in amortization related to new account origination costs, largely offset by\nhigher annual fees. The net interchange decreased as the impact of increased debit and credit card sales\nvolume was more than offset by higher rewards costs and partner payments. Refer to Note 5 for additional\ninformation on card income, asset management fees and commissions and other fees; and Critical Accounting\nEstimates on pages 72\u201375 for additional information on the credit card rewards liability. Noninterest\nexpense was $9.9 billion, up 6%, reflecting: \u2022 higher noncompensation expense, predominantly driven by\nmarketing, higher auto lease depreciation on higher auto lease assets, and higher operating losses, as well\nas \u2022 higher compensation expense, predominantly driven by an increase in the number of employees, primarily\nbankers and advisors and employees in technology, as well as higher revenue-related compensation for\nadvisors. The provision for credit losses was $2.6 billion. Net charge-offs were $2.2 billion, up $275\nmillion, predominantly in Card Services, reflecting the seasoning of vintages originated in recent years.\nThe net addition to the allowance for credit losses of $475 million was predominantly driven by changes in\nthe weighted-average macroeconomic outlook.\n                                                     19                                                     \nIn the prior year, the provision was $1.9 billion, net charge-offs were $1.9 billion and the net addition to\nthe allowance for credit losses was $34 million.

The net\naddition to the allowance for credit losses was\n$528 million and net charge-offs were $177 million.\n\nIn the prior year, the provision was $1 million,\nnet charge-offs were $69 million and

Revenue from Asset Management\nwas $2.7 billion, up 15%, predominantly driven by higher asset management fees reflecting strong net inflows\nand higher average market levels. Revenue from Global Private Bank was $3.1 billion, up 10%, driven by: \u2022\nhigher noninterest revenue as a result of: \u2013 higher management fees due to strong net inflows and higher\nbrokerage fees, partially offset by \u2013 a decline in the amortization of the fair value discount on certain\nacquired lending-related commitments associated with First Republic that have expired, and \u2022 higher net\ninterest income, largely driven by higher average deposits. Noninterest expense was $3.7 billion, up 7%,\nlargely driven by: \u2022 higher compensation, primarily revenue-related compensation and continued growth in\nprivate banking advisor teams, as well as \u2022 higher distribution fees. The provision for credit losses was a\nnet benefit of $10 million, compared with a net benefit of $57 million in the prior year. Refer to Note 5\nfor additional information on lending related fees.

Refer to Business Segment & Corporate Results\non page 17 for additional information on FTP. Noninterest revenue was $653 million, compared with a loss of\n$275 million in the prior year, driven by: \u2022 a $588 million First Republic-related gain, and \u2022 lower net\ninvestment securities losses compared to the prior year, which included sales of securities, primarily U.S.\nGSE and government agency MBS and U.S. Treasuries, associated with repositioning the investment securities\nportfolio in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the First Republic-related\ngain, and Note 9 and Note 12 for additional information on the investment securities portfolio and the\nallowance for credit losses.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $19 million.\nIn the prior year, the provision was $27 million. The current period income tax expense was predominantly\ndriven by changes in the level and mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal, state and local\ntaxes.

When the Firm extends a\nconsumer or wholesale loan, advises customers and\nclients on their investment decisions, makes\nmarkets in securities, or offers other products or\nservices, the Firm takes on some degree of risk.\nThe Firm\u2019s overall objective is to manage its\nbusiness, and the associated risks, in a manner\nthat balances serving the interests of its clients,\ncustomers and investors, and protecting the safety\nand soundness of the Firm. The Firm believes that\neffective risk management requires, among other\nthings: \u2022 Acceptance of responsibility, including\nidentification and escalation of risks by all\nindividuals within the Firm; \u2022 Ownership of risk\nidentification, assessment, data and management\nwithin each of the LOBs and Corporate; and \u2022 A\nFirmwide risk governance and oversight structure.\nThe Firm follows a disciplined and balanced\ncompensation framework with strong internal\ngovernance and independent oversight by the Board\nof Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d). The impact of risk and\ncontrol issues is carefully considered in the\nFirm\u2019s performance evaluation and incentive\ncompensation processes.

Under the\nrules currently in effect, two comprehensive\napproaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a\nstandardized approach (\u201cBasel III Standardized\u201d),\nand an advanced approach (\u201cBasel III Advanced\u201d).\n\nFor each of these risk-based capital ratios, the\ncapital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against\nthe lower of the Standardized or Advanced\napproaches compared to their respective regulatory\ncapital ratio requirements.\n\nAs of March 31, 2025, the Firm\u2019s Basel III\nStandardized risk-based ratios continue to be more\nbinding than the Basel III Advanced risk-based\nratios.\n\nAdditionally, Basel III requires that Advanced\nApproaches banking organizations, including the\nFirm, calculate their SLRs.\n\nRefer to page 36 of this Form 10-Q and page 104 of\nJPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K for additional\ninformation on SLR.\n\nKey Regulatory Developments\n\nIn April 2025, the Federal Reserve proposed changes\nto the calculation of the Stress Capital Buffer\n(\u201cSCB\u201d) for large bank holding companies, including\nthe Firm. The proposal aims to reduce SCB\nvolatility by using the average of supervisory\nstress results from the previous two annual stress\ntests to calculate the SCB. The proposal would also\nmodify the annual effective date of the SCB from\nOctober 1 to January 1 and make targeted changes to\nreporting requirements to streamline data\ncollection. The proposal would be effective January\n1, 2026.\n\nRefer to page 99 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K\nfor information on other Key Regulatory\nDevelopments.\n                                                     33                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Selected capital and RWA data                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \nThe following tables present the Firm\u2019s risk-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and\nAdvanced approaches and leverage-based capital metrics.

Under the LCR\nrule, the amount of eligible HQLA held by JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand-\nalone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not\ntransferable to non-bank affiliates, must be\nexcluded from the Firm\u2019s reported eligible HQLA.\nThe LCR for both the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. is required to be a minimum of 100%.

(d) Excludes average excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are\nnot transferable to non-bank affiliates.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s average LCR increased during the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared with the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2024, primarily driven by dividend payments from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the\nParent Company, predominantly offset by common stock repurchases and common stock dividends paid. JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A.\u2019s average LCR for the three months ended March 31, 2025 decreased compared with the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2024, due to dividend payments to the Parent Company and loan growth, largely offset\nby activities in CIB Markets, an increase in deposits and a reduction in non-HQLA securities. Each of the\nFirm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR may fluctuate from period to period due to changes in their\nrespective eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity and from\nthe impacts of Federal Reserve actions as well as other factors. Refer to page 109 of JPMorganChase\u2019s 2024\nForm 10-K and the Firm\u2019s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports for additional information on HQLA and net cash\noutflows. Internal stress testing The Firm conducts internal liquidity stress testing to monitor liquidity\npositions at the Firm and its material legal entities under a variety of adverse scenarios, including\nscenarios analyzed as part of the Firm\u2019s resolution and recovery planning. Internal stress tests are\nproduced on a daily basis, and other stress tests are performed in response to specific market events or\nconcerns. Results of stress tests are considered in the formulation of the Firm\u2019s funding plan and\nassessment of its liquidity position. The Firm manages liquidity at the Parent Company, the Intermediate\nHolding Company (\u201cIHC\u201d), and operating subsidiaries at levels sufficient to comply with liquidity risk\ntolerances and minimum liquidity requirements, and to manage through periods of stress when access to normal\nfunding sources may be disrupted.\n                                                     40                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n   Liquidity sources                                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \nIn addition to the assets reported in the Firm\u2019s\neligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had\nunencumbered marketable securities, such as equity\nand debt securities, that the Firm believes would\nbe available to raise liquidity. This includes\nexcess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank\naffiliates. The fair value of these securities was\napproximately $635 billion and $594 billion as of\nMarch 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively,\nalthough the amount of liquidity that could be\nraised at any particular time would be dependent on\nprevailing market conditions. The increase compared\nto December 31, 2024, was driven by an increase in\nunencumbered CIB trading assets, largely offset by\na decrease in excess eligible HQLA securities at\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\n\nThe Firm had approximately $1.5 trillion and $1.4\ntrillion of available cash and securities as of\nMarch 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.\nFor each respective period, the amount was\ncomprised of eligible end-of-period HQLA, excluding\nthe impact of regulatory haircuts, of approximately\n$881 billion and $834 billion, and unencumbered\nmarketable securities with a fair value of\napproximately $635 billion and $594 billion.\n\nThe Firm also had available borrowing capacity at\nthe Federal Home Loan Banks (\"FHLBs\") and the\ndiscount window at the Federal Reserve Banks as a\nresult of collateral pledged by the Firm to such\nbanks of approximately $408 billion and $413\nbillion as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024,\nrespectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the\nbenefit of cash and securities reported in the\nFirm\u2019s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered\nsecurities that are currently pledged at the\nFederal Reserve Banks discount window and other\ncentral banks. Although available, the Firm does\nnot view this borrowing capacity at the Federal\nReserve Banks discount window and the other central\nbanks as a primary source of liquidity.\n                                                                                                            \n  NSFR                                                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nThe net stable funding ratio (\u201cNSFR\u201d) is a\nliquidity requirement for large banking\norganizations that is intended to measure the\nadequacy of \u201cavailable\u201d stable funding that is\nsufficient to meet their \u201crequired\u201d amounts of\nstable funding over a one-year horizon.\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2025, both the\nFirm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were compliant\nwith the 100% minimum NSFR requirement, based on\nthe Firm's interpretation of the final NSFR rule.\nRefer to the Firm's U.S. NSFR Disclosure report for\nthe quarterly periods ended December 31, 2024 and\nSeptember 30, 2024 on the Firm\u2019s website for\nadditional information.\n                                                     41                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Funding                                                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Sources of funds                                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \nManagement believes that the Firm\u2019s unsecured and\nsecured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its\non- and off-balance sheet obligations, which\nincludes both short- and long-term cash\nrequirements.\n\nThe Firm funds its global balance sheet through\ndiverse sources of funding including deposits,\nsecured and unsecured funding in the capital\nmarkets and stockholders\u2019 equity. Deposits are the\nprimary funding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A.

A significant\nportion of the Firm\u2019s deposits are consumer\ndeposits and wholesale operating deposits, which\nare both considered to be stable sources of\nliquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are\ngenerally considered to be stable sources of\nliquidity because they are generated from customers\nthat maintain operating service relationships with\nthe Firm.\n\nThe Firm believes that average deposit balances are\ngenerally more representative of deposit trends\nthan period-end deposit balances. However, during\nperiods of market disruption, average deposit\ntrends may be impacted.\n\nAverage deposits increased for the three months\nended March 31, 2025 compared to the three months\nended March 31, 2024, reflecting the net impact of:\n\n\u2022 an increase in CIB due to net inflows related to\nclient-driven activities in Payments and Securities\nServices, partially offset by net maturities of\nstructured notes in Markets,\n\n\u2022 an increase in AWM as a result of growth in\nbalances in new and existing client accounts,\nreflecting the impact of higher-yielding product\nofferings, and\n\n\u2022 a decline in CCB primarily driven by a decrease\nin balances in existing accounts due to migration\ninto higher-yielding investments and increased\ncustomer spending, predominantly offset by new\naccounts.\n\nPeriod-end deposits increased from December 31,\n2024, reflecting the impact of:\n\n\u2022 an increase in CIB predominantly due to net\ninflows related to client-driven activities in\nSecurities Services and Payments,\n\n\u2022 an increase in CCB primarily driven by new\naccounts, and\n\n\u2022 an increase in AWM as a result of growth in\nbalances in new and existing client accounts,\nreflecting the impact of higher-yielding product\nofferings, predominantly offset by continued\nmigration into other investments.\n\nRefer to the Firm\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets\nAnalysis and the Business Segment & Corporate\nResults on pages 12-13 and pages 17-31,\nrespectively, for further information on deposit\nand liability balance trends. Refer to Note 3 for\nfurther information on structured notes.\n\nCertain deposits are covered by insurance\nprotection that provides additional funding\nstability and results in a benefit to the LCR.\nDeposit insurance protection may\n                                                     42                                                     \nbe available to depositors in the countries in\nwhich the deposits are placed.

These instruments are secured\npredominantly by high-quality securities\ncollateral, including government-issued debt and\nU.S. GSE and government agency MBS. Securities sold\nunder agreements to repurchase increased at March\n31, 2025, compared with December 31, 2024, driven\nby Markets, reflecting higher client-driven market-\nmaking activities, higher secured financing of\ntrading assets and the impact of lower levels of\nnetting, as well as when compared with seasonally\nlower levels at year-end.\n\nThe increase in secured other borrowed funds at\nMarch 31, 2025 from December 31, 2024 and for the\naverage three months ended March 31, 2025, compared\nto the prior year period, was due to higher\nfinancing requirements in Markets.\n\nThe balances associated with securities loaned or\nsold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over\ntime due to investment and financing activities of\nclients, the Firm\u2019s demand for financing, the\nongoing management of the mix of the Firm\u2019s\nliabilities, including its secured and unsecured\nfinancing (for both the investment securities and\nmarket-making portfolios), and other market and\nportfolio factors.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s primary sources of short-term unsecured\nfunding consist of issuances of wholesale\ncommercial paper and other borrowed funds.\n\nThe decrease in commercial paper at March 31, 2025\nfrom December 31, 2024 was primarily driven by\nstrategic short-term liquidity management.\n\nThe increase in unsecured other borrowed funds for\nthe average three months ended March 31, 2025,\ncompared to the prior year period, was primarily\ndriven by net issuances of structured notes in\nMarkets.\n                                                     44                                                     \nLong-term funding Long-term funding provides an\nadditional source of stable funding and liquidity\nfor the Firm. The Firm\u2019s long-term funding plan is\ndriven primarily by expected client activity,\nliquidity considerations and regulatory\nrequirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding\nobjectives include maintaining diversification,\nmaximizing market access and optimizing funding\ncosts. The Firm evaluates various funding markets,\ntenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-\nterm funding plan. Unsecured funding and issuance\nThe significant majority of the Firm\u2019s total\noutstanding long-term debt has been issued by the\nParent Company to provide flexibility in support of\nthe funding needs of both bank and non-bank\nsubsidiaries. The Parent Company advances\nsubstantially all net funding proceeds to its\nsubsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to\nexternal counterparties. The increase in structured\nnotes for the average three months ended March 31,\n2025, compared to the prior year period, was\nprimarily driven by net issuances of structured\nnotes in Markets due to client demand.

Residential real estate: The\nresidential real estate portfolio, including loans\nheld-for-sale and loans at fair value,\npredominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and\nhome equity lines of credit. Retained loans\ndecreased compared to December 31, 2024, driven by\npaydowns, net of originations. Net recoveries were\nhigher for the three months ended March 31, 2025\ncompared to the same period in the prior year,\ndriven by loan sales. Loans held-for-sale and\nnonaccrual loans held-for-sale decreased from\nDecember 31, 2024, predominantly driven by loan\nsales. Loans at fair value decreased compared to\nDecember 31, 2024, driven by lower Home Lending\nloans, as warehouse loan sales outpaced\noriginations, largely offset by an increase in CIB\nas purchases outpaced sales. Nonaccrual loans at\nfair value decreased compared to December 31, 2024,\npredominantly driven by loan sales in CIB. At March\n31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the carrying value\nof retained interest-only residential mortgage\nloans was $88.7 billion and $88.9 billion,\nrespectively. These loans have an interest-only\npayment period generally followed by an adjustable-\nrate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period\nto maturity and are typically originated as higher-\nbalance loans to higher-income borrowers. The\ncredit performance of this portfolio is comparable\nto the performance of the broader prime mortgage\nportfolio. The carrying value of retained home\nequity lines of credit outstanding was $13.9\nbillion at March 31, 2025, including $3.7 billion\nof HELOCs that have recast from interest-only to\nfully amortizing payments or have been modified,\nand $3.5 billion of interest-only balloon HELOCs,\nwhich primarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages\nthe risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by\nreducing or canceling the undrawn line in\naccordance with the contract or to the extent\notherwise permitted by law, including when there\nhas been a demonstrable decline in the\ncreditworthiness of the borrower or significant\ndecrease in the value of the underlying property.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the\nFirm\u2019s residential mortgage portfolio insured\nand/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies,\npredominantly loans held-for-sale and loans at fair\nvalue.

A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm\u2019s wholesale businesses is\ngenerally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it\noriginates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations\nand credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth\nreviews of client credit quality and transaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of\nindustry, product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 54-57 for further\ninformation. The Firm\u2019s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, AWM and Corporate, and\nrisk-rated exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the\nallowance for loan losses. As of March 31, 2025, loans increased $18.9 billion, predominantly driven by\nhigher loans in CIB Markets. Lending-related commitments increased $17.4 billion driven by higher\ncommitments in CIB.

derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.\n\n(c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile\nshown is based on the ratings of the reference entity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly\nall of the credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used in credit\nportfolio management activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties. In addition, the Firm\nobtains credit protection against certain loans in the retained loan portfolio through the issuance of\ncredit-related notes.\n\n(d) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is\ngenerally based on remaining contractual maturity. Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at\nMarch 31, 2025, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or changes in market\nconditions.\n                                                     53                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Wholesale credit exposure \u2013 industry exposures                                                            \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular\nattention to industries with actual or potential credit concerns.\n\nExposures that are deemed to be criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators\u2019 definition of criticized\nexposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized\nexposure, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $45.5 billion and $44.7 billion as of\nMarch 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, representing approximately 3.5% of total wholesale credit exposure as\nof both period ends; of the $45.5 billion, $40.7 billion was performing.\n\nThe table below summarizes by industry the Firm\u2019s exposures as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.

(including\nrevolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to\naddress the financing needs of its clients. The\ncontractual amounts of these financial instruments\nrepresent the maximum possible credit risk should\nthe clients draw down on these commitments or when\nthe Firm fulfills its obligations under these\nguarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to\nperform according to the terms of these contracts.\nMost of these commitments and guarantees have\nhistorically been refinanced, extended, cancelled,\nor expired without being drawn upon or a default\noccurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe\nthat the total contractual amount of these\nwholesale lending-related commitments is\nrepresentative of the Firm\u2019s expected future credit\nexposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 22\nfor further information on wholesale lending-\nrelated commitments.\n                                                                                                            \n  Receivables from customers                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nReceivables from customers reflect held-for-\ninvestment margin loans to brokerage clients in\nCIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets\nmaintained in the clients\u2019 brokerage accounts\n(including cash on deposit, and primarily liquid\nand readily marketable debt or equity securities).\nTo manage its credit risk, the Firm establishes\nmargin requirements and monitors the required\nmargin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires\nclients to deposit additional cash or other\ncollateral, or to reduce positions, when\nappropriate. Credit risk arising from lending\nactivities subject to collateral maintenance\nrequirements is generally mitigated by factors such\nas the short-term nature of the activity, the fair\nvalue of collateral held and the Firm\u2019s right to\ncall for, and the borrower\u2019s obligation to provide,\nadditional margin when the fair value of the\ncollateral declines. Because of these mitigating\nfactors, these receivables generally do not require\nan allowance for credit losses. However, if in\nmanagement\u2019s judgment, an allowance for credit\nlosses is required, the Firm estimates expected\ncredit losses based on the value of the collateral\nand probability of borrower default. These\nreceivables are reported within accrued interest\nand accounts receivable on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated\nbalance sheets.\n\nRefer to Note 13 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K\nfor further information on the Firm\u2019s accounting\npolicies for the allowance for credit losses.\n                                                                                                            \n  Derivative contracts                                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to\nmanage risk, including credit risk and risks\narising from fluctuations in interest rates,\nforeign exchange and equities and commodities\nprices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in\norder to meet these needs and uses derivatives to\nmanage certain risks associated with net open risk\npositions from its market-making activities,\nincluding the counterparty credit risk arising from\nderivative receivables. The Firm also uses\nderivative instruments to manage its own credit\nrisk and other market risk exposure. The nature of\nthe counterparty and the settlement mechanism of\nthe derivative affect the\n\ncredit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For over-\nthe-counter (\"OTC\") derivatives, the Firm is\nexposed to the credit risk of the derivative\ncounterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives\n(\u201cETD\u201d), such as futures and options, and cleared\nover-the-counter (\u201cOTC-cleared\u201d) derivatives, the\nFirm can also be exposed to the credit risk of the\nrelevant CCP. Where possible, the Firm seeks to\nmitigate its credit risk exposures arising from\nderivative contracts through the use of legally\nenforceable master netting arrangements and\ncollateral agreements. The percentage of the Firm\u2019s\nOTC derivative transactions subject to collateral\nagreements \u2014 excluding foreign exchange spot\ntrades, which are not typically covered by\ncollateral agreements due to their short maturity\nand centrally cleared trades that are settled daily\n\u2014 was approximately 85% and 86% at March 31, 2025\nand December 31, 2024, respectively. Refer to Note\n4 for additional information on the Firm\u2019s use of\ncollateral agreements and for a further discussion\nof derivative contracts, counterparties and\nsettlement types.\n\nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported\non the Consolidated balance sheets was $60.5\nbillion and $61.0 billion at March 31, 2025 and\nDecember 31, 2024, respectively. The decrease was\nprimarily as a result of market movements.\nDerivative receivables represent the fair value of\nthe derivative contracts after giving effect to\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements and\nthe related cash collateral held by the Firm.\n\nIn addition, the Firm holds liquid securities and\nother cash collateral that may be used as security\nwhen the fair value of the client\u2019s exposure is in\nthe Firm\u2019s favor. For these purposes, the\ndefinition of liquid securities is consistent with\nthe definition of high quality liquid assets as\ndefined in the LCR rule.\n\nIn management\u2019s view, the appropriate measure of\ncurrent credit risk should also take into\nconsideration other collateral, which generally\nrepresents securities that do not qualify as high\nquality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The\nbenefits of these additional collateral amounts for\neach counterparty are subject to a legally\nenforceable master netting agreement and limited to\nthe net amount of the derivative receivables for\neach counterparty.\n\nThe Firm also holds additional collateral\n(primarily cash, G7 government securities, other\nliquid government agency and guaranteed securities,\nand corporate debt and equity securities) delivered\nby clients at the initiation of transactions, as\nwell as collateral related to contracts that have a\nnon-daily call frequency and collateral that the\nFirm has agreed to return but has not yet settled\nas of the reporting date.

The Firm's allowance for credit losses\ngenerally consists of: \u2022 the allowance for loan\nlosses, which covers the Firm\u2019s retained loan\nportfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented\nseparately on the Consolidated balance sheets, \u2022\nthe allowance for lending-related commitments,\nwhich is reflected in accounts payable and other\nliabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, and\n\u2022 the allowance for credit losses on investment\nsecurities, which is reflected in investment\nsecurities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\nDiscussion of changes in the allowance The\nallowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2025\nwas $27.8 billion, reflecting a net addition of\n$1.0 billion from December 31, 2024. The net\naddition to the allowance for credit losses was\nlargely driven by changes in the weighted-average\nmacroeconomic outlook, including the qualitative\nadjustment to reflect additional weight placed on\nthe adverse scenarios due to elevated risks and\nuncertainties related to the geopolitical and\nmacroeconomic environment. The net addition to the\nallowance for credit losses included: \u2022 $562\nmillion in wholesale , which also reflected changes\nin credit quality on client-specific exposures and\nthe impact of new lending-related commitments, and\n\u2022 $441 million in consumer , predominantly driven\nby Card Services. The Firm's allowance for credit\nlosses is estimated using a weighted average of\nfive internally developed macroeconomic scenarios.\nThe adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive\nmacroeconomic factors than the central case\nassumptions provided in the following table,\nresulting in: \u2022 a weighted average U.S.\nunemployment rate peaking at 5.8% in the first\nquarter of 2026, and \u2022 a weighted average U.S. real\nGDP level that is 2.6% lower than the central case\nat the end of the second quarter of 2026.\n\nThe following table presents the Firm\u2019s central\ncase assumptions for the periods presented:\n                                                                                       \n                                    Central case assumptions                           \n                                           at March 31, 2025                           \n                                                        2Q25       4Q25       2Q26     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. unemployment rate(a)                              4.3  %     4.3  %     4.3  %  \n  YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                         2.5  %     2.2  %     2.0  %  \n                                    Central case assumptions                           \n                                        at December 31, 2024                           \n                                                        2Q25       4Q25       2Q26     \n  U.S. unemployment rate(a)                              4.5  %     4.3  %     4.3  %  \n  YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                         2.0  %     1.9  %     1.8  %  \n                                                                                       \n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S.\nunemployment rate.

The investment securities portfolio is\npredominantly held by Treasury and CIO in\nconnection with the Firm\u2019s balance sheet and asset-\nliability management objectives. Principal\ninvestments are predominantly privately-held\nfinancial instruments and are managed in the LOBs\nand Corporate. Investments are typically intended\nto be held over extended periods and, accordingly,\nthe Firm has no expectation for short-term realized\ngains with respect to these investments. Investment\nsecurities risk Investment securities risk includes\nthe exposure associated with a default in the\npayment of principal and interest. This risk is\nmitigated given that the investment securities\nportfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly\nconsists of high-quality securities. At March 31,\n2025, the Treasury and CIO investment securities\nportfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses,\nwas $661.4 billion, and the average credit rating\nof the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+\n(based upon external ratings where available, and\nwhere not available, based primarily upon internal\nrisk ratings). Refer to Corporate results on pages\n30-31 and Note 9 for further information on the\ninvestment securities portfolio and internal risk\nratings. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on\npages 40-46 for further information on related\nliquidity risk. Refer to Market Risk Management on\npages 65-70 for further information on the market\nrisk inherent in the portfolio.\n\nPrincipal investment risk Principal investments are\ntypically privately-held financial instruments\nrepresenting ownership interests or other forms of\njunior capital. In general, principal investments\ninclude tax-oriented investments and investments\nmade to enhance or accelerate the Firm\u2019s business\nstrategies and exclude those that are consolidated\non the Firm's balance sheets. These investments are\nmade by dedicated investing businesses or as part\nof a broader business strategy.

Refer to Market Risk\nManagement on pages 141\u2013149 of JPMorganChase\u2019s 2024\nForm 10-K for a discussion of the Firm\u2019s Market\nRisk Management organization, market risk\nmeasurement, risk monitoring and control, and\npredominant business activities that give rise to\nmarket risk.\n\nModels used to measure market risk are inherently\nimprecise and are limited in their ability to\nmeasure certain risks or to predict losses. This\nimprecision may be heightened when sudden or severe\nshifts in market conditions occur. For additional\ndiscussion on model uncertainty refer to\nEstimations and Model Risk Management on page 160\nof JPMorganChase\u2019s 2024 Form 10-K.\n\nMarket Risk Management periodically reviews the\nFirm\u2019s existing market risk measures to identify\nopportunities for enhancement, and to the extent\nappropriate, will calibrate those measures\naccordingly over time.\n\nValue-at-risk\n\nJPMorganChase utilizes value-at-risk (\u201cVaR\u201d), a\nstatistical risk measure, to estimate the potential\nloss from adverse market moves in the current\nmarket environment. The Firm has a single VaR\nframework used as a basis for calculating Risk\nManagement VaR and Regulatory VaR.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR is calculated\nassuming a one-day holding period and an expected\ntail-loss methodology which approximates a 95%\nconfidence level. For risk management purposes, the\nFirm believes this methodology provides a daily\nmeasure of risk that is closely aligned to risk\nmanagement decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate\nand, along with other market risk measures,\nprovides the appropriate information needed to\nrespond to risk events. The Firm calculates\nseparately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance\nwith regulatory rules (\u201cRegulatory VaR\u201d), which is\nused to derive the Firm\u2019s regulatory VaR-based\ncapital requirements under Basel III.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s VaR model calculations are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in response to changes in\nthe composition of the Firm\u2019s portfolios, changes\nin market conditions, improvements in the Firm\u2019s\nmodeling techniques and measurements, and other\nfactors. Such changes may affect historical\ncomparisons of VaR results. Refer to Estimations\nand Model Risk Management on page 160 of\nJPMorganChase\u2019s 2024 Form 10-K for information\nregarding model reviews and approvals.\n\nRefer to page 143 of JPMorganChase\u2019s 2024 Form 10-K\nfor further information regarding VaR, including\nits inherent limitations, and the key differences\nbetween Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.\nRefer to JPMorganChase\u2019s Basel III Pillar 3\nRegulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are\navailable on the Firm\u2019s website, for additional\ninformation on Regulatory VaR and the other\ncomponents of market risk regulatory capital for\nthe Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-\nbased measure and the respective backtesting).\nRefer to Other risk measures on pages 146\u2013149 of\nJPMorganChase\u2019s

The gains and losses depicted in the\nchart below do not reflect the Firm\u2019s reported revenue as they exclude certain components of total net\nrevenue, such as those associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven\ntrading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, other valuation adjustments and net\ninterest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or\nloss on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the\nrequirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.\n\nA backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the\nprior day. Under the Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are\nconsistent with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR\nbacktesting exceptions five times every 100 trading days on average. The number of VaR backtesting\nexceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the\ncurrent level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility during the 12\nmonths of historical data used in the VaR calculation.\n\nFor the 12 months ended March 31, 2025, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 172 of the 259 days, and\nobserved 11 VaR backtesting exceptions. For the three months ended March 31, 2025, the Firm posted\nbacktesting gains on 42 of the 63 days, and observed three VaR backtesting exceptions.\n\nThe following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the\ntrailing 12 months and three months ended March 31, 2025. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a\npercentage of the corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are\nshown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the\nintervals that are greater than one hundred percent.

Interest rate risk arises not only\nfrom trading activities which are included in VaR,\nbut also from the Firm\u2019s traditional banking\nactivities, which include extension of loans and\ncredit facilities, taking deposits, issuing debt,\nas well as the investment securities portfolio, and\nassociated derivative instruments.\n\nRefer to the table on page 142 of JPMorganChase\u2019s\n2024 Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and Corporate\nidentifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.\n                                                                                                            \n  Earnings-at-risk                                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \nOne way that the Firm evaluates its structural\ninterest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk.\nEarnings-at-risk estimates the Firm\u2019s interest rate\nexposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is\npresented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which\nincludes net interest income and certain interest\nrate sensitive fees. The baseline uses market\ninterest rates and, in the case of deposits,\npricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations\nof changes to this baseline for interest rate-\nsensitive assets and liabilities denominated in\nU.S. dollars and other currencies (\u201cnon-U.S.\ndollar\u201d currencies). These simulations primarily\ninclude retained and held-for-sale loans, deposits,\ndeposits with banks and financing activities,\ninvestment securities, long-term debt, related\ninterest rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of\nother positions in risk management VaR and other\nsensitivity-based measures as described on page 142\nof JPMorganChase\u2019s 2024 Form 10-K. These\nsimulations also include hedges of non-U.S. dollar\nforeign exchange exposures arising from capital\ninvestments. Refer to non-U.S. dollar foreign\nexchange risk on page 149 of JPMorganChase\u2019s 2024\nForm 10-K for more information.\n\nEarnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential\nchange to a baseline, over the following 12 months\nutilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios\ninclude a parallel shift involving changes to both\nshort-term and long-term rates by an equal amount;\na steeper yield curve involving holding short-term\nrates constant and increasing long-term rates; and\na flatter yield curve involving increasing short-\nterm rates and holding long-term rates constant or\nholding short-term rates constant and decreasing\nlong-term rates. These scenarios consider many\ndifferent factors, including:\n\n\u2022 The impact on exposures as a result of\ninstantaneous changes in interest rates from\nbaseline rates.\n\n\u2022 Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled\nprepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding\nassumptions about actions that could be taken by\nthe Firm or its clients and customers in response\nto instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment\nassumptions are based on the interest rates used in\nthe scenarios compared with underlying contractual\nrates, the time since origination, and other\nfactors which are updated periodically based on\nhistorical experience. Deposit forecasts are a key\nassumption in the Firm\u2019s earnings-at-risk. The\nbaseline reflects certain assumptions relating to\nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet policy (e.g.,\nquantitative tightening and usage at the Reverse\nRepurchase Facility) that require management\njudgment. The amount of deposits that the Firm\nholds at any given time may be influenced by\nFederal Reserve actions, as well as broader\nmonetary conditions and competition for deposits.\n\n\u2022 The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as\ndeposit betas, represent the amount by which\ndeposit rates paid could change upon a given change\nin market interest rates. Actual deposit rates paid\nmay differ from the modeled assumptions, primarily\ndue to customer behavior and competition for\ndeposits.\n\nThe Firm performs sensitivity analyses of the\nassumptions used in earnings-at-risk scenarios,\nincluding with respect to deposit betas and\nforecasts of deposit balances, both of which are\nespecially significant in the case of consumer\ndeposits. The results of these sensitivity analyses\nare reported to the CTC Risk Committee and the\nBoard Risk Committee.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s earnings-at-risk scenarios are\nperiodically evaluated and enhanced in response to\nchanges in the composition of the Firm\u2019s balance\nsheet, changes in market conditions, improvements\nin the Firm\u2019s simulation and other factors.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s earnings-at-risk sensitivities are\nmeasures of the Firm\u2019s interest rate exposure. The\nFirm\u2019s actual net interest income for the rate\nchanges presented may differ as the earnings-at-\nrisk scenarios are modelled as instantaneous\nchanges and exclude any actions that could be taken\nby the Firm or its clients or customers in response\nto rate changes. Other significant assumptions in\nthe earnings-at-risk scenarios, including mortgage\nprepayments and deposit rates paid, may also differ\nfrom actual results.

Non-U.S. dollar sensitivities were insignificant. The change in the Firm\u2019s\nsensitivities as of March 31, 2025 compared to December 31, 2024, were primarily driven by the net impact of\nTreasury and CIO actions, partially offset by the impact of changes in Firmwide deposits and loans,\nprimarily in balances. Treasury and CIO actions consisted of an increase in cash flow hedges of floating\nrate retained loans which added duration, partially offset by securities activity.\n\nEconomic value sensitivity In addition to earnings-at-risk, which is measured as a sensitivity to a baseline\nof earnings over the next 12 months, the Firm also measures economic value sensitivity (\u201cEVS\u201d). EVS stress\ntests the longer-term economic value of equity by measuring the sensitivity of the Firm\u2019s current balance\nsheet, primarily retained loans, deposits, debt and investment securities as well as related hedges, under\nvarious interest rate scenarios. The Firm's pricing and cash flow assumptions associated with deposits, as\nwell as prepayment assumptions for loans and securities, are significant factors in the EVS measure. In\naccordance with the CTC interest rate risk management policy, the Firm has established limits on EVS as a\npercentage of TCE. Certain assumptions used in the EVS measure may differ from those required in the fair\nvalue measurement note to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For example, certain assets and liabilities\nwith no stated maturity, such as credit card receivables and deposits, have longer assumed durations in the\nEVS measure. Additional information on long-term debt and held to maturity investment securities is\ndisclosed on page 95 in Note 2.\n                                                     69                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Other sensitivity-based measures                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by\nassessing the potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (\u201cOCI\u201d) and noninterest expense\ndue to changes in relevant market variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to\nmarket risk on page 142 of JPMorganChase\u2019s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on the positions\ncaptured in other sensitivity-based measures.\n\nThe table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-\nsensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used\nfor hedging purposes are reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the\ntable below may not be representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at March 31,\n2025 and December 31, 2024, as the movement in market

The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various\nportfolios which may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the Firm\u2019s exposures\nare diversified given the Firm\u2019s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country. Refer to pages 150\u2013151\nof JPMorganChase\u2019s 2024 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm\u2019s country risk management. Risk\nReporting The following table presents the Firm\u2019s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of\nMarch 31, 2025 and their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2024. The top 20 country exposures\nrepresent the Firm\u2019s largest total exposures by individual country. Country exposures may fluctuate from\nperiod to period due to a variety of factors, including client activity, market flows and liquidity\nmanagement activities undertaken by the Firm. The decrease in exposure to Japan when compared to December\n31, 2024 was predominantly driven by a reduction in cash placed with the central bank of Japan as a result\nof client-driven market-making activities. The Firm continues to monitor its exposure to Russia, which\ncorresponds to cash placed with the central bank, but which excludes deposits placed on behalf of clients at\nthe Deposit Insurance Agency of Russia. The Firm currently believes that its remaining exposure to Russia is\nnot material.

Refer to Note 10 and Note\n13 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K for further\ninformation on these judgments as well as the\nFirm\u2019s policies and methodologies used to determine\nthe Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses, and\nAllowance for credit losses on pages 61-63 and Note\n12 of this Form 10-Q for further information.\n\nOne of the most significant judgments involved in\nestimating the Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses\nrelates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to\nestimate credit losses over the eight-quarter\nforecast period within the Firm\u2019s methodology. The\neight-\n\nquarter forecast incorporates hundreds of\nmacroeconomic variables (\"MEVs\") that are relevant\nfor exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit\nlosses being driven primarily by a subset of less\nthan twenty variables. The specific variables that\nhave the greatest effect on the modeled losses vary\nby portfolio and geography.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include\nregional U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. HPI.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S.\nunemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices,\nU.S. interest rates, U.S. corporate credit spreads,\noil prices, U.S. commercial real estate prices and\nU.S. HPI.\n\nChanges in the Firm\u2019s assumptions and forecasts of\neconomic conditions could significantly affect its\nestimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio\nat the balance sheet date or lead to significant\nchanges in the estimate from one reporting period\nto the next.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes\nin any one factor or input might affect the overall\nallowance for credit losses because management\nconsiders a wide variety of factors and inputs in\nestimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes\nin the factors and inputs considered may not occur\nat the same rate and may not be consistent across\nall geographies or product types, and changes in\nfactors and inputs may be directionally\ninconsistent, such that improvement in one factor\nor input may offset deterioration in others.\n\nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate\nmacroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the\nmodeled credit losses determined using its central\nand relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which\nare two of the five scenarios considered in\nestimating the allowances for loan losses and\nlending-related commitments. The central and\nrelative adverse scenarios each included a full\nsuite of MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths\nand peaks/troughs of those variables over the\neight-quarter forecast period.\n\nFor example, compared to the Firm\u2019s central\nscenario shown on page 61 and in Note 12, the\nFirm\u2019s relative adverse scenario assumes an\nelevated U.S. unemployment rate, averaging\napproximately 2.1% higher over the eight-quarter\nforecast, with a peak difference of approximately\n2.9% in the first quarter of 2026.\n\nThis analysis is not intended to estimate expected\nfuture changes in the allowance for credit losses,\nfor a number of reasons, including:\n\n\u2022 The allowance as of March 31, 2025, reflects\ncredit losses beyond those estimated under the\ncentral scenario due to the weight placed on the\nadverse scenarios.\n                                                     72                                                     \n\u2022 The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both\ninterrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this\nanalysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more\nsevere changes in macroeconomic variables. \u2022\nExpectations of future changes in portfolio\ncomposition and borrower behavior can significantly\naffect the allowance for credit losses. To\ndemonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss\nestimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of March\n31, 2025, the Firm compared the modeled estimates\nunder its relative adverse scenario to its central\nscenario. Without considering offsetting or\ncorrelated effects in other qualitative components\nof the Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses, the\ncomparison between these two scenarios for the\nexposures below reflect the following differences:\n\u2022 An increase of approximately $1.0 billion for\nresidential real estate loans and lending-related\ncommitments \u2022 An increase of approximately $3.7\nbillion for credit card loans \u2022 An increase of\napproximately $4.6 billion for wholesale loans and\nlending-related commitments This analysis relates\nonly to the modeled credit loss estimates and is\nnot intended to estimate changes in the overall\nallowance for credit losses as it does not reflect\nany potential changes in other adjustments to the\nquantitative calculation, which would also be\ninfluenced by the judgment management applies to\nthe modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the\nuncertainty and imprecision of these modeled\nlifetime loss estimates based on then-current\ncircumstances and conditions. Recognizing that\nforecasts of macroeconomic conditions are\ninherently uncertain, the Firm believes that its\nprocess to consider the available information and\nassociated risks and uncertainties is appropriately\ngoverned and that its estimates of expected credit\nlosses were reasonable and appropriate for the\nperiod ended March 31, 2025.\n\nFair value JPMorganChase carries a portion of its\nassets and liabilities at fair value. The majority\nof such assets and liabilities are measured at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis, including trading\nassets and liabilities, AFS securities, structured\nnote products and certain securities financing\nagreements. Certain assets and liabilities are\nmeasured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis,\nincluding certain mortgage, home equity and other\nloans, where the carrying value is based on the\nfair value of the underlying collateral.

The level 3 balances would be reduced if\nnetting were applied, including the netting benefit\nassociated with cash collateral.\n                                                     73                                                     \nValuation\nDetails of the Firm\u2019s processes for determining\nfair value are set out in Note 2. Estimating fair\nvalue requires the application of judgment. The\ntype and level of judgment required is largely\ndependent on the amount of observable market\ninformation available to the Firm. For instruments\nvalued using internally developed valuation models\nand other valuation techniques that use significant\nunobservable inputs and are therefore classified\nwithin level 3 of the fair value hierarchy,\njudgments used to estimate fair value are more\nsignificant than those required when estimating the\nfair value of instruments classified within levels\n1 and 2.\n\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an\ninstrument within level 3, management must first\ndetermine the appropriate valuation model or other\nvaluation technique to use. Second, the lack of\nobservability of certain significant inputs\nrequires management to assess relevant empirical\ndata in deriving valuation inputs including, for\nexample, transaction details, yield curves,\ninterest rates, prepayment speeds, default rates,\nvolatilities, correlations, prices (such as\ncommodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of\ncomparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and\ncredit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further\ndiscussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments,\nincluding unobservable inputs used.\n\nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3,\nmanagement judgment must be applied to assess the\nappropriate level of valuation adjustments to\nreflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm\u2019s\ncreditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity\nconsiderations, unobservable parameters, and for\nportfolios that meet specified criteria, the size\nof the net open risk position. The judgments made\nare typically affected by the type of product and\nits specific contractual terms, and the level of\nliquidity for the product or within the market as a\nwhole. In periods of heightened market volatility\nand uncertainty judgments are further affected by\nthe wider variation of reasonable valuation\nestimates, particularly for positions that are less\nliquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of\nvaluation adjustments applied by the Firm.\n\nImprecision in estimating unobservable market\ninputs or other factors can affect the amount of\ngain or loss recorded for a particular position.\nFurthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation\nmethods are appropriate and consistent with those\nof other market participants, the methods and\nassumptions used reflect management judgment and\nmay vary across the Firm\u2019s businesses and\nportfolios.\n\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions\nin the determination of fair value. The use of\nmethodologies or assumptions different than those\nused by the Firm could result in a different\nestimate of fair value at the reporting date.

(\u201cJPMorganChase\u201d or the\n\u201cFirm\u201d), a financial holding company incorporated\nunder Delaware law in 1968, is a leading financial\nservices firm based in the U.S., with operations\nworldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment\nbanking, financial services for consumers and small\nbusinesses, commercial banking, financial\ntransaction processing and asset management. Refer\nto Note 25 for further discussion of the Firm's\nreportable business segments. The accounting and\nfinancial reporting policies of JPMorganChase and\nits subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP.\nAdditionally, where applicable, the policies\nconform to the accounting and reporting guidelines\nprescribed by regulatory authorities. The\npreparation of the unaudited Consolidated Financial\nStatements requires management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and\ndisclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.\nActual results could be different from these\nestimates. In the opinion of management, all\nnormal, recurring adjustments have been included\nsuch that this interim financial information is\nfairly stated. These unaudited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements should be read in conjunction\nwith the audited Consolidated Financial Statements\nand related notes thereto included in\nJPMorganChase\u2019s 2024 Form 10-K. Consolidation The\nConsolidated Financial Statements include the\naccounts of JPMorganChase and other entities in\nwhich the Firm has a controlling financial\ninterest. All material intercompany balances and\ntransactions have been eliminated. Assets held for\nclients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the\nFirm are not assets of JPMorganChase and are not\nincluded on the Consolidated balance sheets. The\nFirm determines whether it has a controlling\nfinancial interest in an entity by first evaluating\nwhether the entity is a voting interest entity or a\nvariable interest entity. Refer to Notes 1 and 14\nof JPMorganChase\u2019s 2024 Form 10-K for a further\ndescription of JPMorganChase\u2019s accounting policies\nregarding consolidation.\n\nOffsetting assets and liabilities\n\nU.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative\nreceivables and derivative payables with the same\ncounterparty and the related cash collateral\nreceivables and payables on a net basis on the\nConsolidated balance sheets when a legally\nenforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S.\nGAAP also permits securities sold and purchased\nunder repurchase agreements and securities borrowed\nor loaned under securities loan agreements to be\npresented net when specified conditions are met,\nincluding the existence of a legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreement. The Firm has elected to\nnet such balances where it has determined that the\nspecified conditions are met. Refer to Note 1 of\nJPMorganChase\u2019s 2024 Form 10-K for further\ninformation on offsetting assets and liabilities.\n                                                     83

\u201cNet realizable value\u201d is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell\n(\u201ctransaction costs\u201d). Transaction costs for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories are either not\napplicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair\nvalue for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net\nrealizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because\nunder fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in\n                                                     86                                                     \nfair value. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of the Firm\u2019s hedge accounting relationships. To\nprovide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been\nincluded in each period presented.\n\n(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical\nsecurities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).\n\n(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its\nequivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At March\n31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds,\nprivate equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $ 1.1billion and $ 1.0billion, respectively,\nprimarily reported in other assets.\n\n(e) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables\nand the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement\nexists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit\nassociated with cash collateral.\n\nLevel 3 valuations\n\nRefer to Note 2 of JPMorganChase\u2019s 2024 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm\u2019s valuation process\nand a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. The\nfollowing table presents the Firm\u2019s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to\nmeasure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of\nvalues for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to\nclassify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall\nfair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is,\ncomponents that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the\nunobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the\nFirm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and\nderivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of\nvalues presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the\nsignificant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted\naverages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the\ninstruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm\u2019s view, the input range, weighted and\narithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the\nreasonableness of the Firm\u2019s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the\nvarious instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of\ncharacteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and\nvaluation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option\ncontracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted and arithmetic\naverage values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the\ncharacteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.\n                                                     87                                                     \n

their classification on the Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each\nvaluation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the\ntechnique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ.\n\n(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $ 390million, nonagency securities of $ 5million\nand non-trading loans of $ 451million.\n\n(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $ 15million, trading loans of $ 66million and non-trading loans of $\n1.3billion.\n\n(d) Comprises trading loans of $ 737million and non-trading loans of $ 605million.\n\n(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are\nfinancial instruments that typically contain embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of\nstructured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant\nunobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.\n\n(f) Includes equity securities of $ 764million including $ 631million in Other assets, for which quoted\nprices are not readily available and the fair value is generally based on internal valuation techniques such\nas EBITDA multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant both\nindividually and in aggregate.\n\n(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not\nreadily available, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal valuation techniques. The price\ninput is expressed assuming a par value of $ 100.\n\n(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.\n\n(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are\nused.\n                                                     88                                                     \nChanges in and ranges of unobservable inputs Refer to Note 2 of JPMorganChase\u2019s 2024 Form 10-K for a\ndiscussion of the impact on fair value of changes in unobservable inputs and the relationships between\nunobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market\nfactors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm\u2019s positions. Changes in level 3\nrecurring fair value measurements The following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance\nsheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within\nlevel 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. When a determination\nis made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of\nthe unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments\ntypically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is,\ncomponents that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and\nlosses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of\nthe valuation methodology. The Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments\nusing securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value\nhierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or\nlosses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm\u2019s risk management activities

Refer to the sections below for\nadditional information. Transfers between levels\nfor instruments carried at fair value on a\nrecurring basis For the three months ended March\n31, 2025 and 2024, there were no significant\ntransfers from level 2 into level 3 or from level 3\ninto level 2. All transfers are based on changes in\nthe observability and/or significance of the\nvaluation inputs and are assumed to occur at the\nbeginning of the quarterly reporting period in\nwhich they occur.

The conversion rate of Visa B-2 shares to Visa A shares was 1.5342at March 31, 2025\nand may be adjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the litigation matters. The outcome of\nthose litigation matters, and the effect that the resolution of those matters may have on the conversion\nrate, is unknown. Accordingly, as of March 31, 2025, there is significant uncertainty regarding when the\ntransfer restrictions on Visa B-2 shares may be terminated and what the final conversion rate for the Visa\nB-2 shares will be. As a result of these considerations, as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B-2\nshares are not considered to be similar to Visa A shares, and are held at their nominal carryover basis.\n\nSeparately, in connection with sales of Visa B shares prior to 2024, the Firm has entered into derivative\ninstruments with the purchasers of the shares under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes\nin the conversion rate. As of March 31, 2025, the Firm held derivative instruments associated with\n11.6million Visa B-2 shares related to Visa B share sales prior to 2024, which are all subject to similar\nterms and conditions.

incorporates the\ncharacteristics of the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual\nfees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and\nprimary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the\nvalue of the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan\u2019s allowance for\nloan losses, which represents the loan\u2019s expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The\ndifference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to\nchanges in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that\naffect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value.\n(b) Excludes lending-related commitments disclosed in the table below.\nThe majority of the Firm\u2019s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets.

applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-\nterm beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests,\nfor which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-protected\nstructured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of\nprincipal at maturity, but for structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an\nunderlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit\nrisk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.\n(e) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the\ncontractual principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm\u2019s\nnext call date.\nAt March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the\nfair value option was elected was $ 12.3billion and $ 12.2billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair\nvalue of $ 3million and $ 50million, respectively.

Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due\nto changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded\nprimarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.\n(d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at\nthe lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses\nwere recorded in principal transactions revenue.\n(e) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the\nderivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and\ncross-currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through amortization of the\ninitial amount over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current\nperiod.\n(f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the\namortization approach, predominantly cross-currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the\nhedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative.\n                                                    106                                                     \nAs of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated balance\nsheets related to certain cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that are expected to reverse through\nthe income statement in future periods as an adjustment to yield.\n                                                                                                            \n                                                                     Cumulative                             \n                                                                 amount of fair                             \n                                                                  value hedging                             \n                                                                    adjustments                             \n                                                                included in the                             \n                                                                carrying amount                             \n                                                                      of hedged                             \n                       Carrying amount                                   items:                             \n                                of the                             Discontinued                             \n  March 31, 2025                hedged    Active hedging                hedging                             \n  (in millions)            items(a)(b)    relationships(\u2026       relationships(\u2026        Total                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Assets                                                                                                    \n  Investment                                                                                                \n  securities -

the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period,\nweighted based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon,\namortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives,\nincluding closed portfolio hedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield\nexcludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from\ntheir contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable\ndebt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.\n(b) For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the allowance\nfor credit losses of $ 36million and the portfolio layer fair value hedge basis adjustments of $ 463million\nat March 31, 2025. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities also excludes the allowance for credit\nlosses of $ 82million at March 31, 2025.\n(c) Substantially all of the Firm\u2019s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in\n10years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects\nanticipated future prepayments, is approximately eight yearsfor agency residential MBS, six yearsfor agency\nresidential collateralized mortgage obligations, and five yearsfor nonagency residential collateralized\nmortgage obligations.\n                                                    120                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Note 10 \u2013 Securities financing activities                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \nRefer to Note 11 of JPMorganChase\u2019s 2024 Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting policies relating to\nsecurities financing activities.

The table below\nsummarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm\u2019s securities financing agreements as of March 31, 2025 and\nDecember 31, 2024. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting\nagreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm\nnets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements\nwith the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its\ncounterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for\nnet Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with\nrespect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with securities financing\nbalances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table\nbelow as \u201cAmounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,\u201d and reduces the \u201cNet amounts\u201d presented.\nWhere a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are\npresented gross in the \u201cNet amounts\u201d below. In transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a\nsecurities-for-securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as\ncollateral, the Firm recognizes the securities received at fair value within other assets and the obligation\nto return those securities within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n

The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses. Revolving\nloans that have been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within\nthe revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for\nthose products is higher than the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving\nperiod.\n                                                    126                                                     \nNonaccrual loans and other credit quality indicators\n\nThe following table provides information on nonaccrual and other credit quality indicators for retained\nresidential real estate loans.\n                                                                                               \n  (in millions, except weighted-average                                                        \n  data)                                          March 31, 2025          December 31, 2024     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Nonaccrual loans(a)(b)(c)(d)                $           3,092       $              2,984     \n  Current estimated LTV ratios(e)(f)(g)                                                        \n  Greater than 125% and refreshed FICO                                                         \n  scores:                                                                                      \n  Equal to or greater than 660                $              61       $                 72     \n  Less than 660                                               3                          3     \n  101% to 125% and refreshed FICO scores:                                                      \n  Equal to or greater than 660                              163                        161     \n  Less than 660                                               5                          5     \n  80% to 100% and refreshed FICO scores:                                                       \n  Equal to or greater than 660                            3,819                      4,962     \n  Less than 660                                              55                         73     \n  Less than 80% and refreshed FICO scores:                                                     \n  Equal to or greater than 660                          293,281                    294,797     \n  Less than 660                                           8,504                      8,534     \n  No FICO/LTV available(h)                                  632                        906     \n  Total retained loans                        $         306,523       $            309,513     \n  Weighted-average LTV ratio(e)(i)                           46  %                      47  %  \n  Weighted-average FICO(f)(i)                               774                        774     \n  Geographic region(h)(j)                                                                      \n  California                                  $         119,614       $            120,944     \n  New York                                               46,478                     46,854     \n  Florida                                                21,730                     21,820     \n  Texas                                                  14,402                     14,531     \n  Massachusetts                                          13,345                     13,511     \n  Colorado                                               10,437                     10,465     \n  Illinois                                                9,624                      9,835     \n  Washington                                              9,304                      9,372     \n  New Jersey                                              7,448                      7,554     \n  Connecticut                                             6,796                      6,854     \n  All other                                              47,345                     47,773     \n  Total retained loans                        $         306,523       $            309,513     \n                                                                                               \n(a) I ncludes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of\nthe underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance,\nresidential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the\nborrower (\u201cChapter 7 loans\u201d) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual loans, regardless of their delinquency\nstatus. At March 31, 2025, approximately 9% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more\npast due.\n\n(b) Mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies excluded from nonaccrual loans were not material at\nMarch 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\n\n(c) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance,\ncertain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of\namortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the\nunderlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.\n\n(d) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $ 37million and $ 43million for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n\n(e) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property\nvalue. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using\nnationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available\nand forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home\nequity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.\n\n(f) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower\u2019s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm\non at least a quarterly basis.\n\n(g) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO\nscore. These loans have been included in a FICO band based on management\u2019s estimation of the borrower\u2019s\ncredit quality.\n\n(h) Included U.S. government-guaranteed loans as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\n\n(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.\n\n(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding\nloan balances at March 31, 2025.\n                                                    127                                                     \nLoan modifications\n\nThe Firm grants certain modifications of\nresidential real estate loans to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty.

Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance,\ncertain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of\namortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the\nunderlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.\n\n(b) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the three months\nended March 31, 2025 and 2024 .\n\n(c) The geographic regions presented in this table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding\nloan balances at March 31, 2025.\n\nLoan modifications The Firm grants certain modifications of auto and other loans to borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty.

modifications\n\nThe Firm grants certain modifications of credit card loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.\nThese modifications may involve placing the customer\u2019s credit card account on a fixed payment plan,\ngenerally for 60months, which typically includes reducing the interest rate on the credit card account. If\nthe borrower does not make the contractual payments when due under the modified payment terms, the credit\ncard loan continues to age and will be charged-off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy.\nIn most cases, the Firm does not reinstate the borrower's line of credit.\n\nFinancial effects of FDMs\nThe following tables provide information on retained credit card FDMs.\n

accounts receivable in CIB.\n(b) Includes collateral-dependent loans, including those for which foreclosure is deemed probable, and\nnonaccrual risk-rated loans.\n(c) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets.\n(d) At March 31, 2025 and 2024, lending-related commitments excluded $ 20.3billion and $ 17.7billion,\nrespectively, for the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment; $ 1.0trillion and $ 943.9billion,\nrespectively, for the credit card portfolio segment; and $ 26.3billion and $

                                              \nDiscussion of changes in the allowance The allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2025 was $\n27.8billion, reflecting a net addition of $ 1.0billion from December 31, 2024. The net addition to the\nallowance for credit losses was largely driven by changes in the weighted-average macroeconomic outlook,\nincluding the qualitative adjustment to reflect additional weight placed on the adverse scenarios due to\nelevated risks and uncertainties related to the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment. The net addition\nto the allowance for credit losses included: \u2022 $ 562million in wholesale , which also reflected changes in\ncredit quality on client-specific exposures and the impact of new lending-related commitments, and \u2022 $\n441million in consumer , predominantly driven by Card Services. The Firm's allowance for credit losses is\nestimated using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse\nscenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the\nfollowing table, resulting in: \u2022 a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.8% in the first\nquarter of 2026, and \u2022 a weighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 2.6% lower than the central case at\nthe end of the second quarter of 2026.\nThe following table presents the Firm\u2019s central\ncase assumptions for the periods presented:\n                                                                                       \n                                    Central case assumptions                           \n                                           at March 31, 2025                           \n                                                        2Q25       4Q25       2Q26     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. unemployment rate(a)                              4.3  %     4.3  %     4.3  %  \n  YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                         2.5  %     2.2  %     2.0  %  \n                                    Central case assumptions                           \n                                        at December 31, 2024                           \n                                                        2Q25       4Q25       2Q26     \n  U.S. unemployment rate(a)                              4.5  %     4.3  %     4.3  %  \n  YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                         2.0  %     1.9  %     1.8  %  \n                                                                                       \n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S.\nunemployment rate.\n(b) The year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in\nthe forecast horizon of the central scenario is\ncalculated as the percentage change in U.S. real\nGDP levels from the prior year.

The assets and liabilities include third-party assets and liabilities of\nconsolidated VIEs and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.\n(e) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified on the\nConsolidated balance sheets as \u201cBeneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs\u201d. The holders of these\nbeneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorganChase. Included in\nbeneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $ 5.5billion at both March 31, 2025\nand December 31, 2024.\n(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance\nsheets.\nVIEs sponsored by third parties The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties.\nThese include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter,\nplacement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm\u2019s-length,\nand individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the\nquality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE\nthat most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially\nbe significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions\non its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any\nother third-party transaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit\nvehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing,\nalternative energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is\ntypically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax\ncredit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally\ninvests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax\ncredits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding\ncommitments, was $ 34.3billion and $ 35.2billion at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, of which $\n13.9billion and $ 15.0billion was unfunded at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. The Firm\nassesses each project and to reduce the risk\n                                                    145                                                     \nof loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits.\nRefer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.\nThe Firm elected the proportional amortization method for certain tax-oriented investments on a program-by-\nprogram basis. The proportional amortization method requires the cost of eligible investments, within an\nelected program, be amortized in proportion to the tax benefits received with the resulting amortization\nreported directly in income tax expense, which aligns with the associated tax credits and other tax\nbenefits. Investments must meet certain criteria to be eligible, including that substantially all of the\nreturn is from income tax credits and other income tax benefits. In addition, under this method deferred\ntaxes are generally not recorded as the investment is now amortized in proportion to the income tax credits\nand other income tax benefits received. Delayed equity contributions that are unconditional and legally\nbinding or conditional and probable of occurring are recorded in other liabilities with a corresponding\nincrease in the carrying value of the investment. The guidance also requires a reevaluation of eligible\ninvestments when significant modifications or events occur that result in a change in the nature of the\ninvestment or a change in the Firm's relationship with the underlying project. During the period, there were\nno significant modifications or events that resulted in a change in the nature of an eligible investment or\na change in the Firm's relationship with the underlying project.\nThe following table provides information on tax-\noriented investments for which the Firm elected to\napply the proportional amortization method.\n                                                                                                            \n  (in millions)                                                                                             \n  Three months ended March 31,                                                                              \n  Programs for which the Firm elected                   Alternative energy and affordable                   \n  proportional amortization:                   2025                      housing programs  2024             \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Carrying value(a)                                  $                             31,540        $  29,821  \n  Tax credits and other tax benefits(b)                                             1,358            1,266  \n  Investments that qualify to be accounted                                                                  \n  for using proportional amortization:                                                                      \n  Amortization losses recognized as a                                                -983           -1,016  \n  component of income tax expense                                                                           \n  Non-income-tax-related gains/(losses)                                                                     \n  and other returns received that are                                                  31               48  \n  recognized outside of income tax                                                                          \n  expense(c)                                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n(a) Recorded in Other assets on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets.

Refer to Note 15 of JPMorganChase\u2019s 2024 Form 10-K for a further discussion of\nthe Firm\u2019s goodwill impairment testing. Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit\nlosses, increases in capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions,\nadverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause\nthe estimated fair values of the Firm\u2019s reporting units to decline in the future, which could result in a\nmaterial impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated\ngoodwill. As of March 31, 2025, the Firm reviewed current economic conditions, estimated market cost of\nequity, as well as actual business results and projections of business performance. Based on such reviews,\nthe Firm has concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of March 31, 2025 or December 31, 2024, nor was\ngoodwill written off due to impairment during the three months ended March 31, 2025 or 2024.\n                                                    149                                                     \nMortgage servicing rights\n\nMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others.\nThe fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to\nservice the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively\namortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased\nfrom third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained.\nRefer to Notes 2 and 15 of JPMorganChase\u2019s 2024 Form 10-K for a further description of the MSR asset,\ninterest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs.\nThe following table summarizes MSR activity for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.\n

The contractual amount of these financial instruments\nrepresents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the\ncommitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or\nclient subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and\nguarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a\ndefault occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm\u2019s\nview, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of\nJPMorganChase\u2019s 2024 Form 10-K for a further discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and\nthe Firm\u2019s related accounting policies. To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain\nconsumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is\nmaintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-\nrelated commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-\nbalance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at March 31, 2025 and\nDecember 31, 2024. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain scored business\nbanking lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has\nnot experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these commitments will be\nutilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments, in accordance with the contract,\nor to the extent otherwise permitted by law, including when there has been a demonstrable decline in the\ncreditworthiness of the borrower or significant decrease in the value of underlying property.\n                                                    160

The liability related to\nrepurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in\nestablishing its litigation reserves. Refer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorganChase\u2019s 2024\nForm 10-K for additional information regarding litigation.\n                                                    162                                                     \nMerchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment\nnetworks, in its role as a merchant acquirer, the\nFirm's Merchant Services business in CIB Payments,\nretains a contingent liability for disputed\nprocessed credit and debit card transactions that\nresult in a charge-back to the merchant. If a\ndispute is resolved in the cardholder\u2019s favor, the\nFirm will (through the cardholder\u2019s issuing bank)\ncredit or refund the amount to the cardholder and\nwill charge back the transaction to the merchant.\nIf the Firm is unable to collect the amount from\nthe merchant, the Firm will bear the loss for the\namount credited or refunded to the cardholder. The\nFirm mitigates this risk by withholding future\nsettlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or\nobtaining other collateral. In addition, the Firm\nrecognizes a valuation allowance that covers the\npayment or performance risk related to charge-\nbacks. Sponsored member repo program The Firm acts\nas a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight\nand term resale and repurchase agreements through\nthe Government Securities Division of the Fixed\nIncome Clearing Corporation (\u201cFICC\u201d) on behalf of\nclients that become sponsored members under the\nFICC\u2019s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC\nthe prompt and full payment and performance of its\nsponsored member clients\u2019 respective obligations\nunder the FICC\u2019s rules. The Firm minimizes its\nliability under these guarantees by obtaining a\nsecurity interest in the cash or high-quality\nsecurities collateral that the clients place with\nthe clearing house; therefore, the Firm expects the\nrisk of loss to be remote. The Firm\u2019s maximum\npossible exposure, without taking into\nconsideration the associated collateral, is\nincluded in the Exchange & clearing house\nguarantees and commitments line on page 161. Refer\nto Note 11 of JPMorganChase\u2019s 2024 Form 10-K for\nadditional information on credit risk mitigation\npractices on resale agreements and the types of\ncollateral pledged under repurchase agreements.\nGuarantees of subsidiaries The Parent Company has\nguaranteed certain long-term debt and structured\nnotes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase\nFinancial Company LLC (\u201cJPMFC\u201d), a 100%-owned\nfinance subsidiary.

Additionally, the Firm\npledges assets for other purposes, including to\ncollateralize repurchase and other securities\nfinancing agreements, to cover short sales and to\ncollateralize derivative contracts and deposits.\nCertain of these pledged assets may be sold or\nrepledged or otherwise used by the secured parties\nand are parenthetically identified on the\nConsolidated balance sheets as assets pledged.\nThe following table presents the carrying value of\nthe Firm\u2019s pledged assets.\n                                                                                                           \n  (in billions)                                           March 31, 2025                December 31, 2024  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Assets that may be sold or repledged or     $    242.1                    $    152.5                     \n  otherwise used by secured parties                                                                        \n  Assets that may not be sold or repledged         360.9                         297.9                     \n  or otherwise used by secured parties                                                                     \n  Assets pledged at Federal Reserve banks          698.9                         724.0                     \n  and FHLBs                                                                                                \n  Total pledged assets                        $  1,301.9                    $  1,174.4                     \n                                                                                                           \nTotal pledged assets do not include assets of\nconsolidated VIEs; these assets are used to settle\nthe liabilities of those entities.

The litigations range from individual\nactions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members.\nInvestigations and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both\ngovernmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of\nadjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm\u2019s lines of business and several\ngeographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory\nantitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm\nbelieves the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves\nestablished, for its legal proceedings is from $ 0to approximately $ 1.1billion at March 31, 2025. This\nestimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date\nfor those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made.\nFor certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The\nFirm\u2019s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: \u2022\nthe number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary\nstages, \u2022 the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of\nliability (if any) has yet to be determined, \u2022 the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the\nproceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and \u2022 the\nuncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made\nassumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives\nof adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition, the\noutcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate\nbecause the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm\u2019s estimate of\nthe aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary\nsignificantly. Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm\u2019s material legal proceedings. 1MDB Litigation .\nJ.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by\n1Malaysia Development Berhad (\u201c1MDB\u201d), a Malaysian state-owned and controlled investment fund. The claim\nalleges \u201cdishonest assistance\u201d against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in relation to payments of $ 300million and $\n500million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan\n(Suisse) SA held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings\n(Cayman) Limited. In March 2024, the Court upheld the Firm's challenge to the validity of service and the\nMalaysian Court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear the claim. That decision has been appealed by 1MDB. In August 2023,\nthe Court denied an application by 1MDB to discontinue its claim with permission to re-file a new claim in\nthe future. That decision was appealed by both 1MDB and the Firm, and an appeals court is scheduled to hear\nboth appeals in November 2025. In its appeal, the Firm seeks to prevent any claim from continuing. In\naddition, in November 2023, the Federal Office of the Attorney General (OAG) in Switzerland notified J.P.\nMorgan (Suisse) SA that it is conducting an investigation into possible criminal liability in connection\nwith transactions arising from J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA\u2019s relationship with the 1MDB PetroSaudi joint venture\nand its related persons for the period September 2009 through August 2015. The OAG investigation is ongoing.\nAmrapali . India\u2019s Enforcement Directorate (\u201cED\u201d) is investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in\nconnection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by twooffshore funds formerly managed by JPMorganChase\nentities into residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (\u201cAmrapali\u201d) relating to delays\nin delivering or failure to deliver residential units. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P.\nMorgan India Private Limited approximately $ 31.5million, and the Firm is appealing that order. Relatedly,\nin July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other\nparties, including unspecified JPMorganChase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the\nprojects, violated certain criminal currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordered the ED to\nconduct a further inquiry. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the inquiry.\n                                                    164                                                     \nForeign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain\ngovernment authorities relating to its foreign exchange (\u201cFX\u201d) sales and trading activities and controls\nrelated to those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single\nviolation of federal antitrust law. The Department of Labor (\"DOL\") granted the Firm exemptions that permit\nthe Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under\nthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d) through the ten-yeardisqualification period following\nthe antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition\nCommission matter which is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal. With respect to\ncivil litigation matters, some FX-related individual and putative class actions filed outside the U.S.,\nincluding in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia remain. In July 2023, the U.K. Court of\nAppeal overturned the Competition Appeal Tribunal's earlier denial of a request for class certification on\nan opt-out basis. The defendants have appealed this decision to the U.K. Supreme Court. In Israel, a\nsettlement in principle has been reached on the putative class action, which remains subject to court\napproval. In Australia, the parties have reached an agreement in principle to settle the class action. The\nsettlement is subject to Court approval. Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations\nfiled a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks,\nconspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation\nof antitrust laws. In September 2018, the parties settled the class action seeking monetary relief, with the\ndefendants collectively contributing approximately $ 6.2billion. The settlement has been approved by the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of New York and affirmed on appeal. Based on the\npercentage of merchants that opted out of the settlement, $ 700million has been returned to the defendants\nfrom the settlement escrow. A separate class action seeking injunctive relief continues, and in September\n2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion\nin part. In June 2024, the District Court denied preliminary approval of a settlement of the injunctive\nclass action in which Visa and Mastercard agreed to certain changes to their respective network rules and\nsystem-wide reductions in interchange rates for U.S.-based merchants. The parties are considering next\nsteps. Of the merchants who opted out of the damages class settlement, certain merchants filed individual\nactions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other\nbanks. While some of those actions remain pending, the defendants have reached settlements with the\nmerchants who opted out representing approximately 80% of the combined Mastercard-branded and Visa-branded\npayment card sales volume. A number of these actions are pending in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York, and that court has scheduled a trial of the claims brought by several\nmerchants to begin in October 2025. LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation .\nJPMorganChase has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around the world\nrelating primarily to the British Bankers Association\u2019s (\u201cBBA\u201d) London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) for\nvarious currencies and the European Banking Federation\u2019s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cEURIBOR\u201d). The Swiss\nCompetition Commission\u2019s investigation of the Firm relating to EURIBOR has been settled, and the Firm paid a\npenalty and costs of approximately 9million Swiss franc. The Firm appealed a December 2016 decision by the\nEuropean Commission against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules\nrelating to EURIBOR. In December 2023, the European General Court annulled the fine imposed by the European\nCommission, but exercised its discretion to re-impose a fine in an identical amount. In March 2024, the Firm\nfiled an appeal of this decision with the Court of Justice of the European Union. In addition, the Firm has\nbeen named as a defendant along with other banks in various individual and putative class actions related to\nbenchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that\nit was administered by the BBA, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York\ngranted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by\nthe defendants, including the Firm. The Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain\nother actions, and as to all remaining actions has moved for summary judgment. In addition, a lawsuit filed\nby a group of individual plaintiffs asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants\nwere engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for\nLIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards was dismissed in October 2023 and affirmed on appeal by the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in December 2024. The Firm has resolved all non-U.S.\ndollar LIBOR actions. Russian Litigation. The Firm is obligated to comply with international sanctions laws,\nwhich mandate the blocking of certain assets. These laws apply when assets associated with individuals,\ncompanies, products or services are within the scope of the\n                                                    165                                                     \nsanctions. The Firm has faced actual and threatened litigation in Russia seeking payments that the Firm\ncannot make under, and is contractually excused from paying as a result of, relevant sanctions laws. In\nclaims involving the Firm and claims filed against other financial institutions, Russian courts have\ndisregarded the parties\u2019 contractual agreements concerning forum selection and did not recognize foreign\nsanctions laws as a basis for not making payment. Russian courts have entered judgment against the Firm in a\nnumber of claims, including one for $ 439million, and a judgment has been executed against assets held\nonshore by the Firm in Russia. The total amount of the judgments exceeds the total amount of available\nassets that the Firm holds in Russia. The Firm continues to appeal the Russian courts' decisions, and\njudgments may not be executed while on appeal. Russian courts have also ordered interim freezes of Firm\nassets in Russia (including, among other things, funds in bank accounts, securities, shares in authorized\ncapital, and certain trademarks, of the named defendants) pending a determination of certain underlying\nclaims against the Firm. The Firm has challenged claims being pursued in the Russian courts and related\nfreeze orders in other jurisdictions provided for by the parties\u2019 contractual forum selections. If further\nclaims are enforced despite the actions taken by the Firm to challenge the claims and orders and to seek the\nproper application of law, the Firm\u2019s assets in Russia could be seized in full, and certain client assets\ncould also be seized, or the Firm could be prevented from complying with its obligations. Shareholder\nLitigation . Several shareholder putative class actions, as well as shareholder derivative actions\npurporting to act on behalf of the Firm, have been filed against the Firm, its Board of Directors and\ncertain of its current and former officers. Certain of these shareholder suits relate to historical trading\npractices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct which\nwere the subject of the Firm\u2019s resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary\nactivities that were separately the subject of a resolution between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in\nNovember 2020. One of these shareholder derivative suits was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New\nYork in May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims relating to the historical\ntrading practices and related conduct and fiduciary activities which were the subject of the resolutions\ndescribed above. In December 2022, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss this action in full, and\nin April 2025 the appellate court affirmed the dismissal. A second shareholder derivative action relating to\nthe historical trading practices and related conduct was filed in the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of New York in December 2022. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint. Zelle Network\nLitigation. In December 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) filed a complaint against\nEarly Warning Services, LLC (\u201cEWS\u201d), Bank of America, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. The CFPB alleged that EWS and the\ndefendant banks failed to take sufficient efforts to prevent fraud on the Zelle network. In March 2025, the\nCourt dismissed the complaint with prejudice at the request of the CFPB. * * * In addition to the various\nlegal proceedings discussed above, JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are\notherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious\ndefenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to\ndefend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. The\nFirm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In\naccordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related\nliability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be\nreasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its\nlitigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on\nmanagement\u2019s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm\u2019s legal expense was $ 121million and $(\n72) million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. There is no assurance that the\nFirm\u2019s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future. In view of the inherent difficulty of\npredicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or\nindeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties\nor are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual\noutcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses,\nfines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorganChase believes, based upon its current\nknowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described\nabove and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of\npossible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not\n                                                    166                                                     \nhave a material adverse effect on the Firm\u2019s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that\nin light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate\nresolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a\nmatter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may\nbe material to JPMorganChase\u2019s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors,\nthe size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorganChase\u2019s income for that period.\n                                                    167                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Note 25 \u2013 Business segments & Corporate                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are threereportable business segments \u2013 Consumer & Community\nBanking, Commercial & Investment Bank, and Asset & Wealth Management \u2013 with the remaining activities in\nCorporate. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of\ncustomer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Firm\u2019s\nOperating Committee, whose members act collectively as the Firm\u2019s chief operating decision maker. Segment\nresults are presented on a managed basis. Refer to JPMorganChase\u2019s 2024 Form 10-K Explanation and\nReconciliation of the Firm\u2019s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 67 for a definition of managed basis\nand Note 32 for a further discussion of the Firm\u2019s business segments. Description of business segment\nreporting methodology Results of the reportable business segments are intended to present each segment as if\nit were a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives business segment results\nincludes the allocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and therefore further refinements\nmay be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on\nat least an annual basis. The Firm\u2019s LOBs also provide various business metrics which are utilized by the\nFirm and its investors and analysts in assessing performance. Revenue sharing When business segments or\nbusinesses within each segment join efforts to sell products and services to the Firm\u2019s clients and\ncustomers, the participating businesses may agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is\ngenerally recognized in the segment responsible for the related product or service, with allocations to the\nother segments or businesses involved in the transaction. The segment and business results reflect these\nrevenue-sharing agreements. Funds transfer pricing Funds transfer pricing (\u201cFTP\u201d) is the process by which\nthe Firm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary\ninterest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO. The funds transfer pricing process considers the\ninterest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products.\nPeriodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic\nconditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest income to the segments.\nEffective in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Firm updated its FTP with respect to consumer deposits, which\nresulted in an increase in the funding benefit reflected within CCB\u2019s net interest income that is fully\noffset in Corporate, with no effect on the Firm\u2019s net interest income. As a result of lower average interest\nrates in the current period, the cost of funding for assets and the funding benefit earned for liabilities\ngenerally decreased compared with the prior year. Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk is transferred\nfrom the LOBs and Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO\nmanages these risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate movements related to the\ntransferred risk in its results. Capital allocation The amount of capital assigned to each LOB and Corporate\nis referred to as equity. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate\ncapital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs and Corporate may change. Refer\nto Note 32 of JPMorganChase\u2019s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on capital allocation.\n                                                    168                                                     \nSegment & Corporate results The following table provides a summary of the Firm\u2019s segment results as of or\nfor the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, on a managed basis. The Firm\u2019s definition of managed\nbasis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net\nrevenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue\nfrom investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a\nbasis comparable to taxable investments and securities.

A\nsubstantial proportion of the Firm\u2019s Alt-A loans\nare those where a borrower does not provide\ncomplete documentation of his or her assets or the\namount or source of his or her income.\n\nOption ARMs\n\nThe option ARM real estate loan product is an\nadjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the\nborrower with the option each month to make a fully\namortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The\nminimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on\nthe interest rate charged during the introductory\nperiod. This introductory rate is usually\nsignificantly below the fully indexed rate. The\nfully indexed rate is calculated using an index\nrate plus a margin. Once the introductory period\nends, the contractual interest rate charged on the\nloan increases to the fully indexed rate and\nadjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index.\nThe minimum payment is typically insufficient to\ncover interest accrued in the prior month, and any\nunpaid interest is deferred and added to the\nprincipal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are\nsubject to payment recast, which converts the loan\nto a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon\nmeeting specified loan balance and anniversary date\ntriggers.\n\nPrime\n\nPrime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with\ngood credit records who meet specific underwriting\nrequirements, including prescriptive requirements\nrelated to income and overall debt levels.

Loans (other\nthan credit card loans and certain consumer loans\ninsured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on\nnonaccrual status when full payment of principal\nand interest is not expected, regardless of\ndelinquency status, or when principal and interest\nhas been in default for a period of 90 days or more\nunless the loan is both well-secured and in the\nprocess of collection. Collateral-dependent loans\nare typically maintained on nonaccrual status.\n\nNonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include\nnonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and\ncertain assets acquired in loan satisfactions,\npredominantly real estate owned and other\ncommercial and personal property.\n\nNSFR: Net Stable Funding Ratio\n\nOCC : Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\n\nOCI : Other comprehensive income/(loss)\n                                                    175                                                     \nOPEB : Other postretirement employee benefit\n\nOperating losses: Primarily refer to fraud losses\nassociated with customer deposit accounts, credit\nand debit cards; exclude legal expense\n\nOTC : \u201cOver-the-counter derivatives\u201d: Derivative\ncontracts that are negotiated, executed and settled\nbilaterally between two derivative counterparties,\nwhere one or both counterparties is a derivatives\ndealer.\n\nOTC cleared : \u201cOver-the-counter cleared\nderivatives\u201d: Derivative contracts that are\nnegotiated and executed bilaterally, but\nsubsequently settled via a central clearing house,\nsuch that each derivative counterparty is only\nexposed to the default of that clearing house.\n\nOverhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage\nof total net revenue.\n\nParent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nParticipating securities: represents unvested\nshare-based compensation awards containing\nnonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend\nequivalents (collectively, \u201cdividends\u201d), which are\nincluded in the earnings per share calculation\nusing the two-class method. JPMorganChase grants\nrestricted stock and RSUs to certain employees\nunder its share-based compensation programs, which\nentitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable\ndividends during the vesting period on a basis\nequivalent to the dividends paid to holders of\ncommon stock. These unvested awards meet the\ndefinition of participating securities. Under the\ntwo-class method, all earnings (distributed and\nundistributed) are allocated to each class of\ncommon stock and participating securities, based on\ntheir respective rights to receive dividends.\n\nPCD: \u201cPurchased credit deteriorated\u201d assets\nrepresent acquired financial assets that as of the\ndate of acquisition have experienced a more-than-\ninsignificant deterioration in credit quality since\norigination, as determined by the Firm.\n\nPillar 1: The Basel framework consists of a three\n\u201cPillar\u201d approach. Pillar 1 establishes minimum\ncapital requirements, defines eligible capital\ninstruments, and prescribes rules for calculating\nRWA.\n\nPillar 3: The Basel framework consists of a three\n\u201cPillar\u201d approach. Pillar 3 encourages market\ndiscipline through disclosure requirements which\nallow market participants to assess the risk and\ncapital profiles of banks.\n\nPRA: Prudential Regulation Authority\n\nPreferred stock dividends: reflects dividends\ndeclared and deemed dividends upon redemption of\npreferred stock\n\nPre-provision profit/(loss): represents total net\nrevenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes\nthat this financial measure is useful in assessing\nthe\n\nability of a lending institution to generate income\nin excess of its provision for credit losses.\n\nPrincipal transactions revenue : Principal\ntransactions revenue is driven by many factors,\nincluding the bid-offer spread, which is the\ndifference between the price at which the Firm is\nwilling to buy a financial or other instrument and\nthe price at which the Firm is willing to sell that\ninstrument. It also consists of realized (as a\nresult of closing out or termination of\ntransactions, or interim cash payments) and\nunrealized (as a result of changes in valuation)\ngains and losses on financial and other instruments\n(including those accounted for under the fair value\noption) primarily used in client-driven market-\nmaking activities and on private equity\ninvestments. In connection with its client-driven\nmarket-making activities, the Firm transacts in\ndebt and equity instruments, derivatives and\ncommodities (including physical commodities\ninventories and financial instruments that\nreference commodities). Principal transactions\nrevenue also includes certain realized and\nunrealized gains and losses related to hedge\naccounting and specified risk-management\nactivities, including: (a) certain derivatives\ndesignated in qualifying hedge accounting\nrelationships (primarily fair value hedges of\ncommodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain\nderivatives used for specific risk management\npurposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and\nforeign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.\n\nPSU(s) : Performance share units\n\nRegulatory VaR: Daily aggregated VaR calculated in\naccordance with regulatory rules.\n\nREO: Real estate owned\n\nReported basis: Financial statements prepared under\nU.S. GAAP, which excludes the impact of taxable-\nequivalent adjustments.\n\nRetained loans : Loans that are held-for-investment\n(i.e. excludes loans held-for-sale and loans at\nfair value).\n\nRevenue wallet: Total fee revenue based on\nestimates of investment banking fees generated\nacross the industry (i.e., the revenue wallet) from\ninvestment banking transactions in M&A, equity and\ndebt underwriting, and loan syndications.

Key differences in the\ncalculation of credit risk RWA between the\nStandardized and Advanced approaches are that for\nBasel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on\nrisk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the\nuse of internal credit models and parameters,\nwhereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA\nis generally based on supervisory risk-weightings\nwhich vary primarily by counterparty type and asset\nclass. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally\nconsistent basis between Basel III Standardized and\nBasel III Advanced.\n\nS&P : Standard and Poors\n\nSA-CCR: Standardized Approach for Counterparty\nCredit Risk\n\nSAR as it pertains to Hong Kong: Special\nAdministrative Region\n\nSAR(s) as it pertains to employee stock awards :\nStock appreciation rights\n\nSCB : Stress capital buffer\n\nScored portfolios: Consumer loan portfolios that\npredominantly include residential real estate\nloans, credit card loans, auto loans to individuals\nand certain small business loans.\n\nSEC : U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n\nSecuritized Products Group: Comprised of\nSecuritized Products and tax-oriented investments.\n\nSeed capital: Initial JPMorgan capital invested in\nproducts, such as mutual funds, with the intention\nof ensuring the fund is of sufficient size to\nrepresent a viable offering to clients, enabling\npricing of its shares, and allowing the manager to\ndevelop a track record. After these goals are\nachieved, the intent is to remove the Firm\u2019s\ncapital from the investment.\n\nShelf securities: Securities registered with the\nSEC under a shelf registration statement that have\nnot been issued, offered or sold.
