Effective in\nthe second quarter of 2024, the Firm reorganized\nits reportable business segments by combining the\nformer Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial\nBanking business segments to form one reportable\nsegment, the Commercial & Investment Bank (\u201cCIB\u201d).\nAs a result of the reorganization, the Firm now has\nthree reportable business segments: Consumer &\nCommunity Banking, Commercial & Investment Bank,\nand Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there\nis a Corporate segment.\n\nThe business segments are determined based on the\nproducts and services provided, or the type of\ncustomer served, and they reflect the manner in\nwhich financial information is currently evaluated\nby the Firm\u2019s Operating Committee. Segment results\nare presented on a managed basis. Refer to\nExplanation and Reconciliation of the Firm\u2019s use of\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 18-19 for a\ndefinition of managed basis.\n\nThe following table depicts the Firm\u2019s reportable\nbusiness segments.\n\nDescription of business segment reporting\nmethodology\n\nResults of the business segments are intended to\npresent each segment as if it were a stand-alone\nbusiness. The management reporting process that\nderives business segment results includes the\nallocation of certain income and expense items. The\nFirm periodically assesses the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications used\nfor segment reporting, and therefore further\nrefinements may be implemented in future periods.\nThe Firm also assesses the level of capital\nrequired for each LOB on at least an annual basis.\nThe Firm\u2019s LOBs also provide various business\nmetrics which are utilized by the Firm and its\ninvestors and analysts in assessing performance.\n\nRevenue sharing\n\nWhen business segments or businesses within each\nsegment join efforts to sell products and services\nto the Firm\u2019s clients and customers, the\nparticipating businesses may agree to share revenue\nfrom those transactions. Revenue is generally\nrecognized in the segment responsible for the\nrelated product or service, with allocations to the\nother segments/businesses involved in the\ntransaction. The segment and business results\nreflect these revenue-sharing agreements.\n\nFunds transfer pricing\n\nFunds transfer pricing (\u201cFTP\u201d) is the process by\nwhich the Firm allocates interest income and\nexpense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and\ntransfers the primary interest rate risk and\nliquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.\n\nThe funds transfer pricing process considers the\ninterest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of\nassets and liabilities and off-balance sheet\nproducts. Periodically the methodology and\nassumptions utilized in the FTP process are\nadjusted to reflect economic conditions and other\nfactors, which may impact the allocation of net\ninterest income to the segments.\n\nForeign exchange risk\n\nForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs\nand Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain\nrevenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages\nthese risks centrally and reports the impact of\nforeign exchange rate movements related to the\ntransferred risk in its results. Refer to Market\nRisk Management on pages 79-84 for additional\ninformation.\n                                                     20                                                     \nCapital allocation\n\nThe amount of capital assigned to each business\nsegment is referred to as equity. At least\nannually, the assumptions, judgments and\nmethodologies used to allocate capital are\nreassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated\nto the LOBs may change.

Estimates on\npages 86-88 for additional information on the\ncredit card rewards liability.\n\nNoninterest expense was $9.4 billion, up 13%,\nreflecting First Republic-related expense that was\naligned to CCB from Corporate starting in the third\nquarter of 2023, impacting both compensation and\nnoncompensation expense.\n\nThe increase in expense also reflected:\n\n\u2022 higher compensation expense, largely driven by\nhigher revenue-related compensation, primarily for\nadvisors and bankers, and an increase in employees,\nincluding in technology, and\n\n\u2022 higher noncompensation expense, largely driven by\ncontinued investments in technology and marketing.\n\nThe provision for credit losses was $2.6 billion,\nreflecting:\n\n\u2022 net charge-offs of $2.1 billion, up $813 million,\npredominantly driven by $706 million in Card\nServices, primarily due to the seasoning of newer\nvintages and continued credit normalization, and\n\n\u2022 a $579 million net addition to the allowance for\ncredit losses, primarily in Card Services,\npredominantly driven by loan growth and updates to\ncertain macroeconomic variables.\n\nThe provision in the prior year was $1.9 billion,\nreflecting net charge-offs of $1.3 billion and a\n$611 million net addition to the allowance for\ncredit losses, including $408 million to establish\nthe allowance for the First

compression.\n\nNoninterest revenue was $7.9 billion, up 11% ,\npredominantly driven by:\n\n\u2022 higher asset management fees reflecting higher\naverage market levels, including the timing impact\nof First Republic and, to a lesser extent, net\ninflows, as well as higher commissions from annuity\nsales in BWM,\n\n\u2022 higher card income driven by higher net\ninterchange on increased

When the Firm extends a\nconsumer or wholesale loan, advises customers and\nclients on their investment decisions, makes\nmarkets in securities, or offers other products or\nservices, the Firm takes on some degree of risk.\nThe Firm\u2019s overall objective is to manage its\nbusiness, and the associated risks, in a manner\nthat balances serving the interests of its clients,\ncustomers and investors, and protecting the safety\nand soundness of the Firm. The Firm believes that\neffective risk management requires, among other\nthings: \u2022 Acceptance of responsibility, including\nidentification and escalation of risks by all\nindividuals within the Firm; \u2022 Ownership of risk\nidentification, assessment, data and management\nwithin each of the LOBs and Corporate; and \u2022 A\nFirmwide risk governance and oversight structure.\nThe Firm follows a disciplined and balanced\ncompensation framework with strong internal\ngovernance and independent oversight by the Board\nof Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d). The impact of risk and\ncontrol issues is carefully considered in the\nFirm\u2019s performance evaluation and incentive\ncompensation processes. Risk governance framework\nThe Firm\u2019s risk governance framework involves\nunderstanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and\nimpacts of risks.

Under the\nrules currently in effect, two comprehensive\napproaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a\nstandardized approach (\u201cBasel III Standardized\u201d),\nand an advanced approach (\u201cBasel III Advanced\u201d).\n\nFor each of these risk-based capital ratios, the\ncapital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against\nthe lower of the Standardized or Advanced\napproaches compared to their respective regulatory\ncapital ratio requirements.\n\nIn July 2023, the Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System (the \"Federal Reserve\"), the Office\nof the Comptroller of the Currency (\"OCC\"), and the\nFDIC released a proposal to amend the risk-based\ncapital framework, entitled \"Regulatory capital\nrule: Amendments applicable to large banking\norganizations and to banking organizations with\nsignificant trading activity\", which is referred to\nin this Form 10-Q as the \"U.S. Basel III proposal\".\nUnder the proposal, changes to the framework would\ninclude replacement of the Advanced approach with\nan expanded risk-based approach, which would not\npermit the use of internal models for the\ncalculation of RWA, other than for market risk. In\naddition, the stress capital buffer requirement\nwould be applicable to both the expanded risk-based\napproach and the Standardized approach. The\nproposal would significantly revise risk-based\ncapital requirements for all banks with assets of\n$100 billion or more, including the Firm and other\nU.S. global systemically important banks (\"GSIBs\").\nThe proposed effective date is July 1, 2025, with a\nthree-year transition period applicable to the\nexpanded risk-based approach.\n\nUnder the requirements of the U.S. Basel III\nproposal, the new expanded risk-based approach,\nwhen fully phased-in, would be the Firm's binding\nconstraint. The Firm is managing its CET1 capital\nin anticipation of the finalization of the U.S.\nBasel III proposal.\n\nRefer to page 92 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K\nfor additional information on the U.S. Basel III\nproposal.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Advanced Total Capital\nratio is the most binding constraint of the Firm's\nBasel III risk-based ratios.

As part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, a 1% excise tax was\nimposed on net share repurchases effective January 1, 2023. The Board of Directors\u2019 authorization to\nrepurchase common shares is utilized at management\u2019s discretion. The $30 billion common share repurchase\nprogram approved by the Board of Directors does not establish specific price targets or timetables.\nManagement determines the amount and timing of common share repurchases based on various factors, including\nmarket conditions; legal and regulatory considerations affecting the amount and timing of repurchase\nactivity; the Firm\u2019s capital position (taking into account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital\ngeneration; current and proposed future capital requirements; and other investment opportunities. The amount\nof common shares that the Firm repurchases in any period may be substantially more or less than the amounts\nestimated or actually repurchased in prior periods, reflecting the dynamic nature of the decision-making\nprocess.

Capital planning and\nstress testing Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review On April 5, 2024, the Firm submitted its 2024\nCapital Plan to the Federal Reserve. On June 28, 2024, the Firm announced that its preliminary Stress\nCapital Buffer (\"SCB\") requirement provided by the Federal Reserve is 3.3% (up from the current 2.9%), and\nthe Firm\u2019s Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement, including regulatory buffers, is 12.3% (up from the\ncurrent 11.9%). In addition, consistent with the Firm's press release on June 26, 2024 regarding the\npotential for higher stress losses, should the Federal Reserve modify the Firm\u2019s stress results, the Firm\u2019s\nStandardized CET1 capital ratio requirement would likely be modestly higher than 12.3%. The Federal Reserve\nwill provide the Firm with its final SCB requirement by August 31, 2024, and that requirement will become\neffective on October 1, 2024, and will remain in effect until September 30, 2025.

JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A.\u2019s average LCR for the three months ended June 30, 2024 decreased compared with the three months\nended June 30, 2023, reflecting the timing impact associated with the First Republic acquisition. Refer to\nExecutive Overview on pages 5-8 and Note 26 for additional information on First Republic. Each of the Firm\nand JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR may fluctuate from period to period due to changes in their\nrespective eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity and from\nthe impacts of Federal Reserve actions as well as other factors. Refer to page 103 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023\nForm 10-K and the Firm\u2019s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports for additional information on HQLA and net cash\noutflows. Internal stress testing The Firm conducts internal liquidity stress testing to monitor liquidity\npositions at the Firm and its material legal entities under a variety of adverse scenarios, including\nscenarios analyzed as part of the Firm\u2019s resolution and recovery planning. Internal stress tests are\nproduced on a regular basis, and other stress tests are performed in response to specific market events or\nconcerns. Results of stress tests are considered in the formulation of the Firm\u2019s funding plan and\nassessment of its liquidity position. The Firm maintains liquidity at the Parent Company, the Intermediate\nHolding Company (\u201cIHC\u201d), and operating subsidiaries at levels sufficient to comply with liquidity risk\ntolerances and minimum liquidity requirements, and to manage through periods of stress when access to normal\nfunding sources may be disrupted.\n                                                     51                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n   Liquidity sources                                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \nIn addition to the assets reported in the Firm\u2019s\neligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had\nunencumbered marketable securities, such as equity\nand debt securities, that the Firm believes would\nbe available to raise liquidity. This includes\nexcess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank\naffiliates. The fair value of these securities was\napproximately $623 billion and $649 billion as of\nJune 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively,\nalthough the amount of liquidity that could be\nraised at any particular time would be dependent on\nprevailing market conditions. The decrease compared\nto December 31, 2023, was driven by decreases in\nexcess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. and in unencumbered AFS securities,\nlargely offset by an increase in CIB trading\nassets.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Firm\nhad approximately $1.5 trillion and $1.4 trillion\nof available cash and securities, respectively,\ncomprised of eligible end-of-period HQLA, excluding\nthe impact of regulatory haircuts, of approximately\n$841 billion and $798 billion, respectively, and\nunencumbered marketable securities with a fair\nvalue of approximately $623 billion and $649\nbillion, respectively.\n\nThe Firm also had available borrowing capacity at\nthe FHLB and the discount window at the Federal\nReserve Banks as a result of collateral pledged by\nthe Firm to such banks of approximately $366\nbillion and $340 billion as of June 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively. This borrowing\ncapacity excludes the benefit of cash and\nsecurities reported in the Firm\u2019s eligible HQLA or\nother unencumbered securities that are currently\npledged at the Federal Reserve Banks discount\nwindow and other central banks. Available borrowing\ncapacity increased from December 31, 2023\npredominantly due to a higher amount of commercial\nloans and mortgages pledged at the Federal Reserve\nBanks. Although available, the Firm does not view\nthis borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve\nBanks discount window and the other central banks\nas a primary source of liquidity.\n                                                                                                            \n  NSFR                                                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nThe net stable funding ratio (\u201cNSFR\u201d) is a\nliquidity requirement for large banking\norganizations that is intended to measure the\nadequacy of \u201cavailable\u201d stable funding that is\nsufficient to meet their \u201crequired\u201d amounts of\nstable funding over a one-year horizon.\n\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024, both the\nFirm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were compliant\nwith the 100% minimum NSFR requirement, based on\nthe Firm's interpretation of the final rule.

Refer to page 67 of the Firm\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K\nfor additional information.\n\nThe Firm believes that deposits provide a stable\nsource of funding and reduce the Firm\u2019s reliance on\nthe wholesale funding markets. A significant\nportion of the Firm\u2019s deposits are consumer\ndeposits and wholesale operating deposits, which\nare both considered to be stable sources of\nliquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are\ngenerally considered to be stable sources of\nliquidity because they are generated from customers\nthat maintain operating service relationships with\nthe Firm.\n\nThe Firm believes that average deposit balances are\ngenerally more representative of deposit trends\nthan period-end deposit balances. However, during\nperiods of market disruption, average deposit\ntrends may be impacted.\n\nAverage deposits were lower for the three months\nended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months\nended June 30, 2023, reflecting:\n\n\u2022 a decline in CCB in existing accounts primarily\ndue to increased customer spending, partially\noffset by new accounts,\n\npredominantly offset by\n\n\u2022 net issuances of structured notes in CIB as a\nresult of client demand in Markets; and net inflows\nin Payments, which included the retention of\ninflows associated with disruptions in the market\nin the first quarter of 2023, predominantly offset\nby deposit attrition, which included actions taken\nto reduce certain deposits,\n\n\u2022 the timing impact of First Republic, and\n\n\u2022 an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's\ninternational consumer initiatives, including new\nproduct offerings in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nExcluding the impact of First Republic, AWM was\nrelatively flat, reflecting an increase from new\nproduct offerings, offset by continued migration\ninto higher-yielding investments.\n\nAverage deposits were higher for the six months\nended June 30, 2024 compared to the six months\nended June 30, 2023, reflecting:\n\n\u2022 net issuances of structured notes in CIB as a\nresult of client demand in Markets; and net inflows\nin Payments, which included the retention of\ninflows associated with disruptions in the market\nin the first quarter of 2023, largely offset by\ndeposit attrition, which included actions taken to\nreduce certain deposits,\n\n\u2022 the timing impact of First Republic, and\n\n\u2022 an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's\ninternational consumer initiatives, including new\nproduct offerings in the second quarter of 2024,\n\npredominantly offset by\n\n\u2022 a decline in CCB in existing accounts primarily\ndue to increased customer spending, partially\noffset by new accounts, and\n\n\u2022 excluding the impact of First Republic, a decline\nin AWM, driven by continued migration into higher-\nyielding investments, predominantly offset by new\nproduct offerings.\n                                                     53                                                     \nPeriod-end deposits decreased from December 31,\n2023, reflecting: \u2022 a decline in CCB in existing\naccounts, primarily driven by seasonal tax outflows\nand migration into higher-yielding investments,\nlargely offset by new accounts, predominantly\noffset by \u2022 higher deposits in CIB due to net\ninflows in Securities Services and Payments,\npartially offset by net maturities of structured\nnotes in Markets, \u2022 higher deposits in Corporate\npredominantly driven by new product offerings\nrelated to the Firm's international consumer\ninitiatives, and \u2022 higher balances in AWM driven by\nnew product offerings, and an increase in deposits\nin existing accounts due to a change in product\nofferings associated with First Republic,\npredominantly offset by continued migration into\nhigher-yielding investments.

Refer to Note 3 for further\ninformation on structured notes. Certain deposits\nare covered by insurance protection that provides\nadditional funding stability and results in a\nbenefit to the LCR. Deposit insurance protection\nmay be available to depositors in the countries in\nwhich the deposits are placed.

These instruments\nare secured predominantly by high-quality\nsecurities collateral, including government-issued\ndebt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS.\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase\nincreased at June 30, 2024, compared with December\n31, 2023, driven by Markets, reflecting higher\nclient-driven market-making activities and higher\nsecured financing of trading assets, as well as\nwhen compared with seasonally lower levels at year-\nend.\n\nThe increase in secured other borrowed funds at\nJune 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 was\npredominantly due to higher financing requirements\nin Markets. For the average three months ended June\n30, 2024 , compared to the prior year period, the\nincrease was due to higher financing requirements\nin Markets, partially offset by maturities in\nTreasury and CIO.\n\nThe balances associated with securities loaned or\nsold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over\ntime due to\n\ninvestment and financing activities of clients, the\nFirm\u2019s demand for financing, the ongoing management\nof the mix of the Firm\u2019s liabilities, including its\nsecured and unsecured financing (for both the\ninvestment securities and market-making\nportfolios), and other market and portfolio\nfactors.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s sources of short-term unsecured funding\nprimarily consist of issuances of wholesale\ncommercial paper and other borrowed funds.\n\nThe decrease in commercial paper at June 30, 2024\nfrom December 31, 2023 was due to lower issuances\nprimarily as a result of short-term liquidity\nmanagement.\n\nThe increase in unsecured other borrowed funds at\nJune 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023 was\npredominantly driven by higher net issuances of\nstructured notes in CIB, due to client demand.\n                                                     56                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Long-term funding                                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \nLong-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm\u2019s\nlong-term funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations and\nregulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification,\nmaximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors\nand currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan.\n\nUnsecured funding and issuance\n\nThe significant majority of the Firm\u2019s total outstanding long-term debt has been issued by the Parent\nCompany to provide flexibility in support of the funding needs of both bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The\nParent Company advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not\nissue debt to external counterparties. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the increase in\naverage structured notes compared to the prior year periods was attributable to net issuances of structured\nnotes in Markets due to client demand.\n\nThe following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the three and\nsix months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.

Residential real\nestate: The residential real estate portfolio,\nincluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair\nvalue, predominantly consists of prime mortgage\nloans and home equity lines of credit. Retained\nloans decreased compared to December 31, 2023,\npredominantly driven by paydowns and loan sales,\nnet of originations. Net recoveries were higher for\nthe three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to\nthe same period in the prior year due to loan\nsales. Loans held-for-sale increased from December\n31, 2023, predominantly driven by a transfer of\ncertain retained loans in anticipation of\nsecuritization. Nonaccrual loans at fair value\ndecreased compared to December 31, 2023,\npredominantly driven by net sales in CIB. At June\n30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value\nof interest-only residential mortgage loans was\n$89.6 billion and $90.6 billion, respectively.\nThese loans have an interest-only payment period\ngenerally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-\nrate fully amortizing payment period to maturity\nand are typically originated as higher-balance\nloans to higher-income borrowers. The credit\nperformance of this portfolio is comparable with\nthe performance of the broader prime mortgage\nportfolio. The carrying value of home equity lines\nof credit outstanding was $15.0 billion at June 30,\n2024. The carrying value of home equity lines of\ncredit outstanding included $4.0 billion of HELOCs\nthat have recast from interest-only to fully\namortizing payments or have been modified and $3.9\nbillion of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which\nprimarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages the\nrisk of HELOCs during their revolving period by\nclosing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent\npermitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a\nmaterial deterioration in their credit risk\nprofile.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the\nFirm\u2019s residential mortgage portfolio insured\nand/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies,\npredominantly loans held-for-sale and loans at fair\nvalue.

A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm\u2019s wholesale businesses is\ngenerally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it\noriginates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations\nand credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth\nreviews of client credit quality and transaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of\nindustry, product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 68-71 for further\ninformation. The Firm\u2019s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, AWM and Corporate, and\nrisk-rated exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the\nallowance for loan losses. The Firm continues to convert certain operations, and to integrate clients,\nproducts and services, associated with First Republic. Accordingly, reporting classifications and internal\nrisk rating profiles in the wholesale portfolio may change in future periods. Refer to Business Developments\non page 8 for additional information. As of June 30, 2024, lending-related commitments increased by $8.2\nbillion, driven by Technology, Media & Telecommunications, including held-for-sale commitments, and SPEs,\npartially offset by a decrease in Asset Managers. As of June 30, 2024, nonperforming exposure increased by\n$1.3 billion, predominantly driven by Real Estate, concentrated in Office, and in Industrials, resulting\nfrom downgrades. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, wholesale net charge-offs were $353 million,\nlargely in Real Estate, concentrated in Office, and Individuals.\n

Total criticized\nexposure, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $46.8 billion and $41.4 billion as of\nJune 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, representing approximately 3.7% and 3.3% of total wholesale credit\nexposure, respectively; of the $46.8 billion, $42.7 billion was performing. The increase in criticized\nexposure was driven by net downgrades in Real Estate, concentrated in Office and Multifamily, and held-for-\nsale commitments in Technology and Media.\n\nThe table below summarizes by industry the Firm\u2019s exposures as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Refer to Note 1 of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K and Note 11 of this\nForm 10-Q for further information.\n                                                     72                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Lending-related commitments                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm uses lending-related financial\ninstruments, such as commitments (including\nrevolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to\naddress the financing needs of its clients. The\ncontractual amounts of these financial instruments\nrepresent the maximum possible credit risk should\nthe clients draw down on these commitments or when\nthe Firm fulfills its obligations under these\nguarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to\nperform according to the terms of these contracts.\nMost of these commitments and guarantees have\nhistorically been refinanced, extended, cancelled,\nor expired without being drawn upon or a default\noccurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe\nthat the total contractual amount of these\nwholesale lending-related commitments is\nrepresentative of the Firm\u2019s expected future credit\nexposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 22\nfor further information on wholesale lending-\nrelated commitments.\n                                                                                                            \n  Receivables from customers                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nReceivables from customers reflect held-for-\ninvestment margin loans to brokerage clients in\nCIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets\nmaintained in the clients\u2019 brokerage accounts\n(including cash on deposit, and primarily liquid\nand readily marketable debt or equity securities).\nTo manage its credit risk, the Firm establishes\nmargin requirements and monitors the required\nmargin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires\nclients to deposit additional cash or other\ncollateral, or to reduce positions, when\nappropriate. Credit risk arising from lending\nactivities subject to collateral maintenance\nrequirements is generally mitigated by factors such\nas the short-term nature of the activity, the fair\nvalue of collateral held and the Firm\u2019s right to\ncall for, and the borrower\u2019s obligation to provide,\nadditional margin when the fair value of the\ncollateral declines. Because of these mitigating\nfactors, these receivables generally do not require\nan allowance for credit losses. However, if in\nmanagement\u2019s judgment, an allowance for credit\nlosses is required, the Firm estimates expected\ncredit losses based on the value of the collateral\nand probability of borrower default. These\nreceivables are reported within accrued interest\nand accounts receivable on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated\nbalance sheets.\n\nRefer to Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2023 Form 10-K\nfor further information on the Firm\u2019s accounting\npolicies for the allowance for credit losses.\n                                                                                                            \n  Derivative contracts                                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to\nmanage risk, including credit risk and risks\narising from fluctuations in interest rates,\nforeign exchange and equities and commodities\nprices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in\norder to meet these needs and uses derivatives to\nmanage certain risks associated with net open risk\npositions from its market-making activities,\nincluding the counterparty credit risk arising from\nderivative receivables. The Firm also uses\nderivative instruments to manage its own credit\nrisk and other market risk exposure. The nature of\nthe counterparty and the settlement mechanism of\nthe\n\nderivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm\nis exposed. For over-the-counter (\"OTC\")\nderivatives, the Firm is exposed to the credit risk\nof the derivative counterparty. For exchange-traded\nderivatives (\u201cETD\u201d), such as futures and options,\nand cleared over-the-counter (\u201cOTC-cleared\u201d)\nderivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the\ncredit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible,\nthe Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk\nexposures arising from derivative contracts through\nthe use of legally enforceable master netting\narrangements and collateral agreements. The\npercentage of the Firm\u2019s OTC derivative\ntransactions subject to collateral agreements \u2014\nexcluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are\nnot typically covered by collateral agreements due\nto their short maturity and centrally cleared\ntrades that are settled daily \u2014 was approximately\n87% at both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nRefer to Note 4 for additional information on the\nFirm\u2019s use of collateral agreements and for a\nfurther discussion of derivative contracts,\ncounterparties and settlement types.\n\nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported\non the Consolidated balance sheets was $54.7\nbillion and $54.9 billion at June 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease was\nprimarily as a result of market movements.\nDerivative receivables represent the fair value of\nthe derivative contracts after giving effect to\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements and\nthe related cash collateral held by the Firm.\n\nIn addition, the Firm holds liquid securities and\nother cash collateral that may be used as security\nwhen the fair value of the client\u2019s exposure is in\nthe Firm\u2019s favor. For these purposes, the\ndefinition of liquid securities is consistent with\nthe definition of high quality liquid assets as\ndefined in the LCR rule.\n\nIn management\u2019s view, the appropriate measure of\ncurrent credit risk should also take into\nconsideration other collateral, which generally\nrepresents securities that do not qualify as high\nquality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The\nbenefits of these additional collateral amounts for\neach counterparty are subject to a legally\nenforceable master netting agreement and limited to\nthe net amount of the derivative receivables for\neach counterparty.\n\nThe Firm also holds additional collateral\n(primarily cash, G7 government securities, other\nliquid government agency and guaranteed securities,\nand corporate debt and equity securities) delivered\nby clients at the initiation of transactions, as\nwell as collateral related to contracts that have a\nnon-daily call frequency and collateral that the\nFirm has agreed to return but has not yet settled\nas of the reporting date. Although this collateral\ndoes not reduce the receivables balances and is not\nincluded in the tables below, it is available as\nsecurity against potential exposure that could\narise should the fair value of the client\u2019s\nderivative contracts move in the Firm\u2019s favor.\nRefer to Note 4 for additional information on the\nFirm\u2019s use of collateral agreements for derivative\ntransactions.\n                                                     73                                                     \nThe following tables summarize the net derivative receivables and the internal ratings profile for the\nperiods presented.\n                                                                                              \n  Derivative receivables                                  June 30,              December 31,  \n  (in millions)                                           2024                  2023          \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Total, net of cash collateral               $   54,673            $   54,864                \n  Liquid securities and other cash                                                            \n  collateral held against derivative             -24,211               -22,461                \n  receivables                                                                                 \n  Total, net of liquid securities and         $   30,462            $   32,403                \n  other cash collateral                                                                       \n  Other collateral held against derivative        -1,064                  -993                \n  receivables                                                                                 \n  Total, net of collateral                    $   29,398            $   31,410                \n                                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Ratings                                                                                                   \n  profile of                                                                                                \n  derivative                                                      December 31,                              \n  receivables          June 30, 2024                                      2023                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (in millions,         Exposure net     % of exposure            Exposure net            % of exposure     \n  except               of collateral            net of           of collateral                   net of     \n  ratios)                                   collateral                                       collateral     \n  Investment-g\u2026    $          22,482                76  %    $          24,004                       76  %  \n  Noninvestmen\u2026                6,916                24                   7,406    -a                 24     \n  Total            $          29,398               100  %    $          31,410                      100  %  \n                                                                                                            \nCredit portfolio management activities The Firm\nuses credit derivatives for two primary purposes:\nfirst, in its capacity as a market-maker, and\nsecond, as an end-user, to manage the Firm\u2019s own\ncredit risk associated with traditional lending\nactivities (loans and lending-related commitments)\nand derivatives counterparty exposure in the Firm\u2019s\nwholesale businesses.

The Firm's allowance for credit losses\ngenerally consists of : \u2022 the allowance for loan\nlosses, which covers the Firm\u2019s retained loan\nportfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented\nseparately on the Consolidated balance sheets, \u2022\nthe allowance for lending-related commitments,\nwhich is reflected in accounts payable and other\nliabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, and\n\u2022 the allowance for credit losses on investment\nsecurities, which is reflected in investment\nsecurities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\nDiscussion of changes in the allowance The\nallowance for credit losses as of June 30, 2024 was\n$25.5 billion , reflecting a net addition of $749\nmillion from December 31, 2023. The net addition to\nthe allowance for credit losses included: \u2022 $653\nmillion in consumer , reflecting a $753 million net\naddition in Card Services, predominantly driven by\nthe seasoning of newer vintages, loan growth, and\nupdates to certain macroeconomic variables, and a\n$125 million net reduction in Home Lending, and \u2022\n$47 million in wholesale , driven by \u2013 a net\naddition of $707 million, reflecting net downgrade\nactivity, primarily in Real Estate, and included\napproximately $200 million associated with\nincorporating the First Republic portfolio into the\nFirm\u2019s modeled credit loss estimates, predominantly\noffset by \u2013 a net reduction of $660 million,\nprimarily due to the impact of changes in the loan\nand lending-related commitment portfolios and\nupdates to certain macroeconomic variables. The\nFirm has maintained the additional weight placed on\nthe adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023\nto reflect ongoing uncertainties and downside risks\nrelated to the geopolitical and macroeconomic\nenvironment. The Firm's allowance for credit losses\nis estimated using a weighted average of five\ninternally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The\nadverse scenarios incorporate more punitive\nmacroeconomic factors than the central case\nassumptions provided in the table below, resulting\nin a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate\npeaking at 5.3% in the second quarter of 2025, and\na weighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 2.1%\nlower than the central case at the end of the\nfourth quarter of 2025.\n\nThe following table presents the Firm\u2019s central\ncase assumptions for the periods presented:\n                                                                                       \n                                    Central case assumptions                           \n                                            at June 30, 2024                           \n                                                        4Q24       2Q25       4Q25     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. unemployment rate(a)                              4.1  %     4.1  %     4.0  %  \n  YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                         1.5  %     1.6  %     1.9  %  \n                                    Central case assumptions                           \n                                        at December 31, 2023                           \n                                                        2Q24       4Q24       2Q25     \n  U.S. unemployment rate(a)                              4.1  %     4.4  %     4.1  %  \n  YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                         1.8  %     0.7  %     1.0  %  \n                                                                                       \n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S.\nunemployment rate.

The investment securities portfolio is\npredominantly held by Treasury and CIO in\nconnection with the Firm\u2019s balance sheet and asset-\nliability management objectives. Principal\ninvestments are predominantly privately-held\nfinancial instruments and are managed in the LOBs\nand Corporate. Investments are typically intended\nto be held over extended periods and, accordingly,\nthe Firm has no expectation for short-term realized\ngains with respect to these investments. Investment\nsecurities risk Investment securities risk includes\nthe exposure associated with a default in the\npayment of principal and interest. This risk is\nmitigated given that the investment securities\nportfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly\nconsists of high-quality securities. At June 30,\n2024, the Treasury and CIO investment securities\nportfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses,\nwas $587.4 billion, and the average credit rating\nof the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+\n(based upon external ratings where available, and\nwhere not available, based primarily upon internal\nrisk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results\non pages 41-43 and Note 9 for further information\non the investment securities portfolio and internal\nrisk ratings. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on\npages 51-58 for further information on related\nliquidity risk. Refer to Market Risk Management on\npages 79-84 for further information on the market\nrisk inherent in the portfolio.\n\nPrincipal investment risk Principal investments are\ntypically privately-held financial instruments\nrepresenting ownership interests or other forms of\njunior capital. In general, principal investments\ninclude tax-oriented investments and investments\nmade to enhance or accelerate the Firm\u2019s business\nstrategies and exclude those that are consolidated\non the Firm's balance sheets. These investments are\nmade by dedicated investing businesses or as part\nof a broader business strategy.

The Firm has a single VaR\nframework used as a basis for calculating Risk\nManagement VaR and Regulatory VaR.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR is calculated\nassuming a one-day holding period and an expected\ntail-loss methodology which approximates a 95%\nconfidence level. For risk management purposes, the\nFirm believes this methodology provides a daily\nmeasure of risk that is closely aligned to risk\nmanagement decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate\nand, along with other market risk measures,\nprovides the appropriate information needed to\nrespond to risk events. The Firm calculates\nseparately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance\nwith regulatory rules (\u201cRegulatory VaR\u201d), which is\nused to derive the Firm\u2019s regulatory VaR-based\ncapital requirements under Basel III.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s VaR model calculations are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in response to changes in\nthe composition of the Firm\u2019s portfolios, changes\nin market conditions, improvements in the Firm\u2019s\nmodeling techniques and measurements, and other\nfactors. Such changes may affect historical\ncomparisons of VaR results.

The gains and losses depicted in the\nchart below do not reflect the Firm\u2019s reported revenue as they exclude certain components of total net\nrevenue, such as those associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven\ntrading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, other valuation adjustments and net\ninterest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or\nloss on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the\nrequirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.\n\nA backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the\nprior day. Under the Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are\nconsistent with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR\nbacktesting exceptions five times every 100 trading days on average. The number of VaR backtesting\nexceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the\ncurrent level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility during the 12\nmonths of historical data used in the VaR calculation.\n\nFor the 12 months ended June 30, 2024, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 152 of the 258 days, and\nobserved 14 VaR backtesting exceptions. For the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Firm posted\nbacktesting gains on 42 of the 65 days, and the Firm observed five VaR backtesting exceptions primarily\ndriven by price changes in Visa C shares.\n\nThe following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the\ntrailing 12 months and three months ended June 30, 2024. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a\npercentage of the corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are\nshown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the\nintervals that are greater than one hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the results\nof backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm\u2019s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital\nDisclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm\u2019s covered positions.\n                             Distribution of Daily Backtesting Gains and Losses                             \n                                                                                                            \n                                                     81                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Structural interest rate risk management                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \nThe effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm\u2019s\nreported net income is important as interest rate\nrisk represents one of the Firm\u2019s significant\nmarket risks. Interest rate risk arises not only\nfrom trading activities which are included in VaR,\nbut also from the Firm\u2019s traditional banking\nactivities, which include extension of loans and\ncredit facilities, taking deposits, issuing debt,\nas well as the investment securities portfolio, and\nassociated derivative instruments.\n\nRefer to the table on page 136 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n2023 Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and Corporate\nidentifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.\n                                                                                                            \n  Earnings-at-Risk                                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \nOne way that the Firm evaluates its structural\ninterest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk.\nEarnings-at-risk estimates the Firm\u2019s interest rate\nexposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is\npresented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which\nincludes net interest income and certain interest\nrate sensitive fees. The baseline uses market\ninterest rates and, in the case of deposits,\npricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations\nof changes to this baseline for interest rate-\nsensitive assets and liabilities denominated in\nU.S. dollars and other currencies (\u201cnon-U.S.\ndollar\u201d currencies). These simulations primarily\ninclude retained loans, deposits, deposits with\nbanks, investment securities, long-term debt and\nany related interest rate hedges, and funds\ntransfer pricing of other positions in risk\nmanagement VaR and other sensitivity-based measures\nas described on page 136 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023\nForm 10-K. These simulations exclude hedges of\nexposure from non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk\narising from the Firm\u2019s capital investments. The\ninclusion of the hedges in these simulations would\nincrease U.S. dollar sensitivities and decrease\nnon-U.S. dollar sensitivities. Refer to non-U.S.\ndollar foreign exchange risk on page 143 of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K for more\ninformation.\n\nEarnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential\nchange to a net interest income baseline, over the\nfollowing 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions.\nThese scenarios include a parallel shift involving\nchanges to both short-term and long-term rates by\nan equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving\nholding short-term rates constant and increasing\nlong-term rates; and a flatter yield curve\ninvolving increasing short-term rates and holding\nlong-term rates constant or holding short-term\nrates constant and decreasing long-term rates.\nThese scenarios consider many different factors,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 The impact on exposures as a result of\ninstantaneous changes in interest rates from\nbaseline rates.\n\n\u2022 Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled\nprepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding\nassumptions about actions that could be taken by\nthe Firm or its clients and customers in response\nto instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment\nassumptions are based on the interest rates used in\nthe scenarios compared with underlying contractual\nrates, the time since origination, and other\nfactors which are updated periodically based on\nhistorical experience. Deposit forecasts are a key\nassumption in the Firm's earnings-at-risk. The\nbaseline reflects certain assumptions relating to\nthe reversal of Quantitative Easing that are highly\nuncertain and require management judgment.\nTherefore, the actual amount of deposits held by\nthe Firm, at any particular time, could be impacted\nby actions the Federal Reserve may take as part of\nmonetary policy, including through the use of the\nReverse Repurchase Facility. In addition, there are\nother factors that impact the amount of deposits\nheld at the Firm such as the level of loans across\nthe industry and competition for deposits.\n\n\u2022 The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as\ndeposit betas, represent the amount by which\ndeposit rates paid could change upon a given change\nin market interest rates. Actual deposit rates paid\nmay differ from the modeled assumptions, primarily\ndue to customer behavior and competition for\ndeposits.\n\nThe Firm performs sensitivity analyses of the\nassumptions used in earnings-at-risk scenarios,\nincluding with respect to deposit betas and\nforecasts of deposit balances, both of which are\nespecially significant in the case of consumer\ndeposits. The results of these sensitivity analyses\nare reported to the CTC Risk Committee and the\nBoard Risk Committee.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s earnings-at-risk scenarios are\nperiodically evaluated and enhanced in response to\nchanges in the composition of the Firm\u2019s balance\nsheet, changes in market conditions, improvements\nin the Firm\u2019s simulation and other factors. In the\nsecond quarter of 2024, the Firm updated certain\ndeposit rates paid assumptions which take into\naccount observed pricing and client and customer\nbehavior during the most recent economic cycle.\nThese updated deposit rates paid assumptions\nimpacted the U.S. dollar scenarios, resulting in an\nincrease in positive sensitivity in higher interest\nrate scenarios, and an increase in negative\nsensitivity in lower interest rate scenarios.

The change in the Firm\u2019s U.S.\ndollar sensitivities as of June 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023, reflected the impact of changes in\nthe Firm\u2019s actual and forecasted balance sheet and the update in the second quarter of 2024 of the deposit\nrates paid assumptions for certain consumer and wholesale deposit products based upon observed pricing and\nclient and customer behavior during the most recent economic cycle. In the absence of this update, the\nFirm\u2019s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of June 30, 2024, would have been lower by approximately $900 million\nand $1.9 billion to the +100 basis points and +200 basis points shifts, respectively, in short-term and\nparallel rate scenarios and higher by approximately $1.0 billion and $1.8 billion to the -100 basis points\nand -200 basis points shifts, respectively, in short-term and parallel rate scenarios.\n\nEconomic Value Sensitivity In addition to earnings-at-risk, which is measured as a sensitivity to a baseline\nof earnings over the next 12 months, the Firm also measures Economic Value Sensitivity (\u201cEVS\u201d). EVS stress\ntests the longer-term economic value of equity by measuring the sensitivity of the Firm\u2019s current balance\nsheet, primarily retained loans, deposits, debt and investment securities as well as related hedges, under\nvarious interest rate scenarios. The Firm's pricing and cash flow assumptions associated with deposits, as\nwell as prepayment assumptions for loans and securities, are significant factors in the EVS measure. In\naccordance with the CTC interest rate risk management policy, the Firm has established limits on EVS as a\npercentage of TCE. Certain assumptions used in the EVS measure may differ from those required in the fair\nvalue disclosure. For example, certain assets and liabilities with no stated maturity, such as credit card\nreceivables and deposits, have longer assumed durations in the EVS measure. Additional information on long-\nterm debt and held to maturity investment securities is disclosed on page 112 in Note 2 financial\ninstruments that are not carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n                                                     83                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Other sensitivity-based measures                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by\nassessing the potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (\u201cOCI\u201d) and noninterest expense\ndue to changes in relevant market variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to\nmarket risk on page 136 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on the positions\ncaptured in other sensitivity-based measures.\n\nThe table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-\nsensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used\nfor hedging purposes are reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the\ntable below may not be representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at June 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, as the movement in market

The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various\nportfolios which may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the Firm\u2019s exposures\nare diversified given the Firm\u2019s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country. Refer to pages 144\u2013145\nof JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm\u2019s country risk management. Risk\nReporting The following table presents the Firm\u2019s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of\nJune 30, 2024 and their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2023. The top 20 country exposures\nrepresent the Firm\u2019s largest total exposures by individual country. Country exposures may fluctuate from\nperiod to period due to a variety of factors, including client activity, market flows and liquidity\nmanagement activities undertaken by the Firm. The increase in exposure to Germany when compared to December\n31, 2023, was driven by an increase in cash placed with the central bank of Germany primarily due to client-\ndriven market-making activities and higher client deposits in CIB. The Firm continues to monitor its\nexposure to Russia, which corresponds to cash placed with the central bank, but which excludes deposits\nplaced on behalf of clients at the Deposit Insurance Agency of Russia. The Firm currently believes that its\nremaining exposure to Russia is not material.

The Firm\u2019s most complex\naccounting estimates require management\u2019s judgment\nto ascertain the appropriate carrying value of\nassets and liabilities. The Firm has established\npolicies and control procedures intended to ensure\nthat estimation methods, including any judgments\nmade as part of such methods, are well-controlled,\nindependently reviewed and applied consistently\nfrom period to period. The methods used and\njudgments made reflect, among other factors, the\nnature of the assets or liabilities and the related\nbusiness and risk management strategies, which may\nvary across the Firm\u2019s businesses and portfolios.\nIn addition, the policies and procedures are\nintended to ensure that the process for changing\nmethodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The\nFirm believes its estimates for determining the\ncarrying value of its assets and liabilities are\nappropriate. The following is a brief description\nof the Firm\u2019s critical accounting estimates\ninvolving significant judgments.\n                                                                                                            \n  Allowance for credit losses                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement\u2019s estimate of expected credit losses\nover the remaining expected life of the Firm\u2019s\nfinancial assets measured at amortized cost and\ncertain off-balance sheet lending-related\ncommitments. The allowance for credit losses\ngenerally comprises:\n\n\u2022 The allowance for loan losses, which covers the\nFirm\u2019s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-\nrated),\n\n\u2022 The allowance for lending-related commitments,\nand\n\n\u2022 The allowance for credit losses on investment\nsecurities.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses involves\nsignificant judgment on a number of matters\nincluding development and weighting of\nmacroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of\nhistorical loss experience, assessment of risk\ncharacteristics, assignment of risk ratings,\nvaluation of collateral, and the determination of\nremaining expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note\n13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2023 Form 10-K for further\ninformation on these judgments as well as the\nFirm\u2019s policies and methodologies used to determine\nthe Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses, and\nAllowance for credit losses on pages 75-77 and Note\n12 of this Form 10-Q for further information.\n\nOne of the most significant judgments involved in\nestimating the Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses\nrelates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to\nestimate credit losses over the eight-quarter\nforecast period within the Firm\u2019s methodology. The\neight-quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of\nmacroeconomic variables (\"MEVs\") that are relevant\nfor exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit\nlosses being driven primarily by a subset of less\nthan twenty variables. The specific variables that\nhave the greatest effect on the modeled losses vary\nby portfolio and geography.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include\nregional U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. HPI.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S.\nunemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices,\nU.S. interest rates, U.S. corporate credit spreads,\noil prices, U.S. commercial real estate prices and\nU.S. HPI.\n\nChanges in the Firm\u2019s assumptions and forecasts of\neconomic conditions could significantly affect its\nestimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio\nat the balance sheet date or lead to significant\nchanges in the estimate from one reporting period\nto the next.\n\nAs a result of the First Republic acquisition, the\nFirm recorded an allowance for credit losses for\nthe loans acquired and lending-related commitments\nassumed as of May 1, 2023. Given the differences in\nrisk rating methodologies for the First Republic\nportfolio, and the ongoing integration of products\nand systems, the allowance for credit losses for\nthe acquired wholesale portfolio was measured based\non other facilities underwritten by the Firm with\nsimilar risk characteristics and not based on\nmodeled estimates. The acquired wholesale portfolio\nwas incorporated into the Firm's modeled credit\nloss estimates commencing in the second quarter of\n2024, and therefore is now reflected in the\nwholesale sensitivity analysis below, resulting in\nan increase of approximately $200 million. Refer to\nNote 26 for additional information on the First\nRepublic acquisition.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes\nin any one factor or input might affect the overall\nallowance for credit losses because management\nconsiders a wide variety of factors and inputs in\nestimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes\nin the factors and inputs considered may not occur\nat the same rate and may not be consistent across\nall geographies or product types, and changes in\nfactors and inputs may be directionally\ninconsistent, such that improvement in one factor\nor input may offset deterioration in others.\n\nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate\nmacroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the\nmodeled credit losses determined using its central\nand relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which\nare two of the five scenarios considered in\nestimating the allowances for loan losses and\nlending-related commitments. The central and\nrelative adverse scenarios each included a full\nsuite of MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths\nand peaks/troughs of those variables over the\neight-quarter forecast period.\n\nFor example, compared to the Firm\u2019s central\nscenario shown on page 75 and in Note 12, the\nFirm\u2019s relative adverse scenario assumes an\nelevated U.S. unemployment rate, averaging\napproximately 2.2% higher over the eight-quarter\nforecast, with a peak difference of approximately\n3.0% in the second quarter of 2025.\n                                                     86                                                     \nThis analysis is not intended to estimate expected\nfuture changes in the allowance for credit losses,\nfor a number of reasons, including: \u2022 The allowance\nas of June 30, 2024, reflects credit losses beyond\nthose estimated under the central scenario due to\nthe weight placed on the adverse scenarios. \u2022 The\nimpacts of changes in many MEVs are both\ninterrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this\nanalysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more\nsevere changes in macroeconomic variables. \u2022\nExpectations of future changes in portfolio\ncomposition and borrower behavior can significantly\naffect the allowance for credit losses. To\ndemonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss\nestimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of June 30,\n2024, the Firm compared the modeled estimates under\nits relative adverse scenario to its central\nscenario. Without considering offsetting or\ncorrelated effects in other qualitative components\nof the Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses, the\ncomparison between these two scenarios for the\nexposures below reflect the following differences:\n\u2022 An increase of approximately $750 million for\nresidential real estate loans and lending-related\ncommitments \u2022 An increase of approximately $3.8\nbillion for credit card loans \u25aa An increase of\napproximately $4.3 billion for wholesale loans and\nlending-related commitments This analysis relates\nonly to the modeled credit loss estimates and is\nnot intended to estimate changes in the overall\nallowance for credit losses as it does not reflect\nany potential changes in other adjustments to the\nquantitative calculation, which would also be\ninfluenced by the judgment management applies to\nthe modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the\nuncertainty and imprecision of these modeled\nlifetime loss estimates based on then-current\ncircumstances and conditions. Recognizing that\nforecasts of macroeconomic conditions are\ninherently uncertain, the Firm believes that its\nprocess to consider the available information and\nassociated risks and uncertainties is appropriately\ngoverned and that its estimates of expected credit\nlosses were reasonable and appropriate for the\nperiod ended June 30, 2024.\n\nFair value JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its\nassets and liabilities at fair value. The majority\nof such assets and liabilities are measured at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis, including derivatives,\nstructured note products and certain securities\nfinancing agreements. Certain assets and\nliabilities are measured at fair value on a\nnonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage,\nhome equity and other loans, where the carrying\nvalue is based on the fair value of the underlying\ncollateral.

The level 3 balances would be reduced if\nnetting were applied, including the netting benefit\nassociated with cash collateral.\n                                                     87                                                     \nValuation\nEstimating fair value requires the application of\njudgment. The type and level of judgment required\nis largely dependent on the amount of observable\nmarket information available to the Firm. For\ninstruments valued using internally developed\nvaluation models and other valuation techniques\nthat use significant unobservable inputs and are\ntherefore classified within level 3 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair\nvalue are more significant than those required when\nestimating the fair value of instruments classified\nwithin levels 1 and 2.\n\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an\ninstrument within level 3, management must first\ndetermine the appropriate valuation model or other\nvaluation technique to use. Second, the lack of\nobservability of certain significant inputs\nrequires management to assess relevant empirical\ndata in deriving valuation inputs including, for\nexample, transaction details, yield curves,\ninterest rates, prepayment speeds, default rates,\nvolatilities, correlations, prices (such as\ncommodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of\ncomparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and\ncredit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further\ndiscussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments,\nincluding unobservable inputs used.\n\nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3,\nmanagement judgment must be applied to assess the\nappropriate level of valuation adjustments to\nreflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm\u2019s\ncreditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity\nconsiderations, unobservable parameters, and for\nportfolios that meet specified criteria, the size\nof the net open risk position. The judgments made\nare typically affected by the type of product and\nits specific contractual terms, and the level of\nliquidity for the product or within the market as a\nwhole. In periods of heightened market volatility\nand uncertainty judgments are further affected by\nthe wider variation of reasonable valuation\nestimates, particularly for positions that are less\nliquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of\nvaluation adjustments applied by the Firm.\n\nImprecision in estimating unobservable market\ninputs or other factors can affect the amount of\ngain or loss recorded for a particular position.\nFurthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation\nmethods are appropriate and consistent with those\nof other market participants, the methods and\nassumptions used reflect management judgment and\nmay vary across the Firm\u2019s businesses and\nportfolios.\n\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions\nin the determination of fair value.

(\u201cJPMorgan Chase\u201d or the \u201cFirm\u201d), a financial holding company incorporated under\nDelaware law in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The\nFirm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial\nbanking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 25 for further discussion of\nthe Firm's business segments. On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets and assumed certain\nliabilities of First Republic Bank (the \u201cFirst Republic acquisition\u201d) from the FDIC. The Firm continues to\nconvert certain operations, and to integrate clients, products and services associated with the First\nRepublic acquisition, to align with the Firm\u2019s businesses and operations. Accordingly, reporting\nclassification and internal risk rating profiles in the wholesale portfolio may change in future periods.\nRefer to Note 26 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition. The accounting and financial\nreporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where\napplicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory\nauthorities. The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,\nrevenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be\ndifferent from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been\nincluded such that this interim financial information is fairly stated. These unaudited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and\nrelated notes thereto, included in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K. Consolidation The Consolidated Financial\nStatements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling\nfinancial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Assets held\nfor clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not\nincluded on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial\ninterest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable\ninterest entity. Refer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K for a further description of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s accounting policies regarding consolidation. Offsetting assets and liabilities U.S. GAAP\npermits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and\nthe related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when\na legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities financing balances\nto be presented on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally\nenforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances where it has determined that\nthe specified conditions are met. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K for further information\non offsetting assets and liabilities. Accounting standard adopted January 1, 2024 Equity Method and Joint\nVentures: Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method The\nguidance expanded the types of tax-oriented investments, beyond affordable housing tax credit investments,\nthat the Firm can elect on a program by program basis, to be accounted for using the proportional\namortization method. This method requires the cost of eligible investments, within an elected program, to be\namortized in proportion to the tax benefits received with the resulting amortization reported directly in\nincome tax expense, which aligns with the associated tax credits and other tax benefits. Eligible\ninvestments must meet certain criteria, including that substantially all of the return is from income tax\ncredits and other income tax benefits. This guidance was adopted on January 1, 2024 under the modified\nretrospective method. The adoption of this guidance resulted in a change to the classification and timing of\nthe amortization associated with certain of the Firm's alternative energy tax-oriented investments. As a\nresult of the adoption, the amortization of these investments that was previously recognized in other income\nis now being recognized in income tax expense. The change in accounting resulted in a decrease to retained\nearnings of $ 161million and increased the Firm\u2019s income tax expense and the effective tax rate by\napproximately $ 450million and twopercentage points, respectively, in the first quarter of 2024, with no\nmaterial impact to net income.\n                                                     96                                                     \nThe guidance requires additional disclosure for all investments that generate income tax credits and other\nincome tax benefits from a tax-oriented investment program for which the Firm has elected to apply the\nproportional amortization method. The guidance also requires a reevaluation of eligible investments when\nsignificant modifications or events occur that result in a change in the nature of the investment or a\nchange in the Firm's relationship with the underlying project. Refer to Notes 5 and 13 for additional\ninformation.\n                                                     97                                                     \n

realizable value\u201d is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell\n(\u201ctransaction costs\u201d). Transaction costs for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories are either not\napplicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair\nvalue for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net\nrealizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because\nunder fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 4 for\na further discussion of the Firm\u2019s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value\ndisclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.\n                                                    100                                                     \n(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical\nsecurities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).\n\n(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its\nequivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At both\nJune 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge\nfunds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $ 1.0billion. Included in these balances at\nJune 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, were trading assets of $ 45million and $ 42million, respectively, and\nother assets of $ 964million and $ 984million, respectively.\n\n(e) At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, included $ 10.5billion and $ 10.2billion, respectively, of\nresidential first-lien mortgages, and $ 5.4billion and $ 6.0billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien\nmortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell\nto U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $ 4.5billion and $ 2.9billion, respectively.\n\n(f) At June 30, 2024, includes the Firm\u2019s Visa C shares that are held at fair value. Refer to page 111 for\nadditional information.\n\n(g) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables\nand the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement\nexists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit\nassociated with cash collateral.\n\nLevel 3 valuations\n\nRefer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm\u2019s valuation process\nand a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. The\nfollowing table presents the Firm\u2019s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to\nmeasure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of\nvalues for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to\nclassify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall\nfair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is,\ncomponents that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the\nunobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the\nFirm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and\nderivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of\nvalues presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the\nsignificant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted\naverages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the\ninstruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm\u2019s view, the input range, weighted and\narithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the\nreasonableness of the Firm\u2019s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the\nvarious instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of\ncharacteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and\nvaluation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option\ncontracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted and arithmetic\naverage values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the\ncharacteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.\n                                                    101                                                     \n

their classification on the Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each\nvaluation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the\ntechnique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ.\n\n(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $ 708million, nonagency securities of $ 5million\nand non-trading loans of $ 810million.\n\n(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $ 11million, trading loans of $ 65million and non-trading loans of $\n1.5billion.\n\n(d) Comprises trading loans of $ 626million and non-trading loans of $ 720million.\n\n(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are\nfinancial instruments that typically contain embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of\nstructured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant\nunobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.\n\n(f) Includes equity securities of $ 776million including $ 654million in Other assets, for which quoted\nprices are not readily available and the fair value is generally based on internal valuation techniques such\nas EBITDA multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant both\nindividually and in aggregate.\n\n(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not\nreadily available, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal valuation techniques. The price\ninput is expressed assuming a par value of $ 100.\n\n(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.\n\n(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are\nused.\n                                                    102                                                     \nChanges in and ranges of unobservable inputs Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K for a\ndiscussion of the impact on fair value of changes in unobservable inputs and the relationships between\nunobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market\nfactors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm\u2019s positions. Changes in level 3\nrecurring fair value measurements The following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance\nsheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within\nlevel 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. When a\ndetermination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the\nsignificance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial\ninstruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components\n(that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the\ngains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are\npart of the valuation methodology. The Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial\ninstruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains\nor losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm\u2019s risk management activities related\nto such level 3 instruments.\n                                                    103                                                     \n

Three and six months ended June 30,\n2024 Level 3 assets were $ 25.6billion at June 30, 2024, reflecting an increase of $ 860million from March\n31, 2024, and an increase of $ 1.9billion from December 31, 2023. The increase for the three months ended\nJune 30, 2024 was largely driven by higher: \u2022 MSRs of $ 242million, and \u2022 Other Assets of $ 391million\npredominantly due to purchases. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was predominantly driven\nby higher: \u2022 Gross derivative receivables of $ 1.3billion due to gains, purchases and net transfers largely\noffset by settlements, \u2022 MSRs of $ 325million, and \u2022 Other Assets of $ 444million predominantly due to\npurchases.

On April 8, 2024, Visa commenced an initial exchange offer for any and all outstanding\nVisa B-1 shares. On May 6, 2024, the Firm announced that Visa had accepted the Firm\u2019s tender of its\n37.2million Visa B-1 shares in exchange for a combination of Visa B-2 shares and Visa Class C common shares\n(\u201cVisa C shares\u201d). The Visa C shares are included in Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis on page 99. Visa's acceptance resulted in an initial gain of $ 8.0billion based on the fair\nvalue of the Visa C shares. In addition, the current quarter also reflected other Visa-related activity,\nincluding the fair value changes of the Visa C shares and derivative instruments, as well as dividends,\nresulting in the $ 7.9billion net gain on Visa shares. As of June 30, 2024, approximately $ 2billion of Visa\nC shares are subject to a lock-up restriction that expires on August 4, 2024.\n\nThe Visa B-2 shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A\ncommon shares (\u201cVisa A shares\u201d) at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain litigation\nmatters involving Visa. The conversion rate of Visa B-2 shares to Visa A shares was 1.5875at June 30, 2024\nand may be adjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the litigation matters. The outcome of\nthose litigation matters, and the effect that the resolution of those matters may have on the conversion\nrate, is unknown. Accordingly, as of June 30, 2024, there is significant uncertainty regarding when the\ntransfer restrictions on Visa B-2 shares may be terminated and what the final conversion rate for the Visa\nB-2 shares will be. As a result of these considerations, as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B-2\nshares are not considered to be similar to Visa A shares, and are held at their nominal carryover basis.\n\nIn connection with prior sales of Visa Class B common shares prior to the redenomination to Visa B-1 shares,\nthe Firm has entered into derivative instruments with the purchasers of the shares under which the Firm\nretains the risk associated with changes in the conversion rate. The notional amount of shares associated\nwith those derivative instruments has been adjusted as a result of the Visa exchange offer.

the\ncharacteristics of the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual\nfees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and\nprimary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the\nvalue of the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan\u2019s allowance for\nloan losses, which represents the loan\u2019s expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The\ndifference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to\nchanges in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that\naffect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value.\n(b) Excludes lending-related commitments disclosed in the table below.\nThe majority of the Firm\u2019s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets.

due as of June 30, 2024 and December\n31, 2023.\n(c) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-\nterm beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests,\nfor which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-protected\nstructured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of\nprincipal at maturity, but for structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an\nunderlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit\nrisk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.\n(d) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the\ncontractual principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm\u2019s\nnext call date.\nAt June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the\nfair value option was elected was $ 11.5billion and $ 9.7billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair\nvalue of $ 55million and $ 97million, respectively.

Excluded components may impact earnings either through amortization of the\ninitial amount over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current\nperiod.\n(f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the\namortization approach, predominantly cross-currency basis spreads.

yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period,\nweighted based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon,\namortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives,\nincluding closed portfolio hedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield\nexcludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from\ntheir contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable\ndebt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.\n(b) For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the allowance\nfor credit losses of $ 52million and the portfolio layer fair value hedge basis adjustments of $( 1.3)\nbillion at June 30, 2024. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities also excludes the allowance for\ncredit losses of $ 125million at June 30, 2024.\n(c) Substantially all of the Firm\u2019s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in\n10years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects\nanticipated future prepayments, is approximately eight yearsfor agency residential MBS and six yearsfor both\nagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and nonagency residential collateralized mortgage\nobligations.\n                                                    137                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Note 10 \u2013 Securities financing activities                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \nRefer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting policies relating to\nsecurities financing activities. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding securities financing\nagreements for which the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 23 for further information\nregarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements. The table below\nsummarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm\u2019s securities financing agreements as of June 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting\nagreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm\nnets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements\nwith the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its\ncounterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for\nnet Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with\nrespect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with securities financing\nbalances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table\nbelow as \u201cAmounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,\u201d and reduces the \u201cNet amounts\u201d presented.\nWhere a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are\npresented gross in the \u201cNet amounts\u201d below. In transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a\nsecurities-for-securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as\ncollateral, the Firm recognizes the securities received at fair value within other assets and the obligation\nto return those securities within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n

The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance,\nresidential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the\nborrower (\u201cChapter 7 loans\u201d) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual loans, regardless of their delinquency\nstatus. At June 30, 2024, approximately 9% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more\npast due.\n\n(b) Mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies excluded from nonaccrual loans were not material at\nJune 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\n(c) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance,\ncertain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of\namortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the\nunderlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.\n\n(d) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $ 42million and $ 44million and $\n85million and $ 89million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n(e) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property\nvalue. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using\nnationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available\nand forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home\nequity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.\n\n(f) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower\u2019s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm\non at least a quarterly basis.\n\n(g) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO\nscore. These loans have been included in a FICO band based on management\u2019s estimation of the borrower\u2019s\ncredit quality.\n\n(h) Included U.S. government-guaranteed loans as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\n(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.\n\n(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding\nloan balances at June 30, 2024.\n                                                    144                                                     \nLoan modifications The Firm grants certain\nmodifications of residential real estate loans to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The\nFirm's proprietary modification programs as well as\ngovernment programs, including U.S. GSE programs,\nthat generally provide various modifications to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty\nincluding, but not limited to, interest rate\nreductions, term extensions, other-than-\ninsignificant payment deferral and principal\nforgiveness that would otherwise have been required\nunder the terms of the original agreement, are\nconsidered FDMs. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan\nChase's 2023 Form 10-K for further information.\nFinancial effects of FDMs For the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2024, residential real estate\nFDMs were $ 68million and $ 98million,\nrespectively. The financial effects of the FDMs,\nwhich were predominantly in the form of term\nextensions and interest rate reductions, included\nextending the weighted-average life of the loans by\n7years and 10years, and reducing the weighted-\naverage contractual interest rate from 7.59% to\n6.04% and 7.58% to 5.50% for the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2024, respectively. For the\nthree and six months ended June 30, 2023,\nresidential real estate FDMs were $ 35million and $\n75million, respectively. The financial effects of\nthe FDMs, which were largely in the form of term\nextensions and interest rate reductions, included\nextending the weighted-average life of the loans by\n15years and 18years, and reducing the weighted-\naverage contractual interest rate from 6.90% to\n4.21% and 6.75% to 4.01% for the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2023, respectively. As of\nJune 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were\nnoadditional commitments to lend to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty whose loans have\nbeen modified as FDMs. For the three and six months\nended June 30, 2024 and 2023, loans subject to a\ntrial modification, where the terms of the loans\nhave not been permanently modified, and Chapter 7\nloans were not material.\n\nPayment status of FDMs\nThe following table provides information on the\npayment status of FDMs during the twelve months\nended June 30, 2024 and the six months ended June\n30, 2023.\n                                                                                 \n  (in millions)                               Amortized cost basis               \n  Twelve months ended June 30,  2024     Six months ended June 30,  2023         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Current                             $                        125        $  64  \n  30-149 days past due                                          19            5  \n  150 or more days past due                                     14            6  \n  Total                               $                        158        $  75  \n                                                                                 \nDefaults of FDMs FDMs that defaulted in the three\nand six months ended June 30, 2024 and were\nreported as FDMs in the twelve months prior to the\ndefault were not material.

In accordance with regulatory guidance,\ncertain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of\namortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the\nunderlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.\n\n(b) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 .\n\n(c) The geographic regions presented in this table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding\nloan balances at June 30, 2024.\n\nLoan modifications The Firm grants certain modifications of auto and other loans to borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty.

certain modifications of credit card loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.\nThese modifications may involve placing the customer\u2019s credit card account on a fixed payment plan,\ngenerally for 60months, which typically includes reducing the interest rate on the credit card account. If\nthe borrower does not make the contractual payments when due under the modified payment terms, the credit\ncard loan continues to age and will be charged-off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy.\nIn most cases, the Firm does not reinstate the borrower's line of credit.\n\nFinancial effects of FDMs\nThe following tables provide information on credit card loan modifications

\n(a) Represents the impact to the allowance for loan losses upon the adoption of the Financial Instruments -\nCredit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings accounting guidance. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase's 2023\nForm 10-K for further information.\n(b) At June 30, 2024 and 2023, in addition to the allowance for credit losses in the table above, the Firm\nalso had an allowance for credit losses of $ 278million and $ 18million, respectively, associated with\ncertain accounts receivable in CIB.\n(c) Includes collateral-dependent loans, including those for which foreclosure is deemed probable, and\nnonaccrual risk-rated loans.\n(d) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets.\n(e) At June 30, 2024 and 2023, lending-related commitments excluded $ 19.8billion and $ 18.4billion,\nrespectively, for the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment; $ 964.7billion and $ 881.5billion,\nrespectively, for the credit card portfolio segment; and $ 32.6billion and $ 19.3billion, respectively, for\nthe wholesale portfolio segment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-related commitments.\n                                                    157                                                     \nDiscussion of changes in the allowance The allowance for credit losses as of June 30, 2024 was $ 25.5billion\n, reflecting a net addition of $ 749million from December 31, 2023. The net addition to the allowance for\ncredit losses included: \u2022 $ 653million in consumer , reflecting a $ 753million net addition in Card\nServices, predominantly driven by the seasoning of newer vintages, loan growth, and updates to certain\nmacroeconomic variables, and a $ 125million net reduction in Home Lending, and \u2022 $ 47million in wholesale ,\ndriven by \u2013 a net addition of $ 707million, reflecting net downgrade activity, primarily in Real Estate, and\nincluded approximately $ 200million associated with incorporating the First Republic portfolio into the\nFirm\u2019s modeled credit loss estimates, predominantly offset by \u2013 a net reduction of $ 660million, primarily\ndue to the impact of changes in the loan and lending-related commitment portfolios and updates to certain\nmacroeconomic variables. The Firm has maintained the additional weight placed on the adverse scenarios in\nthe first quarter of 2023 to reflect ongoing uncertainties and downside risks related to the geopolitical\nand macroeconomic environment. The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average\nof five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive\nmacroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in a weighted\naverage U.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.3% in the second quarter of 2025, and a weighted average U.S.\nreal GDP level that is 2.1% lower than the central case at the end of the fourth quarter of 2025.\nThe following table presents the Firm\u2019s central\ncase assumptions for the periods presented:\n                                                                                       \n                                    Central case assumptions                           \n                                            at June 30, 2024                           \n                                                        4Q24       2Q25       4Q25     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. unemployment rate(a)                              4.1  %     4.1  %     4.0  %  \n  YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                         1.5  %     1.6  %     1.9  %  \n                                    Central case assumptions                           \n                                        at December 31, 2023                           \n                                                        2Q24       4Q24       2Q25     \n  U.S. unemployment rate(a)                              4.1  %     4.4  %     4.1  %  \n  YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                         1.8  %     0.7  %     1.0  %  \n                                                                                       \n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S.\nunemployment rate.\n(b) The year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in\nthe forecast horizon of the central scenario is\ncalculated as the percentage change in U.S. real\nGDP levels from the prior year.

and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n(d) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the\nliabilities of those entities. The assets and liabilities include third-party assets and liabilities of\nconsolidated VIEs and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.\n(e) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified on the\nConsolidated balance sheets as \u201cBeneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs\u201d. The holders of these\nbeneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. Included in\nbeneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $ 5.4billion and $ 3.1billion at\nJune 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance\nsheets.\nVIEs sponsored by third parties The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties.\nThese include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter,\nplacement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm\u2019s-length,\nand individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the\nquality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE\nthat most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially\nbe significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions\non its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any\nother third-party transaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit\nvehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing,\nalternative energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is\ntypically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax\ncredit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally\ninvests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax\ncredits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding\ncommitments, was $ 33.6billion and $ 35.1billion at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, of which $\n14.0billion and $ 14.7billion was unfunded at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Firm\nassesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment\nuntil the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K for further\ninformation on affordable housing tax credits and Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for more information on off-\nbalance sheet lending-related commitments. Effective January 1, 2024, the Firm adopted updates to the\nAccounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method guidance\nwhich expanded the types of tax-oriented investments, beyond affordable housing tax credit investments, that\nthe Firm can elect on a program by program basis, to be accounted for\n                                                    162                                                     \nusing the proportional amortization method. Refer\nto Note 1 for further information. The proportional\namortization method requires the cost of eligible\ninvestments, within an elected program, be\namortized in proportion to the tax benefits\nreceived with the resulting amortization reported\ndirectly in income tax expense, which aligns with\nthe associated tax credits and other tax benefits.\nInvestments must meet certain criteria to be\neligible, including that substantially all of the\nreturn is from income tax credits and other income\ntax benefits. In addition, under this method\ndeferred taxes are generally not recorded as the\ninvestment is now amortized in proportion to the\nincome tax credits and other income tax benefits\nreceived. Delayed equity contributions that are\nunconditional and legally binding or conditional\nand probable of occurring are recorded in other\nliabilities with a corresponding increase in the\ncarrying value of the investment. The guidance also\nrequires a reevaluation of eligible investments\nwhen significant modifications or events occur that\nresult in a change in the nature of the investment\nor a change in the Firm's relationship with the\nunderlying project. During the period, there were\nno significant modifications or events that\nresulted in a change in the nature of an eligible\ninvestment or a change in the Firm's relationship\nwith the underlying

In certain customer TOB transactions, the\nFirm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those\ntransactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders\nfor any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on\nany of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm\ndoes not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the\nmunicipal bond vehicle. The Firm\u2019s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at June\n30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $ 5.3billion and $ 5.1billion, respectively.

These loans and excess MSRs are\nsold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions\n(e.g., credit enhancement of the loans).

Refer to Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K for a further discussion of\nthe Firm\u2019s goodwill impairment testing. Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit\nlosses, increases in capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions,\nadverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause\nthe estimated fair values of the Firm\u2019s reporting units to decline in the future, which could result in a\nmaterial impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated\ngoodwill. As of June 30, 2024, the Firm reviewed current economic conditions, estimated market cost of\nequity, as well as actual business results and projections of business performance. In addition, as a result\nof the business segment reorganization, the Firm assessed goodwill for impairment. Based on such reviews,\nthe Firm has concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of June 30, 2024, or December 31, 2023, nor was\ngoodwill written off due to impairment during the six months ended June 30, 2024 or 2023.\n                                                    166                                                     \nMortgage servicing rights\n\nMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others.\nThe fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to\nservice the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively\namortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased\nfrom third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained.\nRefer to Notes 2 and 15 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K for a further description of the MSR asset,\ninterest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs.\nThe following table summarizes MSR activity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\n                                                                                                            \n  (in millions,            As of or for

The Firm\u2019s credit risk associated with these servicer\nadvances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to\ninvestors.

The contractual amount of these financial instruments\nrepresents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the\ncommitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or\nclient subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and\nguarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a\ndefault occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm\u2019s\nview, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K for a further discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and\nthe Firm\u2019s related accounting policies. To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain\nconsumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is\nmaintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-\nrelated commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-\nbalance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at June 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain scored business\nbanking lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has\nnot experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be\nutilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business banking\nlines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In\naddition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60days or more past due. The Firm\nmay reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or\nwhen there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.\n                                                    178                                                     \n

The liability related to\nrepurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in\nestablishing its litigation reserves. Refer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n2023 Form 10-K for additional information regarding litigation.\n                                                    180                                                     \nMerchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment\nnetworks, in its role as a merchant acquirer, the\nFirm's Merchant Services business in CIB Payments,\nretains a contingent liability for disputed\nprocessed credit and debit card transactions that\nresult in a charge-back to the merchant. If a\ndispute is resolved in the cardholder\u2019s favor, the\nFirm will (through the cardholder\u2019s issuing bank)\ncredit or refund the amount to the cardholder and\nwill charge back the transaction to the merchant.\nIf the Firm is unable to collect the amount from\nthe merchant, the Firm will bear the loss for the\namount credited or refunded to the cardholder. The\nFirm mitigates this risk by withholding future\nsettlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or\nobtaining other collateral. In addition, the Firm\nrecognizes a valuation allowance that covers the\npayment or performance risk related to charge-\nbacks. Sponsored member repo program The Firm acts\nas a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight\nand term resale and repurchase agreements through\nthe Government Securities Division of the Fixed\nIncome Clearing Corporation (\u201cFICC\u201d) on behalf of\nclients that become sponsored members under the\nFICC\u2019s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC\nthe prompt and full payment and performance of its\nsponsored member clients\u2019 respective obligations\nunder the FICC\u2019s rules. The Firm minimizes its\nliability under these guarantees by obtaining a\nsecurity interest in the cash or high-quality\nsecurities collateral that the clients place with\nthe clearing house; therefore, the Firm expects the\nrisk of loss to be remote. The Firm\u2019s maximum\npossible exposure, without taking into\nconsideration the associated collateral, is\nincluded in the Exchange & clearing house\nguarantees and commitments line on page 179. Refer\nto Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K for\nadditional information on credit risk mitigation\npractices on resale agreements and the types of\ncollateral pledged under repurchase agreements.\nGuarantees of subsidiaries The Parent Company has\nguaranteed certain long-term debt and structured\nnotes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase\nFinancial Company LLC (\u201cJPMFC\u201d), a 100%-owned\nfinance subsidiary.

The litigations range from individual\nactions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members.\nInvestigations and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both\ngovernmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of\nadjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm\u2019s lines of business and several\ngeographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory\nantitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm\nbelieves the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves\nestablished, for its legal proceedings is from $ 0to approximately $ 1.7billion at June 30, 2024. This\nestimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date\nfor those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made.\nFor certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The\nFirm\u2019s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: \u2022\nthe number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary\nstages, \u2022 the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of\nliability (if any) has yet to be determined, \u2022 the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the\nproceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and \u2022 the\nuncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made\nassumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives\nof adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition, the\noutcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate\nbecause the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm\u2019s estimate of\nthe aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary\nsignificantly. Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm\u2019s material legal proceedings. 1MDB Litigation .\nJ.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by\n1Malaysia Development Berhad (\u201c1MDB\u201d), a Malaysian state-owned and controlled investment fund. The claim\nalleges \u201cdishonest assistance\u201d against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in relation to payments of $ 300million and $\n500million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan\n(Suisse) SA held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings\n(Cayman) Limited. In March 2024, the Court upheld the Firm's challenge to the validity of service and the\nMalaysian Court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear the claim. That decision has been appealed by 1MDB. In August 2023,\nthe Court denied an application by 1MDB to discontinue its claim with permission to re-file a new claim in\nthe future. An appeals court is scheduled in August 2024 to hear separate appeals filed by 1MDB and the Firm\nagainst that August 2023 decision. In its appeal, the Firm seeks to prevent any claim from continuing. In\naddition, in November 2023, the Federal Office of the Attorney General (OAG) in Switzerland notified J.P.\nMorgan (Suisse) SA that it is conducting an investigation into possible criminal liability in connection\nwith transactions arising from J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA\u2019s relationship with the 1MDB PetroSaudi joint venture\nand its related persons for the period September 2009 through August 2015. The OAG investigation is ongoing.\nAmrapali . India\u2019s Enforcement Directorate (\u201cED\u201d) is investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in\nconnection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by twooffshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase\nentities into residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (\u201cAmrapali\u201d) relating to delays\nin delivering or failure to deliver residential units. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P.\nMorgan India Private Limited approximately $ 31.5million, and the Firm is appealing that order. Relatedly,\nin July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other\nparties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the\nprojects, violated certain criminal currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordered the ED to\nconduct a further inquiry. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the inquiry. Foreign Exchange\nInvestigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities\nrelating to its foreign exchange (\u201cFX\u201d) sales and trading activities and controls related to those\nactivities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal\nantitrust law. The Department of Labor (\"DOL\") granted the Firm exemptions\n                                                    182                                                     \nthat permit the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager\nexemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d) through the ten-yeardisqualification\nperiod following the antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa\nCompetition Commission matter which is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal. With\nrespect to civil litigation matters, in a putative class action filed against the Firm and other foreign\nexchange dealers on behalf of certain parties who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates,\nthe United States District Court for the Southern District of New York denied certification of a class and\ngranted summary judgment against the named plaintiffs in March 2023. In May 2024, the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the District Court's decision, and in July 2024, plaintiffs\u2019\nsubsequent petition for en banc review by the full Court of Appeals was denied. In addition, some FX-related\nindividual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside\nthe U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. An agreement to resolve one\nof the U.K. actions was reached in December 2022. In July 2023, the U.K. Court of Appeal overturned the\nCompetition Appeal Tribunal's earlier denial of a request for class certification on an opt-out basis. In\nIsrael, a settlement in principle has been reached on the putative class action, which remains subject to\ncourt approval. Government Inquiries Related to the Zelle Network . The Firm is responding to inquiries from\nthe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) regarding the transfers of funds through the Zelle Network.\nIn connection with this, the CFPB Staff has informed the Firm that it is authorized to pursue a resolution\nof the inquiries or file an enforcement action. The Firm is evaluating next steps, including litigation.\nInterchange Litigation . Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action\ncomplaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit\nand debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In September 2018,\nthe parties settled the class action seeking monetary relief, with the defendants collectively contributing\napproximately $ 6.2billion. The settlement has been approved by the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of New York and affirmed on appeal. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of\nthe settlement, $ 700million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow. A separate\nclass action seeking injunctive relief continues, and in September 2021, the District Court granted\nplaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion in part. In June 2024, the\nDistrict Court denied preliminary approval of a settlement of the injunctive class action in which Visa and\nMastercard agreed to certain changes to their respective network rules and system-wide reductions in\ninterchange rates for U.S.-based merchants. The parties are considering next steps. Of the merchants who\nopted out of the damages class settlement, certain merchants filed individual actions raising similar\nallegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks. While some of those\nactions remain pending, the defendants have reached settlements with the merchants who opted out\nrepresenting over 70% of the combined Mastercard-branded and Visa-branded payment card sales volume. LIBOR\nand Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation . JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from\nvarious governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers\nAssociation\u2019s (\u201cBBA\u201d) London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) for various currencies and the European\nBanking Federation\u2019s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cEURIBOR\u201d). The Swiss Competition Commission\u2019s\ninvestigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain subject, continues. The Firm\nappealed a December 2016 decision by the European Commission against the Firm and other banks finding an\ninfringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. In December 2023, the European General Court\nannulled the fine imposed by the European Commission, but exercised its discretion to re-impose a fine in an\nidentical amount. In March 2024, the Firm filed an appeal of this decision with the Court of Justice of the\nEuropean Union. In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in various\nindividual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions\nrelated to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has obtained\ndismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other actions, and others are in various stages of\nlitigation. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York has granted class\ncertification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants,\nincluding the Firm. In addition, a lawsuit filed by a group of individual plaintiffs asserting antitrust\nclaims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar\nLIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards was dismissed\nin October 2023. Plaintiffs' appeal of the dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit filed in November 2023 remains pending. The Firm has resolved all non-U.S. dollar LIBOR actions.\nRussian Litigation. The Firm is obligated to comply with international sanctions laws, which mandate the\nblocking of certain assets. These laws apply when assets associated with individuals, companies, products or\nservices are within the scope of the sanctions. The Firm has faced actual and threatened litigation in\nRussia seeking payments on transactions that the Firm cannot make under, and is contractually excused from\npaying as a result of, relevant sanctions laws. In claims involving the Firm and claims filed\n                                                    183                                                     \nagainst other financial institutions, Russian courts have disregarded the parties\u2019 contractual agreements\nconcerning forum selection and did not recognize foreign sanctions laws as a basis for not making payment.\nAs to claims against the Firm, a Russian court entered judgment against the Firm in one claim in February\n2024, which was executed in July 2024 against assets held onshore by the Firm in Russia. The Firm continues\nto appeal the Russian court\u2019s decision. In separate claims, in April 2024, Russian courts ordered an interim\nfreeze of assets in Russia (including funds in bank accounts, securities, shares in authorized capital, and\ncertain trademarks, of the named defendants) pending a determination on the underlying claims. Russian\ncourts may rule similarly in other cases, including ordering freezes and seizure of assets. The Firm\nchallenged the April 2024 freeze orders in the Russian courts and in a New York federal court action, and a\nRussian court has issued an order instructing the Firm to discontinue the New York action. The value of the\ncurrent claims and the orders to freeze assets against the Firm exceed the total amount of available assets\nthat the Firm holds in Russia. If further claims are enforced despite the actions taken by the Firm to\nchallenge the claims and orders and to seek the proper application of law, the Firm\u2019s assets in Russia could\nbe seized in full or the Firm could be prevented from complying with its obligations. SEC Inquiries . The\nFirm is responding to requests from the SEC regarding aspects of certain advisory programs within J.P.\nMorgan Securities LLC, including aggregation of accounts for billing, discounting advisory fees, and\nselecting portfolio managers. Separately, the Firm is responding to requests from the SEC in connection with\nthe timing of the Firm\u2019s liquidation of shares distributed in-kind to certain investment vehicles that\ninvest in third-party managed private funds. The Firm continues to cooperate and is currently engaged in\nresolution discussions with the SEC. There is no assurance that such discussions will result in resolutions\nSecurities Lending Antitrust Litigation . JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan\nPrime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class\naction filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint\nasserts violations of federal antitrust law and New York State common law in connection with an alleged\nconspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange trading for securities lending transactions. The\nsettlement of this action by the parties has been preliminarily approved, and is subject to final court\napproval. Shareholder Litigation . Several shareholder putative class actions, as well as shareholder\nderivative actions purporting to act on behalf of the Firm, have been filed against the Firm, its Board of\nDirectors and certain of its current and former officers. Certain of these shareholder suits relate to\nhistorical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and\nrelated conduct which were the subject of the Firm\u2019s resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September\n2020, and fiduciary activities that were separately the subject of a resolution between JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. and the OCC in November 2020. One of these shareholder derivative suits was filed in the Supreme Court\nof the State of New York in May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims\nrelating to the historical trading practices and related conduct and fiduciary activities which were the\nsubject of the resolutions described above. In December 2022, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion to\ndismiss this action in full, and in July 2023, the plaintiff filed an appeal, which remains pending. A\nseparate shareholder derivative suit was filed in March 2022 in the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of New York asserting state claims of breaches of fiduciary duty and federal claims of\nviolations of federal securities laws based on the alleged failure of the Board of Directors to exercise\nadequate oversight over the Firm\u2019s compliance with records preservation requirements which were the subject\nof resolutions between certain of the Firm\u2019s subsidiaries and the SEC and the CFTC. In March 2024, the Court\ngranted Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the federal claims and declined to exercise jurisdiction over the\nremaining state claims. Trading Venues Investigations . The Firm has been responding to government inquiries\nregarding its processes to inventory trading venues and confirm the completeness of certain data fed to\ntrade surveillance platforms. The Firm self-identified that certain trading and order data through the CIB\nwas not feeding into its trade surveillance platforms. The Firm has completed enhancements to the CIB\u2019s\nvenue inventory and data completeness controls, and other remediation is underway. The Firm has also\nperformed a review of the data not originally surveilled and has not identified any employee misconduct,\nharm to clients or the market. While the identified gaps represent a fraction of the overall activity across\nthe CIB, the data gap on one venue, which largely consisted of sponsored client access activity, was\nsignificant. The Firm is dedicated to maintaining rigorous controls and continuously enhancing the\nreliability of its trade infrastructure. The Firm entered into resolutions with the OCC and the Board of\nGovernors of the FRB in March 2024 and with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in May 2024. The\nresolutions required the Firm to, among other things, pay aggregate civil penalties of $ 450million, which\nthe Firm has paid, and to complete the Firm\u2019s remediation. The Firm has also engaged an independent\ncompliance consultant as required by the resolutions. The Firm does not expect any disruption of service to\nclients as a result of these resolutions. * * * In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed\nabove, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a\nsubstantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has\n                                                    184                                                     \nmeritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it\nintends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the\nfuture. The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal\nproceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a\nlitigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of\nthe loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to\nassess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate,\nbased on management\u2019s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm\u2019s legal expense was $\n317million and $ 420million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. There is no\nassurance that the Firm\u2019s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future. In view of the\ninherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek\nvery large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large\nnumber of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be\nthe eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the\neventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based\nupon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal\nproceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated\naggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not\nhave a material adverse effect on the Firm\u2019s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that\nin light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate\nresolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a\nmatter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may\nbe material to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other\nfactors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s income for that period.\n                                                    185                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Note 25 \u2013 Business segments                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm is managed on an LOB basis. Effective in the second quarter of 2024, the Firm reorganized its\nreportable business segments by combining the former Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking\nbusiness segments to form one reportable segment, the Commercial & Investment Bank (\u201cCIB\u201d). As a result of\nthe reorganization, the Firm now has threereportable business segments: Consumer & Community Banking,\nCommercial & Investment Bank, and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment. The\nbusiness segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer\nserved, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm\u2019s\nOperating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and\nReconciliation of the Firm\u2019s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 18-19 for a definition of managed\nbasis. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K for a further discussion of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbusiness segments. Segment results The following table provides a summary of the Firm\u2019s segment results as\nof or for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, on a managed basis. The Firm\u2019s definition\nof managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to\npresent total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis.\nAccordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the\nmanaged results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm\u2019s managed basis. Capital allocation The amount\nof capital assigned to each business segment is referred to as equity.

The acquisition resulted in\na bargain purchase gain, which represents the\nexcess of the estimated fair value of the net\nassets acquired above the purchase price. The Firm\nhas determined that this acquisition constitutes a\nbusiness combination under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly,\nthe initial recognition of the assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed were generally measured at\ntheir estimated fair values as of May 1, 2023. The\ndetermination of those fair values required\nmanagement to make certain market-based assumptions\nabout expected future cash flows, discount rates\nand other valuation inputs at the time of the\nacquisition. The Firm believes that the fair value\nestimates of the assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed provide a reasonable basis for determining\nthe estimated bargain purchase gain. The First\nRepublic acquisition resulted in a preliminary\nestimated bargain purchase gain of $ 2.7billion. As\nthe one-year measurement period permitted by U.S.\nGAAP has now concluded, management has finalized\nits fair value estimates for the assets acquired\nand liabilities assumed. The final bargain purchase\ngain of $ 2.9billion reflects adjustments made\nduring the measurement period to the fair value of\nthe net assets acquired, including an increase of $\n119million and $ 103million for the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2024, respectively. Certain\nmatters related to the final settlement remain\noutstanding between the Firm and the FDIC. Any\nsubsequent adjustments will not impact the final\nbargain purchase gain and will be reflected in\nOther income.

The\nminimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on\nthe interest rate charged during the introductory\nperiod. This introductory rate is usually\nsignificantly below the fully indexed rate. The\nfully indexed rate is calculated using an index\nrate plus a margin. Once the introductory period\nends, the contractual interest rate charged on the\nloan increases to the fully indexed rate and\nadjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index.\nThe minimum payment is typically insufficient to\ncover interest accrued in the prior month, and any\nunpaid interest is deferred and added to the\nprincipal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are\nsubject to payment recast, which\n                                                    196                                                     \nconverts the loan to a variable-rate fully\namortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance\nand anniversary date triggers.\n\nPrime\n\nPrime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with\ngood credit records who meet specific underwriting\nrequirements, including prescriptive requirements\nrelated to income and overall debt levels. New\nprime mortgage borrowers provide full documentation\nand generally have reliable payment histories.\n\nSubprime\n\nSubprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008,\nwere offered to certain customers with one or more\nhigh risk characteristics, including but not\nlimited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment\nhistories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than\n80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance);\n(iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an\noccupancy type for the loan is other than the\nborrower\u2019s primary residence; or (v) a history of\ndelinquencies or late payments on the loan.\n\nMREL : Minimum requirements for own funds and\neligible liabilities\n\nMSR : Mortgage servicing rights\n\nNA : Data is not applicable or available for the\nperiod presented.\n\nNet Capital Rule: Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934.\n\nNet charge-off/(recovery) rate: represents net\ncharge-offs/(recoveries) (annualized) divided by\naverage retained loans for the reporting period.\n\nNet interchange income includes the following\ncomponents:\n\n\u2022 Interchange income: Fees earned by credit and\ndebit card issuers on sales transactions.\n\n\u2022 Rewards costs: The cost to the Firm for points\nearned by cardholders enrolled in credit card\nrewards programs generally tied to sales\ntransactions.\n\n\u2022 Partner payments: Payments to co-brand credit\ncard partners based on the cost of loyalty program\nrewards earned by cardholders on credit card\ntransactions.\n\nNet yield on interest-earning assets: The average\nrate for interest-earning assets less the average\nrate paid for all sources of funds.\n\nNFA: National Futures Association\n\nNM : Not meaningful\n\nNonaccrual loans : Loans for which interest income\nis not recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other\nthan credit card loans and certain consumer loans\ninsured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on\nnonaccrual status when full payment of principal\nand interest is not expected, regardless of\ndelinquency status, or when principal and interest\nhas been in default for a period of 90 days or more\nunless the loan is both well-secured and in the\nprocess of collection. Collateral-dependent loans\nare typically\n\nmaintained on nonaccrual status.\n\nNonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include\nnonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and\ncertain assets acquired in loan satisfactions,\npredominantly real estate owned and other\ncommercial and personal property.\n\nNSFR: Net Stable Funding Ratio\n\nOCC : Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\n\nOCI : Other comprehensive income/(loss)\n\nOPEB : Other postretirement employee benefit\n\nOTC : \u201cOver-the-counter derivatives\u201d: Derivative\ncontracts that are negotiated, executed and settled\nbilaterally between two derivative counterparties,\nwhere one or both counterparties is a derivatives\ndealer.\n\nOTC cleared : \u201cOver-the-counter cleared\nderivatives\u201d: Derivative contracts that are\nnegotiated and executed bilaterally, but\nsubsequently settled via a central clearing house,\nsuch that each derivative counterparty is only\nexposed to the default of that clearing house.\n\nOverhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage\nof total net revenue.\n\nParent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nParticipating securities: represents unvested\nshare-based compensation awards containing\nnonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend\nequivalents (collectively, \u201cdividends\u201d), which are\nincluded in the earnings per share calculation\nusing the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase grants\nrestricted stock and RSUs to certain employees\nunder its share-based compensation programs, which\nentitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable\ndividends during the vesting period on a basis\nequivalent to the dividends paid to holders of\ncommon stock. These unvested awards meet the\ndefinition of participating securities. Under the\ntwo-class method, all earnings (distributed and\nundistributed) are allocated to each class of\ncommon stock and participating securities, based on\ntheir respective rights to receive dividends.\n\nPCD: \u201cPurchased credit deteriorated\u201d assets\nrepresent acquired financial assets that as of the\ndate of acquisition have experienced a more-than-\ninsignificant deterioration in credit quality since\norigination, as determined by the Firm.\n\nPillar 1: The Basel framework consists of a three\n\u201cPillar\u201d approach. Pillar 1 establishes minimum\ncapital requirements, defines eligible capital\ninstruments, and prescribes rules for calculating\nRWA.\n\nPillar 3: The Basel framework consists of a three\n\u201cPillar\u201d approach.

The Firm believes\nthat this financial measure is useful in assessing\nthe ability of a lending institution to generate\nincome in excess of its provision for credit\nlosses.\n\nPrincipal transactions revenue : Principal\ntransactions revenue is driven by many factors,\nincluding the bid-offer spread, which is the\ndifference between the price at which the Firm is\nwilling to buy a financial or other instrument and\nthe price at which the Firm is willing to sell that\ninstrument. It also consists of realized (as a\nresult of closing out or termination of\ntransactions, or interim cash payments) and\nunrealized (as a result of changes in valuation)\ngains and losses on financial and other instruments\n(including those accounted for under the fair value\noption) primarily used in client-driven market-\nmaking activities and on private equity\ninvestments. In connection with its client-driven\nmarket-making activities, the Firm transacts in\ndebt and equity instruments, derivatives and\ncommodities (including physical commodities\ninventories and financial instruments that\nreference commodities). Principal transactions\nrevenue also includes certain realized and\nunrealized gains and losses related to hedge\naccounting and specified risk-management\nactivities, including: (a) certain derivatives\ndesignated in qualifying hedge accounting\nrelationships (primarily fair value hedges of\ncommodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain\nderivatives used for specific risk management\npurposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and\nforeign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.\n\nPSU(s) : Performance share units\n\nRegulatory VaR: Daily aggregated VaR calculated in\naccordance with regulatory rules.\n\nREO: Real estate owned\n\nReported basis: Financial statements prepared under\nU.S. GAAP, which excludes the impact of taxable-\nequivalent adjustments.\n\nRetained loans : Loans that are held-for-investment\n(i.e. excludes loans held-for-sale and loans at\nfair value).\n\nRevenue wallet: Total fee revenue based on\nestimates of investment banking fees generated\nacross the industry (i.e., the revenue wallet) from\ninvestment banking transactions in M&A, equity and\ndebt underwriting, and loan syndications.

Key differences in the\ncalculation of credit risk RWA between the\nStandardized and Advanced approaches are that for\nBasel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on\nrisk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the\nuse of internal credit models and parameters,\nwhereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA\nis generally based on supervisory risk-weightings\nwhich vary primarily by counterparty type and asset\nclass.
