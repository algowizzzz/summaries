It is an honor to hold this position and a responsibility I take very seriously. In\nthis role I serve with a dedicated group of fellow directors who work closely with senior management to grow\nthe company and advance the interest of shareholders.\n\nWe are fortunate to have a great management team led by our Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon. For two decades,\nJamie and his team have delivered excellent results while supporting our clients, communities and employees.\nOur Board meets at least eight times a year and has broad and unfettered access to dozens of senior\nmanagers. Over the course of many years, we have come to know the executive team and the culture they\noperate in well. The Board works cooperatively with senior management, and also challenges them to\nconstantly improve operations and deliver results for shareholders.\n\nBuilding on investments and decisions made over many years, your company continued its record financial\nperformance in 2024. We grew across all of our market-leading lines of business, achieved record financial\nresults and continued to invest for the future. Our managed revenue of $180.6 billion was a record for the\nseventh consecutive year. Our net income of $58.5 billion was also a record and we had a return on equity of\n18% and return on tangible common equity of 22%. The Firm announced an increase in its quarterly dividend\nfrom $1.05 a share to $1.25 in December 2024 and to $1.40 in March 2025.\n\nThe Board is focused on many factors which contribute to long-term performance. We have strong committee\nleadership that is engaged across all aspects of the business. We are particularly engaged with the\nuncertainty and opportunity presented by a challenging geopolitical environment. The Board works closely\nwith senior management to make sure that the Firm has the resiliency and capital strength to be able to help\nour clients in both good times and bad times.\n\nOne of the Board\u2019s key responsibilities is to plan for an orderly and successful CEO transition. As\ndiscussed in detail in the proxy statement, the entire Board is involved with developing and assessing the\nsenior executives who are potential CEO candidates. In January 2025, the Firm announced that Daniel Pinto,\nour President and Chief Operating Officer, is expected to retire at the end of 2026. Jennifer Piepszak has\nmoved from the Commercial & Investment Bank to become our new Chief Operating Officer. Doug Petno has\nsucceeded Jenn as co-CEO of the Commercial & Investment Bank, partnering with Troy Rohrbaugh. Marianne Lake\nand Mary Erdoes continue as CEOs of Consumer & Community Banking and Asset & Wealth Management,\nrespectively. The Board believes these management changes will help the Firm better serve its clients and\nfurther develop these senior leaders. In addition, the Board believes the Firm has a very strong and deep\nbench of senior leaders who have grown up in a culture that emphasizes doing the right things to ensure\nlong-term success.\n\nThe Board recognizes its role is different than that of senior management. While senior management runs the\ncompany, the Board performs a broad and strong oversight function, making sure that senior management\nmaintains an open and collaborative culture, challenging management when appropriate, asking tough questions\nand making sure that the Firm is positioned well for the future. At present the Board is particularly\nfocused on issues such as geopolitical uncertainty, the role of artificial intelligence and the evolving\nregulatory environment. The Firm\u2019s approach to risk management, liquidity, capital, cybersecurity, the\neconomy and other issues are discussed regularly at our Board meetings. We also work closely with management\nto promote equal treatment, opportunity and access throughout our organization.\n\nWe remain committed to maintaining a vital and engaged Board for today and in the future. This year we were\nfortunate to identify two new directors, each of whom we are pleased to nominate for election by\nshareholders at the annual meeting. Brad Smith is the President of Marshall University and was CEO of Intuit\nfor eleven years. Michele Buck is Chairman, President and CEO of The Hershey Company. Both Brad and Michele\nbring experience managing large, complex, international organizations\n\nTable of Contents\n\nthrough periods of change and innovation. Their impressive combination of skills, experiences and personal\nqualities will serve our shareholders, the Firm and our Board well in the years ahead.\n\nOur Board is committed to working diligently on behalf of our shareholders. We are driven to help senior\nmanagement deliver results by, as J.P. Morgan himself put it, \u201cdoing first-class business in a first-class\nway.\u201d On behalf of the entire Board, we thank you for your support and remain committed to serving the best\ninterests of our shareholders.\n\nSincerely,\n                             \n  Stephen B.

CEO pay is strongly aligned to the Firm\u2019s short-, medium- and long-term performance, with\napproximately 87% of the CEO\u2019s variable pay deferred into equity, of which 100% is in at-risk Performance\nShare Units (\u201cPSUs\u201d) for both our current CEO and President & COO. Other NEO pay is also strongly aligned to\nFirm and line of business (\u201cLOB\u201d) performance, with a majority of variable pay deferred into equity, of\nwhich 50% is in at-risk PSUs.\n\nDisciplined performance assessment process to determine pay\n\nThe CMDC uses a balanced holistic approach to determine annual compensation, which includes a disciplined\nassessment of performance against the aforementioned four broad dimensions over a sustained period of time.\n\nThe table below summarizes the salary and incentive compensation awarded to our NEOs for 2024

Given the nature and broad scope of the products and services provided by the Firm, there are\nfrom time to time ordinary course of business transactions between the Firm and a director, his or her\nimmediate family members, or principal business affiliations. These may include, among other relationships:\nextensions of credit; provision of other financial and financial advisory products and services; business\ntransactions for property or services; and charitable contributions made by the JPMorgan Chase Foundation or\nthe Firm to a nonprofit organization of which a director is an officer. The Board reviews these\nrelationships to assess their materiality and determine if any such relationship would impair the\nindependence and judgment of the relevant director. The Board considered:\n\n\u2022 Consumer credit: credit cards and other lines of credit and loans for directors Bammann, Buck, Burke,\nCombs, Gorsky, Hobson, Novakovic, Weinberger and/or their immediate family members\n\n\u2022 Wholesale/commercial credit: extensions of credit and other financial and financial advisory products and\nservices provided to: The Hershey Company, for which Ms. Buck is Chairman, President and Chief Executive\nOfficer, and its subsidiaries; Berkshire Hathaway Inc., for which Mr. Combs is an Investment Officer, and\nits subsidiaries; Alto Pharmacy, LLC, for which Ms. Davis is the Chief Executive Officer, and its\nsubsidiaries; ICONIQ Capital, LLC, for which Mr. Gorsky serves as a Managing Director; Ariel Investments,\nLLC, for which Ms. Hobson is Co-Chief Executive Officer and President, and its subsidiaries, affiliates and\nfunds; certain entities wholly-owned by Ms. Hobson\u2019s spouse and trusts for which such spouse serves as\ntrustee; General Dynamics Corporation, for which Ms. Novakovic is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and\nits subsidiaries; Louis Dreyfus Company B.V., for which a sibling of Mrs. Rometty serves as the Trading\nOperations Officer and Cotton Platform Head, and its subsidiaries; Hearthside Food Solutions, LLC, for which\na sibling of Mrs. Rometty serves as Chief Executive Officer, and its affiliates; and Marshall University,\nfor which Mr. Smith is the President\n\n\u2022 Goods, services: purchases from Berkshire Hathaway and subsidiaries of private aviation services and\nprofessional services related to the Firm\u2019s corporate-owned aircraft; and purchases of corporate aircraft\nand associated maintenance services and parts provided by General Dynamics subsidiaries\n\n\u2022 Other relationships: A son-in-law of Mr. Burke is a non-executive employed by the Firm and in 2024 was\nprovided compensation less than $120,000 and benefits in accordance with the Firm\u2019s employment and\ncompensation practices applicable to employees holding comparable positions. He became Mr. Burke\u2019s son-in-\nlaw in 2024. He has been employed by the Firm since 2021 and is currently a Business Relationship Manager in\nConsumer & Community Banking.\n\nThe Board, having reviewed the relevant relationships between the Firm and each non-management director,\ndetermined, in accordance with the NYSE\u2019s listing standards and the Firm\u2019s independence standards, that each\nnon-management director (Linda B. Bammann, Michele G. Buck, Stephen B. Burke, Todd A. Combs, Alicia Boler\nDavis, Alex Gorsky, Mellody Hobson, Phebe N. Novakovic, Virginia M. Rometty, Brad D.

This includes candidates who are not available for board\nmembership immediately but may become available in the future, such as candidates whose current professional\ncommitments preclude board service and emerging leaders who require more experience. Often the Board works\nto develop a relationship with prospective candidates, becoming familiar with their skills and\neffectiveness, before the candidate is formally considered. The Board looks to recruit those who will\ncontribute individually, and it seeks to balance skills, experience, personal attributes and tenure. All\ncandidates recommended to the Governance Committee are evaluated based on the same standards outlined above.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s By-laws provide for a right of proxy access. Our By-laws enable shareholders, under specified\nconditions, to include their nominees for election as directors in the Firm\u2019s proxy statement. Under these\nprovisions, a shareholder group of up to 20 shareholders who have continuously owned at least 3% of the\nFirm\u2019s outstanding shares for at least three years may nominate up to 20% of the Board (but in any event at\nleast two directors).

Smith and Michele G. Buck to the Board effective\nJanuary 21, 2025 and March 17, 2025, respectively. The Board used the process described on the previous page\nand took into account the considerations outlined on pages 9- 11and shareholder interest in board\nrefreshment. Mr. Smith and Ms. Buck have been among a select group of individuals considered as part of the\nGovernance Committee\u2019s evaluation of prospective Board members in recent years.\n\nMr. Smith and Ms. Buck were familiar to a number of directors and executives based on their leadership roles\nat Intuit Inc. and The Hershey Company, respectively. Members of the Governance Committee suggested that\nthey be considered as prospective candidates. Members of the Governance Committee met with them, as did Mr.\nDimon and other Board members. Upon review of their qualifications and independence, the Governance\nCommittee recommended their election by the Board.\n\nFor more information on Mr. Smith and Ms. Buck's qualifications, see page 17and page 13, respectively.\n\nDirector re-nomination\n\nThe Governance Committee also oversees the re-nomination process. In determining whether to re-nominate a\ndirector for election at our annual meeting, the Governance Committee reviews each director, considering:\n\nRetirement policy\n\nOur Governance Principles require a non-management director to offer not to stand for re-election in each\ncalendar year following a year in which the director will be 75 or older. The Board (other than the affected\ndirector) then determines whether to accept the offer. The Board has increased the retirement age from 72 to\n75 to better align with peer financial institutions and to potentially expand the pool of director\ncandidates. The Board believes that the appropriate mix of experience and fresh perspectives is an important\nconsideration in assessing Board composition, and the best interests of the Firm are served by taking\nadvantage of all available talent, and evaluations as to director candidacy should not be determined solely\non age.\n\nNone of our director nominees will be 75 or older this year.\n\nFor a description of the annual Board and committee self-assessment process, see page 26.\n                              \n  20    2025 Proxy Statement  \n                              \nTable of Contents\n                                         \n  Board governance|Corporate governance  \n                                         \n                                                                          \n  Director nominees    Board governance    Board oversight    Engagement  \n                                                                          \n                          \n  02    Board governance  \n                          \nStrong governance practices\n\nOur Board is guided by the Firm\u2019s Governance Principles, and we adhere to the Commonsense Corporate\nGovernance Principles and the Investor Stewardship Group\u2019s Corporate Governance Principles for U.S. Listed\nCompanies.

Based on consideration of the factors\ndescribed on page 22, our Board has determined that combining the roles of Chair and CEO is the most\neffective leadership structure for the Board at this time. The Board believes the present structure provides\nthe Firm and the Board with strong leadership, appropriate independent oversight of management, continuity\nof experience that complements ongoing Board refreshment, and the ability to communicate the Firm\u2019s business\nand strategy to shareholders, clients, employees, regulators and the public in a single voice.\n\nAs required by the Firm\u2019s Governance Principles, when the role of the Chair is combined with that of the\nCEO, the independent directors appoint a Lead Independent Director. Our Lead Independent Director provides a\nstrong counterbalance to the Chair, including facilitating independent oversight of management, promoting\nopen dialogue among the independent directors during and in between Board meetings, leading executive\nsessions at each regular Board meeting without the presence of the CEO, and focusing on the Board\u2019s\npriorities and processes.\n\nIn March 2025, the independent directors conducted their annual review of the Board\u2019s leadership structure.\nThis review was conducted first by the Governance Committee, which considered the factors on page 22, the\nFirm\u2019s governance practices, which include executive sessions of independent directors as part of each\nregularly scheduled Board meeting and the directors\u2019 frequent and open interactions with senior management,\nand the effectiveness of the Lead Independent Director role. Following its review, the Governance Committee\nrecommended that the Board continue its current leadership structure and that Stephen B. Burke be re-\nappointed as Lead Independent Director. The independent directors of the Board then conducted their own\nreview, again taking into account the factors on page 22, the Governance Committee\u2019s recommendation and Mr.\nBurke\u2019s strong performance in the Lead Independent Director role over the course of the prior year, and\ndetermined to maintain the current leadership structure with Mr. Burke serving as Lead Independent Director.\n\nThe Board maintains the ability to change its leadership structure at any time should it elect to do so and\nis not limited to its annual review of leadership structure. The Board has a general policy, upon the next\nCEO transition, that the Chair and CEO positions shall be separate, subject to the Board\u2019s determination of\nthe leadership structure that best serves the Firm and its shareholders at that time. This policy is\nreflected in the Firm\u2019s Governance Principles and reinforces the Board\u2019s longstanding commitment to\nindependent oversight while also maintaining the Board\u2019s ability to fulfill its fiduciary duty to determine\nthe leadership structure that best serves shareholders.\n                              \n  2025 Proxy Statement    21  \n                              \nTable

Governance Principles. The Board has established practices and processes to actively manage its\ninformation flow, set meeting agendas and promote sound, well-informed decisions.\n\nBoard members have direct access to management and regularly receive information from, and engage with,\nmanagement during and outside of formal Board meetings.\n\nIn addition, the Board and each committee has the authority and resources to seek legal or other expert\nadvice from sources independent of management.\n\nThe full Board met 10 times at eight regularly scheduled Board meetings and two special Board meetings in\n2024. For more information on committees, see below. Each director attended 75% or more of the total\nmeetings of the Board and the committees on which he or she served in 2024.\n\nCommittees of the Board\n\nA significant portion of our Board\u2019s oversight responsibilities is carried out through its five independent,\nprincipal standing committees: Audit Committee, CMDC, Governance Committee, Public Responsibility Committee\n(\u201cPRC\u201d) and Risk Committee. Allocating responsibilities among committees allows more in-depth attention\ndevoted to the Board\u2019s oversight of the business and affairs of the Firm.\n\nCommittees meet regularly in conjunction with scheduled Board meetings and hold additional meetings as\nneeded. Each committee reviews reports from senior management and reports its actions to, and discusses its\nrecommendations with, the full Board.\n\nEach principal standing committee operates pursuant to a written charter. These charters are available on\nour website at jpmorganchase.com/about/governance/board-committees. Each charter is reviewed at least\nannually as part of the Board\u2019s and each respective committee\u2019s self-assessment.\n\nThe Board annually reviews the allocation of responsibility among the committees as part of the Board and\ncommittee self- assessment. For more information about the self-assessment process, see page 26.\n\nEach committee has oversight of specific activities and risk, and engages with the Firm\u2019s senior management\nresponsible for those areas.\n\nAll committee chairs are appointed at least annually by our Board.

administering the dividend reinvestment plan and implementing share repurchase plans. The\ncommittee acts within Board-approved limitations and capital plans.\n\nExecutive Committee: The committee may exercise all the powers of the Board that lawfully may be delegated,\nbut with the expectation that it will not take material actions absent special circumstances.\n\nThe Board may establish additional standing committees as needed.\n\nSpecific purpose committees\n\nThe Board establishes specific purpose committees as appropriate to address specific issues. The Board\ncurrently has two such committees, the Markets Compliance Committee and the Omnibus Committee. The Markets\nCompliance Committee provides oversight in connection with certain markets-related matters, including issues\nrelated to trading venues and trade surveillance data feeds. The Omnibus Committee reviews matters delegated\nby the Board.\n\nAs the Firm achieves its objectives in a specific area, the work of the relevant specific purpose committee\nwill be concluded and the committee appropriately disbanded.\n\nAdditional Specific Purpose Committees may be established from time to time in the future to address\nparticular issues.\n\nCurrent board committee membership\n                                                                                 \n  Director               Audit    CMDC    Governance    PRC    Risk    Specific  \n                                                                       Purpose1  \n  Stephen B.

Annual strategic plans include evaluation of\nperformance against the prior year\u2019s initiatives, assessment of the current operating environment,\nrefinement of existing strategies and development of new strategic initiatives. Throughout the year, the CEO\nand senior management provide updates on the Firm\u2019s overall strategic direction, including updates on the\nopportunities and performance, priorities and implementation of strategies in their respective LOBs and\nCorporate functions. These management presentations are the foundation of active dialogue with, and feedback\nfrom, the Board about the strategic risks and opportunities facing the Firm and its businesses.\n\nExecutive performance, talent management and succession planning\n\nThe CMDC reviews the Firm\u2019s performance periodically during the course of the year, and formally, at least\nannually. The CMDC\u2019s review of the CEO\u2019s performance is presented to the Board in connection with the\nBoard\u2019s review of executive officer annual compensation.\n\nIn accordance with our Governance Principles, succession planning is considered at least annually by the\nBoard. The CMDC reviews the succession plan for the CEO in preparation for discussion by the Board, with\nsuch discussion guided by the Lead Independent Director. These discussions occur with and without the CEO\nand include consideration of recommendations, evaluations and development plans for potential CEO\nsuccessors, in addition to ongoing review of the Firm\u2019s long-term strategy and analyses of CEO transitions\nat other companies, among other factors.\n\nThe Board is focused on enabling an orderly CEO transition to take place in the medium-term. As part of\nsuccession planning, the Board continues to oversee management\u2019s development of several Operating Committee\nmembers who are well-known to shareholders as strong potential candidates to succeed Mr. Dimon. As part of\nthis, individual OC members have been provided with opportunities to gain exposure to different parts of the\nbusiness and to deepen their leadership experience in new and expanded roles.\n\nIn January 2025, the Firm announced that Daniel Pinto, President and Chief Operating Officer, is expected to\nretire at the end of 2026. He will relinquish his responsibilities as President and COO as of June 30, 2025\nand is expected to continue to serve as Vice Chairman through the end of 2026. Jennifer Piepszak has become\nChief Operating Officer. Doug Petno, Co-head of Global Banking, succeeded Ms. Piepszak as Co-CEO of the CIB,\npartnering with Troy Rohrbaugh, who continues as Co-CEO of the CIB. Marianne Lake and Mary Erdoes continue\nas CEO of Consumer & Community Banking and CEO of Asset & Wealth Management, respectively. The Board\nbelieves that these senior management changes will help the Firm better serve its clients as well as further\ndevelop the Firm\u2019s most senior leaders.\n\nThe CMDC also periodically reviews the succession plan for members of the OC other than the CEO to build a\nrobust talent pipeline for specific critical roles.

The Firm\u2019s annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (\u201cCCAR\u201d) capital plan submission, which\ncontains the Firm\u2019s proposed plans to make capital distributions, such as dividend payments, stock\nrepurchases and other capital actions, is reviewed and approved prior to its submission to the Federal\nReserve. In addition, the Audit Committee assists the Board in the oversight of the Firm\u2019s financial\nstatements and internal control framework. The Audit Committee also assists the Board in the appointment,\nretention, compensation, evaluation and oversight of the Firm\u2019s independent registered public accounting\nfirm. For further information, see \u201cRisk management and internal control framework\u201d below.\n                                                                                                            \n   Risk management and internal control framework                                                           \n                                                                                                            \nRisk is an inherent part of JPMorganChase\u2019s business activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or\nwholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or\noffers other products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. The Firm\u2019s overall objective is to\nmanage its business, and the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the interests of its\nclients, customers and investors, and protecting the safety and soundness of the Firm.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s risk governance framework is managed on a firmwide basis. The Board of Directors oversees\nmanagement\u2019s strategic decisions, and the Risk Committee oversees Independent Risk Management (\u201cIRM\u201d) and\nthe Firm\u2019s risk governance framework. Cybersecurity risk is overseen by the full Board, with additional\noversight of the relevant risk framework and controls provided by the Audit and Risk Committees. Board\ncommittees support the Board\u2019s oversight responsibility by overseeing the risk categories related to such\ncommittee\u2019s specific area of focus.\n\nCommittee chairs report significant matters discussed at committee meetings to the full Board. Issues\nescalated to the full Board may be dealt with in several ways, as appropriate, for example: oversight of\nrisk may remain with the particular principal standing committee of the Board, the Board may establish or\ndirect a specific purpose committee to oversee such matters, or the Board may ask management to present more\nfrequently to the full Board on the issue.\n\nEnvironmental, social and governance matters\n\nOversight of ESG-related matters is part of the Board\u2019s work in setting the policies and principles that\ngovern our business, including:\n\n\u2022 the Firm\u2019s governance-related policies and practices;\n                                                                                                            \n  \u2022                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  our systems of risk management and controls;                                                              \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u2022                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  our investment in our employees;                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \n\u2022 the manner in which we serve our customers and support our communities; and\n\n\u2022 how we advance sustainability in our business and operations.\n\nBoard committees each consider ESG-related matters within their scope of responsibility. The PRC provides\noversight of the Firm\u2019s positions and practices on public responsibility matters such as community\ninvestment, fair lending, consumer practices, sustainability and other public policy issues that reflect the\nFirm\u2019s values and character and impact its reputation among its stakeholders. The CMDC oversees the Firm\u2019s\nculture, including reviewing employee-related diversity programs; the Risk Committee considers climate risk;\nthe Governance Committee reviews board composition and also considers shareholder proposals; and the Audit\nCommittee assists the Board in its oversight of compliance with the Firm\u2019s ethical standards, policies,\nplans and procedures, and with laws and regulations. In the past year, Board and committee discussion topics\nincluded, among others, sustainability, Diversity, Opportunity & Inclusion (\"DOI\"), Racial Equity\nCommitment, and governance of ESG initiatives.\n\nIn the second half of 2025, we intend to release a consolidated report on ESG and climate topics. In recent\nyears, we published an annual ESG Report, which provided information on how we are addressing the ESG-\nrelated matters that we and our stakeholders view as important to our business. Additionally, we published a\nClimate Report, which included disclosure about the Firm\u2019s approach to climate-related risks and\nopportunities. In 2024, our ESG-related disclosures were informed by the Global Reporting Initiative,\nSustainability Accounting Standards Board and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures as\napplicable. We continue to monitor the evolving disclosure landscape as we iterate on our approach to\ndisclosure.

sense of personal accountability on the\npart of all of the Firm\u2019s employees.\n\nIn addition to discussions at Board meetings with\nsenior management about these efforts, our directors\nparticipate in events outside of the boardroom\nincluding meetings with employees that emphasize\nthis commitment. These meetings include LOB and\nleadership team events such as our annual senior\nleaders\u2019 meetings and informal sessions with members\nof the OC and other senior leaders. In 2024, members\nof our Board participated in Regional Director\ndinners, Firmwide senior leadership events, LOB\nindustry events and Business Resource Groups\u2019\n(\u201cBRGs\u201d) events.\n\nRegulators\n\nOur Board and senior leaders regularly meet with\nregulators. These interactions help us learn first-\nhand from regulators about matters of importance to\nthem and their expectations of us. They also provide\na forum for the Board and management to keep our\nregulators well-informed about the Firm\u2019s\nperformance and business practices.\n\nStakeholders\n\nAs we strive to deliver value, management engages\nwith our stakeholders, including our customers,\nsuppliers and leaders in the communities in which we\nwork, on a range of issues and in a variety of ways.\nThese may include, for example, participation in\nconsumer advisory groups and meetings with policy\nadvocacy groups and nonprofit organizations. We\nactively seek feedback on key topics to help us\nbetter understand what is important to our\nstakeholders and find ways to deliver value while\nalso navigating financial, legal and regulatory\nconsiderations. In recent years, we have engaged in\nextensive stakeholder outreach pertaining to, among\nother topics, the Firm\u2019s enterprise risk management\nframework, human capital management and\nsustainability.\n\nManagement shares feedback from these relationships\nand engagements with the Board, providing the Board\nwith valuable insights. Board members also\nparticipate in engagements with stakeholders through\nclient events, industry conferences, and shareholder\ndiscussions as appropriate.\n                              \n  2025 Proxy Statement    31  \n                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  Corporate governance|Director compensation  \n                                              \nDirector compensation\n\nThe Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing director compensation and making recommendations to\nthe Board. In making its recommendations, the Governance Committee annually reviews the Board\u2019s\nresponsibilities and the compensation practices of peer firms, which include the primary financial services\npeer group referenced with respect to the compensation of our NEOs. For more information see \u201cEvaluating\nmarket practices\u201d on page 46.\n\nThe Board believes a best practice is to link director compensation to the Firm\u2019s performance; therefore, a\nsignificant portion of director compensation is paid in common stock.\n\nAnnual compensation\n\nFor 2024, each non-employee director was entitled to receive an annual cash retainer of up to $110,000 and,\nif the non-employee director was on the Board at the time when annual performance year equity awards were\ngranted, an annual grant of deferred stock units valued at $265,000.\n\nCompensation paid during 2024, including additional cash compensation paid for certain committee and other\nservice, is described in the following tables.\n\nEach deferred stock unit included in the annual grant to directors represents the right to receive one share\nof the Firm\u2019s common stock and dividend equivalents payable in deferred stock units for any dividends paid.\nDeferred stock units have no voting rights. In January of the year immediately following a director\u2019s\nretirement from the Board, deferred stock units are distributed in shares of the Firm\u2019s common stock in\neither a lump sum or in annual installments for up to 15 years as elected by the director.\n\nThe following table summarizes the 2024 annual compensation for non-employee directors for service on the\nBoards of the Firm, the Bank and J.P. Morgan Securities plc (\u201cJPMS plc\u201d).

The Firm experienced growth across all of our market-leading lines of\nbusiness, achieved record financial results and maintained a fortress balance sheet.\n\nThe CMDC recognized that the Firm achieved managed revenue 1 of $180.6 billion, which was a record for the\nseventh consecutive year, as well as record net income of $58.5 billion, or $19.75 per share, with ROTCE 1\nof 22%. The Firm increased its quarterly common dividend from $1.05 to $1.25 per share.\n\nAs part of their evaluation and determination, the Board considered Mr. Dimon's continued development of top\nexecutives to lead for today and the future, his continued commitment to shareholders and his longstanding\nexemplary leadership of the Firm. In light of the continued absolute and relative strength of the Firm\u2019s\nperformance, the Board determined Mr. Dimon\u2019s annual pay of $39 million.\n\nSuccession planning and recent leadership changes\n\nOne of the Board\u2019s top priorities is succession planning for Mr. Dimon, which is focused on enabling an\norderly CEO transition to take place in the medium-term. As part of succession planning, the Board continues\nto oversee management\u2019s development of several Operating Committee members who are well-known to\nshareholders as strong potential candidates to succeed Mr. Dimon. Individual OC members have been provided\nwith opportunities to gain exposure to different parts of the business and to deepen their leadership\nexperience in new and expanded roles. Most recently, in January 2025, the Firm announced that Daniel Pinto,\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer, is expected to retire at the end of 2026; Jennifer Piepszak was named\nChief Operating Officer; and Doug Petno, Co-head of Global Banking, succeeded Ms. Piepszak as Co-CEO of the\nCommercial & Investment Bank, partnering with Troy Rohrbaugh who continues as Co-CEO of the Commercial &\nInvestment Bank.

The CMDC assesses OC members\u2019 performance against those strategic priorities, as well\nas four broad financial and non-financial performance dimensions in a balanced and holistic way in\naccordance with the Firm\u2019s compensation philosophy. To determine OC compensation, the CMDC considers both\nwhat progress has been made against long-term strategic priorities, and how that progress has been achieved.\nThe CMDC applies:\n\n\u2022 ~50% weighting to its consideration of absolute and relative business results ( what they have\naccomplished)\n\n\u2022 ~50% weighting to its qualitative consideration of risk, controls & conduct; client/customer/stakeholder;\nand teamwork & leadership ( how they have accomplished results)\n\nWhile there is no single performance dimension in isolation that determines compensation, a significant\nshortcoming in any one dimension may result in downward adjustments to OC members\u2019 variable compensation,\nwithout limits.\n                                                                                                            \n  FOUR                                                                                                      \n  BROAD                                                                                                     \n  PERFORM\u2026                                                                                                  \n  DIMENSI\u2026                                                                                                  \n  The                                       The \"how\u201d                                                       \n  \"what\"                                                                                                    \n              Business                      Risk,             Client/C\u2026         Teamwork         OC Member  \n              Results                  +    Controls     +    Stakehol\u2026    +    &           =    Performa\u2026  \n                                            & Conduct                           Leaders\u2026                    \n                          Unlimited                                                                         \n                          downward                                                                          \n                          potential                                                                         \n                          for                                                                               \n                          signific\u2026                                                                         \n                          shortcom\u2026                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \nDetermining total compensation\n\nAfter considering OC members\u2019 performance throughout the year and over the long-term, the CMDC first\ndetermines their respective total compensation levels and then their pay mix \u2014 a combination of fixed pay\n(salary) and variable pay (cash awards and long-term equity). Pay mix is weighted toward long-term equity,\nand for PSUs, ROTCE performance drives the ultimate payout.\n\nThe CMDC also considers competitive market practices, referencing our primary financial services peer group\nof American Express, Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo.\n\nPay mix\n\nTo determine the appropriate pay mix, the CMDC considers the fixed and variable components of each OC\nmember\u2019s pay. The salary portion of total compensation has already been paid, and the variable portion can\ninclude a cash award that is paid immediately, plus long-term equity in the form of restricted stock units\n(\u201cRSUs\u201d) and at-risk PSUs.\n\nMr. Dimon receives all of his equity in at-risk PSUs, comprising ~87% of his variable compensation, which is\na higher proportion than any of our peer firms\u2019 CEOs. Mr. Dimon\u2019s total cash compensation is consistently\namong the lowest, and in 2024, well below the $10 million median of the total cash amounts paid to peer\nCEOs.\n\nThe chart below illustrates

The performance assessment process starts with\nstrategic plans, budgets and priorities being established at those same levels, with the Board and CMDC\nengaging in regular discussions with the CEO and the Head of HR about individual OC members\u2019 performance\nthroughout the year, as appropriate.\n\nThis approach (rather than determining pay levels during a single year-end process) enables the CMDC to make\nbalanced and informed OC member pay decisions that are aligned with long-term performance against four broad\ndimensions, which consider short-, medium- and long-term priorities that drive sustained shareholder value.\n\nBalanced and holistic approach for assessing performance\n\nIn determining OC compensation, the CMDC considers both what progress has been made against long-term\nstrategic priorities, and how that progress has been achieved. For example, consistently strong revenue, net\nincome and ROTCE performance over the long-term are more important than any short-term fluctuations in\nbusiness results.\n\nThe CMDC applies an approximately 50% weighting to its consideration of absolute and relative business\nresults against the Firm\u2019s strategic priorities over multiple years, i.e., the \"what,\u201d and an approximately\n50% weighting to its qualitative consideration of risk, controls & conduct, client/customer/stakeholder and\nteamwork & leadership, i.e., the \"how.\u201d\n\nNo single performance dimension in isolation determines total compensation; however, it is possible for a\nsingle significant shortcoming in any performance dimension to have a downward impact on variable\ncompensation without limitation. The CMDC has historically exercised this kind of downward discretion by\nmaking significant reductions to OC member compensation related to risk & control matters \u2014 and it will\ncontinue to do so in the future if appropriate.\n\nThis assessment of performance, illustrated in the chart below, includes considerations of responsible\nleadership, thoughtful governance and sustainability where

attract, properly motivate and retain our senior executives, the CMDC periodically\nreviews market data relating to pay levels, pay mix and pay practices.\n\nIn evaluating market data for OC members, the CMDC benchmarks against our primary financial services peer\ngroup, which consists of large financial services companies with which the Firm directly competes for both\ntalent and business. The following companies comprise our primary financial services peer group, which\nremains unchanged from last year:\n                                                          \n  \u2022American Express    \u2022Citigroup        \u2022Morgan Stanley  \n  \u2022Bank of America     \u2022Goldman Sachs    \u2022Wells Fargo     \n                                                          \nGiven the diversity of the Firm\u2019s businesses, the CMDC may also periodically reference the pay plans and\npractices of other financial services companies as well as leading large, global firms across multiple\nindustries. The CMDC considers the size, presence, brand and reputation of the companies, and the nature and\nmix of their businesses in using this data. These companies include some or all of the following: 3M,\nAlphabet, Amazon, Apple, AT&T, Barclays, BlackRock, BNY Mellon, Boeing, Capital One Financial, Chevron,\nCoca-Cola, Comcast, CVS Health, Deutsche Bank, ExxonMobil, GE Aerospace, HSBC, IBM, Johnson & Johnson,\nMerck, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, PayPal, PepsiCo, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, RTX, UBS, Verizon, Walmart and\nWalt Disney. Although these reference companies are not part of our primary financial services peer group,\nwe believe that their practices can provide a relevant point of reference for maintaining a competitive\ntalent and compensation program.\n\nDisciplined process to determine total compensation\n\nPay level\n\nIn determining total compensation levels for individual OC members, the CMDC evaluates various pay scenarios\nin light of the following considerations to inform its judgment:\n\n\u2022 Performance, based on the four broad assessment dimensions and discussed on pages 53- 56\n\n\u2022 Value of the position to the organization and shareholders over time (i.e., \u201cvalue of seat\u201d)\n\n\u2022 The example they set for others by acting with integrity and strengthening the Firm\u2019s culture, Purpose and\nValues\n                                                                                                            \n  \u2022                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  External talent market (i.e., market data)                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nWhile market data provides the CMDC with useful information regarding our competitors, the CMDC does not\ntarget specific positioning (e.g., 50 th percentile), nor does it use a formulaic approach in determining\ncompetitive pay levels. Instead, the CMDC uses a range of data as a reference, which is considered in the\ncontext of each executive\u2019s performance over a multi-year period, and the CMDC\u2019s assessment of the value the\nindividual delivers to the Firm.\n\nPay mix\n\nOnce the CMDC determines OC members\u2019 total incentive compensation, it then establishes the appropriate pay\nmix between an annual cash award and long-term equity, including PSUs and RSUs.\n\nFor U.S. OC members other than the current CEO and President, the CMDC continued to apply the Firm\u2019s\nstandard cash/equity incentive mix to each of their 2024 incentive compensation awards. Per the Firm\u2019s mix,\nthe OC members were awarded 60% of their incentive compensation in long-term equity (with 30% in PSUs and\n30% in RSUs), and the remaining 40% paid in cash 1 . The CMDC determined that a 50%/50% mix of time-based\nRSUs and at-risk PSUs continues to provide an appropriate balance to their equity exposure.\n\nThe CMDC believes that this significant weighting of pay mix to equity is aligned with the interests of\nshareholders by encouraging OC members to focus on the long-term success of the Firm while mitigating\nexcessive risk-taking, and provides a competitive annual cash incentive opportunity.\n\nMessrs. Dimon and Pinto\u2019s annual cash incentive awards are subject to a cap of 25% of their respective total\ncompensation, with PSUs comprising 100% of the equity portion of their incentive compensation. The CMDC\ndetermined to not award the maximum amount allowed by their respective caps in 2024, but to maintain a lower\ncash award of $5 million each for Messrs. Dimon and Pinto.\n\n1 The CMDC has established a different pay mix for OC members in the U.K. due to local regulations for\nIdentified Staff, please refer to the Glossary for additional information.\n                              \n  46    2025 Proxy Statement  \n                              \nTable of Contents\n                                                  \n  Compensation discussion and analysis|Executive  \n  compensation                                    \n                                                  \n                                                                                                            \n  How we think about pay             How we performed against our\u00a0        How performance determined\u00a0pay    \n  decisions                          business strategy                    in 2024                           \n                                                                                                            \nSummary of pay elements\n\nOur compensation program provides for an appropriate mix between base salary, cash and equity incentives\nthat vest over time.

The value upon vesting of PSUs is also directly tied to the Firm\u2019s\nperformance through its stock price, similar to RSUs. The CMDC believes that the PSU design continues to\nappropriately incentivize strong performance by our OC members, does not encourage excessive risk-taking and\nis aligned with long-term shareholder interests. Since PSUs were first introduced in 2015, we have received\npositive shareholder support for this aspect of our executive compensation program.\n\nDetermining absolute and relative PSU performance goals\n\n\u2022 Each year, in determining the absolute ROTCE goal and minimum ROTCE threshold for that year\u2019s PSU awards,\nthe CMDC reviews the Firm\u2019s historical performance and a summary of a reasonable range of possible net\nincome and capital outcomes over the next three years. For the 2024 PSU awards granted in January 2025,\nthese outcomes were considered, evaluated and analyzed in the context of the macroeconomic and geopolitical\nenvironment, interest rates, regulatory capital requirements and key business drivers, all of which affect\nthe range of ROTCE outcomes in the medium-term.\n\n\u2022 The CMDC calibrated the upper ROTCE goal of the 2024 PSUs, representing exceptional financial performance\nover the three-year performance period, at 18% or more; and the lower ROTCE threshold, representing weak\nfinancial performance over the same period, at below 6%.\n\n\u2014 Of the three-year performance periods for the Firm and our PSU peers in the last 10 years, our PSU peers\nhave achieved ROTCE of >18% only 4 times, demonstrating the rigor of our upper ROTCE goal.\n\n\u2014 Our PSU peers have collectively reported three-year average ROTCE of <6% for 16% of the time during that\nperiod, demonstrating the rigor of our lower absolute ROTCE threshold.\n\n\u2022 Furthermore, the Firm recognizes that there are substantial uncertainties in the current global economic\nenvironment that may have significant implications on financial institutions over the next three years. To\nthis end, the CMDC believes that it has set upper and lower absolute performance thresholds that are\nsufficiently rigorous in this environment, including consideration of a current range of possible net income\nand capital outcomes over the next three years.\n\n\u2022 In setting the relative ROTCE performance goals for the 2024 PSU awards, the CMDC limited above-target\npayout to instances in which the Firm outperforms the majority of its competitors on a relative basis, with\nbelow-target payout occurring in instances of underperformance. Median relative performance results in below\ntarget payout, outstanding relative performance results in a payout of 150% and requires a top ranking, and\nbottom relative performance pays out at 0%. \u2022 As reflected by the chart to the right, the Firm\u2019s consistent\nrelative outperformance of our ten PSU peers is demonstrated in particular by the strength of our three-year\naverage ROTCE outperformance over the last 10 years.\n                                                    \n  3-YEAR AVERAGE ROTCE OF THE FIRM RELATIVE TO PSU  \n  PEERS OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS1,2                   \n                                                    \n                    \n  JPM    PSU Peers  \n                    \nPSUs awarded for performance years 2021, 2022, and 2023\n\n\u2022 The Firm reported ROTCE 1 of 18%, 21%, and 22% in 2022, 2023, and 2024 respectively, resulting in a three-\nyear average ROTCE of 20%, outperforming the absolute threshold for the 2021 PSU awards granted in January\n2022. On March 25, 2025, the 2021 PSU awards vested at 150%.

If the stock ownership guidelines are subsequently increased, the\nhigher ownership guideline must be satisfied within 6 years of such revision, unless otherwise determined by\nthe CEO and CMDC.\n\nPrior to reaching their designated share ownership guideline, OC members are required to retain 75% of all\nnet shares received from equity awards granted after they join the Operating Committee. Once they have met\ntheir ownership guideline, the policy requires OC members to retain 50% of all net shares received from\nawards (75% for the CEO) as summarized below:\n                                                                                                            \n  Retention Requirement                                                                                     \n  Before Guideline Met                       After Guideline Met                                            \n  75% of net shares until stock ownership    50% of net shares for the duration of their service\u00a0on\u00a0the OC  \n  guideline is met                           (75% for CEO)                                                  \n                                                                                                            \nBecause OC members are required to continue accumulating shares even after having met their share ownership\nguideline, the resulting increase of share ownership over time further strengthens the alignment of their\ninterests with those of our shareholders. Notably, since he became CEO, Mr. Dimon has acquired a substantial\namount of stock through compensation and purchases on the open market.\n\nAnti-hedging/anti-pledging provisions\n\nAll employees are prohibited from hedging or pledging unvested RSUs and PSUs, and unexercised SARs or stock\noptions. In addition:\n\n\u2022 Shares owned outright or through deferred compensation by an OC member may not be hedged.\n\n\u2022 Shares held directly by an OC or Board member 1 may not be held in margin accounts or otherwise pledged.\n\nIntegrating risk with compensation\n\nThe CMDC holds an annual joint session with the Risk Committee to review our HR and compensation practices,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 How we integrate risk, controls and conduct considerations into key HR practices including performance\ndevelopment, compensation and promotion.\n\n\u2022 Compensation features and elements designed to discourage imprudent risk-taking (e.g., multi-year vesting,\nclawbacks, prohibition on hedging, etc.).\n\n\u2022 Annual incentive pool processes for LOBs and Corporate functions.\n\n\u2022 Regulatory updates which have impacted or may impact HR practices in the future.\n\nThe committees are also provided with information on our performance development process, a summary of risk,\ncontrols and conduct framework and impacts, and updates regarding HR Control Forum issues.\n\n1 For information on the hedging/pledging restrictions applicable to our directors, please see \u201cDirector\ncompensation\u201d on pages 32and 33.\n                              \n  50    2025 Proxy Statement  \n                              \nTable of Contents\n                                                  \n  Compensation discussion and analysis|Executive  \n  compensation                                    \n                                                  \n                                                                                                            \n  How we think about pay             How we performed against our\u00a0        How performance determined\u00a0pay    \n  decisions                          business strategy                    in 2024                           \n                                                                                                            \nStrong accountability and recovery provisions\n\nOur compensation program is designed to hold employees accountable, including executives, when appropriate,\nfor meaningful actions or issues that may negatively impact business performance or the Firm\u2019s reputation in\ncurrent or future years.\n\nIssues that may warrant recovery determinations can be raised at any time, including in HR Control Forums\nand annual assessments of employee performance. Under the Firm\u2019s process to govern these determinations:\n\n\u2022 We have established a process for reviewing compensation or other employee actions following a\ndetermination that the cause and materiality of a risk-related loss, issue or other set of facts and\ncircumstances warrants such a review of accountability for actual or potential misconduct.\n\n\u2022 The CMDC is responsible for determinations involving OC members (determinations involving the CEO are\nsubject to ratification by independent members of the Board). The Firm has a framework that identifies and\nassesses employee risk and drives consistent management decisions and discipline. For more material risk and\ncontrol issues, the HR Control Forum process described below explains how issues are reviewed and impacts\nare considered.\n                                                                                                            \n   Risk, controls & conduct review process                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \nA summary of the review processes we maintain to evaluate and provide feedback on risk, controls and conduct\nmatters and to identify individuals who may be subject to remedial actions such as impacts to performance\nassessment ratings, additional training, compensation and/or termination is provided below:\n                                                                                                            \n                            ENHANCED PERFORMANCE                                   EMPLOYEE CONDUCT         \n                            REVIEW PROCESS                                         MATTERS                  \n                            \u2022Employees in roles                                    \u2022We have an              \n                            that could expose the                                  enterprise-wide          \n                            Firm to greater risks                                  framework to assess      \n                            (including OC and other                                employee conduct         \n                            Designated Employees)                                  related matters, and we  \n                            are subject to a more                                  review trends that may   \n                            disciplined evaluation                                 expose the Firm to       \n                            process.

It differs from how compensation is reported in the \u201cSummary compensation table\u201d (\u201cSCT\u201d) on\npage 64, which is required by the SEC, and is not intended as a substitute for the SCT. There are two\nprincipal differences between the SCT and the table above:\n\n1. The Firm grants both cash and equity incentive compensation after a performance year is completed. In\nboth the table above and the SCT, cash incentive compensation paid in 2025 for 2024 performance is shown as\n2024 compensation. In the table above, the equity awards (RSUs and PSUs) granted in 2025 for 2024\nperformance are shown as 2024 compensation. In contrast, the SCT reports the value of equity awards in the\nyear in which they are granted. As a result, awards granted in 2024 for 2023 performance are shown in the\nSCT as 2024 compensation.\n\n2. The table above does not show the change in pension value and nonqualified deferred compensation and all\nother compensation, which are reported in the SCT. In addition to showing the 2024 amounts, the SCT shows\nrevised all other compensation amounts for 2023 and 2022.\n                              \n  2025 Proxy Statement    57  \n

Grants made as part of the annual incentive compensation process are generally awarded in January\nafter fourth quarter earnings are released. RSUs and PSUs carry no voting rights. On January 21, 2025, the\nFirm awarded RSU and PSU awards as part of 2024 annual incentive compensation. Because these awards were\ngranted in 2025, they do not appear in this table, which is required to include only equity awards actually\ngranted during 2024. These 2025 awards are however reflected in the \u201cNEO annual compensation table\" on page\n57.\n\n2 PSUs vest on March 25, 2027, and are subject to a two-year holding period post-vesting. Each PSU\nrepresents the right to receive one share of common stock on the vesting date. The ultimate number of PSUs\nthat will vest will be determined by the Firm\u2019s performance over the three-year performance period and will\ninclude any accumulated reinvested dividend equivalent shares. The dividend equivalent shares, if any, will\nbe based on: (1) the number of PSUs earned at vesting; and (2) dividends that would have been paid on the\nFirm\u2019s common stock during the vesting period as of each dividend payment date, if any.\n\n3 RSUs vest in two equal installments on January 13, 2026 and 2027. Each RSU represents the right to receive\none share of common stock on the vesting date and non-preferential dividend equivalents, payable in cash,\nequal to any dividends paid on the Firm\u2019s common stock during the vesting period.\n\n4 The grant date fair value for RSUs and PSUs is based on the average of the high and the low prices of\nJPMorganChase common stock on the grant date multiplied by the number of units granted (for RSUs) or target\nnumber of PSUs.\n                              \n  2025 Proxy Statement    65  \n                              \nTable of Contents\n                                                 \n  Executive compensation|Executive compensation  \n  tables                                         \n                                                 \nIII.

The Plan was frozen with respect to pay credit\ncontributions, effective January 1, 2020, and frozen with respect to new entrants into the Plan, effective\nJanuary 1, 2019. Employees became fully vested in the value of their Plan benefits as a result of this\nchange. The years of service listed above are as of the freeze date. The Plan employed a cash balance\nformula (in the form of pay and interest credits) to determine amounts at retirement. Pay credits ceased\neffective with the plan freeze. Interest credits, which generally equal the yield on one-year U.S. Treasury\nbills plus 1% (subject to a minimum of 4.5%), continue to accrue. Account balances include the value of\nbenefits earned under prior heritage company plans, if any. Benefits are payable as an actuarially\nequivalent lifetime annuity with survivorship rights (if married) or optionally under a variety of other\npayment forms, including a single-sum distribution.\n\nExcess Retirement Plan \u2014 Benefits were determined under the same terms and conditions as the Retirement\nPlan, but reflecting base salary in excess of IRS limits up to $1 million and benefit amounts in excess of\nIRS limits. Benefits are generally payable in a lump sum in the year following termination. The plan is\nclosed to new participants and accruals under the plan were discontinued as of May 1, 2009.\n\nPresent value of accumulated benefits \u2014 The valuation method and all material assumptions used to calculate\nthe amounts above are consistent with those reflected in Note 8 to the Firm\u2019s Consolidated Financial\nStatements in the 2024 Form 10-K on pages 230 - 232. Key assumptions include the discount rate (5.65%);\ninterest rates (interest crediting rates of 5.20% for 2025, and 5.25% thereafter, to project cash balances;\n4.80% to convert annuities to lump sums and lump sums to\n                              \n  68    2025 Proxy Statement  \n                              \nTable of Contents\n                                           \n  Executive compensation tables|Executive  \n  compensation                             \n                                           \nannuities) and mortality rates (for the present value of annuities, the Pri-2012 (white-collar) projected\ngenerational mortality table with projection scale MP2021; for lump sums, the UP94 mortality table projected\nto 2002, with 50%/50% male/female weighting). We assumed benefits would commence at normal retirement date\nor unreduced retirement date, if earlier. Benefits paid from the Retirement Plan were assumed to be paid\neither as single-sum distributions (with probability of 85%) or life annuities (with probability of\n15%).Benefits from the Excess Retirement Plan are paid as single-sum distributions. No death or other\nseparation from service was assumed prior to retirement date.\n\nVI. 2024 Non-qualified deferred compensation\n\nThe Deferred Compensation Plan allows eligible participants to defer their annual cash incentive\ncompensation awards on a before-tax basis up to a maximum of $1 million. A lifetime $10 million cap applies\nto deferrals of cash made after 2005. No deferral elections have been permitted relative to equity awards\nsince 2006. During 2024, there were no contributions made by the Firm nor contributions made or withdrawals\nor distributions received by the Named Executive Officers.\n                                                                                               \n                          Aggregate earnings                Aggregate                          \n                          (loss) in last                    balance at last                    \n  Name                    fiscal year ($)1                  fiscal year\u2013end ($)                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  James Dimon                                   $  9,027                           $  171,116  \n  Daniel Pinto                                       864                               27,312  \n  Mary Callahan Erdoes                                 \u2014                                    \u2014  \n  Troy Rohrbaugh                                       \u2014                                    \u2014  \n  Jeremy Barnum                                        \u2014                                    \u2014  \n                                                                                               \n1 The Deferred Compensation Plan allows participants to direct their deferrals among several investment\nchoices, including JPMorganChase common stock; an interest income fund based 50% on a weighted average of\nreturns by Hartford Investment Management Company SVA Bond Index Division and 50% by Newport Group\ndesignated set of general account life insurance policies owned by JPMorganChase; Hartford funds indexed to\nfixed income, bond, balanced, S&P 500, Russell 2000 and international portfolios; and Hartford investments\nin Vanguard Variable Insurance Fund high-yield bond, mid-cap and REIT index. In addition, there are balances\nin deemed investment choices from heritage company plans that are no longer open to new deferrals.\n\nInvestment returns in 2024 for the following investment choices were: Short-Term Fixed Income, 6.36%;\nInterest Income, 3.28%; Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, 1.19%; High-Yield, 6.3%; Balanced\nPortfolio, 12.59%; S&P 500 Index, 24.96%; Mid-Cap Index, 15.08%; Russell 2000 Index, 11.42%; REIT Index,\n4.74%; International, 9.01%; and JPMorganChase common stock, including dividend equivalents, 44.27%.\n\nBeginning with deferrals credited January 2005 under the Deferred Compensation Plan, participants were\nrequired to elect to receive distribution of the deferral balance beginning either following retirement or\ntermination or in a specific year but no earlier than the second anniversary of the date the deferral would\notherwise have been paid. If retirement or termination were elected, payments will commence during the\ncalendar year following retirement or termination. Participants may elect the distribution to be lump sum or\nannual installments for a maximum of 15 years. With respect to deferrals made after December 31, 2004, under\nthe Deferred Compensation Plan, account balances are automatically paid as a lump sum in the year following\ntermination if employment terminates prior to the participant attaining 15 years of service. With respect to\ndeferrals made after December 31, 2017, account balances are automatically paid as a lump sum in the year\nfollowing termination if employment terminates prior to the participant attaining 5 years of service. The\nSupplemental Savings and Investment Plan (\u201cSSIP\u201d) is a heritage plan applicable to former Bank One employees\nwhich is closed to new participants and does not permit new deferrals. It functions similarly to the\nDeferred Compensation Plan. The investment return in 2024 for the following investment choice was: Short-\nTerm Fixed Income, 5.56%. With respect to the SSIP, account balances are automatically paid as a lump sum in\nthe year following termination unless an installment option is elected prior to termination of employment.\n                              \n  2025 Proxy Statement    69  \n                              \nTable of Contents\n                                                 \n  Executive compensation|Executive compensation  \n  tables                                         \n                                                 \nVII. 2024 Potential payments upon termination or change in control\n\nWe believe our pay practices relating to termination events, summarized below, illustrate our commitment to\nsound corporate governance, are consistent with best practices and are aligned with shareholder interests.\n\nTermination policies aligned with shareholder interests\n                                                                                                            \n  No golden parachute agreements    \u2022NEOs are not entitled to any accelerated cash/equity payments or       \n                                    special benefits upon a change in control                               \n  No employment agreements          \u2022NEOs are \u201cat will\u201d employees and are not covered by employment         \n                                    agreements                                                              \n  No special cash severance         \u2022Severance amounts for NEOs are capped at one-year salary, not to       \n                                    exceed $400,000                                                         \n  No special executive benefits     \u2022NEOs are not entitled to any special benefits upon termination         \n                                                                                                            \nStandard, broad-based severance\n\nMr. Dimon, Mr. Pinto, Ms. Erdoes, Mr. Rohrbaugh and Mr. Barnum are covered under the Firm\u2019s broad-based U.S.\nSeverance Pay Plan.

In addition, in the event of termination by the Firm for reasons other\nthan cause, employees may be considered, at the discretion of the Firm, for a cash payment in lieu of an\nannual incentive compensation award, taking into consideration all circumstances the Firm deems relevant,\nincluding the circumstances of the employee\u2019s leaving and the employee\u2019s contributions to the Firm over his\nor her career. Severance benefits and any such discretionary payment are subject to execution of a release\nin favor of the Firm and certain post-termination restrictions.\n\nThe table on the following page sets forth the benefits and compensation which the Named Executive Officers\nwould have received if their employment had terminated on December 31, 2024. The amounts shown in the table\non the following page do not include other payments and benefits available generally to salaried employees\nupon termination of employment, such as accrued vacation pay, distributions from the 401(k) Savings Plan,\npension and deferred compensation plans, or any death, disability or post retirement welfare benefits\navailable under broad-based employee plans. For information on the pension and deferred compensation plans,\nsee \u201cTable V: 2024 Pension benefits\u201d on page 68and 69and \u201cTable VI: 2024 Non-qualified deferred\ncompensation\u201d on page 69. Such tables also do not show the value of exercisable SARs, which would be listed\nin \u201cTable III: Outstanding equity awards at fiscal year-end 2024\u201d on pages 66and 67; however, there were no\nexercisable SARs outstanding on December 31, 2024.\n\nNEOs are not entitled to any additional equity awards in connection with a potential termination. Rather,\nunder certain termination scenarios including disability, death, termination without cause, or resignation\n(if full-career eligible), NEOs\u2019 outstanding equity awards continue to vest in accordance with their terms\n(or accelerate in the event of death). The table on the following page shows the value of these unvested\nRSUs, PSUs and SARs based on the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2024.\n\nGovernment Office provision\n\nEmployees with applicable awards, including NEOs, are covered under the Firm\u2019s Government Office provision\nwhich allows for continued vesting of equity awards if the employee resigns to accept a covered government\noffice. For such employees who are full-career eligible, outstanding performance year awards continue to\nvest in accordance with their terms whether they leave the Firm to enter government service or otherwise,\nso, for these awards, the Government Office provision does not provide any benefit to employees who are\nfull-career eligible. All NEOs meet the full-career eligibility provision of their applicable awards. 1\n\nFor employees who are not full-career eligible, and for awards that do not have full career eligibility\nprovisions, the value of awards that would continue to vest as a result of the Government Office provision\nof our equity plan would equal a percentage of the unvested stock awards ranging from 0% prior to three\nyears of employment by the Firm to 50% after three years of employment increasing to 100% after five years.\n\n1 Refer to Notes 3 and 6 on page 71.\n

awards, the former employee remains subject to the applicable terms of\nthe award agreement as if the award had remained outstanding for the duration of the original vesting\nperiod, including the clawback provisions and post-employment obligations.\n\nAny awards not eligible for continued vesting under the terms of the plan are forfeited and they do not\naccelerate.\n\nIn 2024, no current or

NEOs are not entitled to\nany additional equity awards in connection with a potential termination. Potential payments upon termination\nwould be subject to compliance with applicable terms and conditions of each outstanding equity award,\nincluding confidentiality and non-solicitation obligations.\n\n2 Involuntary terminations without cause include involuntary terminations due to redundancies and\ninvoluntary terminations without alternative employment. For \u201cSeverance and other,\u201d amounts shown represent\nseverance under the Firm\u2019s broad-based U.S. Severance Pay Plan.

The awards shown represent RSUs and PSUs that would\ncontinue to vest because the NEOs have met the full-career eligibility criteria. The awards are subject to\ncontinuing post-employment obligations to the Firm during this period.\n\n4 In the case of disability, stock awards continue to vest pursuant to their original vesting schedule.\n\n5 Vesting restrictions on stock awards and restrictions upon exercise of SARs lapse immediately upon death.\n\n6 The Government Office provision of an award does not provide any benefit to employees who have met the\nfull-career eligibility provision of that same award. Therefore, under the terms of the Government Office\nprovision, NEOs would generally not receive any benefit upon termination since they meet the full-career\neligibility provision entitling them to continued vesting of their equity awards (see preceding Note 3). For\nawards that do not have the full career eligibility provision, the amount reported is based on the December\n31, 2024 value of the award in which the NEO is eligible to continue to vest.\n\n7 For death, represents the value of PSUs granted on January 18, 2022, January 17, 2023, and January 16,\n2024 assuming: (a) maximum payout related to 2022, 2023, and 2024 performance years; (b) target payout\nrelated to 2025 and 2026 performance years; and (c) accumulated reinvested dividend equivalent shares as of\nDecember 31, 2024.

ROTCE is a comprehensive performance metric that measures the Firm\u2019s net income applicable to\ncommon equity as a percentage of average tangible common equity, and reflects how well management is using\nshareholders\u2019 equity to generate profit. It is a fundamental performance metric that is widely used by the\nFirm, investors and analysts in assessing the earnings power of common shareholders\u2019 equity capital, and is\nuseful for comparing the profitability of the Firm with that of our competitors.\n                                                                                                            \n                                     A\u2026                                                                     \n                                     S\u2026            A\u2026            V\u2026                                         \n       S\u2026                            C\u2026            C\u2026            of                                         \n       C\u2026             C\u2026             T\u2026            A\u2026            I\u2026                                         \n       T\u2026             A\u2026             T\u2026            P\u2026            F\u2026                                         \n  \u2026    T\u2026       P\u2026    P\u2026             f\u2026            to            $\u2026                                         \n  \u2026    f\u2026       G\u2026    to             n\u2026            n\u2026            I\u2026                     \u2026                   \n  \u2026    P\u2026       T\u2026    P\u2026             N\u2026            N\u2026            B\u2026                     \u2026             \u2026     \n  \u2026    (\u2026       (\u2026    (\u2026             (\u2026            (\u2026            O\u2026                     \u2026             \u2026     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026          $  3\u2026          $  2\u2026          $  \u2026          $  \u2026          $  \u2026    $  1\u2026         $  5\u2026    \u2026     \n  \u2026             3\u2026             1\u2026             \u2026             \u2026             \u2026       1\u2026            4\u2026    \u2026  %  \n  \u2026             3\u2026             3\u2026             \u2026             \u2026             \u2026       1\u2026            3\u2026    \u2026  %  \n  \u2026             8\u2026             1\u2026             \u2026             \u2026             \u2026       1\u2026            4\u2026    \u2026  %  \n  \u2026             3\u2026             1\u2026             \u2026             \u2026             \u2026       9\u2026            2\u2026    \u2026  %  \n                                                                                                            \n1 NEOs included in the above table are comprised of the following individuals.

In\n2022, both PEO CAP and non-PEO NEO average CAP decreased significantly from 2021, due to a decrease in the\nFirm\u2019s stock price as of year-end 2022, consistent with the broader market decline. The largest impact of\nthe change in the stock price was on Messrs. Dimon and Pinto\u2019s outstanding SARs awards, both of which were\nout of the money as of the end of 2022. In 2023 and 2024, the increases in both PEO CAP and non-PEO NEO\naverage CAP were attributable to an increase in the Firm\u2019s stock price as of year- end, which outperformed\nthe S&P Financials Index as well as the broader market in general. Additionally, the PEO and non-PEO NEO\naverage CAP were impacted by Messrs. Dimon and Pinto\u2019s outstanding SARs awards, both of which were in the\nmoney as of the end of 2023 and 2024.\n\nIn summary, the Firm\u2019s PEO CAP and non-PEO NEO average CAP reflect a general correlation with:\n\n\u2022 The Firm\u2019s stock price and TSR, primarily due to a significant majority of our NEOs\u2019 compensation being in\nthe form of long-term equity\n\n\u2022 The Firm\u2019s net income, which reflects our pay-for-performance compensation philosophy and practices\n\n\u2022 The Firm\u2019s ROTCE, which reflects the Firm's strong returns and fortress balance sheet\n\nIn addition, the Firm\u2019s change in TSR over the past five years reflects a general correlation with that of\nthe broader S&P Financials Index.\n\nUnranked tabular list of the Firm\u2019s most important financial performance measures\n\nAs required by SEC rules, the most important financial performance measures that the Firm used to link\nexecutive compensation during the last fiscal year to company performance are listed below.\n                                                     \n  Performance Measures                               \n  Managed revenue for the Firm and the lines of      \n  business                                           \n  Pre-tax income (ex.

Therefore, as\npermitted under SEC rules, for this year\u2019s disclosure we have used the 2024 annual total compensation of the\nsame estimated median employee that we identified for disclosure in our 2024 and 2023 Proxy Statements.\n\nConsistent with the disclosure in our 2024 and 2023 Proxy Statements, annual total compensation included\nsalary as of December 31, 2022, as well as overtime pay, fixed allowance and incentive compensation, if\napplicable. We annualized the salary portion of the compensation for employees who were hired during 2022;\nhowever, we did not make any full-time equivalent adjustments to part-time, temporary and seasonal\nemployees. We did not apply any cost-of-living adjustments as part of the calculation. In determining the\nscope of our employees (other than our CEO), we included our global workforce of full-time, part-time,\ntemporary and seasonal employees who were employed as of December 31, 2022.\n\nComparability\n\nWe believe the ratio above is a reasonable estimate, based on the methodology we have described. Given the\ndifferent methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions other companies may use to calculate their\nrespective CEO pay ratios, as well as differences in employment and compensation practices between\ncompanies, the estimated ratio reported above may not be comparable to that reported by other companies.\n\n1 For purposes of the CEO pay ratio disclosure, Mr. Dimon\u2019s annual total compensation includes the amount\nreported in the \u201cTotal\u201d column of the 2024 Summary compensation table on page 64which includes change in\npension value, plus the value of Firm contributions to broad-based employee benefits applicable to Mr.\nDimon.\n\n2 The estimated median employee\u2019s annual total compensation includes change in pension value, plus the value\nof Firm contributions to broad-based employee benefits and 401(k) plan contributions.\n                              \n  2025 Proxy Statement    75  \n                              \nTable of Contents\n                                                \n  Executive compensation|Security ownership of  \n  directors and executive officers              \n                                                \nSecurity ownership of directors and executive officers\n\nOur share retention policies require share ownership for directors and executive officers, as described on\npages 33and 50, respectively.\n\nThe following table shows the number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents beneficially\nowned by each director, nominee and the current executive officers named in the SCT, and all directors,\nnominees and executive officers as a group as of February 28, 2025.

For information on the factors evaluated by the Audit\nCommittee, see the Audit Committee Report on pages 81- 82.\n\nThe members of the Audit Committee and the Board believe that continued retention of PwC as the Firm\u2019s\nindependent external auditor is in the best interests of JPMorganChase and its shareholders. PwC and its\npredecessors have acted as our independent registered public accounting firm since 1965. The Board believes\nthe Firm receives significant benefits from the extensive history PwC has with the Firm. These benefits\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 the high quality of its audit work and accounting advice, as a result of their institutional knowledge of\nour businesses, global operations, key risks, accounting policies, financial systems and internal control\nframework;\n\n\u2022 its audit efficiency and effectiveness, which results in a lower fee structure due to their history and\nfamiliarity with our businesses;\n\n\u2022 the time and expense that would be avoided by management and staff in order to onboard a new auditor; and\n\n\u2022 its commitment to maintaining their independence from the Firm.\n\nA member of PwC will be present at the annual meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement and\nrespond to appropriate questions from shareholders.\n\nBoard oversight of PwC\n\nThe Audit Committee held eight private sessions with PwC during 2024.\n\nThe Audit Committee assesses PwC\u2019s independence throughout the year. This includes reviewing with PwC its\npractices for maintaining its independence. The Audit Committee has also established policies and procedures\nfor approving services provided by PwC. It is JPMorganChase\u2019s policy to use PwC only for audit and audit-\nrelated services, as well as tax services in certain circumstances. For more information, see \"Audit\nCommittee approval policies and procedures\" on page 80.\n\nNo member of PwC\u2019s audit team may be hired by the Firm for a period of one year after such person\ntransferred from the Firm\u2019s audit engagement to another role at PwC, or has terminated employment with PwC.\nFurther, no former PwC employee who was a manager or partner may be hired by the Firm as the CFO, Principal\nAccounting Officer, General Auditor, Treasurer, Director of Tax or CFO or Controller of a LOB or Corporate\nfunction for a period of two years following his or her termination of employment with PwC.\n\nIn accordance with SEC rules and PwC policies, audit partners are subject to rotation requirements to limit\nthe number of consecutive years of service an individual partner may provide audit services to the Firm. The\nlead audit partner and quality review partner may provide services to our Firm for a maximum of five\nconsecutive years. The Audit Committee approved the selection of the current lead audit partner beginning\nwith the 2021 audit engagement. The lead audit partner is expected to serve in this capacity through the end\nof the 2025 audit.\n                              \n  2025 Proxy Statement    79  \n                              \nTable of Contents\n                                                 \n  Audit matters|Proposal 3: Ratification of      \n  independent registered public accounting firm  \n                                                 \nFees paid to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for negotiating the terms and fees associated with the Firm\u2019s retention\nof PwC, including the annual integrated audit of the Firm\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAggregate fees for professional services rendered by PwC for JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries for the\nyears ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, were:\n                                                                   \n  Year ended December 31,                                          \n  ($ in millions)            2024                2023              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Audit                              $   78.5            $   77.5  \n  Audit-related                          36.0                31.0  \n  Tax                                     4.5                 3.9  \n  Total                              $  119.0            $  112.4  \n                                                                   \nThe amounts reported in the table above exclude all fees paid to PwC by investment companies and asset\nmanagement funds (e.g., private equity, mutual and exchange-traded funds, and collective investment funds),\nand special purpose vehicles that are sponsored, managed or advised by subsidiaries of JPMorganChase but are\nnot consolidated with the Firm.

These services include attestation and agreed-upon procedures\nwhich address accounting, reporting and control matters relating to fiduciary, transaction processing,\ninvestment management, servicing activities and ESG initiatives; reviews related to investment and lending\nprocesses, and technology systems; and due diligence reviews related to acquisitions and divestitures. These\nservices are normally provided in connection with the recurring audit engagement. The increase in audit-\nrelated fees is primarily driven by services rendered during the calendar year, including complying with\nadditional control reporting requirements, as well as new engagements due to continued business growth.\n\nTax fees\n\nFees for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, for tax compliance and tax return preparation services\nwere $4.3 million and $3.7 million, respectively. Fees for other tax services, including tax advisory and\nconsultation on tax matters, were $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively.\n                                                                                                            \n   Audit Committee approval policies and procedures                                                         \n                                                                                                            \nThe Audit Committee\u2019s policies and procedures require the Audit Committee to pre-approve a list of specified\naudit,\naudit-related and tax services, and review and approve the terms and fees for the annual integrated audit of\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Board has determined that each member of our committee has no material relationship with the\nFirm under the Board\u2019s director independence standards and that each member is independent under the listing\nstandards of the NYSE, where the Firm\u2019s securities are listed, and under the SEC\u2019s standards relating to the\nindependence of audit committees. The Board has also determined that each member is financially literate and\nis an audit committee financial expert as defined by the SEC.\n\nCharter\n\nThe Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board, which is available on our website\nat jpmorganchase.com/about/governance/board-committees/audit-committee. We annually review our charter and\nour practices. We have determined that our charter and practices are consistent with the listing standards\nof the NYSE and the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The purpose of the Audit Committee is to\nassist the Board in its oversight of:\n\n\u2022 the independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s qualifications and independence,\n\n\u2022 the performance of the Firm\u2019s internal audit function and the independent registered public accounting\nfirm, and\n\n\u2022 management\u2019s responsibilities to assure that there is in place an effective system of controls reasonably\ndesigned to safeguard the assets and income of the Firm; assure the integrity of the Firm\u2019s financial\nstatements; and maintain compliance with the Firm\u2019s ethical standards, policies, plans and procedures, and\nwith laws and regulations.\n\nAudit communications and fees\n\nWe discussed with PwC the matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(\u201cPCAOB\u201d) Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees , including PwC\u2019s overall audit\nscope and audit approach as set forth in the terms of their engagement letter; PwC\u2019s overall audit strategy\nfor significant audit risks identified by them; and the nature and extent of the specialized skills\nnecessary to perform the planned audit. We have established procedures to receive and track the handling of\nissues regarding accounting and reporting, internal control and auditing matters. In addition, we monitor\nthe audit, audit-related and tax services provided by PwC. The Audit Committee has also evaluated and\nconcluded that audit-related and tax services provided by PwC do not impair PwC\u2019s independence.\n\nDetails of the fees paid to PwC for its services, as well as the Audit Committee\u2019s \u201cpre-approval policy\u201d for\nsuch services, can be found on page 80.\n\nAssessment of PwC\n\nThe Audit Committee annually evaluates PwC\u2019s qualifications, performance and independence in connection with\nits determination as to whether to retain PwC. In conducting our evaluation we considered, among other\nthings:\n\n\u2022 the professional qualifications of PwC, and that of the lead audit partner, quality review partner and\nother key engagement partners;\n\n\u2022 PwC\u2019s current and historical performance on the Firm\u2019s audit, including the extent and quality of its\ncommunications with the Audit Committee and the Firm\u2019s management related to accounting and auditing issues,\nlegislative and regulatory developments impacting financial institutions as well as industry insights,\ntrends and emerging practices;\n\n\u2022 PwC\u2019s demonstrated professional skepticism and objectivity, including fresh perspectives brought through\nthe required periodic rotation of the lead audit partner, the quality review partner and other partners who\nplay a significant role in the audit engagement;\n\n\u2022 PwC\u2019s demonstrated capability, expertise and efficiency in which it navigates the breadth and complexity\nof the Firm\u2019s global operations, including the use of technology, specialists, and subject matter experts;\n\n\u2022 PwC\u2019s depth of institutional knowledge and understanding of the Firm\u2019s global businesses, operations and\nsystems, the financial services industry, including the global regulatory environment, U.S. and\ninternational accounting standards, the potential effect on the financial statements of the significant\nrisks and exposures facing the Firm, and the Firm\u2019s internal control over financial reporting;\n\n\u2022 external data relating to PwC\u2019s audit quality and performance, including recent PCAOB reports on PwC\n(including its global network of firms), and the results of peer review and self-review examinations;\n                              \n  2025 Proxy Statement    81  \n                              \nTable of Contents\n                                        \n  Audit matters|Audit Committee report  \n                                        \n\u2022 an analysis of PwC\u2019s known legal risks and significant proceedings that could impair PwC\u2019s ability to\nperform the Firm\u2019s annual audit;\n                                                                                                            \n  \u2022                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  PwC\u2019s tenure as the Firm\u2019s independent auditor;                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n\u2022 the appropriateness of PwC\u2019s fees, both on an absolute basis and as compared with fees paid by certain\npeer banking firms; and\n\n\u2022 the advisability and potential impact of selecting a different independent registered public accounting\nfirm, including the additional costs and inefficiencies associated with hiring a new independent registered\npublic accounting firm.\n\nPwC provided us the written disclosures and the letter required by PCAOB\u2019s Ethics and Independence Rule\n3526, Communications with Audit Committees Concerning Independence. After discussions, we confirmed with PwC\ntheir independence.\n\nAs a result of this evaluation, we believe PwC has the capability to provide the necessary expertise,\nindependence and professional skepticism to continue to audit the Firm\u2019s businesses, and we approved the\nappointment of PwC as JPMorganChase\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm for 2025, subject to\nshareholder ratification.\n\nManagement is responsible for the Firm\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, the financial reporting\nprocess and JPMorganChase\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements. PwC is responsible for performing an\nindependent audit of JPMorganChase\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements and of the effectiveness of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting in accordance with auditing standards promulgated by the PCAOB. The Firm\u2019s\nInternal Audit function, under the direction of the General Auditor, is independent of the Firm\u2019s businesses\nand the Independent Risk Management function. Internal Audit reports directly to the Audit Committee (and\nadministratively to the Firm\u2019s CEO) and is responsible for preparing an annual audit plan and conducting\ninternal audits intended to independently test and evaluate the Firm\u2019s governance, risk management and\ninternal controls. The members of the Audit Committee are not professionally engaged in the practice of\naccounting or auditing; as noted above, the Audit Committee\u2019s responsibility is to monitor and oversee these\nprocesses.\n\nThe Audit Committee regularly meets and holds discussions with the Firm\u2019s management, internal auditors and\nwith PwC, and also holds private sessions with the General Auditor and with PwC, without members of\nmanagement present. These discussions include issues encountered during the audit, the Firm\u2019s quarterly\nearnings materials, and Quarterly and Annual Reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, respectively, prior to\nfiling with the SEC; as well as actions the Audit Committee has taken during the prior year.\n\nManagement represented to us that JPMorganChase\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). We\nreviewed and discussed JPMorganChase\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements with management, the General\nAuditor and PwC. We also reviewed and discussed with PwC the quality of the Firm\u2019s significant accounting\nprinciples, the reasonableness of critical accounting estimates and judgments, critical audit matters PwC\nidentified during the audit, and the disclosures in JPMorganChase\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements,\nincluding disclosures relating to significant accounting policies. We relied, without independent\nverification, on the information provided to us and on the representations made by management, internal\nauditors and the independent auditor. Based on our review of the reports given to us by PwC and our\ndiscussions with the Firm\u2019s management, internal auditors and PwC, as well as their respective\nrepresentations to us, we recommended to the Board, and the Board approved, inclusion of the audited\nConsolidated Financial Statements in the 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC.\n\nMarch 17, 2025\n                                                                                                            \n  Audit Committee                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Mark A.

The shareholder proposals and supporting statements appear in the form they were submitted\nto us.\n\nOur Board and senior management spend a significant amount of time considering each shareholder proposal the\nFirm receives, engaging with the proponents to better understand their views, assessing the relevance of the\nsubject matter to our business, considering the opinions of other shareholders to prioritize shareholder\nviews and considering the potential costs and benefits of the request. The Board\u2019s focus is on its fiduciary\nduty, namely, advancing the long-term financial interests of the Firm\u2019s shareholders.\n\nConsistent with recent trends we\u2019ve observed, some proposals the Firm receives do not explain how they\npromote shareholders\u2019 interests or even assert that they do. Some proposals provide no empirical evidence of\nfinancial effectiveness; some propose solutions without identifying a failure, material problem, or\nhistorical significant risk at the Firm and also ask the Firm to adopt practices that are not common among\nour peers; and still others are based on assertions about the Firm that we believe are inaccurate and\nmisleading.\n\nThere is meaningful cost attached to the implementation of each shareholder proposal. For instance, one\nproposal requests preparation of a report. In 2024, the Firm published a number of reports, including an ESG\nReport and a Climate Report, on topics that we have determined to be of interest to a broad base of\nshareholders and other stakeholders. Each of these reports require considerable time and resources to\nproduce, including senior management time and attention. Creating additional and potentially duplicative\nreports is not a good use of resources, particularly when, based on our assessment, interest in the topic is\nlimited.\n\nAfter a thorough evaluation, taking into account the potential costs, benefits, and alignment with our\nshareholders\u2019 long-term financial interests, as well as the themes addressed in the proposals, the Board\nstrongly recommends a vote AGAINST each of the shareholder proposals presented within this proxy statement.\n\nWe firmly believe in the value of shareholder engagement and recognize that our shareholders hold diverse\nviews and perspectives on various issues. While the Board recommends votes AGAINST these proposals, we\nremain open to continued engagement with the proponents and others who share our commitment to the long-term\nvalue of JPMorganChase.\n                              \n  84    2025 Proxy Statement  \n                              \nTable of Contents\n                                                                                                            \n  Shareholder proposals                                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                             \n  PROPOSAL 4:                                \n  Support for an independent board chairman  \n                                             \nJohn Chevedden has advised us that he intends to introduce the following resolution:\n\nShareholders request that the Board of Directors adopt an enduring policy, and amend the governing documents\nas necessary in order that 2 separate people hold the office of the Chairman and the office of the CEO as\nfollows:\n\nSelection of the Chairman of the Board The Board requires the separation of the offices of the Chairman of\nthe Board and the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nWhenever possible, the Chairman of the Board shall be an Independent Director.\n\nThe Board has the discretion to select a Temporary Chairman of the Board who is not an Independent Director\nto serve while the Board is seeking an Independent Chairman of the Board on an accelerated basis.\n\nIt is a best practice to adopt this proposal soon. However this policy could be phased in when there is a\ncontract renewal for our current CEO or for the next CEO transition.\n\nThis proposal topic won 47%-support at the 2021 JPM annual meeting. It takes much more JPM shareholder\nconviction of the merits of this proposal to vote for this shareholder proposal than to reflexively vote\naccording to the JPM Board of Directors instructions.\n\nThere are at least 2 ways 47%-support can be considered a 50%+ majority vote at JPM. This 47% vote was\nespecially impressive because this proposal had to swim upstream against repeated Madison Avenue type\nspecial solicitations sent to the JPM shareholders who have no access to independent proxy voting advice.\n\nThe 47% also represented a 50%+ majority vote from professional investors who had access to independent\nproxy voting advice. Any proposal that gets above 45% support has to get a majority vote from the most\ninformed shares because there is an overwhelming abundance of automatic against votes from the JPM shares\nthat have no access to independent proxy voting advice.\n\nThe Board of Directors disingenuously put forth a deceptive policy, to dupe shareholders who have no access\nto independent proxy voting advice, that said JPM could always have one person fill the 2 most important\njobs at JPM as long as the JPM directors gave almost any excuse to violate the policy. Putting forth a\ndeceptive policy is worse than taking no action at all in response to a JPM shareholder proposal.\n\nJPM also needs to take the role of the lead director seriously. JPM's so-called Lead Director violates the\nmost important attribute of a Lead Director \u2014 independence. As director tenure goes up director independence\ngoes down. The JPM lead director has 21-years director tenure. The JPM lead director may be close to setting\na record for long-tenure by a lead director. And the JPM so-called lead director was the target of 186\nmillion against votes at the 2024 JPM annual meeting.\n\nPlease vote yes:\n\nSupport for an Independent Board Chairman \u2014 Proposal 4\n                              \n  2025 Proxy Statement    85  \n                              \nTable of Contents\n                                                                                                            \n  Shareholder proposals                                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \nBoard response to proposal 4\n                                                                                                            \n  The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders voteAGAINSTthis proposal for the following reasons:   \n  \u2022Outstanding long-term performance does not happen without exceptional leadership. Under the current      \n  leadership structure, the Firm continues to grow its business, improve its products and services and      \n  lift up communities. As described throughout this proxy statement, this structure has allowed for         \n  effective execution on strategic priorities.                                                              \n  \u2022The proposal calls for a mandatory, enduring, and inflexible policy on leadership structure but          \n  presents absolutely no evidence that a policy to maintain a separate CEO and Chair leadership structure   \n  serves the best interests of the Firm and its shareholders. In fact, this underlying assumption is        \n  contradicted by the practices of the majority of the largest U.S. public companies and the Firm\u2019s         \n  consistent financial outperformance under its current leadership structure.                               \n  \u2022Determining the optimal Board leadership structure is crucial for fulfilling the Board's fiduciary duty  \n  to shareholders. The Board conducts an annual evaluation of its leadership structure, leveraging its      \n  experience, judgment, boardroom insight, and ongoing shareholder feedback to make informed decisions.     \n  Historically, the Board has separated the Chair and CEO roles in half of the Firm\u2019s last six management   \n  transitions and is considering doing so again in the upcoming transition. This flexibility demonstrates   \n  the Board's commitment to adapting its leadership structure to best serve the Firm's interests,           \n  effectively discharging its fiduciary responsibilities.                                                   \n  \u2022The proposal fails to recognize the robustness of the Firm\u2019s Lead Independent Director role which is     \n  empowered to serve as a strong counterbalance to the CEO and exercises independent authority. In fact,    \n  the current Lead Independent Director has been particularly effective at guiding the Board\u2019s              \n  responsiveness to shareholder concerns, reflected in the consistently high shareholder support received   \n  by our Lead Independent Director during his tenure in the role.                                           \n                                                                                                            \nWe have received similar proposals for multiple years, but we, and a majority of our shareholders, continue\nto disagree with the prescriptive proposal. In 2024, the Firm reported another record year of strong returns\nalongside future investment, maintained its fortress balance sheet, and strengthened controls. The proposal\nlacks empirical evidence that a separate CEO/Chair leadership structure is superior for the shareholders of\nour company. Further, the proposal does not acknowledge the exceptional outperformance of the company while\nMr. Dimon has held both roles, and it does not recognize the effectiveness of our independent Lead Director\nand independent Board, for JPMorganChase.\n\nThere is no consensus on a single ideal leadership structure for all companies, as evidenced by the\nproponent's lack of empirical support. However, a clear \"market practice\" exists among our peers; a market\npractice study shows the majority of the 100 largest U.S. public companies listed on the New York Stock\nExchange and Nasdaq have a combined CEO and Chair role, and approximately 30% of the minority of those\ncompanies with separate roles do not have an independent chair.\n\nThe Board of Directors remains in the best position to determine the appropriate structure of its leadership\nat any given time. More importantly, our Board is not fixed in its view of whether the Firm is best served\nby a combined or separated Chair/CEO function \u2013 in fact, it has separated the Chair and CEO roles in half of\nthe Firm\u2019s six previous management transitions, and it currently contemplates doing so again in the next\ntransition. This demonstrates its ability to effectively discharge its fiduciary duties with respect to\nleadership structure.\n\nThe Board has also implemented strong governance of this assessment, by requiring an annual review of\nleadership structure. Each year the Board considers, among other factors, the composition of the Board, the\nindividuals serving in leadership positions and their performance, the needs and opportunities of the Firm\nat the time, the Firm\u2019s long-term performance and shareholder feedback. This proposal would eliminate the\nBoard\u2019s ability to use its experience, judgment, boardroom insight, and ongoing shareholder feedback to make\nthe most informed decision on its own leadership structure based on current facts and circumstances \u2014 and\nmay require structures that do not best serve our shareholders.\n\nContrary to its request for a mandatory, enduring, and inflexible policy on leadership structure, the\nproposal actually supports Board judgment by providing for the Board\u2019s discretion in appointing a non-\nindependent \u201cTemporary Chairman\u201d while it seeks an independent Chair. It is unclear what the proponent\nintends in suggesting that the Board appoint a \u201cTemporary Chairman\u201d \u2014 this is not a standard corporate\ngovernance practice and would undermine the authority of the role of the Chair. However, this feature serves\nto demonstrate why an inflexible policy is inconsistent with good practice and shareholder value.\n                              \n  86    2025 Proxy Statement  \n                              \nTable of Contents\n                                                                                                            \n  Shareholder proposals                                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \nThe proposal also makes several inaccurate statements that may mislead shareholders. It claims there are\nways in which a 2021 proposal on this topic, which received 47% support, may be deemed to have received\nmajority support. The proposal did not, in fact, receive majority support. Nonetheless, the Board responded\nto support garnered by the proposal in 2021 by enhancing our Corporate Governance Principles to separate the\nChair and CEO positions at the next CEO transition, subject to the Board\u2019s determination of the leadership\nstructure that best serves the Firm and its shareholders at that time.\n\nFurther, the proponent asserts that the Board\u2019s adoption of a general policy to separate the Chair and CEO\nroles at the next CEO transition was somehow intended to deceive shareholders. These statements are\ndemonstrably false. The Board has been clear that it believes a mandatory or \u201cenduring\u201d policy that requires\na separate Independent Chair undermines its discretion to respond to shareholder feedback and use its\nexperience, judgment, and boardroom insight to make the best-informed decision about leadership at the time\nand has consistently recommended against adoption of such a policy.\n\nThe Board has also been transparent regarding its amendment of the Corporate Governance Principles in 2022.\nWe disclosed this amendment \u2014 and the Board\u2019s rationale \u2014 in our 2022 proxy statement and have disclosed\nthis policy in each of our annual proxy statements since 2022. The Corporate Governance Principles are also\navailable publicly on our website.\n\nIn addition, the proponent incorrectly asserts that our Lead Independent Director, Stephen B. Burke, is not\nindependent and states the Board does not take this role seriously. Mr. Burke is independent under New York\nStock Exchange rules and the Board\u2019s independence standards which are described in the Firm\u2019s Corporate\nGovernance Principles (see p. 18of this proxy statement for further information). In addition, Mr. Burke\u2019s\nservice on the Board has allowed him to gain invaluable institutional knowledge, making him extremely\neffective as Lead Independent Director. He has been overwhelmingly supported by shareholders, receiving more\nthan 90% of shareholder votes for each election during his tenure as Lead Independent Director. The Lead\nIndependent Director role is empowered to serve as a strong and effective counterbalance and thought partner\nto the CEO. Contrary to the claims of this proposal, the Lead Independent Director role includes robust\nresponsibilities and independent authority, including the facilitation of independent oversight of\nmanagement and promotion of open dialogue among independent directors during Board meetings, at executive\nsessions without the presence of the CEO, and in between Board meetings.\n\nIt should also be noted that each member of the Board except for Mr. Dimon is independent. The Board meets\nseparately from Mr. Dimon at every regularly scheduled meeting and provides direct feedback to him\nafterward. A simple majority of the Board can remove Mr. Dimon as CEO at any time for any reason. Mr. Dimon\nhas no contract and serves at the pleasure of the Board.\n\nOutstanding long-term performance does not happen without exceptional leadership. Under the current\nleadership structure, the Firm continues to grow its business, improve its products and services and lift up\ncommunities. As described throughout this proxy statement, this structure has allowed for effective\nexecution on strategic priorities. Under Mr. Dimon's leadership as Chair and CEO, overseen by an otherwise\nindependent Board and Lead Independent Director, the Firm has delivered ROTCE that has consistently\noutperformed our major competitors, demonstrating effective oversight and leadership achieved through a\ncombined structure.\n                                       \n  The Board of Directors recommends a  \n  voteAGAINSTthis proposal.            \n                                       \n                              \n  2025 Proxy Statement    87  \n                              \nTable of Contents\n                                                                                                            \n  Shareholder proposals                                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                                  \n  PROPOSAL 5:                                     \n  Report on social impacts of transition finance  \n                                                  \nPaul Rissman has advised us that he intends to introduce the following resolution:\n\nRESOLVED: Shareholders request the Board of Directors of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) issue a report disclosing\nwhether and how the Company addresses the potential risks and opportunities related to the social impacts of\nJPM\u2019s transition finance efforts.\n\nSUPPORTING STATEMENT: Transition finance 1 \u2014 financial support that helps decarbonize high-emitting\nactivities or enables the decarbonization of other economic activities, is an important aspect of JPM\u2019s\nbusiness. JPM\u2019s Center for Carbon Transition \u201cis a key business within J.P. Morgan's Corporate Advisory\u201d and\nassists its Commercial and Investment Bank \u201con a wide variety of strategic sustainability-focused\ntransactions.\u201d 2 JPM states that it has a $1 trillion Green objective, of which $242 billion has already\nbeen financed or facilitated. 3 Managing the human element of this massive climate transition appears as\nimportant as technical innovation or development of new physical infrastructure.\n\nStranded human capital and human rights abuses can generate public resistance to the transition; in\ncontrast, investment in the retraining of people, and demonstrating respect and partnership with communities\ncan ease and accelerate the transition. Whether coal miners losing their jobs in Appalachia or land use and\npollution conflict in communities targeted for lithium mining, climate transition faces backlash where the\nhuman element is ignored. 4 A study of the Environmental Justice Atlas database found that one quarter of\nprojects opposed by environmental defenders were stopped through protest, litigation and other forms of\npopular mobilization. 5\n\nAccording to the World Economic Forum (WEF) 6 \u201c[t]he green transition\u2026 could concentrate job creation in\nalready tight labour markets\u2026 deepen[ing] unemployment in some regions while causing labour shortages in\nothers\u2026\u201d WEF notes that this \u201ccould fuel social and political upheaval.\u201d\n\nThus, part of the work of transition finance is to support finance, public policy or other provisions for\nworker transition such as job retraining and skill development, income support in job transitions, creating\nnew green jobs, and actively planning for economic diversification in affected communities.\n\nThe rights of communities are also at stake, such as in regions where mining of minerals critical to the\ngreen transition threatens human rights and the environment. Transition strategies must respect human\nrights, public health and the environment, or they risk community resistance and supply chain disruption.\n\nUnfortunately, there is precious little in JPM\u2019s disclosures on this topic. References to mitigating\nnegative impacts appear in its 2023 Development Finance Institution Annual Report and Methodology, which\napply to any type of emerging markets investments, but not specifically to transition finance. Otherwise,\ndisclosure concerning the social risks and opportunities of transition finance is absent in JPM\u2019s financial\nand sustainability reports, in contrast to its peer banks. 7 This is doubly concerning as JPM\u2019s \u201cGreen\nProgress\u201d financing and facilitation has declined from 2022 to 2023. 8 JPM\u2019s inadequate disclosure impairs\ninvestors\u2019 ability to understand how its transition finance plans safeguard shareholder returns.\n1 https://www.weforum.org/stories/2023/01/davos23-transition-finance-decarbonization/\n\n2 https://www.jpmorgan.com/investment-banking/center-for-carbon-transition\n\n3 https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-chase-and-co/documents/Climate-Report-2024.pdf\n\n4 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301421518302301\n\n5 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378020301424?via%3Dihub\n\n6 https://intelligence.weforum.org/topics/a1Gb0000000pTDXEA2/key-issues/a1Gb00000015QJKEA2\n\n7 https://www.iccr.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ICCR-The-Role-of-Major-US-Banks-in-a-Just-Transition-to-a-\nNet-Zero-Carbon-Economy-FINAL.pdf\n\n8 https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-chase-and-co/documents/Climate-Report-2024.pdf\n                              \n  88    2025 Proxy Statement  \n                              \nTable of Contents\n                                                                                                            \n  Shareholder proposals                                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \nBoard response to proposal 5\n                                                                                                            \n  The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders voteAGAINSTthis proposal for the following reasons:   \n  \u2022JPMorganChase works to advance sustainable community development, recognizing that healthy communities   \n  are important to our business success.                                                                    \n  \u2022The social factors referenced by the proponent are generally not driven by unique environmental          \n  attributes. Instead, actions to address climate change are often one influence among many in social       \n  factors that are more appropriately addressed through public policy.                                      \n  \u2022Applying an artificially narrow focus to our assessment of environmental and social (\"E&S\") matters      \n  would limit our ability to understand and address the social factors that are relevant to our business.   \n  \u2022There is currently no universally accepted definition of \u201ctransition finance\u201d in the market, which       \n  creates ambiguity and potential misrepresentation. Therefore, providing such disclosure without a clear   \n  standard could mislead investors rather than inform them, undermining the very transparency we aim to     \n  achieve.                                                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \nAt JPMorganChase, our objective is to manage our business and associated risks in a manner that balances\nserving the interests of our clients, customers, and investors while safeguarding the Firm's safety and\nsoundness.\n\nThe world today faces significant environmental and social challenges, which, if not adequately addressed,\ncould pose risks to society and businesses alike.\n\nAssessing our clients\u2019 approach to and performance on E&S matters is a crucial component of risk management\nat JPMorganChase. Inadequate management of E&S risks can impact our clients\u2019 operations and long-term\neconomic viability, increase scrutiny from investors, employees, and regulators, and affect the environment\nand communities globally.\n\nWe recognize that climate change and efforts to address it are complex, broad social and economic\nimplications. We take these considerations seriously. However, these effects are not unique to climate\nchange and are similar to those from other sources. This is why we adopt a holistic approach to assessing\nE&S matters, as we do with other risks.\n\nMany issues raised by the proponent stem from macroeconomic trends arising from a complex set of\ninterlocking factors. While JPMorganChase may share these concerns, they are more appropriately addressed\ndirectly through public policy. Communities and labor forces worldwide face diverse social challenges and\nopportunities that cannot be analyzed in isolation. A narrow focus on \u201ctransition finance\u201d may hinder a\ncomprehensive understanding of broader social challenges and opportunities. For instance, understanding\nlabor dynamics would be incomplete if focused solely on transition finance, excluding other factors.\n\nThe job creation and displacement on which the proponent focuses can occur for many intersecting reasons,\nincluding automation, artificial intelligence, deglobalization of supply chains, evolution of consumer\ndemand, or changes in public policy. While efforts to address climate change may create jobs today, this job\ncreation is generally driven by a broad set of factors such as innovation, new infrastructure construction,\nconsumer demand evolution, or the growth of new sectors.\n\nWe have frameworks to identify client business models with high concentrations of specific environmental and\nsocial risks that pose the highest potential impact to the Firm. Client and transaction decisions consider\nthese frameworks as well as various other client-specific factors, including a client\u2019s track record and\nengagement in resolving identified issues. We continue to invest in talent, data and technology resources to\nsupport the management of climate, nature, and social risks.\n\nThe Firm provides extensive disclosure regarding its approach to environmental, climate change, and social\nissues in its suite of annual reporting, including our most recent Climate Report, ESG Report, regulatory\nfilings, website, press releases, and various other reports and presentations. Additional disclosure related\nto transition finance is unnecessary.\n\nFurthermore, the scope of \u201ctransition finance\u201d is unclear. There is no universally accepted definition of\n\u201ctransition finance\u201d in the market, making it unclear what specific activities would be included in\nadditional disclosure, the utility of additional disclosure, or the risk of potential misrepresentation\nthat, given the lack of a clear standard, could mislead investors rather than inform them, undermining the\nvery transparency we aim to achieve.\n                              \n  2025 Proxy Statement    89  \n                              \nTable of Contents\n                                                                                                            \n  Shareholder proposals                                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \nRecognizing the Firm\u2019s existing suite of disclosure, independent approach to business decisions, the unclear\nutility of narrowly focusing on \u201ctransition finance\u201d in the market, and the Firm\u2019s broader efforts to\nadvance community development, the Board recommends voting against this proposal.\n                                       \n  The Board of Directors recommends a  \n  voteAGAINSTthis proposal.            \n                                       \n                              \n  90    2025 Proxy Statement  \n                              \nTable of Contents\n\nInformation about the annual meeting of shareholders\n\nGeneral\n\nWhy am I receiving these materials?\n\nYou are invited to attend JPMorganChase\u2019s Annual Meeting of Shareholders and vote on the proposals described\nin this proxy statement because you were a JPMorganChase shareholder on March 21, 2025 (the \u201cRecord Date\u201d).\nJPMorganChase is soliciting proxies for use at the annual meeting, including any postponements or\nadjournments.\n\nEven if you plan on attending the annual meeting through our virtual meeting site, we encourage you to vote\nyour shares in advance using one of the methods described in this proxy statement to ensure that your vote\nwill be represented at the annual meeting.\n\nWhen and where is our annual meeting?\n\nWe will hold our annual meeting on Tuesday, May 20, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.\n\nThe annual meeting will be held in a virtual meeting format only.

If you do not vote at the annual meeting, the persons named as proxies on the\nproxy card will vote your shares as you have instructed.\n\nHow will my shares be voted if I do not give specific voting instructions?\n\nShareholder of Record: If you are a shareholder of record and do not return a proxy card, or if you sign,\ndate and return a proxy card but do not give specific voting instructions, then the persons named as proxies\non the proxy card will vote your shares in the manner recommended by our Board on all matters presented in\nthis proxy statement. In addition, the proxies may determine in their discretion how to vote your shares\nregarding any other matters properly presented for a vote at our annual meeting.\n\nAlthough our Board does not anticipate that any of the director nominees will be unable to stand for\nelection as a director nominee at our annual meeting, if this occurs, the persons named as proxies on the\nproxy card will vote your shares in favor of such other person or persons as may be recommended by our\nGovernance Committee and designated by the Board.\n\nBeneficial Owner of Shares Held in Street Name: If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name\nand the organization holding your shares does not receive specific voting instructions from you, how your\nshares may be voted will depend on whether the proposal is considered \u201croutine\u201d or \u201cnon-routine,\u201d as\ndescribed below.\n\nParticipants in the 401(k) Savings Plan: The trustee of the JPMorganChase 401(k) Savings Plan (\u201cPlan\u201d) will\nvote the shares held in the Common Stock Fund as of the Record Date. If you have an interest in the\nJPMorganChase Common Stock Fund through the Plan, your vote will provide voting instructions to the trustee.\nIf no voting instructions are given, the trustee will vote uninstructed shares in the same proportion as\nvoted shares.\n\nWhich proposals are considered \u201croutine\u201d or \u201cnon-routine\u201d?\n\nThe ratification of the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm is considered to be\na \u201croutine\u201d matter under NYSE rules. A bank, brokerage firm, broker-dealer or other similar organization may\ngenerally vote in their discretion on routine matters, if specific voting instructions are not received from\na beneficial owner.\n                              \n  2025 Proxy Statement    93  \n                              \nTable of Contents\n                                           \n  Information about the annual meeting of  \n  shareholders                             \n                                           \nAll other proposals are considered \u201cnon-routine\u201d under NYSE rules and are therefore \u201cnon-discretionary\u201d\nmatters. This means your bank, brokerage firm, broker-dealer or other similar organization may not vote your\nshares without instructions from you. If the organization that holds your shares does not receive\ninstructions from you on how to vote on one of these non-routine matters, it will so inform the inspector of\nelection. This is generally referred to as a \u201cbroker non-vote.\u201d\n\nWhat is the difference between holding shares as a shareholder of record and as a beneficial owner of shares\nheld in street name?\n\nShareholder of Record: If your shares of JPMorganChase common stock are registered directly in your name\nwith our transfer agent, Computershare, you are considered a \u201cshareholder of record\u201d of those shares.\n\nBeneficial Owner of Shares Held in Street Name: If your shares are held in an account at a bank, brokerage\nfirm, broker-dealer or other similar organization, you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name.\nIn that case, you will have received these proxy materials, as well as a voting instruction form, from the\norganization holding your shares and, as a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct the organization\nas to how to vote them. Most individual shareholders are beneficial owners of shares held in street name.\n\nWhat is the voting requirement to approve each of the proposals?\n\nQuorum Requirement: Before any business can be transacted at our annual meeting, a quorum must be present.\nHolders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the annual meeting, present at the meeting or\nrepresented by proxy, will constitute a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes are treated as present for\nquorum purposes.\n\nRequirements for each proposal: What is the voting requirement for each proposal?\n                                                                                                            \n  Proposal              Voting options       Vote requirement      Effect of           Effect of broker     \n                                                                   abstentions1        non-votes2           \n  Corporate                                                                                                 \n  governance:                                                                                               \n                        FOR, AGAINST or      Majority of the       No effect \u2014 not                          \n  \u2013 Election of         ABSTAIN (for each    votes cast FOR or     counted as a        No effect \u2014 not      \n  directors3            director nominee)    AGAINST (for each     votecast            entitled to\u00a0vote     \n                                             director\u00a0nominee)                                              \n  Executive                                                                                                 \n  compensation:                                                                                             \n                                             Majority of the                                                \n                                             shares present or                                              \n  \u2013 Advisory vote on    FOR, AGAINST or      represented by\u00a0       Counts as a vote    No effect \u2014 not      \n  compensation4         ABSTAIN              proxy and entitled    AGAINST             entitled to\u00a0vote     \n                                             to vote on the                                                 \n                                             proposal                                                       \n  Audit matters:                                                                                            \n                                             Majority of the                           N/A \u2014 the            \n                                             shares present or                         organization that    \n  Ratification of       FOR, AGAINST or      represented by\u00a0       Counts as a vote    holds shares of      \n  independentauditor    ABSTAIN              proxy and entitled    AGAINST             beneficial owners    \n                                             to vote on the                            may vote in their\u00a0   \n                                             proposal                                  discretion           \n  Shareholder                                                                                               \n  proposals:                                                                                                \n                                             Majority of the                                                \n  Voting                                     shares present or                                              \n  requirements for      FOR, AGAINST or      represented by\u00a0       Counts as a vote    No effect \u2014 not      \n  each proposal         ABSTAIN              proxy and entitled    AGAINST             entitled to\u00a0vote     \n  are the same                               to vote on the                                                 \n                                             proposal                                                       \n                                                                                                            \n1 For election of directors, abstentions have no effect because the required vote is determined as follows:\nvotes FOR divided by the sum of votes FOR plus votes AGAINST. For all other proposals (management and\nshareholder), abstentions are counted as a vote AGAINST the proposal because the required vote is determined\nas follows: votes FOR divided by the sum of votes FOR plus votes AGAINST plus votes ABSTAINING.\n\n2 For all proposals (management and shareholder) other than ratification of the independent auditor, broker\nnon-votes have no effect because they are not considered shares entitled to vote on the proposal.\n\n3 If, in a non-contested election of directors, an incumbent nominee for director is not re-elected by a\nmajority of votes cast, such nominee must tender their resignation, and the Board of Directors, through a\nprocess managed by the Governance Committee, will decide whether to accept the resignation at its next\nregular meeting. Unless the Board decides to reject the offer or to postpone the effective date, the\nresignation shall become effective 45 days after the date of the election.\n\n4 The result of the advisory vote on compensation is not binding on the Board, whether or not the resolution\nis passed under the standard described above.\n                              \n  94    2025 Proxy Statement  \n                              \nTable of Contents\n                                           \n  Information about the annual meeting of  \n  shareholders                             \n                                           \nIs my vote confidential?\n\nProxy instructions, ballots and voting tabulations that identify individual shareholders are handled in a\nmanner that protects your voting privacy. JPMorganChase will not disclose the proxy instructions or ballots\nof individual shareholders except to those recording the vote, or as may be required in accordance with\nappropriate legal process, or as authorized by the shareholder.\n\nCould other matters be decided at the 2025 annual meeting?\n\nWe do not know of any matters that will be considered at the annual meeting other than those described\nabove. If a shareholder proposal that was properly excluded from this proxy statement or is otherwise not\nproperly presented at the meeting is nevertheless brought before the meeting, the Chair will declare such a\nproposal out of order, and it will be disregarded. If any other matters arise at the annual meeting that are\nproperly presented at the meeting, the proxies will be voted at the discretion of the proxy holders.\n\nWhat happens if the meeting is postponed or adjourned?\n\nYour proxy will still be good and may be voted at the postponed or adjourned meeting. You will still be able\nto change or revoke your proxy until it is voted.\n\nWho counts the votes cast at our annual meeting?\n\nRepresentatives of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. will tabulate the votes cast at our annual meeting,\nand American Election Services, LLC will act as the independent inspector of election.\n                                                                                                            \n   Where can I find the voting results of our annual meeting?                                               \n                                                                                                            \nWe expect to announce the preliminary voting results at our annual meeting. The final voting results will be\nreported on a Current Report on Form 8-K that will be filed with the SEC and be available on our website.\n\nWho is paying the costs of this proxy solicitation?\n\nJPMorganChase is paying the costs of the solicitation of proxies. JPMorganChase has retained MacKenzie\nPartners, Inc. to assist in the distribution of proxy materials and the solicitation of proxies from\nbrokerage firms, banks, broker-dealers and other similar organizations representing beneficial owners of\nshares. We have agreed to pay MacKenzie Partners a fee of approximately $55,000 plus reimbursement of\ncertain out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nJPMorganChase must also pay brokerage firms, banks, broker-dealers and other similar organizations\nrepresenting beneficial owners certain fees associated with:\n\n\u2022 Forwarding the Notice of Internet Availability to beneficial owners;\n\n\u2022 Forwarding printed proxy materials by mail to beneficial owners who specifically request them; and\n\n\u2022 Obtaining beneficial owners\u2019 voting instructions.\n\nIn addition to solicitations by mail, the persons who will be serving as the proxies and JPMorganChase\u2019s\ndirectors, officers and employees may solicit, without additional compensation, proxies on JPMorganChase\u2019s\nbehalf in person, by phone or by electronic communication.\n\nHow do I inspect the list of shareholders of record?\n\nA list of shareholders of record as of March 21, 2025 will be available for inspection during ordinary\nbusiness hours at our offices at 383 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10179, from May 9, 2025, to May 19, 2025.\nPlease contact the Office of the Secretary by sending an email to corporate.secretary@jpmchase.com if you\nwish to inspect the list prior to the annual meeting.\n                              \n  2025 Proxy Statement    95  \n                              \nTable of Contents\n                                           \n  Information about the annual meeting of  \n  shareholders                             \n                                           \nInformation about paper and electronic delivery of proxy materials\n\nJPMorganChase uses the SEC rule commonly known as \u201cNotice and Access\u201d that permits companies to furnish\nproxy materials to our shareholders over the Internet. This process enables us to expedite delivery of\nmaterials to our shareholders and reduces the costs to us of printing and mailing paper proxy materials.\n\nIn accordance with the Notice and Access rules, on or about April 7, 2025, we sent those current\nshareholders of record on March 21, 2025, the Record Date for the annual meeting, a Notice. The Notice\ncontains instructions on how to access our proxy statement and annual report online. If you received a\nNotice, you will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials in the mail.\n\nIf you received a Notice, and would like to receive copies of our proxy materials in print by mail, or\nelectronically by email, please follow the instructions in the Notice.\n\nShareholders who do not receive the Notice will receive copies of our proxy statement and 2024 Annual Report\nto Shareholders either by mail or email. The copies will be sent on or about April 7, 2025.\n\nHow can I obtain an additional proxy card?\n\nShareholders of record can contact the Office of the Secretary by sending an email to\ncorporate.secretary@jpmchase.com or calling (212) 270-6000.\n\nIf you hold your shares of common stock in street name, contact your account representative at the bank,\nbrokerage firm, broker-dealer or similar organization through which you hold your shares.\n\nHow do I sign up for electronic delivery of proxy materials?\n\nThis proxy statement and our 2024 Annual Report to Shareholders are available on our website at:\njpmorganchase.com. If you would like to help reduce the environmental impact of our annual meetings and our\ncosts of printing and mailing future materials, you can agree to access these documents in the future over\nthe Internet rather than receiving printed copies in the mail. For your convenience, you may find links to\nsign up for electronic delivery for both shareholders of record and beneficial owners who hold shares in\nstreet name at https://enroll.icsdelivery.com/jpm.\n\nOnce you sign up, you will continue to receive proxy materials electronically until you revoke this\npreference.\n\nI share an address with another shareholder, and we received only one paper copy of the proxy materials. How\ncan I obtain an additional copy of the proxy materials?\n\nJPMorganChase has adopted a procedure called \u201chouseholding.\u201d Under this procedure, JPMorganChase may deliver\na single copy of the proxy statement and annual report to multiple shareholders who share the same address,\nunless we have received contrary instructions from one or more of the shareholders. Each shareholder\ncontinues to receive a separate proxy card. This procedure reduces the environmental impact of our annual\nmeetings and our printing and mailing costs.\n\nIf your household received a single set of proxy materials, but you prefer to receive a separate copy of the\nproxy statement and 2024 Annual Report, you may contact the Office of the Secretary via email at\ncorporate.secretary@jpmchase.com, via mail at the Office of the Secretary, JPMorgan Chase & Co., 383 Madison\nAvenue, 39th Floor, New York, New York 10179, or by phone at 212-270-6000 and these documents will be\ndelivered to you promptly upon receiving the request.\n\nAlternatively, if you are receiving more than one copy of the proxy materials at a single address and would\nlike to participate in householding, please contact Broadridge Financial Services at 1-866-540-7095. If you\nare a beneficial owner who holds shares in street name, contact your bank, brokerage firm, broker-dealer or\nsimilar organization to request information about householding.\n\nYou may change your householding preferences at any time, by contacting Broadridge Financial Services at\n1-866-540-7095 or by sending a written request to Broadridge Financial Services, Inc., Householding\nDepartment, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717, or by contacting the bank, brokerage firm, broker-dealer or\nsimilar organization through which you hold your shares.\n                              \n  96    2025 Proxy Statement  \n                              \nTable of Contents\n                                           \n  Information about the annual meeting of  \n  shareholders                             \n                                           \nOther\n\nHow do I obtain more information about JPMorganChase?\n\nThe Governance Principles, Code of Conduct, Code of Ethics for Finance Professionals, Business Principles,\nthe Political Engagement and Public Policy Statement, ESG and climate reporting, and the By-laws and\ncharters of our principal standing committees are posted on our website at jpmorganchase.com.

TCE, ROTCE, TBVPS and Pre-tax income ex. LLR are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the\nFirm\u2019s common stockholders\u2019 equity (i.e., total stockholders\u2019 equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and\nidentifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax\nliabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm\u2019s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average\nTCE. TBVPS represents the Firm\u2019s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Pre-tax income\nex. LLR represents income on a managed basis before income tax expense (pre-tax income) excluding the change\nin loan loss reserves. This reflects the exclusion of the portion of the provision for credit losses\nattributable to the change in allowance for credit losses. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as\nwell as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm\u2019s use of equity. Pre-tax income ex. LLR is utilized by\nthe Firm to assess the Firm\u2019s operating performance and management believes this information helps investors\nunderstand the effect on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm\u2019s performance.\nThe following tables provide reconciliations and calculations of these measures for the periods presented.\n\n2. In addition to analyzing the Firm\u2019s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results on a\n\u201cmanaged\u201d basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews\nthe results of the lines of business on a \u201cmanaged\u201d basis. The Firm\u2019s definition of managed basis starts, in\neach case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net\nrevenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent basis.\nAccordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the\nmanaged results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow\nmanagement to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt\nsources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax\nexpense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines\nof business.\n\nNon-GAAP reconciliations\n
