Firmwide overview For the first quarter of 2024, JPMorgan Chase reported net\nincome of $13.4 billion, up 6%, earnings per share of $4.44, ROE of 17% and ROTCE of 21%. The Firm's results\nincluded a $725 million increase to the FDIC special assessment in Corporate. \u2022 Total net revenue was $41.9\nbillion, up 9%, reflecting: \u2013 Net interest income (\"NII\") of $23.1 billion, up 11%, driven by the\nacquisition of First Republic, the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates, as well as higher revolving\nbalances in Card Services, partially offset by deposit margin compression, and lower average deposit\nbalances in CCB. NII excluding Markets was $23.0 billion, up 10%. \u2013 Noninterest revenue (\"NIR\") was $18.9\nbillion, up 7%, driven by higher asset management fees, lower net investment securities losses in Treasury\nand CIO, the impact of First Republic and higher investment banking fees, partially offset by lower Markets\nnoninterest revenue. \u2022 Noninterest expense was $22.8 billion, up 13%, driven by higher compensation expense,\nincluding an increase in employees, the impact of First Republic and the $725 million increase to the FDIC\nspecial assessment in Corporate. \u2022 The provision for credit losses was $1.9 billion, reflecting $2.0 billion\nof net charge-offs. Net charge-offs increased $819 million, predominantly driven by CCB, primarily Card\nServices. The prior year included net charge-offs of $1.1 billion and a $1.1 billion net addition to the\nallowance for credit losses. \u2022 The total allowance for credit losses was $24.7 billion at March 31, 2024.\nThe Firm had an allowance for loan losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 1.77%, compared with 1.85% in\nthe prior year. \u2022 The Firm\u2019s nonperforming assets totaled $8.3 billion at March 31, 2024, up 11%, driven by\nwholesale nonaccrual loans, which reflects downgrades in Real Estate, concentrated in Office, and the impact\nof First Republic. Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio and Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 58-66 and\npages 54-57, respectively, for additional information. \u2022 Firmwide average loans of $1.3 trillion were up\n16%, predominantly driven by higher loans in CCB and CB, primarily as a result of First Republic.\n                                                     5                                                      \n\u2022 Firmwide average deposits of $2.4 trillion were\nup 2%, driven by:\n\n\u2013 growth in CIB due to net issuances of structured\nnotes as a result of client demand, and net inflows\nin Payments and Securities Services,\n\n\u2013 the impact of First Republic, and\n\n\u2013 an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's\ninternational consumer initiatives,\n\nlargely offset by\n\n\u2013 a decline in CCB and AWM as clients seek higher-\nyielding investments; in CCB, the decline in\ndeposits was also driven by increased customer\nspending; and in CB, the decline was due to\ncontinued deposit attrition.\n\nRefer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 44-51\nfor additional information.\n                                                                                                            \n  Selected capital and other metrics                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n\u2022 CET1 capital was $258 billion, and the\nStandardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 15.0%\nand 15.3%, respectively.\n\n\u2022 SLR was 6.1%.\n\n\u2022 TBVPS grew 15%, ending the first quarter of 2024\nat $88.43.\n\n\u2022 As of March 31, 2024, the Firm had eligible end-\nof-period High Quality Liquid Assets (\u201cHQLA\u201d) of\napproximately $823 billion and unencumbered\nmarketable securities with a fair value of\napproximately $673 billion, resulting in\napproximately $1.5 trillion of liquidity sources.\nRefer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 44-51\nfor additional information.\n\nRefer to Consolidated Results of Operations and\nConsolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 10-12\nand pages 13-14, respectively, for a further\ndiscussion of the Firm's results, including the\nprovision for credit losses ; and Business Segment\nResults on page 20; and Note 5 and 26 for\nadditional information on the FDIC special\nassessment and the First Republic acquisition,\nrespectively.\n\nPre-provision profit, ROTCE, TCE, TBVPS, NII and\nNIR excluding Markets, and total net revenue on a\nmanaged basis are non-GAAP financial measures.\nRefer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the\nFirm\u2019s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages\n16-17 for a further discussion of each of these\nmeasures.\n                                                     6                                                      \nBusiness segment highlights Selected business\nmetrics for each of the Firm\u2019s four lines of\nbusiness (\"LOB\") are presented below for the first\nquarter of 2024, and include the impact of First\nRepublic, unless otherwise specified.\n                                                                                                            \n             \u2022Average deposits down 3%, or down 7% excluding First Republic; client investment assets up    \n             46%, or up 25% excluding First Republic                                                        \n  CCB        \u2022Average loans up 27%, or up 6% excluding First Republic; Card Services net charge-off rate    \n  ROE 35%    of 3.32%                                                                                       \n             \u2022Debit and credit card sales volume(a)up 9%                                                    \n             \u2022Active mobile customers(b)up 7%                                                               \n  CIB        \u2022#1 ranking for Global Investment Banking fees with 9.1% wallet share in 1Q24                  \n  ROE 18%    \u2022Markets revenue down 5%, with Fixed Income Markets down 7% and Equity Markets flat            \n  CB         \u2022Gross Investment Banking and Markets(c)revenue of $913 million, up 4%                         \n  ROE 24%    \u2022Average loans up 17%, or up 1% excluding First Republic; average deposits flat, or down 3%    \n             excluding First Republic                                                                       \n  AWM        \u2022Assets under management (\"AUM\") of $3.6 trillion, up 19%                                      \n  ROE 33%    \u2022Average loans up 6%, or up 1% excluding First Republic; average deposits up 2%, or down 4%    \n             excluding First Republic                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \n(a) Excludes Commercial Card.

Quarterly results\nInvestment banking fees in creased, reflecting in CIB: \u2022 higher underwriting fees that benefited from\nimproved market conditions, and consisted of \u2013 an increase in debt underwriting fees predominantly driven by\nhigher industry-wide issuance in leveraged loans and high-yield bonds, as well as higher issuance in high\ngrade bonds reflecting wallet share gains, and \u2013 an increase in equity underwriting fees driven by IPO and\nconvertible securities offerings, reflecting wallet share gains , partially offset by \u2022 lower advisory fees\ndriven by a lower number of large completed transactions. Refer to CIB segment results on pages 24-28 and\nNote 5 for additional information. Principal transactions revenue decreased, reflecting in CIB the net\nimpact of: \u2022 lower Fixed Income Markets revenue in Rates and Commodities, partially offset by higher revenue\nin Securitized Products, \u2022 higher Equity Markets revenue in Equity Derivatives and Prime Finance, and \u2022\nlower losses of $15 million in Credit Adjustments & Other compared with losses of $153 million in the prior\nyear.\n\nPrincipal transactions revenue in CIB generally has offsets across other revenue lines, including net\ninterest income. The Firm assesses the performance of its Markets business on a total net revenue basis.\nRefer to CIB results on pages 24-28 and Note 5 for additional information. Lending- and deposit-related fees\nincr eased, reflecting: \u2022 higher lending-related revenue predominantly driven by the amortization of the\npurchase discount on certain acquired lending-related commitments associated with First Republic,\npredominantly in AWM and CB, and \u2022 higher other len ding- and deposit-related fees in CIB and CB. Refer to\nCIB, CB and AWM segment results on pages 24-28, pages 29-31 and pages 32-34, respectively, and Note 5 for\nadditional information. Asset management fees increased driven by strong net inflows and higher average\nmarket levels in AWM and CCB, as well as the impact of First Republic in CCB. Refer to CCB and AWM segment\nresults on pages 21-23 and pages 32-34, respectively, and Note 5 for additional information. Commissions and\nother fees increased predominantly due to higher commissions from annuity sales in CCB and higher custody\nfees associated with a higher level of assets under custody in CIB. Refer to CCB and CIB Segment results on\npages 21-23 and pages 24-28, respectively, and Note 5 for additional information.

The prior year included net valuation gains in AWM, including $339 million on the\noriginal minority interest in China International Fund Management (\u201cCIFM\u201d). Refer to AWM segment results on\npages 32-34 for additional information on CIFM; Notes 1, 5 and 13 for additional information on the adoption\nof updates to the Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures guidance. Net interest income\nincreased, driven by the acquisition of First Republic, the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates, as\nwell as higher revolving balances in Card Services, partially offset by deposit margin compression\nreflecting higher rates paid across the LOBs, and lower average deposit balances in CCB. The Firm\u2019s average\ninterest-earning assets were $3.4 trillion, up $229 billion, and the yield was 5.55%, up 87 basis points\n(\u201cbps\u201d).

Refer to\nNote 10 for additional information on securities\npurchased under resale agreements and securities\nborrowed.\n\nTrading assets increased due to:\n\n\u2022 higher levels of equity and debt

impact of\nseasonality,\n\n\u2022 a decline in Home Lending as sales outpaced\noriginations, and\n\n\u2022 lower wholesale loans in AWM due to paydowns.\n\nThe allowance for loan losses was relatively flat ,\nreflecting:\n\n\u2022 a net reduction of $92 million in wholesale ,\nwhich included a net addition to the allowance\nassociated with net downgrade activity, largely in\nReal Estate, primarily in CB, which was more than\noffset by the impact of changes in the loan\nportfolios as well as updates to certain\nmacroeconomic variables, and\n\n\u2022 a net addition of $23 million in consumer ,\nconsisting of $153 million in Card Services,\npredominantly offset by a $146 million net\nreduction in Home Lending.\n\nThere was also a $58 million net reduction in the\nallowance for lending-related commitments\nrecognized in other liabilities on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets.\n\nRefer to Consolidated Results of Operations and\nCredit and Investment Risk Management on

There are four\nmajor reportable business segments \u2013 Consumer &\nCommunity Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank,\nCommercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management.\nIn addition, there is a Corporate segment.\n\nThe business segments are determined based on the\nproducts and services provided, or the type of\ncustomer served, and they reflect the manner in\nwhich financial information is currently evaluated\nby the Firm\u2019s Operating Committee. Segment results\nare presented on a managed basis.\n\nAs a result of the organizational changes announced\non January 25, 2024, the Firm will be reorganizing\nits business segments to reflect the manner in\nwhich the segments will be managed. The\nreorganization of the business segments will be\neffective in the second quarter of 2024. Refer to\nRecent events on page 52 of JPMorgan Chase's 2023\nForm 10-K for additional information.\n\nRefer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the\nFirm\u2019s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages\n16-17 for a definition of managed basis.\n\nDescription of business segment reporting\nmethodology\n\nResults of the business segments are intended to\npresent each segment as if it were a stand-alone\nbusiness. The management reporting process that\nderives business segment results includes the\nallocation of certain income and expense items. The\nFirm periodically assesses the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications used\nfor segment reporting, and therefore further\nrefinements may be implemented in future periods.\nThe Firm also assesses the level of capital\nrequired for each LOB on at least an annual basis.\nThe Firm\u2019s LOBs also provide various business\nmetrics which are utilized by the Firm and its\ninvestors and analysts in assessing performance.\n\nRevenue sharing\n\nWhen business segments or businesses within each\nsegment join efforts to sell products and services\nto the Firm\u2019s clients and customers, the\nparticipating businesses may agree to share revenue\nfrom those transactions. Revenue is generally\nrecognized in the segment responsible for the\nrelated product or service, with allocations to the\nother segments/businesses involved in the\ntransaction. The segment and business results\nreflect these revenue-sharing agreements.\n\nFunds transfer pricing\n\nFunds transfer pricing (\u201cFTP\u201d) is the process by\nwhich the Firm allocates interest income and\nexpense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and\ntransfers the primary interest rate risk and\nliquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.\n\nThe funds transfer pricing process considers the\ninterest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of\nassets and liabilities and off-balance sheet\nproducts. Periodically the methodology and\nassumptions utilized in the FTP process are\nadjusted to reflect economic conditions and other\nfactors, which may impact the allocation of net\ninterest income to the segments.\n\nForeign exchange risk\n\nForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs\nand Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain\nrevenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages\nthese risks centrally and reports the impact of\nforeign exchange rate movements related to the\ntransferred risk in its results. Refer to Market\nRisk Management on pages 71-76 for additional\ninformation.\n\nCapital allocation\n\nThe amount of capital assigned to each business\nsegment is referred to as equity. At least\nannually, the assumptions, judgments and\nmethodologies used to allocate capital are\nreassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated\nto the LOBs may change. Refer to Line of business\nequity on page 41, and page 98 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n2023 Form 10-K for additional information on\ncapital allocation.\n\nRefer to Business Segment Results \u2013 Description of\nbusiness segment reporting methodology on pages\n65\u201385 and Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form\n10-K for a further discussion of those\nmethodologies.\n

(b) Included\ndepreciation expense on leased assets of $427 million and $407 million for the three months ended March 31,\n2024 and 2023, respectively. (c) Included MSR risk management results of $(1) million and $(12) million for\nthe three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. (d) Includes First Republic. Refer to page 20\nfor additional information. (e) Banking & Wealth Management and Home Lending included revenue associated\nwith First Republic of $639 million and $392 million, respectively, for the three months ended March 31,\n2024.\n\nQuarterly results Net income was $4.8 billion, down 8%. Net revenue was $17.7 billion, up 7%. Net interest\nincome was $13.7 billion, up 7%, driven by: \u2022 higher Card Services NII, reflecting an increase in revolving\nbalances, and \u2022 the impact of First Republic in Home Lending, partially offset by \u2022 deposit margin\ncompression, reflecting higher rates paid and lower average deposits in Banking & Wealth Management (\"BWM\").\nNoninterest revenue was $3.9 billion, up 9%, driven by: \u2022 higher asset management fees reflecting higher\naverage market levels, strong net inflows and the impact of First Republic, as well as other service fees\nassociated with First Republic, and higher commissions from annuity sales in BWM, and \u2022 higher production\nrevenue in Home Lending, which included the impact of First Republic, partially offset by \u2022 lower auto\noperating lease income, and \u2022 lower card income driven by an increase in new account origination costs,\nlargely offset by higher annual fees, reflecting continued growth in the portfolio. Net interchange income\nwas relatively flat as the impact of increased debit and credit card sales volume was offset by higher\nreward costs and partner payments. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on card income, asset\nmanagement fees, and commissions and other fees; and Critical Accounting Estimates on pages 78-80 for credit\ncard rewards liability. Noninterest expense was $9.3 billion, up 15%, reflecting: \u2022 higher compensation\nexpense, predominantly driven by an increase in employees, including the impact of First Republic and in\ntechnology, as well as higher revenue-related compensation, primarily for bankers and advisors, and \u2022 higher\nnoncompensation expense, largely driven by the impact of First Republic and investments in marketing and\ntechnology. Refer to Business Segment Results on page 20 and Note 26 for additional information on the First\nRepublic acquisition.

Noninterest revenue was $925 million, up\n18%, driven by: \u2022 higher lending-related revenue as\na result of the amortization of the purchase\ndiscount on certain acquired lending-related\ncommitments associated with First Republic, \u2022\nhigher deposit-related fees, partially offset by\nthe higher level of client credits that reduce such\nfees, and \u2022 higher card income and investment\nbanking revenue.

The prior year included an investment valuation loss. Noninterest expense was $3.5\nbillion, up 12%, largely driven by: \u2022 higher compensation including: \u2013 revenue-related compensation,\ncontinued growth in private banking advisor teams, and \u2013 the impact of First Republic, and the acquisition\nof J.P.

When the Firm extends a\nconsumer or wholesale loan, advises customers and\nclients on their investment decisions, makes\nmarkets in securities, or offers other products or\nservices, the Firm takes on some degree of risk.\nThe Firm\u2019s overall objective is to manage its\nbusiness, and the associated risks, in a manner\nthat balances serving the interests of its clients,\ncustomers and investors, and protecting the safety\nand soundness of the Firm. The Firm believes that\neffective risk management requires, among other\nthings: \u2022 Acceptance of responsibility, including\nidentification and escalation of risks by all\nindividuals within the Firm; \u2022 Ownership of risk\nidentification, assessment, data and management\nwithin each of the LOBs and Corporate; and \u2022 A\nFirmwide risk governance and oversight structure.\nThe Firm follows a disciplined and balanced\ncompensation framework with strong internal\ngovernance and independent oversight by the Board\nof Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d). The impact of risk and\ncontrol issues is carefully considered in the\nFirm\u2019s performance evaluation and incentive\ncompensation processes. Risk governance framework\nThe Firm\u2019s risk governance framework involves\nunderstanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and\nimpacts of risks.

Under the\nrules currently in effect, two comprehensive\napproaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a\nstandardized approach (\u201cBasel III Standardized\u201d),\nand an advanced approach (\u201cBasel III Advanced\u201d).\n\nFor each of these risk-based capital ratios, the\ncapital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against\nthe lower of the Standardized or Advanced\napproaches compared to their respective regulatory\ncapital ratio requirements.\n\nIn July 2023, the Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System (the \"Federal Reserve\"), the Office\nof the Comptroller of the Currency (\"OCC\"), and the\nFDIC released a proposal to amend the risk-based\ncapital framework, entitled \"Regulatory capital\nrule: Amendments applicable to large banking\norganizations and to banking organizations with\nsignificant trading activity\", which is referred to\nin this Form 10-Q as the \"U.S. Basel III proposal\".\nUnder the proposal, changes to the framework would\ninclude replacement of the Advanced approach with\nan expanded risk-based approach, which would not\npermit the use of internal models for the\ncalculation of RWA, other than for market risk. In\naddition, the stress capital buffer requirement\nwould be applicable to both the expanded risk-based\napproach and the Standardized approach. The\nproposal would significantly revise risk-based\ncapital requirements for all banks with assets of\n$100 billion or more, including the Firm and other\nU.S. global systemically important banks (\"GSIBs\").\nThe proposed effective date is July 1, 2025, with a\nthree-year transition period applicable to the\nexpanded risk-based approach.\n\nUnder the requirements of the U.S. Basel III\nproposal, the new expanded risk-based approach,\nwhen fully phased-in, would be the Firm's binding\nconstraint. The Firm is managing its CET1 capital\nin anticipation of the finalization of the U.S.\nBasel III proposal.\n\nRefer to page 92 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K\nfor additional information on the U.S. Basel III\nproposal.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, the Advanced Total Capital\nratio is the most binding constraint of the Firm's\nBasel III risk-based ratios. However, as of March\n31, 2024, with respect to the CET1 and Tier 1 risk-\nbased ratios, the Standardized ratios are more\nbinding than the Advanced ratios.\n\nBasel III also includes a requirement for Advanced\nApproaches banking organizations, including the\nFirm, to calculate its SLR.\n\nRefer to page 41 of this Form 10-Q and page 98 of\nJPMorgan Chase's 2023 Form 10-K for additional\ninformation on SLR.\n\nRefer to page 93 of JPMorgan Chase's 2023 Form 10-K\nfor information on Other Key Regulatory\nDevelopments.\n                                                     38                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Selected capital and RWA data                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \nThe following tables present the Firm\u2019s risk-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and\nAdvanced approaches and leverage-based capital metrics.

Refer to Note 26 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition. Each\nof the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR may fluctuate from period to period due to changes\nin their respective eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity\nand from the impacts of Federal Reserve actions as well as other factors.

Internal stress testing The Firm conducts internal liquidity stress testing that is intended\nto ensure that the Firm and its material legal entities have sufficient liquidity under a variety of adverse\nscenarios, including scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm\u2019s resolution and recovery planning. Internal\nstress tests are produced on a regular basis, and other stress tests are performed in response to specific\nmarket events or concerns. Results of stress tests are considered in the formulation of the Firm\u2019s funding\nplan and assessment of its liquidity position. The Firm maintains liquidity at the Parent Company, the\nIntermediate Holding Company (\u201cIHC\u201d), and operating subsidiaries at levels sufficient to comply with\nliquidity risk tolerances and minimum liquidity requirements, and to manage through periods of stress when\naccess to normal funding sources may be disrupted.\n                                                     44                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n   Liquidity sources                                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \nIn addition to the assets reported in the Firm\u2019s\neligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had\nunencumbered marketable securities, such as equity\nand debt securities, that the Firm believes would\nbe available to raise liquidity. This includes\nexcess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank\naffiliates. The fair value of these securities was\napproximately $673 billion and $649 billion as of\nMarch 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively,\nalthough the amount of liquidity that could be\nraised at any particular time would be dependent on\nprevailing market conditions. The increase compared\nto December 31, 2023, was driven by an increase in\nCIB trading assets, largely offset by a decrease in\nexcess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the\nFirm had approximately $1.5 trillion and $1.4\ntrillion of available cash and securities,\nrespectively, comprised of eligible end-of-period\nHQLA, excluding the impact of regulatory haircuts\nof approximately $823 billion and $798 billion,\nrespectively, and unencumbered marketable\nsecurities with a fair value of approximately $673\nbillion and $649 billion, respectively.\n\nThe Firm also had available borrowing capacity at\nthe FHLB and the discount window at the Federal\nReserve Banks as a result of collateral pledged by\nthe Firm to such banks of approximately $352\nbillion and $340 billion as of March 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively. This borrowing\ncapacity excludes the benefit of cash and\nsecurities reported in the Firm\u2019s eligible HQLA or\nother unencumbered securities that are currently\npledged at the Federal Reserve Banks discount\nwindow and other central banks. Available borrowing\ncapacity increased from December 31, 2023 primarily\ndue to a higher amount of wholesale loans pledged\nat the Federal Reserve Banks. Although available,\nthe Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at\nthe Federal Reserve Banks discount window and the\nother central banks as a primary source of\nliquidity.\n                                                                                                            \n  NSFR                                                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nThe net stable funding ratio (\u201cNSFR\u201d) is a\nliquidity requirement for large banking\norganizations that is intended to measure the\nadequacy of \u201cavailable\u201d stable funding that is\nsufficient to meet their \u201crequired\u201d amounts of\nstable funding over a one-year horizon.\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, both the\nFirm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were compliant\nwith the 100% minimum NSFR requirement, based on\nthe Firm's interpretation of the final rule.

A significant\nportion of the Firm\u2019s deposits are consumer\ndeposits and wholesale operating deposits, which\nare both considered to be stable sources of\nliquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are\ngenerally considered to be stable sources of\nliquidity because they are generated from customers\nthat maintain operating service relationships with\nthe Firm.\n\nThe Firm believes that average deposit balances are\ngenerally more representative of deposit trends\nthan period-end deposit balances. However, during\nperiods of market disruption, average deposit\ntrends may be impacted.\n\nAverage deposits were higher for the three months\nended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months\nended March 31, 2023, reflecting the net impact of:\n\n\u2022 growth in CIB due to net issuances of structured\nnotes as a result of client demand, and net inflows\nrelated to client-driven activities in Payments and\nSecurities Services, partially offset by deposit\nattrition, including actions taken to reduce\ncertain deposits,\n\n\u2022 an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's\ninternational consumer initiatives,\n\n\u2022 growth in AWM from new and existing customers as\na result of new product offerings and the impact of\nFirst Republic, predominantly offset by continued\nmigration into higher-yielding investments driven\nby the higher interest rate environment,\n\n\u2022 a decrease in CCB reflecting a decline in\ndeposits in existing accounts due to migration into\nhigher-yielding investments and increased customer\nspending, largely offset by the impact of First\nRepublic, and\n\n\u2022 a decrease in CB due to continued deposit\nattrition, offset by the retention of inflows\nassociated with disruptions in the market in the\nfirst quarter of 2023 and the impact of First\nRepublic.\n\nPeriod-end deposits increased from December 31,\n2023, reflecting the net impact of:\n\n\u2022 higher balances in CIB, driven by net inflows\nrelated to client-driven activities in Payments and\nSecurities Services,\n\n\u2022 an increase in CCB due to new accounts and\nseasonal inflows, largely offset by a decline in\ndeposits in existing accounts due to migration into\nhigher-yielding investments,\n\n\u2022 a decrease in AWM due to continued migration into\nhigher-yielding investments, partially offset by an\nincrease in deposits in existing accounts due to a\nchange in product offerings associated with First\nRepublic, and\n                                                     46                                                     \n\u2022 a decrease in CB primarily due to seasonal\noutflows and continued deposit attrition, largely\noffset by the realignment of additional clients\nassociated with First Republic from CCB to CB that\nbegan in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Refer to Note 3 for further\ninformation on structured notes.\n\nCertain deposits are covered by insurance\nprotection that provides additional funding\nstability and results in a benefit to the LCR.\nDeposit insurance protection may be available to\ndepositors in the countries in which the deposits\nare placed.

These instruments\nare secured predominantly by high-quality\nsecurities collateral, including government-issued\ndebt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS.\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase\nincreased at March 31, 2024, compared with December\n31, 2023, driven by Markets, reflecting higher\nclient-driven market-making activities and higher\nsecured financing of trading assets, as well as\nwhen compared with seasonally lower levels at year-\nend.\n\nThe balances associated with securities loaned or\nsold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over\ntime due to investment and financing activities of\nclients, the Firm\u2019s demand for financing, the\nongoing management of the mix of the Firm\u2019s\nliabilities, including its secured and unsecured\nfinancing (for both the investment securities and\nmarket-making portfolios), and other market and\nportfolio factors.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s sources of short-term unsecured funding\nprimarily consist of issuances of wholesale\ncommercial paper and other borrowed funds.\n\nThe decrease in period-end commercial paper for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2024 from December 31,\n2023 was due to lower issuance levels primarily\nreflecting short-term liquidity management.\n                                                     49                                                     \nLong-term funding Long-term funding provides an\nadditional source of stable funding and liquidity\nfor the Firm. The Firm\u2019s long-term funding plan is\ndriven primarily by expected client activity,\nliquidity considerations and regulatory\nrequirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding\nobjectives include maintaining diversification,\nmaximizing market access and optimizing funding\ncosts. The Firm evaluates various funding markets,\ntenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-\nterm funding plan. Unsecured funding and issuance\nThe significant majority of the Firm\u2019s total\noutstanding long-term debt has been issued by the\nParent Company to provide flexibility in support of\nthe funding needs of both bank and non-bank\nsubsidiaries. The Parent Company advances\nsubstantially all net funding proceeds to its\nsubsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to\nexternal counterparties. For the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024, the increase in average structured\nnotes compared to the prior year period was\nattributable to net issuances of structured notes\nin Markets due to client demand.

Residential real estate: The residential\nreal estate portfolio, including loans held-for-\nsale and loans at fair value, predominantly\nconsists of prime mortgage loans and home equity\nlines of credit. Retained loans decreased compared\nto December 31, 2023, predominantly driven by\npaydowns and loans sales, net of originations. Net\nrecoveries were lower for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024 compared to the prior year. Loans\nheld-for-sale increased from December 31, 2023,\npredominantly driven by a transfer of certain\nretained loans in anticipation of securitization.\nAt March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the\ncarrying value of interest-only residential\nmortgage loans was $90.3 billion and $90.6 billion,\nrespectively. These loans have an interest-only\npayment period generally followed by an adjustable-\nrate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period\nto maturity and are typically originated as higher-\nbalance loans to higher-income borrowers. The\ncredit performance of this portfolio is comparable\nwith the performance of the broader prime mortgage\nportfolio. The carrying value of home equity lines\nof credit outstanding was $15.3 billion at March\n31, 2024, which included $2.4 billion associated\nwith First Republic. The carrying value of home\nequity lines of credit outstanding included $4.1\nbillion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-\nonly to fully amortizing payments or have been\nmodified and $4.1 billion of interest-only balloon\nHELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm\nmanages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving\nperiod by closing or reducing the undrawn line to\nthe extent permitted by law when borrowers are\nexhibiting a material deterioration in their credit\nrisk profile.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the\nFirm\u2019s residential mortgage portfolio insured\nand/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies,\npredominantly loans held-for-sale and loans at fair\nvalue. The Firm monitors its exposure to certain\npotential unrecoverable claim payments related to\ngovernment-insured loans and considers this\nexposure in estimating the allowance for loan\nlosses.\n                                                                                \n                                               March 31,          December 31,  \n  (in millions)                                2024               2023          \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Current                              $  389             $  446                \n  30-89 days past due                      82                102                \n  90 or more days past due                157                182                \n  Total government guaranteed loans    $  628             $  730                \n                                                                                \nGeographic composition and current estimated loan-\nto-value ratio of residential real estate loans\nRefer to Note 11 for information on the geographic\ncomposition and current estimated LTVs of the\nFirm\u2019s residential real estate loans.

The portfolio decreased when compared\nto December 31, 2023, predominantly due to a loan\nsecuritization. Net charge-offs increased for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the\nsame period in the prior year due to higher scored\nauto net charge-offs of $50 million reflecting a\ndecline in used vehicle valuations, largely offset\nby lower overdraft charge-offs.

A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm\u2019s wholesale businesses is\ngenerally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it\noriginates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations\nand credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth\nreviews of client credit quality and transaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of\nindustry, product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 60-63 for further\ninformation. The Firm\u2019s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, and\nrisk-rated exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the\nallowance for loan losses. The Firm continues to convert certain operations, and to integrate clients,\nproducts and services, associated with First Republic. Accordingly, reporting classifications and internal\nrisk rating profiles in the wholesale portfolio may change in future periods. Refer to Business Developments\non page 9 for additional information. As of March 31, 2024, retained loans decreased by $4.7 billion and\nlending-related commitments decreased by $4.3 billion.

Total criticized\nexposure, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $45.8 billion and $41.4 billion as of\nMarch 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, representing approximately 3.6% and 3.3% of total wholesale credit\nexposure, respectively; of the $45.8 billion, $42.2 billion was performing. The increase in criticized\nexposure was driven by Real Estate concentrated in Office, reflecting downgrades, and held-for-sale\ncommitments in Technology and Consumer & Retail.\n\nThe table below summarizes by industry the Firm\u2019s exposures as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

The\ncontractual amounts of these financial instruments\nrepresent the maximum possible credit risk should\nthe clients draw down on these commitments or when\nthe Firm fulfills its obligations under these\nguarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to\nperform according to the terms of these contracts.\nMost of these commitments and guarantees have\nhistorically been refinanced, extended, cancelled,\nor expired without being drawn upon or a default\noccurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe\nthat the total contractual amount of these\nwholesale lending-related commitments is\nrepresentative of the Firm\u2019s expected future credit\nexposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 22\nfor further information on wholesale lending-\nrelated commitments.\n                                                                                                            \n  Receivables from customers                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nReceivables from customers reflect held-for-\ninvestment margin loans to brokerage clients in\nCIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets\nmaintained in the clients\u2019 brokerage accounts\n(including cash on deposit, and primarily liquid\nand readily marketable debt or equity securities).\nTo manage its credit risk, the Firm establishes\nmargin requirements and monitors the required\nmargin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires\nclients to deposit additional cash or other\ncollateral, or to reduce positions, when\nappropriate. Credit risk arising from lending\nactivities subject to collateral maintenance\nrequirements is generally mitigated by factors such\nas the short-term nature of the activity, the fair\nvalue of collateral held and the Firm\u2019s right to\ncall for, and the borrower\u2019s obligation to provide,\nadditional margin when the fair value of the\ncollateral declines. Because of these mitigating\nfactors, these receivables generally do not require\nan allowance for credit losses. However, if in\nmanagement\u2019s judgment, an allowance for credit\nlosses is required, the Firm estimates expected\ncredit losses based on the value of the collateral\nand probability of borrower default. These\nreceivables are reported within accrued interest\nand accounts receivable on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated\nbalance sheets.\n\nRefer to Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2023 Form 10-K\nfor further information on the Firm\u2019s accounting\npolicies for the allowance for credit losses.\n                                                                                                            \n  Derivative contracts                                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to\nmanage risk, including credit risk and risks\narising from fluctuations in interest rates,\nforeign exchange and equities and commodities\nprices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in\norder to meet these needs and uses derivatives to\nmanage certain risks associated with net open risk\npositions from its market-making activities,\nincluding the counterparty credit risk arising from\nderivative receivables. The Firm also uses\nderivative instruments to manage its own credit\nrisk and other market risk exposure. The nature of\nthe counterparty and the settlement mechanism of\nthe\n\nderivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm\nis exposed. For over-the-counter (\"OTC\")\nderivatives, the Firm is exposed to the credit risk\nof the derivative counterparty. For exchange-traded\nderivatives (\u201cETD\u201d), such as futures and options,\nand cleared over-the-counter (\u201cOTC-cleared\u201d)\nderivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the\ncredit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible,\nthe Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk\nexposures arising from derivative contracts through\nthe use of legally enforceable master netting\narrangements and collateral agreements. The\npercentage of the Firm\u2019s OTC derivative\ntransactions subject to collateral agreements \u2014\nexcluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are\nnot typically covered by collateral agreements due\nto their short maturity and centrally cleared\ntrades that are settled daily \u2014 was approximately\n87% at both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nRefer to Note 4 for additional information on the\nFirm\u2019s use of collateral agreements and for a\nfurther discussion of derivative contracts,\ncounterparties and settlement types.\n\nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported\non the Consolidated balance sheets was $56.6\nbillion and $54.9 billion at March 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively. The increase was\nprimarily as a result of market movements.\nDerivative receivables represent the fair value of\nthe derivative contracts after giving effect to\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements and\nthe related cash collateral held by the Firm.\n\nIn addition, the Firm holds liquid securities and\nother cash collateral that may be used as security\nwhen the fair value of the client\u2019s exposure is in\nthe Firm\u2019s favor. For these purposes, the\ndefinition of liquid securities is consistent with\nthe definition of high quality liquid assets as\ndefined in the LCR rule.\n\nIn management\u2019s view, the appropriate measure of\ncurrent credit risk should also take into\nconsideration other collateral, which generally\nrepresents securities that do not qualify as high\nquality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The\nbenefits of these additional collateral amounts for\neach counterparty are subject to a legally\nenforceable master netting agreement and limited to\nthe net amount of the derivative receivables for\neach counterparty.\n\nThe Firm also holds additional collateral\n(primarily cash, G7 government securities, other\nliquid government agency and guaranteed securities,\nand corporate debt and equity securities) delivered\nby clients at the initiation of transactions, as\nwell as collateral related to contracts that have a\nnon-daily call frequency and collateral that the\nFirm has agreed to return but has not yet settled\nas of the reporting date.

The Firm's allowance for credit losses\ngenerally consists of : \u2022 the allowance for loan\nlosses, which covers the Firm\u2019s retained loan\nportfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented\nseparately on the Consolidated balance sheets, \u2022\nthe allowance for lending-related commitments,\nwhich is reflected in accounts payable and other\nliabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, and\n\u2022 the allowance for credit losses on investment\nsecurities, which is reflected in investment\nsecurities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\nDiscussion of changes in the allowance The\nallowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2024\nwas relatively flat when compared to December 31,\n2023, reflecting: \u2022 a net reduction of $142 million\nin wholesale , which included a net addition\nassociated with net downgrade activity, largely in\nReal Estate, primarily in CB, which was more than\noffset by the net impact of changes in the loan and\nlending-related commitment portfolios, as well as\nupdates to certain macroeconomic variables, and \u2022 a\nnet addition of $44 million in consumer ,\nconsisting of: \u2013 $153 million in Card Services,\nprimarily due to seasoning of newer vintages,\nlargely offset by reduced borrower uncertainty,\npredominantly offset by: \u2013 a $125 million net\nreduction in Home Lending, primarily driven by\nimprovements in the outlook for home prices. The\nFirm has maintained the additional weight placed on\nthe adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023\nto reflect downside risks as a result of persistent\ninflation and tightening financial conditions. The\nFirm's allowance for credit losses is estimated\nusing a weighted average of five internally\ndeveloped macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse\nscenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic\nfactors than the central case assumptions provided\nin the table below, resulting in a weighted average\nU.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.4% in the first\nquarter of 2025, and a weighted average U.S. real\nGDP level that is 1.7% lower than the central case\nat the end of the second quarter of 2025.\n\nThe following table presents the Firm\u2019s central\ncase assumptions for the periods presented:\n                                                                                       \n                                    Central case assumptions                           \n                                           at March 31, 2024                           \n                                                        2Q24       4Q24       2Q25     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. unemployment rate(a)                              3.9  %     4.2  %     4.1  %  \n  YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                         2.6  %     0.9  %     1.2  %  \n                                    Central case assumptions                           \n                                        at December 31, 2023                           \n                                                        2Q24       4Q24       2Q25     \n  U.S. unemployment rate(a)                              4.1  %     4.4  %     4.1  %  \n  YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                         1.8  %     0.7  %     1.0  %  \n                                                                                       \n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S.\nunemployment rate.

The investment securities portfolio is\npredominantly held by Treasury and CIO in\nconnection with the Firm\u2019s balance sheet and asset-\nliability management objectives. Principal\ninvestments are predominantly privately-held\nfinancial instruments and are managed in the LOBs\nand Corporate. Investments are typically intended\nto be held over extended periods and, accordingly,\nthe Firm has no expectation for short-term realized\ngains with respect to these investments. Investment\nsecurities risk Investment securities risk includes\nthe exposure associated with a default in the\npayment of principal and interest. This risk is\nmitigated given that the investment securities\nportfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly\nconsists of high-quality securities. At March 31,\n2024, the Treasury and CIO investment securities\nportfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses,\nwas $568.3 billion, and the average credit rating\nof the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+\n(based upon external ratings where available, and\nwhere not available, based primarily upon internal\nrisk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results\non pages 35-36 and Note 9 for further information\non the investment securities portfolio and internal\nrisk ratings. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on\npages 44-51 for further information on related\nliquidity risk. Refer to Market Risk Management on\npages 71-76 for further information on the market\nrisk inherent in the portfolio.\n\nPrincipal investment risk Principal investments are\ntypically privately-held financial instruments\nrepresenting ownership interests or other forms of\njunior capital. In general, principal investments\ninclude tax-oriented investments and investments\nmade to enhance or accelerate the Firm\u2019s business\nstrategies and exclude those that are consolidated\non the Firm's balance sheets. These investments are\nmade by dedicated investing businesses or as part\nof a broader business strategy.

This\nimprecision may be heightened when sudden or severe\nshifts in market conditions occur. For additional\ndiscussion on model uncertainty refer to\nEstimations and Model Risk Management on page 154\nof JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K.\n\nMarket Risk Management periodically reviews the\nFirm\u2019s existing market risk measures to identify\nopportunities for enhancement, and to the extent\nappropriate, will calibrate those measures\naccordingly over time.\n                                                                                                            \n  Value-at-risk                                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \nJPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (\u201cVaR\u201d), a\nstatistical risk measure, to estimate the potential\nloss from adverse market moves in the current\nmarket environment. The Firm has a single VaR\nframework used as a basis for calculating Risk\nManagement VaR and Regulatory VaR.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR is calculated\nassuming a one-day holding period and an expected\ntail-loss methodology which approximates a 95%\nconfidence level. For risk management purposes, the\nFirm believes this methodology provides a daily\nmeasure of risk that is closely aligned to risk\nmanagement decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate\nand, along with other market risk measures,\nprovides the appropriate information needed to\nrespond to risk events. The Firm calculates\nseparately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance\nwith regulatory rules (\u201cRegulatory VaR\u201d), which is\nused to derive the Firm\u2019s regulatory VaR-based\ncapital requirements under Basel III.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s VaR model calculations are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in response to changes in\nthe composition of the Firm\u2019s portfolios, changes\nin market conditions, improvements in the Firm\u2019s\nmodeling techniques and measurements, and other\nfactors. Such changes may affect historical\ncomparisons of VaR results.

The gains and losses depicted in the\nchart below do not reflect the Firm\u2019s reported revenue as they exclude certain components of total net\nrevenue, such as those associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven\ntrading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, other valuation adjustments and net\ninterest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or\nloss on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the\nrequirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.\n\nA backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the\nprior day. Under the Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are\nconsistent with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR\nbacktesting exceptions five times every 100 trading days on average. The number of VaR backtesting\nexceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the\ncurrent level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility during the 12\nmonths of historical data used in the VaR calculation.\n\nFor the 12 months ended March 31, 2024, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 144 of the 258 days, and\nobserved eleven VaR backtesting exceptions. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Firm posted\nbacktesting gains on 49 of the 64 days, and did not observe any VaR backtesting exceptions.\n\nThe following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the\ntrailing 12 months and three months ended March 31, 2024. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a\npercentage of the corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are\nshown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the\nintervals that are greater than one hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the results\nof backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm\u2019s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital\nDisclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm\u2019s covered positions.\n                             Distribution of Daily Backtesting Gains and Losses                             \n                                                                                                            \n                                                     73                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Structural interest rate risk management                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \nThe effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm\u2019s\nreported net income is important as interest rate\nrisk represents one of the Firm\u2019s significant\nmarket risks. Interest rate risk arises not only\nfrom trading activities which are included in VaR,\nbut also from the Firm\u2019s traditional banking\nactivities, which include extension of loans and\ncredit facilities, taking deposits, issuing debt,\nas well as the investment securities portfolio, and\nassociated derivative instruments.\n\nRefer to the table on page 136 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n2023 Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and Corporate\nidentifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.\n                                                                                                            \n  Earnings-at-Risk                                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \nOne way that the Firm evaluates its structural\ninterest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk.\nEarnings-at-risk estimates the Firm\u2019s interest rate\nexposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is\npresented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which\nincludes net interest income and certain interest\nrate sensitive fees. The baseline uses market\ninterest rates and, in the case of deposits,\npricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations\nof changes to this baseline for interest rate-\nsensitive assets and liabilities denominated in\nU.S. dollars and other currencies (\u201cnon-U.S.\ndollar\u201d currencies). These simulations primarily\ninclude retained loans, deposits, deposits with\nbanks, investment securities, long-term debt and\nany related interest rate hedges, and funds\ntransfer pricing of other positions in risk\nmanagement VaR and other sensitivity-based measures\nas described on page 136 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023\nForm 10-K. These simulations exclude hedges of\nexposure from non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk\narising from the Firm\u2019s capital investments. The\ninclusion of the hedges in these simulations would\nincrease U.S. dollar sensitivities and decrease\nnon-U.S. dollar sensitivities. Refer to non-U.S.\ndollar foreign exchange risk on page 143 of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K for more\ninformation.\n\nEarnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential\nchange to a net interest income baseline, over the\nfollowing 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions.\nThese scenarios include a parallel shift involving\nchanges to both short-term and long-term rates by\nan equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving\nholding short-term rates constant and increasing\nlong-term rates; and a flatter yield curve\ninvolving increasing short-term rates and holding\nlong-term rates constant or holding short-term\nrates constant and decreasing long-term rates.\nThese scenarios consider many different factors,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 The impact on exposures as a result of\ninstantaneous changes in interest rates from\nbaseline rates.\n\n\u2022 Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled\nprepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding\nassumptions about actions that could be taken by\nthe Firm or its clients and customers in response\nto instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment\nassumptions are based on the interest rates used in\nthe scenarios compared with underlying contractual\nrates, the time since origination, and other\nfactors which are updated periodically based on\nhistorical experience. Deposit forecasts are a key\nassumption in the Firm's earnings-at-risk. The\nbaseline reflects certain assumptions relating to\nthe reversal of Quantitative Easing that are highly\nuncertain and require management judgment.\nTherefore, the actual amount of deposits held by\nthe Firm, at any particular time, could be impacted\nby actions the Federal Reserve may take as part of\nmonetary policy, including through the use of the\nReverse Repurchase Facility. In addition, there are\nother factors that impact the amount of deposits\nheld at the Firm such as the level of loans across\nthe industry and competition for deposits.\n\n\u2022 The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as\ndeposit betas, represent the amount by which\ndeposit rates paid could change upon a given change\nin market interest rates. Actual deposit rates paid\nmay differ from the modeled assumptions, primarily\ndue to customer behavior and competition for\ndeposits.\n\nThe Firm performs sensitivity analyses of the\nassumptions used in earnings-at-risk scenarios,\nincluding with respect to deposit betas and\nforecasts of deposit balances, both of which are\nespecially significant in the case of consumer\ndeposits. The results of these sensitivity analyses\nare reported to the CTC Risk Committee and the\nBoard Risk Committee.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s earnings-at-risk scenarios are\nperiodically evaluated and enhanced in response to\nchanges in the composition of the Firm\u2019s balance\nsheet, changes in market conditions, improvements\nin the Firm\u2019s simulation and other factors. The\nFirm is currently evaluating updates to deposit\nrates paid used in its earnings-at-risk scenarios\nconsidering observed pricing and client and\ncustomer behavior. In the current environment,\nincorporating these updated deposit rates paid\nwould affect the U.S. dollar scenarios, with higher\ninterest rate scenarios expected to result in an\nincrease in positive sensitivity, and lower\ninterest rate scenarios expected to result in an\nincrease in negative sensitivity, with respect to\nthe Firm\u2019s earnings-at-risk.

The change in the Firm\u2019s U.S.\ndollar sensitivities as of March 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 primarily reflected the impact of\nchanges in the Firm\u2019s balance sheet. As of March 31, 2024, the Firm\u2019s sensitivity to the +/-100 basis points\nparallel shift in rates is primarily the result of a greater impact from assets repricing compared to the\nimpact of liabilities repricing.\n\nEconomic Value Sensitivity In addition to earnings-at-risk, which is measured as a sensitivity to a baseline\nof earnings over the next 12 months, the Firm also measures Economic Value Sensitivity (\u201cEVS\u201d). EVS stress\ntests the longer-term economic value of equity by measuring the sensitivity of the Firm\u2019s current balance\nsheet, primarily retained loans, deposits, debt and investment securities as well as related hedges, under\nvarious interest rate scenarios. The Firm's pricing and cash flow assumptions associated with deposits, as\nwell as prepayment assumptions for loans and securities, are significant factors in the EVS measure. In\naccordance with the CTC interest rate risk management policy, the Firm has established limits on EVS as a\npercentage of TCE. Certain assumptions used in the EVS measure may differ from those required in the fair\nvalue disclosure. For example, certain assets and liabilities with no stated maturity, such as credit card\nreceivables and deposits, have longer assumed durations in the EVS measure. Additional information on long-\nterm debt and held to maturity investment securities is disclosed on page 101 in Note 2 financial\ninstruments that are not carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n                                                     75                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Other sensitivity-based measures                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by\nassessing the potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (\u201cOCI\u201d) and noninterest expense\ndue to changes in relevant market variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to\nmarket risk on page 136 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on the positions\ncaptured in other sensitivity-based measures.\n\nThe table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-\nsensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used\nfor hedging purposes are reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the\ntable below may not be representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at March 31,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, as the movement in market

The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various\nportfolios which may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the Firm\u2019s exposures\nare diversified given the Firm\u2019s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country. Refer to pages 144\u2013145\nof JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm\u2019s country risk management. Risk\nReporting The following table presents the Firm\u2019s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of\nMarch 31, 2024 and their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2023. The top 20 country exposures\nrepresent the Firm\u2019s largest total exposures by individual country. Country exposures may fluctuate from\nperiod to period due to a variety of factors, including client activity, market flows and liquidity\nmanagement activities undertaken by the Firm. The Firm continues to monitor its exposure to Russia which was\napproximately $350 million as of March 31, 2024, driven by cash placed with the central bank. This amount\nexcludes deposits placed on behalf of clients at the Deposit Insurance Agency of Russia.

The Firm\u2019s most complex\naccounting estimates require management\u2019s judgment\nto ascertain the appropriate carrying value of\nassets and liabilities. The Firm has established\npolicies and control procedures intended to ensure\nthat estimation methods, including any judgments\nmade as part of such methods, are well-controlled,\nindependently reviewed and applied consistently\nfrom period to period. The methods used and\njudgments made reflect, among other factors, the\nnature of the assets or liabilities and the related\nbusiness and risk management strategies, which may\nvary across the Firm\u2019s businesses and portfolios.\nIn addition, the policies and procedures are\nintended to ensure that the process for changing\nmethodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The\nFirm believes its estimates for determining the\ncarrying value of its assets and liabilities are\nappropriate. The following is a brief description\nof the Firm\u2019s critical accounting estimates\ninvolving significant judgments.\n                                                                                                            \n  Allowance for credit losses                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement\u2019s estimate of expected credit losses\nover the remaining expected life of the Firm\u2019s\nfinancial assets measured at amortized cost and\ncertain off-balance sheet lending-related\ncommitments. The allowance for credit losses\ngenerally comprises:\n\n\u2022 The allowance for loan losses, which covers the\nFirm\u2019s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-\nrated),\n\n\u2022 The allowance for lending-related commitments,\nand\n\n\u2022 The allowance for credit losses on investment\nsecurities.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses involves\nsignificant judgment on a number of matters\nincluding development and weighting of\nmacroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of\nhistorical loss experience, assessment of risk\ncharacteristics, assignment of risk ratings,\nvaluation of collateral, and the determination of\nremaining expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note\n13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2023 Form 10-K for further\ninformation on these judgments as well as the\nFirm\u2019s policies and methodologies used to determine\nthe Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses, and\nAllowance for credit losses on pages 67-69 and Note\n12 of this Form 10-Q for further information.\n\nOne of the most significant judgments involved in\nestimating the Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses\nrelates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to\nestimate credit losses over the eight-quarter\nforecast period within the Firm\u2019s methodology. The\neight-quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of\nmacroeconomic variables (\"MEVs\") that are relevant\nfor exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit\nlosses being driven primarily by a subset of less\nthan twenty variables. The specific variables that\nhave the greatest effect on the modeled losses vary\nby portfolio and geography.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include\nregional U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. HPI.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S.\nunemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices,\nU.S. interest rates, U.S. corporate credit spreads,\noil prices, U.S. commercial real estate prices and\nU.S. HPI.\n\nChanges in the Firm\u2019s assumptions and forecasts of\neconomic conditions could significantly affect its\nestimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio\nat the balance sheet date or lead to significant\nchanges in the estimate from one reporting period\nto the next.\n\nAs a result of the First Republic acquisition, the\nFirm recorded an allowance for credit losses for\nthe loans acquired and lending-related commitments\nassumed as of May 1, 2023. Given the differences in\nrisk rating methodologies for the First Republic\nportfolio, and the ongoing integration of products\nand systems, the allowance for credit losses for\nthe acquired wholesale portfolio was measured based\non other facilities underwritten by the Firm with\nsimilar risk characteristics and not based on\nmodeled estimates. As such, the First Republic\nwholesale portfolio is excluded from the modeled\nestimates sensitivity analysis below. The allowance\nfor credit losses for predominantly all of the\nconsumer portfolio was measured using the Firm\u2019s\nmodeled approach, as the consumer portfolio is\npredominantly residential real estate that has more\ncommonly defined risk characteristics including\nloan to value ratio and credit score, and therefore\nis reflected in the sensitivity analysis below.\nRefer to Note 26 for additional information on the\nFirst Republic acquisition.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes\nin any one factor or input might affect the overall\nallowance for credit losses because management\nconsiders a wide variety of factors and inputs in\nestimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes\nin the factors and inputs considered may not occur\nat the same rate and may not be consistent across\nall geographies or product types, and changes in\nfactors and inputs may be directionally\ninconsistent, such that improvement in one factor\nor input may offset deterioration in others.\n\nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate\nmacroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the\nmodeled credit losses determined using its central\nand relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which\nare two of the five scenarios considered in\nestimating the allowances for loan losses and\nlending-related commitments. The central and\nrelative adverse scenarios each included a full\nsuite of MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths\nand peaks/troughs of those variables over the\neight-quarter forecast period.\n\nFor example, compared to the Firm\u2019s central\nscenario shown on page 143 and in Note 12, the\nFirm\u2019s relative adverse scenario assumes an\nelevated U.S. unemployment rate, averaging\napproximately 2.2% higher over the eight-quarter\nforecast, with a peak difference of approximately\n2.9% in the first quarter of 2025.\n                                                     78                                                     \nThis analysis is not intended to estimate expected\nfuture changes in the allowance for credit losses,\nfor a number of reasons, including: \u2022 The allowance\nas of March 31, 2024, reflects credit losses beyond\nthose estimated under the central scenario due to\nthe weight placed on the adverse scenarios. \u2022 The\nimpacts of changes in many MEVs are both\ninterrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this\nanalysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more\nsevere changes in macroeconomic variables. \u2022\nExpectations of future changes in portfolio\ncomposition and borrower behavior can significantly\naffect the allowance for credit losses. To\ndemonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss\nestimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of March\n31, 2024, the Firm compared the modeled estimates\nunder its relative adverse scenario to its central\nscenario. Without considering offsetting or\ncorrelated effects in other qualitative components\nof the Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses, the\ncomparison between these two scenarios for the\nexposures below reflect the following differences:\n\u2022 An increase of approximately $800 million for\nresidential real estate loans and lending-related\ncommitments \u2022 An increase of approximately $3.2\nbillion for credit card loans \u25aa An increase of\napproximately $3.7 billion for wholesale loans and\nlending-related commitments This analysis relates\nonly to the modeled credit loss estimates and is\nnot intended to estimate changes in the overall\nallowance for credit losses as it does not reflect\nany potential changes in other adjustments to the\nquantitative calculation, which would also be\ninfluenced by the judgment management applies to\nthe modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the\nuncertainty and imprecision of these modeled\nlifetime loss estimates based on then-current\ncircumstances and conditions. Recognizing that\nforecasts of macroeconomic conditions are\ninherently uncertain, the Firm believes that its\nprocess to consider the available information and\nassociated risks and uncertainties is appropriately\ngoverned and that its estimates of expected credit\nlosses were reasonable and appropriate for the\nperiod ended March 31, 2024.\n\nFair value JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its\nassets and liabilities at fair value. The majority\nof such assets and liabilities are measured at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis, including derivatives,\nstructured note products and certain securities\nfinancing agreements. Certain assets and\nliabilities are measured at fair value on a\nnonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage,\nhome equity and other loans, where the carrying\nvalue is based on the fair value of the underlying\ncollateral.

The level 3 balances would be reduced if\nnetting were applied, including the netting benefit\nassociated with cash collateral.\n                                                     79                                                     \nValuation\nEstimating fair value requires the application of\njudgment. The type and level of judgment required\nis largely dependent on the amount of observable\nmarket information available to the Firm. For\ninstruments valued using internally developed\nvaluation models and other valuation techniques\nthat use significant unobservable inputs and are\ntherefore classified within level 3 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair\nvalue are more significant than those required when\nestimating the fair value of instruments classified\nwithin levels 1 and 2.\n\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an\ninstrument within level 3, management must first\ndetermine the appropriate valuation model or other\nvaluation technique to use. Second, the lack of\nobservability of certain significant inputs\nrequires management to assess relevant empirical\ndata in deriving valuation inputs including, for\nexample, transaction details, yield curves,\ninterest rates, prepayment speeds, default rates,\nvolatilities, correlations, prices (such as\ncommodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of\ncomparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and\ncredit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further\ndiscussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments,\nincluding unobservable inputs used.\n\nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3,\nmanagement judgment must be applied to assess the\nappropriate level of valuation adjustments to\nreflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm\u2019s\ncreditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity\nconsiderations, unobservable parameters, and for\nportfolios that meet specified criteria, the size\nof the net open risk position. The judgments made\nare typically affected by the type of product and\nits specific contractual terms, and the level of\nliquidity for the product or within the market as a\nwhole. In periods of heightened market volatility\nand uncertainty judgments are further affected by\nthe wider variation of reasonable valuation\nestimates, particularly for positions that are less\nliquid.

(\u201cJPMorgan Chase\u201d or the \u201cFirm\u201d), a financial holding company incorporated under\nDelaware law in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The\nFirm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial\nbanking, financial transaction processing and asset management. On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired\ncertain assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank (the \u201cFirst Republic acquisition\u201d)\nfrom the FDIC. The Firm continues to convert certain operations, and to integrate clients, products and\nservices associated with the First Republic acquisition, to align with the Firm\u2019s businesses and operations.\nAccordingly, reporting classification and internal risk rating profiles in the wholesale portfolio may\nchange in future periods. Refer to Note 26 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition. The\naccounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP.\nAdditionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed\nby regulatory authorities. The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in conformity with U.S.\nGAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results\ncould be different from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments\nhave been included such that this interim financial information is fairly stated. These unaudited\nConsolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial\nStatements, and related notes thereto, included in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K. Consolidation The\nConsolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the\nFirm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been\neliminated. Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of\nJPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm determines whether it has a\ncontrolling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest\nentity or a variable interest entity. Refer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K for a\nfurther description of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s accounting policies regarding consolidation. Offsetting assets and\nliabilities U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the\nsame counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the\nConsolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also\npermits securities financing balances to be presented on a net basis when specified conditions are met,\nincluding the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such\nbalances where it has determined that the specified conditions are met. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n2023 Form 10-K for further information on offsetting assets and liabilities. Accounting standard adopted\nJanuary 1, 2024 Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using\nthe Proportional Amortization Method The guidance expanded the types of tax-oriented investments, beyond\naffordable housing tax credit investments, that the Firm can elect on a program by program basis, to be\naccounted for using the proportional amortization method. This method requires the cost of eligible\ninvestments, within an elected program, to be amortized in proportion to the tax benefits received with the\nresulting amortization reported directly in income tax expense, which aligns with the associated tax credits\nand other tax benefits. Eligible investments must meet certain criteria, including that substantially all of\nthe return is from income tax credits and other income tax benefits. This guidance was adopted on January 1,\n2024 under the modified retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance resulted in a change to the\nclassification and timing of the amortization associated with certain of the Firm's alternative energy tax-\noriented investments. As a result of the adoption, the amortization of these investments that was previously\nrecognized in other income is now being recognized in income tax expense. The change in accounting resulted\nin a decrease to retained earnings of $ 161million and increased the Firm\u2019s income tax expense and the\neffective tax rate by approximately $ 450million and twopercentage points, respectively, for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2024, with no material impact to net income.\n                                                     88                                                     \nThe guidance requires additional disclosure for all investments that generate income tax credits and other\nincome tax benefits from a tax-oriented investment program for which the Firm has elected to apply the\nproportional amortization method. The guidance also requires a reevaluation of eligible investments when\nsignificant modifications or events occur that result in a change in the nature of the investment or a\nchange in the Firm's relationship with the underlying project. Refer to Note 5 and Note 13 for additional\ninformation.\n                                                     89                                                     \n

realizable value\u201d is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell\n(\u201ctransaction costs\u201d). Transaction costs for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories are either not\napplicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair\nvalue for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net\nrealizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because\nunder fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 4 for\na further discussion of the Firm\u2019s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value\ndisclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.\n                                                     92                                                     \n(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical\nsecurities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).\n\n(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its\nequivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At March\n31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds,\nprivate equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $ 1.1billion and $ 1.0billion, respectively.\nIncluded in these balances at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, were trading assets of $ 47million and $\n42million, respectively, and other assets of $ 1.0billion and $ 984million, respectively.\n\n(e) At both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, included $ 10.2billion of residential first-lien mortgages\nand $ 6.0billion of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage\nloans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $ 3.4billion and $\n2.9billion, respectively.\n\n(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables\nand the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement\nexists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit\nassociated with cash collateral.\n\nLevel 3 valuations\n\nRefer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm\u2019s valuation process\nand a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. The\nfollowing table presents the Firm\u2019s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to\nmeasure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of\nvalues for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to\nclassify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall\nfair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is,\ncomponents that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the\nunobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the\nFirm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and\nderivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of\nvalues presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the\nsignificant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted\naverages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the\ninstruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm\u2019s view, the input range, weighted and\narithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the\nreasonableness of the Firm\u2019s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the\nvarious instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of\ncharacteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and\nvaluation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option\ncontracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted and arithmetic\naverage values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the\ncharacteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.\n                                                     93                                                     \n

their classification on the Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each\nvaluation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the\ntechnique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ.\n\n(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $ 729million, nonagency securities of $ 8million\nand non-trading loans of $ 862million.\n\n(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $ 12million, trading loans of $ 65million and non-trading loans of $\n1.3billion.\n\n(d) Comprises trading loans of $ 466million and non-trading loans of $ 729million.\n\n(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are\nfinancial instruments that typically contain embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of\nstructured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant\nunobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.\n\n(f) Includes equity securities of $ 783million including $ 580million in Other assets, for which quoted\nprices are not readily available and the fair value is generally based on internal valuation techniques such\nas EBITDA multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant both\nindividually and in aggregate.\n\n(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not\nreadily available, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal valuation techniques. The price\ninput is expressed assuming a par value of $ 100.\n\n(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.\n\n(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are\nused.\n                                                     94                                                     \nChanges in and ranges of unobservable inputs Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K for a\ndiscussion of the impact on fair value of changes in unobservable inputs and the relationships between\nunobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market\nfactors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm\u2019s positions. Changes in level 3\nrecurring fair value measurements The following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance\nsheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within\nlevel 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. When a determination\nis made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of\nthe unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments\ntypically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is,\ncomponents that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and\nlosses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of\nthe valuation methodology. The Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments\nusing securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value\nhierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or\nlosses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm\u2019s risk management activities related to\nsuch level 3 instruments.\n                                                     95                                                     \n

For the three months ended March 31,\n2024, there were no significant transfers from\nlevel 3 into level 2. For the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2023, significant transfers from level 3\ninto level 2 included the following: \u2022 $ 953million\nof gross equity derivative receivables as a result\nof an increase in observability and a decrease in\nthe significance of unobservable inputs. All\ntransfers are based on changes in the observability\nand/or significance of the valuation inputs and are\nassumed to occur at the beginning of the quarterly\nreporting period in which they occur. Gains and\nlosses The following describes significant\ncomponents of total realized/unrealized\ngains/(losses) for instruments measured at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis for the periods\nindicated.

In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable\nprice changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm\u2019s estimated fair\nvalues. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different rights and obligations of similar\nsecurities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the Firm\u2019s valuation techniques for private\nequity direct investments.\nThe following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair\nvalues held as of March 31, 2024 and 2023 , that are measured under the measurement alternative and the\nrelated adjustments recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price\nchanges.

These shares are subject to\ncertain transfer restrictions and are convertible\ninto Visa Class A common stock (\u201cVisa A shares\u201d) at\na specified conversion rate upon final resolution\nof certain litigation matters involving Visa. The\nconversion rate of Visa B-1 shares to Visa A shares\nwas 1.5875at March 31, 2024 and may be adjusted by\nVisa depending on developments related to the\nlitigation matters. The outcome of those litigation\nmatters, and the effect that the resolution of\nthose matters may have on the conversion rate, is\nunknown. Accordingly, as of March 31, 2024, there\nis significant uncertainty regarding when the\ntransfer restrictions on Visa B-1 shares may be\nterminated and what the final conversion rate for\nthe Visa B-1 shares will be. As a result of these\nconsiderations, as well as differences in voting\nrights, Visa B-1 shares are not considered to be\nsimilar to Visa A shares, and they continue to be\nheld at their nominal carrying value. On January\n24, 2024, Visa filed a Current Report on Form 8-K\nwith the SEC announcing that Visa\u2019s stockholders\nhad approved amendments to its Certificate of\nIncorporation that redenominated the Visa Class B\ncommon stock to Visa Class B-1 common stock (\u201cVisa\nB-1 shares\u201d) and authorized Visa to conduct one or\nmore exchange offers. On April 8, 2024, Visa\ncommenced an initial exchange offer expiring May 3,\n2024 for any and all outstanding shares of Visa B-1\nshares. Holders participating in the exchange offer\nwould receive a combination of Visa Class B-2\ncommon stock (\u201cVisa B-2 shares\u201d) and Visa Class C\ncommon stock (\u201cVisa C shares\u201d) in exchange for Visa\nB-1 shares that are validly tendered and accepted\nfor exchange by Visa. The Firm has tendered its\n37.2million Visa B-1 shares, and that\n\ntender is pending Visa\u2019s acceptance. In exchange\nfor each Visa B-1 share that is validly tendered\nand accepted for exchange by Visa, the Firm would\nreceive one half of a newly issued share of Visa\nClass B-2 common stock (\u201cVisa B-2 shares\u201d) and\nnewly issued Visa C shares in an amount equivalent\nto one half of a Visa B-1 share. Upon acceptance by\nVisa of the Firm\u2019s tender, the Visa C shares\nreceived by the Firm would be recognized at fair\nvalue, which is expected to result in a gain that\nmay be recorded as early as the second quarter of\n2024. The Visa B-2 shares would continue to be held\nat their nominal carrying value and would continue\nto be subject to transfer restrictions. The Firm\nwould be entitled to sell the Visa C shares\nreceived after a brief lock-up period expires. Visa\nis also authorized to extend offers for potential\nfuture exchanges, each enabling the release of\nadditional Visa B shares if certain conditions are\nmet. The timing of future exchange offers is\ndependent upon actions taken by Visa and other\nfactors that may be outside of the Firm\u2019s control.\nIn connection with prior sales of Visa B shares\nprior to the redenomination to Visa B-1 shares, the\nFirm has entered into derivative instruments with\nthe purchasers of the shares under which the Firm\nretains the risk associated with changes in the\nconversion rate.

of the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual\nfees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and\nprimary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the\nvalue of the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan\u2019s allowance for\nloan losses, which represents the loan\u2019s expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The\ndifference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to\nchanges in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that\naffect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value.\n(b) Excludes lending-related commitments disclosed in the table below.\nThe majority of the Firm\u2019s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets.

due as of March 31, 2024 and December\n31, 2023.\n(c) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-\nterm beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests,\nfor which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-protected\nstructured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of\nprincipal at maturity, but for structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an\nunderlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit\nrisk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.\n(d) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the\ncontractual principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm\u2019s\nnext call date.\nAt March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the\nfair value option was elected was $ 11.4billion and $ 9.7billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair\nvalue of $ 93million and $ 97million, respectively.

Derivatives contracts generally\nrequire additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined rating\nthreshold is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a\npreexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in\nadditional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a\nratings downgrade), nor in termination payment requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated\nbased upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative\ncontract.\n                                                                                                            \n  Liquidity                                                                                                 \n  impact of                                                                                                 \n  downgrade                                                                                                 \n  triggers                                                                                                  \n  on OTC and                                                                                                \n  OTC-cleared                                                          December 31,                         \n  derivatives           March 31, 2024                                         2023                         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (in millions)           Single-notch              Two-notch          Single-notch              Two-notch  \n                             downgrade              downgrade             downgrade              downgrade  \n  Amount of                                                                                                 \n  additional                                                                                                \n  collateral to     $              106    $             1,209    $               75    $             1,153  \n  be                                                                                                        \n  posted upon                                                                                               \n  downgrade(a)                                                                                              \n  Amount                                                                                                    \n  required to                                                                                               \n  settle                                                                                                    \n  contracts with                    91                    397                    93                    592  \n  termination                                                                                               \n  triggers upon                                                                                             \n  downgrade(b)                                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \n(a) Includes the additional collateral to be posted for initial margin.\n(b) Amounts represent fair values of derivative payables, and do not reflect collateral posted.\nDerivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset\n\nIn certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains\nthe economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in\ncontemplation of the initial transfer.

The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative\ncontracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative\ncontract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives where JPMorgan Chase is the\npurchaser of protection are comparable to the profile reflected below.\n

yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period,\nweighted based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon,\namortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives,\nincluding closed portfolio hedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield\nexcludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from\ntheir contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable\ndebt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.\n(b) For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the allowance\nfor credit losses of $ 34million and the portfolio layer fair value hedge basis adjustments of $( 1.2)\nbillion at March 31, 2024. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities also excludes the allowance for\ncredit losses of $ 120million at March 31, 2024.\n(c) Substantially all of the Firm\u2019s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in\n10years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects\nanticipated future prepayments, is approximately eight yearsfor agency residential MBS and six yearsfor both\nagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and nonagency residential collateralized mortgage\nobligations.\n                                                    124                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Note 10 \u2013 Securities financing activities                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \nRefer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting policies relating to\nsecurities financing activities. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding securities financing\nagreements for which the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 23 for further information\nregarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements. The table below\nsummarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm\u2019s securities financing agreements as of March 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting\nagreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm\nnets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements\nwith the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its\ncounterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for\nnet Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with\nrespect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with securities financing\nbalances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table\nbelow as \u201cAmounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,\u201d and reduces the \u201cNet amounts\u201d presented.\nWhere a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are\npresented gross in the \u201cNet amounts\u201d below. In transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a\nsecurities-for-securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as\ncollateral, the Firm recognizes the securities received at fair value within other assets and the obligation\nto return those securities within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n

That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for\nthose products is higher than the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving\nperiod.\n                                                    130                                                     \nNonaccrual loans and other credit quality indicators\n\nThe following table provides information on nonaccrual and other credit quality indicators for retained\nresidential real estate loans.\n                                                                                               \n  (in millions, except weighted-average                                                        \n  data)                                          March 31, 2024          December 31, 2023     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Nonaccrual loans(a)(b)(c)(d)                $           3,449       $              3,466     \n  Current estimated LTV ratios(e)(f)(g)                                                        \n  Greater than 125% and refreshed FICO                                                         \n  scores:                                                                                      \n  Equal to or greater than 660                $              70       $                 72     \n  Less than 660                                               \u2014                          \u2014     \n  101% to 125% and refreshed FICO scores:                                                      \n  Equal to or greater than 660                              228                        223     \n  Less than 660                                               5                          4     \n  80% to 100% and refreshed FICO scores:                                                       \n  Equal to or greater than 660                            6,533                      6,491     \n  Less than 660                                             102                        102     \n  Less than 80% and refreshed FICO scores:                                                     \n  Equal to or greater than 660                          302,573                    309,251     \n  Less than 660                                           9,436                      9,277     \n  No FICO/LTV available(h)                                1,037                        989     \n  Total retained loans                        $         319,984       $            326,409     \n  Weighted-average LTV ratio(e)(i)                           48  %                      49  %  \n  Weighted-average FICO(f)(i)                               776                        770     \n  Geographic region(h)(j)                                                                      \n  California                                  $         125,046       $            127,072     \n  New York                                               48,175                     48,815     \n  Florida                                                22,371                     22,778     \n  Texas                                                  15,106                     15,506     \n  Massachusetts                                          14,014                     14,213     \n  Colorado                                               10,590                     10,800     \n  Illinois                                               10,540                     10,856     \n  Washington                                              9,573                      9,923     \n  New Jersey                                              7,863                      8,050     \n  Connecticut                                             7,020                      7,163     \n  All other                                              49,686                     51,233     \n  Total retained loans                        $         319,984       $            326,409     \n                                                                                               \n(a) I ncludes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of\nthe underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance,\nresidential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the\nborrower (\u201cChapter 7 loans\u201d) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual loans, regardless of their delinquency\nstatus. At March 31, 2024, approximately 9% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more\npast due.\n\n(b) Mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies excluded from nonaccrual loans were not material at\nMarch 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\n(c) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance,\ncertain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of\namortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the\nunderlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.\n\n(d) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $ 43million and $ 45million for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n(e) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property\nvalue. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using\nnationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available\nand forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home\nequity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.\n\n(f) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower\u2019s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm\non at least a quarterly basis.\n\n(g) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO\nscore. These loans have been included in a FICO band based on management\u2019s estimation of the borrower\u2019s\ncredit quality.\n\n(h) Included U.S. government-guaranteed loans as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\n(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.\n\n(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding\nloan balances at March 31, 2024.\n                                                    131                                                     \nLoan modifications The Firm grants certain\nmodifications of residential real estate loans to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The\nFirm's proprietary modification programs as well as\ngovernment programs, including U.S. GSE programs,\nthat generally provide various modifications to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty\nincluding, but not limited to, interest rate\nreductions, term extensions, other-than-\ninsignificant payment deferral and principal\nforgiveness that would otherwise have been required\nunder the terms of the original agreement, are\nconsidered FDMs. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan\nChase's 2023 Form 10-K for further information.\nFinancial effects of FDMs For the three months\nended March 31, 2024, residential real estate FDMs\nwere $ 39million. The financial effects of the\nFDMs, which were predominantly in the form of term\nextensions and interest rate reductions, included\nextending the weighted-average life of the loans by\n16years and reducing the weighted-average\ncontractual interest rate from 7.39% to 4.28%. For\nthe three months ended March 31, 2023, residential\nreal estate FDMs were $ 38million. The financial\neffects of the FDMs, which were largely in the form\nof term extensions and interest rate reductions,\nincluded extending the weighted-average life of the\nloans up to 24years, and reducing the weighted-\naverage contractual interest rate from 5.84% to\n3.57%. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nthere were noadditional commitments to lend to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty whose\nloans have been modified as FDMs. For the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, loans subject\nto a trial modification and Chapter 7 loans were\nnot material.\n\nPayment status of FDMs and defaults\nThe following table provides information on the\npayment status of FDMs during the twelve months\nended March 31, 2024 and the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2023.\n                                                                                     \n  (in millions)                                   Amortized cost basis               \n  Twelve months ended March 31,  2024     Three months ended March 31,  2023         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Current                              $                            97        $  37  \n  30-149 days past due                                              17            1  \n  150 or more days past due                                         11            \u2014  \n  Total                                $                           125        $  38  \n                                                                                     \nFDMs that defaulted in the three months ended March\n31, 2024 and were reported as FDMs in the twelve\nmonths prior to the default were notmaterial.

Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance,\ncertain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of\namortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the\nunderlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.\n\n(b) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the three months\nended March 31, 2024 and 2023 .\n\n(c) The geographic regions presented in this table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding\nloan balances at March 31, 2024.\n\nLoan modifications The Firm grants certain modifications of auto and other loans to borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty.

modifications\n\nThe Firm grants certain modifications of credit card loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.\nThese modifications may involve placing the customer\u2019s credit card account on a fixed payment plan,\ngenerally for 60months, which typically includes reducing the interest rate on the credit card account. If\nthe borrower does not make the contractual payments when due under the modified payment terms, the credit\ncard loan continues to age and will be charged-off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy.\nIn most cases, the Firm does not reinstate the borrower's line of credit.\n\nFinancial effects of FDMs\nThe following tables provide information on credit card loan modifications

guidance. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase's 2023\nForm 10-K for further information.\n(b) At March 31, 2024 and 2023, in addition to the allowance for credit losses in the table above, the Firm\nalso had an allowance for credit losses of $ 274million and $ 20million, respectively, associated with\ncertain accounts receivable in CIB. At March 31, 2023, the Firm also had an allowance for credit losses of $\n241million associated with Other assets in Corporate.\n(c) As of March 31, 2024, included the allowance for credit losses associated with First Republic.\n(d) Includes collateral-dependent loans, including those for which foreclosure is deemed probable, and\nnonaccrual risk-rated loans.\n(e) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets.\n(f) At March 31, 2024 and 2023, lending-related commitments excluded $ 17.7billion and $ 16.0billion,\nrespectively, for the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment; $ 943.9billion and $ 861.2billion,\nrespectively, for the credit card portfolio segment; and $ 20.9billion and $ 17.5billion, respectively, for\nthe wholesale portfolio segment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-related commitments.\n                                                    142                                                     \nDiscussion of changes in the allowance The allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2024 was relatively\nflat when compared to December 31, 2023, reflecting: \u2022 a net reduction of $ 142million in wholesale , which\nincluded a net addition associated with net downgrade activity, largely in Real Estate, primarily in CB,\nwhich was more than offset by the net impact of changes in the loan and lending-related commitment\nportfolios, as well as updates to certain macroeconomic variables, and \u2022 a net addition of $ 44million in\nconsumer , consisting of: \u2013 $ 153million in Card Services, primarily due to seasoning of newer vintages,\nlargely offset by reduced borrower uncertainty, predominantly offset by: \u2013 a $ 125million net reduction in\nHome Lending, primarily driven by improvements in the outlook for home prices. The Firm has maintained the\nadditional weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023 to reflect downside risks as\na result of persistent inflation and tightening financial conditions. The Firm's allowance for credit losses\nis estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse\nscenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the\ntable below, resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.4% in the first quarter of\n2025, and a weighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 1.7% lower than the central case at the end of the\nsecond quarter of 2025.\nThe following table presents the Firm\u2019s central\ncase assumptions for the periods presented:\n                                                                                       \n                                    Central case assumptions                           \n                                           at March 31, 2024                           \n                                                        2Q24       4Q24       2Q25     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. unemployment rate(a)                              3.9  %     4.2  %     4.1  %  \n  YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                         2.6  %     0.9  %     1.2  %  \n                                    Central case assumptions                           \n                                        at December 31, 2023                           \n                                                        2Q24       4Q24       2Q25     \n  U.S. unemployment rate(a)                              4.1  %     4.4  %     4.1  %  \n  YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                         1.8  %     0.7  %     1.0  %  \n                                                                                       \n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S.\nunemployment rate.\n(b) The year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in\nthe forecast horizon of the central scenario is\ncalculated as the percentage change in U.S. real\nGDP levels from the prior year.

and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n(d) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the\nliabilities of those entities. The assets and liabilities include third-party assets and liabilities of\nconsolidated VIEs and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.\n(e) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified on the\nConsolidated balance sheets as \u201cBeneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs\u201d. The holders of these\nbeneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. Included in\nbeneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $ 5.4billion and $ 3.1billion at\nMarch 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance\nsheets.\nVIEs sponsored by third parties The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties.\nThese include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter,\nplacement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm\u2019s-length,\nand individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the\nquality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE\nthat most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially\nbe significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions\non its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any\nother third-party transaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit\nvehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing,\nalternative energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is\ntypically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax\ncredit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally\ninvests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax\ncredits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding\ncommitments, was $ 33.1billion and $ 35.1billion at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, of which $\n14.3billion and $ 14.7billion was unfunded at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Firm\nassesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment\nuntil the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K for further\ninformation on affordable housing tax credits and Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for more information on off-\nbalance sheet lending-related commitments. Effective January 1, 2024, the Firm adopted updates to the\nAccounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method guidance\nwhich expanded the types of tax-oriented investments, beyond\n                                                    147                                                     \naffordable housing tax credit investments, that the\nFirm can elect on a program by program basis, to be\naccounted for using the proportional amortization\nmethod. Refer to Note 1 for further information.\nThe proportional amortization method requires the\ncost of eligible investments, within an elected\nprogram, be amortized in proportion to the tax\nbenefits received with the resulting amortization\nreported directly in income tax expense, which\naligns with the associated tax credits and other\ntax benefits. Investments must meet certain\ncriteria to be eligible, including that\nsubstantially all of the return is from income tax\ncredits and other income tax benefits. In addition,\nunder this method deferred taxes are generally not\nrecorded as the investment is now amortized in\nproportion to the income tax credits and other\nincome tax benefits received.

In certain customer TOB transactions, the\nFirm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those\ntransactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders\nfor any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on\nany of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm\ndoes not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the\nmunicipal bond vehicle. The Firm\u2019s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at March\n31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $ 5.2billion and $ 5.1billion, respectively. The fair value of assets\nheld by such VIEs at both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $ 7.3billion.\n                                                    148                                                     \nLoan securitizations\nThe Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgages, credit card\nreceivables, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans.\nSecuritization activity\nThe following table provides information related to the Firm\u2019s securitization activities for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that\nwere not consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization.\n                                                                                                            \n                          Three months                                                                      \n                       ended March 31,                                                                      \n                                  2024                                         2023                         \n                           Residential         Commercial and           Residential         Commercial and  \n  (in millions)            mortgage(d)               other(e)           mortgage(d)               other(e)  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Principal         $            4,922    $             2,358    $            1,073    $                 \u2014  \n  securitized                                                                                               \n  All cash flows                                                                                            \n  during the                                                                                                \n  period:(a)                                                                                                \n  Proceeds                                                                                                  \n  received from                                                                                             \n  loan sales as     $            4,831    $             2,324    $            1,030    $                 \u2014  \n  financial                                                                                                 \n  instruments(b\u2026                                                                                            \n  Servicing fees                     6                      3                     6                      \u2014  \n  collected                                                                                                 \n  Cash flows                                                                                                \n  received on                       70                    130                    74                     87  \n  interests                                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \n(a) Excludes re-securitization transactions.\n(b) Predominantly includes Level 2 assets.\n(c) The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the proceeds received upon loan\nsale.\n(d) Represents prime mortgages.

Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit\nlosses, increases in capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions,\nadverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause\nthe estimated fair values of the Firm\u2019s reporting units to decline in the future, which could result in a\nmaterial impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated\ngoodwill. As of March 31, 2024, the Firm reviewed current economic conditions, estimated market cost of\nequity, as well as actual business results and projections of business performance. Based on such reviews,\nthe Firm has concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of March 31, 2024, or December 31, 2023, nor was\ngoodwill written off due to impairment during the three months ended March 31, 2024 or 2023.\n                                                    151                                                     \nMortgage servicing rights\n\nMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others.\nThe fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to\nservice the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively\namortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased\nfrom third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained.\nRefer to Notes 2 and 15 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K for a further description of the MSR asset,\ninterest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs.\nThe following table summarizes MSR activity for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\n

The contractual amount of these financial instruments\nrepresents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the\ncommitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or\nclient subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and\nguarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a\ndefault occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm\u2019s\nview, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K for a further discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and\nthe Firm\u2019s related accounting policies. To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain\nconsumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is\nmaintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-\nrelated commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-\nbalance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at March 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain scored business\nbanking lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has\nnot experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be\nutilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business banking\nlines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In\naddition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60days or more past due. The Firm\nmay reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or\nwhen there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.\n                                                    162                                                     \n

The liability related to\nrepurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in\nestablishing its litigation reserves. Refer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n2023 Form 10-K for additional information regarding litigation.\n                                                    164                                                     \nMerchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment\nnetworks, in its role as a merchant acquirer, the\nFirm's Merchant Services business in CIB Payments,\nretains a contingent liability for disputed\nprocessed credit and debit card transactions that\nresult in a charge-back to the merchant. If a\ndispute is resolved in the cardholder\u2019s favor, the\nFirm will (through the cardholder\u2019s issuing bank)\ncredit or refund the amount to the cardholder and\nwill charge back the transaction to the merchant.\nIf the Firm is unable to collect the amount from\nthe merchant, the Firm will bear the loss for the\namount credited or refunded to the cardholder. The\nFirm mitigates this risk by withholding future\nsettlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or\nobtaining other collateral. In addition, the Firm\nrecognizes a valuation allowance that covers the\npayment or performance risk related to charge-\nbacks. Sponsored member repo program The Firm acts\nas a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight\nand term resale and repurchase agreements through\nthe Government Securities Division of the Fixed\nIncome Clearing Corporation (\u201cFICC\u201d) on behalf of\nclients that become sponsored members under the\nFICC\u2019s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC\nthe prompt and full payment and performance of its\nsponsored member clients\u2019 respective obligations\nunder the FICC\u2019s rules. The Firm minimizes its\nliability under these guarantees by obtaining a\nsecurity interest in the cash or high-quality\nsecurities collateral that the clients place with\nthe clearing house; therefore, the Firm expects the\nrisk of loss to be remote. The Firm\u2019s maximum\npossible exposure, without taking into\nconsideration the associated collateral, is\nincluded in the Exchange & clearing house\nguarantees and commitments line on page 163. Refer\nto Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K for\nadditional information on credit risk mitigation\npractices on resale agreements and the types of\ncollateral pledged under repurchase agreements.\nGuarantees of subsidiaries The Parent Company has\nguaranteed certain long-term debt and structured\nnotes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase\nFinancial Company LLC (\u201cJPMFC\u201d), a 100%-owned\nfinance subsidiary.

The litigations range from individual\nactions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members.\nInvestigations and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both\ngovernmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of\nadjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm\u2019s lines of business and several\ngeographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory\nantitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm\nbelieves the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves\nestablished, for its legal proceedings is from $ 0to approximately $ 1.4billion at March 31, 2024. This\nestimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date\nfor those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made.\nFor certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The\nFirm\u2019s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: \u2022\nthe number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary\nstages, \u2022 the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of\nliability (if any) has yet to be determined, \u2022 the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the\nproceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and \u2022 the\nuncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made\nassumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives\nof adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition, the\noutcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate\nbecause the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm\u2019s estimate of\nthe aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary\nsignificantly. Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm\u2019s material legal proceedings. 1MDB Litigation .\nJ.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by\n1Malaysia Development Berhad (\u201c1MDB\u201d), a Malaysian state-owned and controlled investment fund. The claim\nalleges \u201cdishonest assistance\u201d against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in relation to payments of $ 300million and $\n500million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan\n(Suisse) SA held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings\n(Cayman) Limited. In March 2024, the Court upheld the Firm's challenge to the validity of service and the\nMalaysian Court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear the claim. That decision has been appealed by 1MDB. In August 2023,\nthe Court denied an application by 1MDB to discontinue its claim with permission to re-file a new claim in\nthe future. An appeals court is scheduled in August 2024 to hear separate appeals filed by 1MDB and the Firm\nagainst that August 2023 decision. In its appeal, the Firm seeks to prevent any claim from continuing. In\naddition, in November 2023, the Federal Office of the Attorney General (OAG) in Switzerland notified J.P.\nMorgan (Suisse) SA that it is conducting an investigation into possible criminal liability in connection\nwith transactions arising from J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA\u2019s relationship with the 1MDB PetroSaudi joint venture\nand its related persons for the period September 2009 through August 2015. The OAG investigation is ongoing.\nAmrapali . India\u2019s Enforcement Directorate (\u201cED\u201d) is investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in\nconnection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by twooffshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase\nentities into residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (\u201cAmrapali\u201d) relating to delays\nin delivering or failure to deliver residential units. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P.\nMorgan India Private Limited approximately $ 31.5million, and the Firm is appealing that order. Relatedly,\nin July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other\nparties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the\nprojects, violated certain criminal currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordered the ED to\nconduct a further inquiry. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the inquiry. Foreign Exchange\nInvestigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities\nrelating to its foreign exchange (\u201cFX\u201d) sales and trading activities and controls related to those\nactivities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal\nantitrust law. The Department of Labor (\"DOL\") granted the Firm exemptions\n                                                    166                                                     \nthat permit the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager\nexemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d) through the ten-yeardisqualification\nperiod following the antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa\nCompetition Commission matter which is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal. With\nrespect to civil litigation matters, in a putative class action filed against the Firm and other foreign\nexchange dealers on behalf of certain parties who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates,\nthe District Court denied certification of a class and granted summary judgment against the named plaintiffs\nin March 2023. An appeal by those plaintiffs of the District Court's decision is pending. In addition, some\nFX-related individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed\noutside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. An agreement to\nresolve one of the U.K. actions was reached in December 2022. In July 2023, the U.K. Court of Appeal\noverturned the Competition Appeal Tribunal's earlier denial of a request for class certification on an opt-\nout basis. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached on the putative class action, which remains\nsubject to court approval. Government Inquiries Related to the Zelle Network . The Firm is responding to\ninquiries from civil government authorities regarding the handling of disputes related to transfers of funds\nthrough the Zelle Network. The Firm is cooperating with these inquiries and responding to requests for\ninformation. Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class\naction complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of\ncredit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In\nSeptember 2018, the parties settled the class action seeking monetary relief, with the defendants\ncollectively contributing approximately $ 6.2billion. The settlement has been approved by the District Court\nand affirmed on appeal. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the settlement, $ 700million\nhas been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow. A separate class action seeking injunctive\nrelief continues, and in September 2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class\ncertification in part, and denied the motion in part. In March 2024, Visa and Mastercard announced a\nsettlement of the injunctive class action, agreeing to certain changes to their respective network rules and\nsystem-wide reductions in interchange rates for U.S.-based merchants. This settlement is subject to approval\nby the District Court. Of the merchants who opted out of the damages class settlement, certain merchants\nfiled individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the\nFirm and other banks. While some of those actions remain pending, the defendants have reached settlements\nwith the merchants who opted out representing over 70% of the combined Mastercard-branded and Visa-branded\npayment card sales volume. LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation . JPMorgan Chase has\nresponded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily\nto the British Bankers Association\u2019s (\u201cBBA\u201d) London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) for various currencies\nand the European Banking Federation\u2019s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cEURIBOR\u201d). The Swiss Competition\nCommission\u2019s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain subject,\ncontinues. The Firm appealed a December 2016 decision by the European Commission against the Firm and other\nbanks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. In December 2023, the\nEuropean General Court annulled the fine imposed by the European Commission, but exercised its discretion to\nre-impose a fine in an identical amount. In March 2024, the Firm filed an appeal of this decision with the\nCourt of Justice of the European Union. In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other\nbanks in various individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar\nLIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the\nFirm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other actions, and others are in various\nstages of litigation. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York has granted\nclass certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the\ndefendants, including the Firm. In addition, a lawsuit filed by a group of individual plaintiffs asserting\nantitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set\nU.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer l oans and credit cards\nwas dismissed in October 2023. Plaintiff filed an appeal of the dismissal to the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit in November 2023. The Firm has resolved all non-U.S. dollar LIBOR actions.\nRussian Litigation . The Firm is obligated to comply with international sanctions laws, which mandate the\nblocking of certain assets. These laws apply when assets associated with individuals, companies, products or\nservices are within the scope of the sanctions. The Firm has faced actual and threatened litigation in\nRussia seeking payments on transactions that the Firm cannot make under and is contractually excused from\npaying as a result of, relevant sanctions laws. In claims involving the Firm and claims filed against other\nfinancial institutions, Russian courts have disregarded the parties\u2019 contractual agreements concerning forum\nselection and did not recognize foreign sanctions laws as a basis for not making payment. As to claims\nagainst the Firm, a Russian court entered judgment against the Firm in one claim in February 2024, which the\nFirm has\n                                                    167                                                     \nappealed in Russia. In separate claims, in April 2024, Russian courts ordered an interim freeze of assets in\nRussia (including funds in bank accounts, securities, shares in authorized capital, and certain trademarks,\nof the named defendants) pending a determination on the underlying claims. Russian courts may rule similarly\nin other cases, including ordering freezes of assets. The Firm challenged the April 2024 freeze orders in\nthe Russian courts and in a New York federal court action, and a Russian court has issued an order\ninstructing the Firm to discontinue the New York action. The value of the current claims and the orders to\nfreeze assets against the Firm exceed the total amount of available assets that the Firm holds in Russia. If\nthe claims are enforced despite the actions taken by the Firm to challenge the claims and orders and to seek\nthe proper application of law, the Firm\u2019s assets in Russia could be seized in full or the Firm could be\nprevented from complying with its obligations. SEC Inquiries . The Firm is responding to requests from the\nSEC regarding aspects of certain advisory programs within J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, including aggregation\nof accounts for billing, discounting advisory fees, and selecting portfolio managers. Separately, the Firm\nis responding to requests from the SEC in connection with the timing of the Firm\u2019s liquidation of shares\ndistributed in-kind to certain investment vehicles that invest in third-party managed private funds. The\nFirm is cooperating with the SEC in regard to both inquires. Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation .\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic\nSecurities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust\nlaw and New York State common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of\nanonymous exchange trading for securities lending transactions. The settlement of this action by the parties\nhas been preliminarily approved, and is subject to final court approval. Shareholder Litigation . Several\nshareholder putative class actions, as well as shareholder derivative actions purporting to act on behalf of\nthe Firm, have been filed against the Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its current and former\nofficers. Certain of these shareholder suits relate to historical trading practices by former employees in\nthe precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct which were the subject of the Firm\u2019s\nresolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary activities that were separately the\nsubject of a resolution between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in November 2020. One of these\nshareholder derivative suits was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in May 2022, asserting\nbreach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims relating to the historical trading practices and\nrelated conduct and fiduciary activities which were the subject of the resolutions described above. In\nDecember 2022, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss this action in full, and in July 2023, the\nplaintiff filed an appeal, which remains pending. A separate shareholder derivative suit was filed in March\n2022 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting state claims of\nbreaches of fiduciary duty and federal claims of violations of federal securities laws based on the alleged\nfailure of the Board of Directors to exercise adequate oversight over the Firm\u2019s compliance with records\npreservation requirements which were the subject of resolutions between certain of the Firm\u2019s subsidiaries\nand the SEC and the CFTC. In March 2024, the Court granted Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the federal claims\nand declined to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining state claims. Trading Venues Investigations . The\nFirm has been responding to government inquiries regarding its processes to inventory trading venues and\nconfirm the completeness of certain data fed to trade surveillance platforms. The Firm self-identified that\ncertain trading and order data through the CIB was not feeding into its trade surveillance platforms. The\nFirm has completed enhancements to the CIB\u2019s venue inventory and data completeness controls, and other\nremediation is underway. The Firm has also performed a review of the data not originally surveilled, which\nis nearly complete, and has not identified any employee misconduct, harm to clients or the market. While the\nidentified gaps represent a fraction of the overall activity across the CIB, the data gap on one venue,\nwhich largely consisted of sponsored client access activity, was significant. The Firm is dedicated to\nmaintaining rigorous controls and continuously enhancing the reliability of its trade infrastructure. In\nMarch 2024, the Firm entered into resolutions with the OCC and the Board of Governors of the FRB that\nrequire the Firm to, among other things, complete its remediation, engage an independent consultant, and pay\naggregate civil penalties of approximately $ 350million. The Firm also expects to enter into a resolution\nwith a third U.S. regulator that will require the Firm to, among other things, pay a civil penalty of $\n100million after offsets for amounts paid to the OCC and FRB. The Firm does not expect any disruption of\nservice to clients as a result of these resolutions. * * * In addition to the various legal proceedings\ndiscussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a\nsubstantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims\nasserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself\nvigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. The Firm has\nestablished reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with\nthe provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it\nis probable\n                                                    168                                                     \nthat such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm\nevaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes\nadjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on management\u2019s best judgment after\nconsultation with counsel. The Firm\u2019s legal expense was $( 72) million and $ 176million for the three months\nended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm\u2019s litigation reserves will\nnot need to be adjusted in the future. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal\nproceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters\npresent novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the\nFirm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the\ntiming of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to\nthose matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with\ncounsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its\ncurrent litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal\nproceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm\u2019s\nconsolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in\nsuch proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly\nexceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational\nconsequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operating\nresults for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability\nimposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s income for that period.\n                                                    169                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n  Note 25 \u2013 Business segments                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are fourmajor reportable business segments \u2013 Consumer & Community\nBanking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there\nis a Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or\nthe type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently\nevaluated by the Firm\u2019s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. As a result\nof the organizational changes announced on January 25, 2024, the Firm will be reorganizing its business\nsegments to reflect the manner in which the segments will be managed. The reorganization of the business\nsegments will be effective in the second quarter of 2024. Refer to Recent events on page 52 of JPMorgan\nChase's 2023 Form 10-K for additional information. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K for a\nfurther discussion of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business segments. Segment results The following table provides a\nsummary of the Firm\u2019s segment results as of or for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, on a\nmanaged basis. The Firm\u2019s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and\nincludes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable\nbusiness segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-\nexempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and\nsecurities. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm\u2019s\nmanaged basis. Capital allocation The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is referred to as\nequity. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are\nreassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change.

The Firm believes that the\nFirst Republic acquisition is complementary to the\nFirm's existing franchises. The acquisition\nresulted in an estimated bargain purchase gain,\nwhich represents the excess of the estimated fair\nvalue of the net assets acquired above the purchase\nprice. The Firm has determined that this\nacquisition constitutes a business combination\nunder U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the initial\nrecognition of the assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed were generally measured at their estimated\nfair values as of May 1, 2023. The determination of\nthose fair values required management to make\ncertain market-based assumptions about expected\nfuture cash flows, discount rates and other\nvaluation inputs at the time of the acquisition.\nThe Firm believes that the fair value estimates of\nthe assets acquired and liabilities assumed provide\na reasonable basis for determining the estimated\nbargain purchase gain. The First Republic\nacquisition resulted in a preliminary estimated\nbargain purchase gain of $ 2.7billion. Adjustments\nto the purchase price and the estimated bargain\npurchase gain may take place up to one year from\nthe acquisition date, as permitted by U.S. GAAP.\nThe Firm is working to conclude the final\nsettlement process with the FDIC.

The\nminimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on\nthe interest rate charged during the introductory\nperiod. This introductory rate is usually\nsignificantly below the fully indexed rate. The\nfully indexed rate is calculated using an index\nrate plus a margin. Once the introductory period\nends, the contractual interest rate charged on the\nloan increases to the fully indexed rate and\nadjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index.\nThe minimum payment is typically insufficient to\ncover interest\n                                                    178                                                     \naccrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest\nis deferred and added to the principal balance of\nthe loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment\nrecast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate\nfully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan\nbalance and anniversary date triggers.\n\nPrime\n\nPrime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with\ngood credit records who meet specific underwriting\nrequirements, including prescriptive requirements\nrelated to income and overall debt levels.

Collateral-\ndependent loans are typically maintained on\nnonaccrual status.\n\nNonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include\nnonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and\ncertain assets acquired in loan satisfactions,\npredominantly real estate owned and other\ncommercial and personal property.\n\nNSFR: Net Stable Funding Ratio\n\nOCC : Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\n\nOCI : Other comprehensive income/(loss)\n\nOPEB : Other postretirement employee benefit\n\nOTC : \u201cOver-the-counter derivatives\u201d: Derivative\ncontracts that are negotiated, executed and settled\nbilaterally between two derivative counterparties,\nwhere one or both counterparties is a derivatives\ndealer.\n\nOTC cleared : \u201cOver-the-counter cleared\nderivatives\u201d: Derivative contracts that are\nnegotiated and executed bilaterally, but\nsubsequently settled via a central clearing house,\nsuch that each derivative counterparty is only\nexposed to the default of that clearing house.\n\nOverhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage\nof total net revenue.\n\nParent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nParticipating securities: represents unvested\nshare-based compensation awards containing\nnonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend\nequivalents (collectively, \u201cdividends\u201d), which are\nincluded in the earnings per share calculation\nusing the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase grants\nrestricted stock and RSUs to certain employees\nunder its share-based compensation programs, which\nentitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable\ndividends during the vesting period on a basis\nequivalent to the dividends paid to holders of\ncommon stock. These unvested awards meet the\ndefinition of participating securities.
