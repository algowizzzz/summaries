JPMorgan Chase & Co. is\na bank holding company (\u201cBHC\u201d) and a financial\nholding company (\u201cFHC\u201d) under U.S. federal law, and\nis subject to comprehensive consolidated\nsupervision, regulation and examination by the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n(the \u201cFederal Reserve\u201d). The Federal Reserve acts\nas the supervisor of the consolidated operations of\nBHCs. Certain of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s subsidiaries are\nalso regulated directly by additional authorities\nbased on the activities or licenses of those\nsubsidiaries.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s national bank subsidiary, JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A., is supervised and regulated by\nthe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\n(\u201cOCC\u201d) and, with respect to certain matters, by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the\n\u201cFDIC\u201d).\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s U.S. broker-dealers are supervised\nand regulated by the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and the Financial Industry\nRegulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d). Subsidiaries of the\nFirm that engage in certain futures-related and\nswaps-related activities are supervised and\nregulated by the Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission (\u201cCFTC\u201d). J.P. Morgan Securities plc is\na U.K.-based bank regulated by the U.K. Prudential\nRegulation Authority (the \u201cPRA\u201d) and the U.K.\nFinancial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d).\n\nJPMSE is a Germany-based credit institution\nregulated by the European Central Bank (\u201cECB\u201d) as\nwell as the local regulators in each of the\ncountries in which it operates. The Firm\u2019s other\nnon-U.S. subsidiaries are regulated by the banking,\nsecurities, prudential and conduct regulatory\nauthorities, as applicable, in the countries in\nwhich they operate.\n\nPermissible business activities . The Bank Holding\nCompany Act restricts BHCs from engaging in\nbusiness activities other than the business of\nbanking and certain closely-related activities.\nFHCs are permitted to engage in a broader range of\nfinancial activities. The Federal Reserve has the\nauthority to limit an FHC\u2019s ability to conduct\notherwise permissible activities if the FHC or any\nof its depository institution subsidiaries ceases\nto meet applicable eligibility requirements. The\nFederal Reserve may also impose corrective capital\nand/or managerial requirements on the FHC, and if\ndeficiencies are persistent, may require\ndivestiture of the FHC\u2019s depository institutions.\nIf any depository institution controlled by an FHC\nfails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the\nCommunity Reinvestment Act, the Federal Reserve\nmust prohibit the FHC and its subsidiaries from\nengaging in any new activities other than\n\nthose permissible for BHCs, or acquiring a company\nengaged in such activities.\n\nCapital and liquidity requirements . The Federal\nReserve establishes capital, liquidity and leverage\nrequirements for JPMorgan Chase that are generally\nconsistent with the international Basel III capital\nand liquidity framework and evaluates the Firm\u2019s\ncompliance with those requirements. The OCC\nestablishes similar requirements for JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. Certain of the Firm\u2019s non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries and branches are also subject to local\ncapital and liquidity requirements.\n\nBanking supervisors globally continue to refine and\nenhance the Basel III capital framework for\nfinancial institutions. U.S. banking regulators\nhave announced their support for the issuance of\nthe Basel III reforms and are considering how to\nappropriately apply such reforms in the U.S.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 and\nLiquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104.\n\nStress tests . As a large BHC, JPMorgan Chase is\nsubject to supervisory stress testing administered\nby the Federal Reserve as part of the Federal\nReserve\u2019s annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and\nReview (\u201cCCAR\u201d) framework. The Firm must conduct\nannual company-run stress tests and must also\nsubmit an annual capital plan to the Federal\nReserve, taking into account the results of\nseparate stress tests designed by the Firm and the\nFederal Reserve. The Federal Reserve uses the\nresults under the severely adverse scenario from\nits supervisory stress test to determine the Firm\u2019s\nStress Capital Buffer (\u201cSCB\u201d) requirement for the\ncoming year, which forms part of the Firm\u2019s\napplicable capital buffers. The Firm is required to\nfile its annual CCAR submission on April 5, 2023.\nThe Federal Reserve will notify the Firm of its\nindicative SCB requirement by June 30, 2023 and\nfinal SCB requirement by August 31, 2023. The\nFirm\u2019s final SCB requirement will become effective\non October 1, 2023. The OCC requires JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. to perform separate, similar stress\ntests annually. The Firm publishes each year the\nresults of the annual stress tests for the Firm and\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. under the supervisory\n\u201cseverely adverse\u201d scenarios provided by the\nFederal Reserve and the OCC.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for\nmore information concerning the Firm\u2019s CCAR.\n\nEnhanced prudential standards . As part of its\nmandate to identify and monitor risks to the\nfinancial stability of the U.S. posed by large\nbanking organizations, the Financial Stability\nOversight Council (\u201cFSOC\u201d) recommends prudential\nstandards and reporting requirements to the Federal\nReserve for systemically important financial\ninstitutions (\u201cSIFIs\u201d), such as JPMorgan Chase. The\nFederal Reserve has adopted several rules to\nimplement those heightened prudential standards,\nincluding rules relating to risk management and\ncorporate governance of subject BHCs. JPMorgan\nChase is required under these rules to comply with\nenhanced liquidity and overall risk\n     \n  4  \n     \nmanagement standards, including oversight by the\nboard of directors of risk management activities.\n\nResolution and recovery . The Firm is required to\nmaintain a comprehensive recovery plan, updated\nannually, summarizing the actions it would take to\nremain well-capitalized and well-funded in order to\navoid failure in the case of an adverse event. In\naddition, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to\nprepare and submit a recovery plan as directed by\nthe OCC. The Firm is required to submit\nperiodically to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a\nplan for resolution in the event of material\ndistress or failure (a \u201cresolution plan\u201d). In 2019,\nthe FDIC and Federal Reserve revised the\nregulations governing resolution plan requirements,\nand on the basis of those revisions, the Firm\u2019s\nresolution plan submissions will alternate between\n\u201ctargeted\u201d and \u201cfull\u201d plans. The Firm\u2019s \u201ctargeted\u201d\nresolution plan was filed on June 28, 2021, and the\nFirm's next \"full\" resolution plan is due to be\nfiled on or before July 1, 2023. JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. is also required to prepare and submit a\nseparate resolution plan as directed by the FDIC on\nor before December 1, 2023.\n\nCertain of the Firm\u2019s non-U.S. subsidiaries and\nbranches are also subject to local resolution and\nrecovery planning requirements.\n\nOrderly liquidation authority . Certain financial\ncompanies, including JPMorgan Chase and certain of\nits subsidiaries, can also be subjected to\nresolution under an \u201corderly liquidation\nauthority.\u201d The U.S. Treasury Secretary, in\nconsultation with the President of the United\nStates, must first make certain determinations\nconcerning extraordinary financial distress and\nsystemic risk, and action must be recommended by\nthe FDIC and the Federal Reserve. Absent such\nactions, the Firm, as a BHC, would remain subject\nto resolution under the Bankruptcy Code. The FDIC\nhas issued a draft policy statement describing its\n\u201csingle point of entry\u201d strategy for resolution of\nSIFIs under the orderly liquidation authority,\nwhich seeks to keep operating subsidiaries of a BHC\nopen and impose losses on shareholders and\ncreditors of the BHC in receivership according to\ntheir statutory order of priority.\n\nHolding company as a source of strength. JPMorgan\nChase & Co. is required to serve as a source of\nfinancial strength for its depository institution\nsubsidiaries and to commit resources to support\nthose subsidiaries, including when directed to do\nso by the Federal Reserve.\n\nRegulation of acquisitions . Acquisitions by BHCs\nand their banks are subject to requirements,\nlimitations and prohibitions established by law and\nby the Federal Reserve and the OCC. For example,\nFHCs and BHCs are required to obtain the approval\nof the Federal Reserve before they acquire more\nthan 5% of the voting shares of an unaffiliated\nbank. In addition, acquisitions by financial\ncompanies are prohibited if, as a result of the\nacquisition, the total liabilities of the financial\ncompany would exceed 10% of the total liabilities\nof all financial companies. Furthermore, for\ncertain acquisitions, the Firm must\n\nprovide written notice to the Federal Reserve prior\nto acquiring direct or indirect ownership or\ncontrol of any voting shares of any company with\nover $10 billion in assets that is engaged in\nactivities that are \u201cfinancial in nature.\u201d\nMoreover, while FHCs may engage in a broader range\nof activities (including acquisitions) than BHCs,\nthe Federal Reserve has the authority to limit an\nFHC\u2019s ability to conduct otherwise permissible\nacquisitions if the FHC or any of its depository\ninstitution subsidiaries ceases to meet applicable\neligibility requirements.\n\nOngoing obligations . The Firm is subject to\nobligations under the terms of a Deferred\nProsecution Agreement entered into with the\nDepartment of Justice on September 29, 2020\nrelating to precious metals and U.S. Treasuries\nmarkets investigations as well as under a related\norder issued by the CFTC.\n\nSubsidiary banks:\n\nThe activities of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the\nFirm\u2019s principal subsidiary bank, are limited to\nthose specifically authorized under the National\nBank Act and related interpretations of the OCC.\nThe OCC has authority to bring an enforcement\naction against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. for unsafe\nor unsound banking practices, which could include\nlimiting JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s ability to\nconduct otherwise permissible activities, or\nimposing corrective capital or managerial\nrequirements on the bank.\n\nFDIC deposit insurance. The FDIC deposit insurance\nfund provides insurance coverage for certain\ndeposits and is funded through assessments on\nbanks, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\n\nFDIC powers upon a bank insolvency. Upon any\ninsolvency of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the FDIC\ncould be appointed as conservator or receiver under\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The FDIC has\nbroad powers to transfer assets and liabilities\nwithout the approval of the institution\u2019s\ncreditors.\n\nPrompt corrective action. The Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991\nrequires the relevant federal banking regulator to\ntake \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d with respect to a\ndepository institution if that institution does not\nmeet certain capital adequacy standards. The\nFederal Reserve is also authorized to take\nappropriate action against the parent BHC, such as\nJPMorgan Chase & Co., based on the undercapitalized\nstatus of any bank subsidiary. In certain\ninstances, the BHC would be required to guarantee\nthe performance of the capital restoration plan for\nits undercapitalized subsidiary.\n\nOCC Heightened Standards. The OCC has established\nguidelines setting forth heightened standards for\nlarge banks, including minimum standards for the\ndesign and implementation of a risk governance\nframework for banks. Under these standards, a\nbank\u2019s risk governance framework must ensure that\nthe bank\u2019s risk profile is easily distinguished and\nseparate from that of its parent BHC for risk\nmanagement purposes.

These\nrestrictions prevent JPMorgan Chase & Co. and other\naffiliates from borrowing from such subsidiaries\nunless the loans are secured in specified amounts\nand comply with certain other requirements.\n\nDividend restrictions. Federal law imposes\nlimitations on the payment of dividends by national\nbanks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Refer to\nNote 26 for the amount of dividends that JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. could pay, at January 1, 2023, to\nJPMorgan Chase without the approval of the banking\nregulators. The OCC and the Federal Reserve also\nhave authority to prohibit or limit the payment of\ndividends of a bank subsidiary that they supervise\nif, in the banking regulator\u2019s opinion, payment of\na dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound\npractice in light of the financial condition of the\nbank.\n\nDepositor preference. Under federal law, the claims\nof a receiver of an insured depositary institution\n(\u201cIDI\u201d) for administrative expense and the claims\nof holders of U.S. deposit liabilities (including\nthe FDIC and deposits in non-U.S. branches that are\ndually payable in the U.S. and in a non-U.S.\nbranch) have priority over the claims of other\nunsecured creditors of the institution, including\ndepositors in non-U.S. branches and public\nnoteholders.\n\nConsumer supervision and regulation. JPMorgan Chase\nand JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. are subject to\nsupervision and regulation by the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) with respect\nto federal consumer protection laws, including laws\nrelating to fair lending and the prohibition of\nunfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in\nconnection with the offer, sale or provision of\nconsumer financial products and services. The CFPB\nalso has jurisdiction over small business lending\nactivities with respect to fair lending and the\nEqual Credit Opportunity Act. As part of its\nregulatory oversight, the CFPB has authority to\ntake enforcement actions against firms that offer\ncertain products and services to consumers using\npractices that are deemed to be unfair, deceptive\nor abusive. In February 2023, the CFPB proposed a\nrule that would significantly reduce and limit the\nlate payment fees that credit card issuers,\nincluding the Firm, would be permitted to charge to\ncustomers. The Firm\u2019s consumer activities are also\nsubject to regulation under state statutes which\nare enforced by the Attorney General or empowered\nagency of each state.\n\nIn the U.K., the Firm operates a retail bank\nthrough J.P. Morgan Europe Limited (\u201cJPMEL\u201d) and\nprovides retail investment management services\nthrough Nutmeg Saving\n\nand Investment Limited (\u201cNutmeg\u201d).

MiFID II also\nsignificantly enhanced requirements for pre- and\npost-trade transparency, transaction reporting and\ninvestor protection, and introduced a position\nlimits and reporting regime for commodities. In\nNovember 2021, the European Commission (\u201cEC\u201d)\npublished a draft legislative proposal for\namendments to MiFID II focused on changes to rules\nrelated to transparency and market structure,\nincluding the proposed creation of a consolidated\ntape intended to increase transparency into trading\nacross the EU by providing a centralized source of\nmarket data. This legislation remains subject to\nreview by the European Parliament and European\nCouncil.\n\nIn the U.K., MiFID II is being amended through the\n\u201cWholesale Markets Review\u201d, a set of proposals\ndesigned to streamline and improve regulation of\nthe U.K. secondary markets following the U.K.\u2019s\ndeparture from the EU. Some of the changes, such as\nthe removal of the requirement to execute trades in\nshares on certain trading venues, have been\nintroduced through the Financial Services and\nMarkets Bill (\u201cFSMB\u201d), which is expected to be\npassed by the U.K. Parliament in the first half of\n2023. Other changes, such as amendments to MiFID II\nrules related to transparency, will be subject to\nfurther consultation, which is expected during\n2023.\n     \n  7  \n     \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                                                  \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\nIn December 2022, the EC published a legislative\nproposal to amend EMIR to increase the\ncompetitiveness of the EU central clearing\nframework and to enhance supervision of EU central\ncounterparties (\u201cCCPs\u201d). These proposals are\nsubject to further review by the European\nParliament and European Council .\n\nThe EU has adopted mandatory buy-in rules under the\nCentral Securities Depositories Regulation (\u201cCSDR\u201d)\nwhich will impose requirements relating to sourcing\nof securities in the event of a settlement fail. In\nJune 2022, EU regulators proposed an amendment to\npostpone the application of these rules until\nNovember 2025. The amendment remains subject to\nreview by the European Parliament and European\nCouncil.\n\nIn December 2022, the Chancellor of the Exchequer\nannounced an extensive package of reforms to U.K.\nfinancial services regulation known as the\n\u201cEdinburgh Reforms\u201d. These reforms aim to drive\ngrowth and competitiveness in the U.K. financial\nservices sector following the U.K.\u2019s departure from\nthe EU. The reform package includes initiatives\nrelating to a number of areas of financial services\npolicy, including retail banks, payments, markets,\ndigital assets and sustainable finance. The U.K.\nGovernment and regulators are expected to release\nfurther consultations and announcements related to\nthese reforms in 2023.\n\nEU and U.K. regulators are expected to finalize the\nrules implementing the Basel III framework during\n2023. The Firm\u2019s banking entities in the EU and the\nU.K. will be required to comply with the Basel III\nfinal rules by January 2025, allowing for certain\ntransitional arrangements until 2030 and 2032,\nrespectively. The main changes implemented by the\nBasel III final rules will be revisions to the\ncredit risk and operational risk calculation\nmethods to reduce the use of and reliance on\ninternal modelling approaches and introduce\ninternationally-agreed changes to the market risk\nframework. The EU Basel III final rules also\nstrengthen enforcement tools for supervisors\noverseeing EU banks and require EU banking entities\nto systematically identify, disclose and manage\nenvironmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) risks\nas part of their risk management practices. In\naddition, in December 2022, the European Banking\nAuthority (\u201cEBA\u201d) announced that it will publish\nrules and technical standards between 2023 and 2025\nrelated to sustainable finance, which will be\napplicable to EU banks. The Firm\u2019s banking entities\nin the U.K. will be required to comply with\nregulatory policies and standards related to\nclimate risk being developed by the PRA. In\naddition, EU legislation requires that certain non-\nEU banks operating in the EU establish an\nintermediate parent undertaking (\u201cIPU\u201d) located in\nthe EU. The IPU legislation allows a second IPU to\nbe established if a single IPU would conflict with\n\u201chome country\u201d bank separation rules or impede\nresolvability. The Firm will be required to comply\nwith the EU\u2019s IPU requirements by December 30,\n2023.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s banking entities in the EU and U.K. are\nalso subject to supervisory expectations published\nby the ECB\n\nand the PRA, respectively, for management of\nfinancial risks arising from climate change and the\nincreasing operational reliance on IT systems,\nthird-party services and innovative technologies,\nas well as supervisory expectations for operational\nresilience and resilience from macro-financial and\ngeopolitical shocks. These expectations address\nbank strategy, governance, risk management,\nscenario analysis, risk reporting and disclosure.\n\nPolicymakers in the EU have continued to implement\nsustainability-related initiatives. In December\n2022, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting\nDirective (\u201cCSRD\u201d) was published in the Official\nJournal of the EU. The CSRD will replace and\nsignificantly expand the scope and content of ESG\nreporting requirements under the EU\u2019s existing ESG\nreporting rules. CSRD reporting requirements will\nbe phased in beginning in 2024. In addition, the EC\npublished its legislative proposal on the Corporate\nSustainability Due Diligence Directive (\u201cCSDDD\u201d) in\nFebruary 2022. The draft directive sets mandatory\ndue diligence obligations for companies to address\nactual and potential human rights violations and\nenvironmental adverse impacts stemming from their\nown operations and business relationships,\nincluding the activities of companies with which\nthey have established business relationships. The\nproposed legislation may also require the adoption\nof company-specific climate-related transition\nplans. The CSDDD is currently subject to review by\nthe European Parliament and European Council. Both\nthe CSRD and CSDDD will apply to certain of the\nFirm\u2019s EU entities as well as to certain non-EU\nentities.\n     \n  8  \n     \n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                                                                                          \u2502\n\u2502  Item 1A.

JPMorgan Chase must comply\nwith the laws, rules and regulations that apply to\nits operations in all of the jurisdictions around\nthe world in which it does business, and financial\nservices firms such as JPMorgan Chase are subject\nto extensive regulation and supervision.\n\nThe regulation and supervision of JPMorgan Chase\nsignificantly affects the way that it conducts its\nbusiness and structures its operations, and\nJPMorgan Chase could be required to make changes to\nits business and operations in response to\nsupervisory expectations or decisions or to new or\nchanged laws, rules and regulations. These types of\ndevelopments could result in JPMorgan Chase\nincurring additional costs in connection with\ncomplying with applicable laws, rules and\nregulations, which could reduce its profitability.\nFurthermore, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s entry into or\nacquisition of a new business or an increase in its\nprincipal investments may require JPMorgan Chase to\ncomply with additional laws, rules, and\nregulations.\n\nIn response to new and existing laws, rules and\nregulations and expanded supervision, JPMorgan\nChase has in the past been and could in the future\nbe, required to:\n\n\u2022 limit the products and services that it offers\n\n\u2022 reduce the liquidity that it can provide through\nits market-making activities\n\n\u2022 refrain from engaging in business opportunities\nthat it might otherwise pursue\n\n\u2022 pay higher taxes (including as part of any\nminimum global tax regime), assessments, levies or\nother governmental charges, including in connection\nwith the resolution of tax examinations\n\n\u2022 incur losses, including with respect to\nfraudulent transactions perpetrated against its\ncustomers\n\n\u2022 dispose of certain assets, and do so at times or\nprices that are disadvantageous\n\n\u2022 impose restrictions on certain business\nactivities, or\n\n\u2022 increase the prices that it charges for products\nand services, which could reduce the demand for\nthem.\n\nAny failure by JPMorgan Chase to comply with the\nlaws, rules and regulations to which it is subject\ncould result in:\n\n\u2022 increased regulatory and supervisory scrutiny\n\n\u2022 regulatory and governmental enforcement actions\n\n\u2022 the imposition of fines, penalties or other\nsanctions\n\n\u2022 increased exposure to litigation, or\n\n\u2022 harm to its reputation.\n\nDifferences and inconsistencies in financial\nservices regulation can negatively impact JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s businesses, operations and financial\nresults.\n\nThe content and application of laws, rules and\nregulations affecting financial services firms\nsometimes vary according to factors such as the\nsize of the firm, the jurisdiction in which it is\norganized or operates, and other criteria. For\nexample:\n\n\u2022 larger firms such as JPMorgan Chase are often\nsubject to more stringent supervision, regulation\nand regulatory scrutiny\n\n\u2022 financial technology companies and other non-\ntraditional competitors may not be subject to\nbanking regulation, or may be supervised by a\nnational or state regulatory agency that does not\nhave the same resources or regulatory priorities as\nthe regulatory agencies which supervise more\ndiversified financial services firms, or\n\n\u2022 the financial services regulatory framework in a\nparticular jurisdiction may favor financial\ninstitutions that are based in that jurisdiction.\n\nThese types of differences in the regulatory\nframework can result in JPMorgan Chase losing\nmarket share to competitors that are less regulated\nor not subject to regulation, especially with\nrespect to unregulated financial products.\n\nThere can also be significant differences in the\nways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting\nthe financial services industry are implemented in\nthe U.S. and in other countries and regions in\nwhich JPMorgan Chase does business. For\n      \n  10  \n      \nexample, when adopting rules that are intended to\nimplement a global regulatory standard, a national\nregulator may introduce additional or more\nrestrictive requirements, which can create\ncompetitive disadvantages for financial services\nfirms, such as JPMorgan Chase, that may be subject\nto those enhanced regulations.\n\nIn addition, certain national and multi-national\nbodies and governmental agencies outside the U.S.\nhave adopted laws, rules or regulations that may\nconflict with or prohibit JPMorgan Chase from\ncomplying with laws, rules and regulations to which\nit is otherwise subject, creating conflict of law\nissues that also increase its risks of non-\ncompliance in those jurisdictions.\n\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives outside the\nU.S. could require JPMorgan Chase to make\nsignificant modifications to its operations and\nlegal entity structure in the relevant countries or\nregions in order to comply with those requirements.\nThese include laws, rules and regulations that have\nbeen adopted or proposed relating to:\n\n\u2022 the establishment of locally-based intermediate\nholding companies or operating subsidiaries\n\n\u2022 requirements to maintain minimum amounts of\ncapital or liquidity in locally-based subsidiaries\n\n\u2022 to implement processes within locally-based\nsubsidiaries to comply with local regulatory\nrequirements\n\n\u2022 the separation (or \u201cring fencing\u201d) of core\nbanking products and services from markets\nactivities\n\n\u2022 the resolution of financial institutions\n\n\u2022 requirements for executing or settling\ntransactions on exchanges or through central\ncounterparties (\u201cCCPs\u201d)\n\n\u2022 position limits and reporting rules for\nderivatives\n\n\u2022 governance and accountability regimes\n\n\u2022 conduct of business and control requirements, and\n\n\u2022 restrictions on compensation.\n\nThese types of differences, inconsistencies and\nconflicts in financial services regulation have\nrequired and could in the future require JPMorgan\nChase to:\n\n\u2022 divest assets or restructure its operations\n\n\u2022 absorb increased capital and liquidity costs\n\n\u2022 incur higher operational and compliance costs\n\n\u2022 change the prices that it charges for its\nproducts and services\n\n\u2022 curtail the products and services that it offers\nto its customers and clients\n\n\u2022 curtail other business opportunities, including\nacquisitions or principal investments, that it\notherwise would have pursued\n\n\u2022 become subject to regulatory fines, penalties or\nother sanctions, or\n\n\u2022 incur higher costs for complying with different\nlegal and regulatory frameworks.\n\nAny or all of these factors could harm JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s ability to compete against other firms that\nare not subject to the same laws, rules and\nregulations or supervisory oversight, or harm\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses, results of operations\nand profitability.\n\nResolving regulatory investigations can subject\nJPMorgan Chase to significant penalties and\ncollateral consequences, and could result in higher\ncompliance costs or restrictions on its operations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase is subject to heightened oversight\nand scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many\njurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase has paid significant\nfines, provided other monetary relief, incurred\nother penalties and experienced other repercussions\nin connection with resolving investigations and\nenforcement actions by governmental agencies.\nJPMorgan Chase could become subject to similar\nregulatory or governmental resolutions or other\nactions in the future, and addressing the\nrequirements of any such resolutions or actions\ncould result in JPMorgan Chase incurring higher\noperational and compliance costs, including\ndevoting substantial resources to the required\nremediation, or needing to comply with other\nrestrictions.\n\nIn connection with resolving specific regulatory\ninvestigations or enforcement actions, certain\nregulators have required JPMorgan Chase and other\nfinancial institutions to admit wrongdoing with\nrespect to the activities that gave rise to the\nresolution. These types of admissions can lead to:\n\n\u2022 greater exposure in litigation\n\n\u2022 damage to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation\n\n\u2022 disqualification from doing business with certain\nclients or customers, or in specific jurisdictions,\nor\n\n\u2022 other direct and indirect adverse effects.\n\nFurthermore, U.S. government officials have\ndemonstrated a willingness to bring criminal\nactions against financial institutions and have\nrequired that institutions plead guilty to criminal\noffenses or admit other wrongdoing in connection\nwith resolving regulatory investigations or\nenforcement actions. Resolutions of this type can\nhave significant collateral consequences for the\nsubject financial institution, including:\n\n\u2022 loss of clients, customers and business\n\n\u2022 restrictions on offering certain products or\nservices, and\n\n\u2022 losing permission to operate certain businesses,\neither temporarily or permanently.\n\nJPMorgan Chase expects that:\n      \n  11  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                                                  \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\n\u2022 it and other financial services firms will\ncontinue to be subject to heightened regulatory\nscrutiny and governmental investigations and\nenforcement actions\n\n\u2022 governmental authorities will continue to require\nthat financial institutions be penalized for actual\nor deemed violations of law with formal and\npunitive enforcement actions, including the\nimposition of significant monetary and other\nsanctions, rather than resolving these matters\nthrough informal supervisory actions; and\n\n\u2022 governmental authorities will be more likely to\npursue formal enforcement actions and resolutions\nagainst JPMorgan Chase to the extent that it has\npreviously been subject to other governmental\ninvestigations or enforcement actions.\n\nIf JPMorgan Chase fails to meet the requirements of\nany resolution of a governmental investigation or\nenforcement action, or to maintain risk and control\nprocesses that meet the heightened standards and\nexpectations of its regulators, it could be\nrequired to, among other things:\n\n\u2022 enter into further resolutions of investigations\nor enforcement actions\n\n\u2022 pay additional regulatory penalties or enter into\njudgments, or\n\n\u2022 accept material regulatory restrictions on, or\nchanges in the management of, its businesses.\n\nIn these circumstances, JPMorgan Chase could also\nbecome subject to other sanctions, or to\nprosecution or civil litigation with respect to the\nconduct that gave rise to an investigation or\nenforcement action.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations and financial results\ncan be negatively impacted in countries with less\npredictable legal and regulatory frameworks .\n\nJPMorgan Chase conducts existing and new business\nin certain countries in which the application of\nthe rule of law is inconsistent or less\npredictable, including with respect to:\n\n\u2022 the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or\nguidance for engaging in specific types of business\nor transactions\n\n\u2022 conflicting or ambiguous laws, rules and\nregulations, or the inconsistent application or\ninterpretation of existing laws, rules and\nregulations\n\n\u2022 uncertainty concerning the enforceability of\ncontractual, intellectual property or other\nobligations\n\n\u2022 difficulty in competing in economies in which the\ngovernment controls or protects all or a portion of\nthe local economy or specific businesses, or where\ngraft or corruption may be pervasive\n\n\u2022 the threat of regulatory investigations, civil\nlitigations or criminal prosecutions that are\narbitrary or otherwise contrary to established\nlegal principles in other parts of the world, and\n\n\u2022 the termination of licenses required to operate\nin the local market or the suspension of business\nrelationships with governmental bodies.\n\nIf the application of the laws, rules and\nregulations in any country is susceptible to\nproducing inconsistent or unexpected outcomes, this\ncan create a more difficult environment in which\nJPMorgan Chase conducts its business and could\nnegatively affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations and\nreduce its earnings with respect to that country.\nFor example, conducting business could require\nJPMorgan Chase to devote significant additional\nresources to understanding, and monitoring changes\nin, local laws, rules and regulations, as well as\nstructuring its operations to comply with local\nlaws, rules and regulations and implementing and\nadministering related internal policies and\nprocedures.\n\nThere can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase will\nalways be successful in its efforts to fully\nunderstand and to conduct its business in\ncompliance with the laws, rules and regulations of\nall of the jurisdictions in which it operates, and\nthe risk of non-compliance can be greater in\ncountries that have less predictable legal and\nregulatory frameworks.\n\nRequirements for the orderly resolution of JPMorgan\nChase could result in JPMorgan Chase having to\nrestructure or reorganize its businesses and could\nincrease its funding or operational costs or\ncurtail its businesses.\n\nJPMorgan Chase is required under Federal Reserve\nand FDIC rules to prepare and submit periodically\nto those agencies a detailed plan for rapid and\norderly resolution in bankruptcy, without\nextraordinary government support, in the event of\nmaterial financial distress or failure. The\nagencies\u2019 evaluation of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s resolution\nplan may change, and the requirements for\nresolution plans may be modified from time to time.\nAny such determinations or modifications could\nresult in JPMorgan Chase needing to make changes to\nits legal entity structure or to certain internal\nor external activities, which could increase its\nfunding or operational costs, or hamper its ability\nto serve clients and customers.\n\nIf the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were both to\ndetermine that a resolution plan submitted by\nJPMorgan Chase has deficiencies, they could jointly\nimpose more stringent capital, leverage or\nliquidity requirements or restrictions on JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s growth, activities or operations. The\nagencies could also require that JPMorgan Chase\nrestructure, reorganize or divest assets or\nbusinesses in ways that could materially and\nadversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations and\nstrategy.\n\nHolders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s debt and equity\nsecurities will absorb losses if it were to enter\ninto a resolution.\n\nFederal Reserve rules require that JPMorgan Chase &\nCo. (the \u201cParent Company\u201d) maintain minimum levels\nof unsecured external long-term debt and other\nloss-\n      \n  12  \n      \nabsorbing capacity with specific terms (\u201celigible\nLTD\u201d) for purposes of recapitalizing JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s operating subsidiaries if the Parent\nCompany were to enter into a resolution either:\n\n\u2022 in a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of\nthe U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or\n\n\u2022 in a receivership administered by the FDIC under\nTitle II of the Dodd-Frank Act (\u201cTitle II\u201d).\n\nIf the Parent Company were to enter into a\nresolution, holders of eligible LTD and other debt\nand equity securities of the Parent Company will\nabsorb the losses of the Parent Company and its\nsubsidiaries.\n\nThe preferred \u201csingle point of entry\u201d strategy\nunder JPMorgan Chase\u2019s resolution plan contemplates\nthat only the Parent Company would enter bankruptcy\nproceedings. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s subsidiaries would be\nrecapitalized, as needed, so that they could\ncontinue normal operations or subsequently be\ndivested or wound down in an orderly manner. As a\nresult, the Parent Company\u2019s losses and any losses\nincurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first\non holders of the Parent Company\u2019s equity\nsecurities and thereafter on its unsecured\ncreditors, including holders of eligible LTD and\nother debt securities. Claims of holders of those\nsecurities would have a junior position to the\nclaims of creditors of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nsubsidiaries and to the claims of priority (as\ndetermined by statute) and secured creditors of the\nParent Company.\n\nAccordingly, in a resolution of the Parent Company\nin bankruptcy, holders of eligible LTD and other\ndebt securities of the Parent Company would realize\nvalue only to the extent available to the Parent\nCompany as a shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. and its other subsidiaries, and only after any\nclaims of priority and secured creditors of the\nParent Company have been fully repaid.\n\nThe FDIC has similarly indicated that a single\npoint of entry recapitalization model could be a\ndesirable strategy to resolve a systemically\nimportant financial institution, such as the Parent\nCompany, under Title II. However, the FDIC has not\nformally adopted a single point of entry resolution\nstrategy.\n\nIf the Parent Company were to approach, or enter\ninto, a resolution, none of the Parent Company, the\nFederal Reserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s preferred resolution strategy, and\nlosses to holders of eligible LTD and other debt\nand equity securities of the Parent Company, under\nwhatever strategy is ultimately followed, could be\ngreater than they might have been under JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s preferred strategy.\n                                                                                                            \n  Political                                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \nEconomic uncertainty or instability caused by\npolitical developments can negatively impact\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses.\n\nPolitical developments in the U.S. and other\ncountries can cause uncertainty in the economic\nenvironment and market conditions in which JPMorgan\nChase operates its businesses. Certain governmental\npolicy initiatives, as well as heightened\ngeopolitical tensions, could significantly affect\nU.S. and global economic growth and cause higher\nvolatility in the financial markets, including:\n\n\u2022 monetary policies and actions taken by the\nFederal Reserve and other central banks or\ngovernmental authorities, including any sustained\nlarge-scale asset purchases or any suspension or\nreversal of those actions\n\n\u2022 fiscal policies, including with respect to\ntaxation and spending\n\n\u2022 actions that governments take or fail to take in\nresponse to the effects of health emergencies, the\nspread of infectious diseases, epidemics or\npandemics, as well as the effectiveness of any\nactions taken\n\n\u2022 governmental actions or initiatives relating to\nclimate risk, or more generally, the impact of\nbusiness activities on environmental, social and\ngovernance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters, and the management of\nclimate and ESG-related

political developments, and\nuncertainty about the possible outcomes of these\ndevelopments, could:\n\n\u2022 erode investor confidence in the U.S. economy and\nfinancial markets, which could potentially\nundermine the status of the U.S. dollar as a safe\nhaven currency\n\n\u2022 provoke retaliatory countermeasures by other\ncountries and otherwise heighten tensions in\nregulatory,

or\n\n\u2022 other market dislocations, including the spread\nof unfavorable economic conditions from a\nparticular country or region to other countries or\nregions.\n\nAny of these potential outcomes could cause\nJPMorgan Chase to suffer losses on its market-\nmaking positions or in its investment portfolio,\nreduce its liquidity and capital levels, increase\nthe allowance for credit losses or lead to higher\nnet charge offs, hamper its ability to deliver\nproducts and services to its clients and customers,\nand weaken its results of operations and financial\ncondition.\n\nJPMorgan Chase's business and results of operations\nmay also be adversely affected by actions or\ninitiatives by national, state or local\ngovernmental authorities that:\n\n\u2022 seek to discourage financial institutions from\ndoing business with companies engaged in certain\nindustries, or conversely, to penalize financial\ninstitutions that elect not to do business with\nsuch companies, or\n\n\u2022 mandate specific business practices that\ncompanies operating in the relevant jurisdiction\nmust adopt.\n\nBecause governmental policies in one jurisdiction\nmay differ or conflict with those in other\njurisdictions, JPMorgan Chase may face negative\nconsequences regardless of the course of action it\ntakes or elects not to take, including:\n\n\u2022 restrictions or prohibitions on doing business\nwithin a particular jurisdiction, or with\ngovernmental entities in a jurisdiction\n\n\u2022 the threat of enforcement actions, including\nunder antitrust or other anti-competition laws,\nrules and regulations, and\n\n\u2022 harm to its reputation arising from public\ncriticism, including from politicians, activists\nand other stakeholders.\n\nIn addition, JPMorgan Chase's relationships or\nability to transact with clients and customers, and\nwith governmental or regulatory bodies in\njurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase does\nbusiness, could be adversely affected if its\ndecisions with respect to doing business with\ncompanies in certain sensitive industries are\nperceived to harm those companies or to align with\nparticular political viewpoints. Furthermore,\nJPMorgan Chase's participation in or association\nwith certain social and environmental industry\ngroups or initiatives could be viewed by activists\nor governmental authorities as boycotting or other\ndiscriminatory business behavior.\n                                                                                                            \n  Market                                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nEconomic and market events and conditions can\nmaterially affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses and\ninvestment and market-making positions.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s results of operations can be\nnegatively affected by adverse changes in any of\nthe following:\n\n\u2022 investor, consumer and business sentiment\n\n\u2022 events that reduce confidence in the financial\nmarkets\n\n\u2022 inflation, deflation or recession\n\n\u2022 high unemployment or, conversely, a tightening\nlabor market\n\n\u2022 the availability and cost of capital, liquidity\nand credit\n\n\u2022 levels and volatility of interest rates, credit\nspreads and market prices for currencies, equities\nand commodities, and the duration of any changes in\nlevels or volatility\n\n\u2022 the economic effects of an outbreak or escalation\nof hostilities, terrorism or other geopolitical\ninstabilities, cyber attacks, climate change,\nnatural disasters, severe weather conditions,\nhealth emergencies, the spread of infectious\ndiseases, epidemics or pandemics or other\nextraordinary events beyond JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\ncontrol, and\n\n\u2022 the strength of the U.S. and global economies.\n\nAll of these are affected by global economic,\nmarket and political events and conditions, as well\nas regulatory restrictions.\n      \n  14  \n      \nIn addition, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s investment portfolio\nand market-making businesses can suffer losses due\nto unanticipated market events, including:\n\n\u2022 severe declines in asset values\n\n\u2022 unexpected credit events\n\n\u2022 unforeseen events or conditions that may cause\npreviously uncorrelated factors to become\ncorrelated (and vice versa)\n\n\u2022 the inability to effectively hedge market and\nother risks related to market-making and investment\nportfolio positions, or\n\n\u2022 other market risks that may not have been\nappropriately taken into account in the\ndevelopment, structuring or pricing of a financial\ninstrument.\n\nIf JPMorgan Chase experiences significant losses in\nits investment portfolio or from market-making\nactivities, this could reduce JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nprofitability and its liquidity and capital levels,\nand thereby constrain the growth of its businesses.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer businesses can be\nnegatively affected by adverse economic conditions\nand governmental policies.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer businesses are\nparticularly affected by U.S. and global economic\nconditions, including:\n\n\u2022 personal and household income distribution\n\n\u2022 unemployment or underemployment\n\n\u2022 prolonged periods of exceptionally low or high\ninterest rates\n\n\u2022 housing prices\n\n\u2022 the level of inflation and its effect on prices\nfor goods and services\n\n\u2022 consumer and small business confidence levels,\nand\n\n\u2022 changes in consumer spending or in the level of\nconsumer debt.\n\nHeightened levels of unemployment or\nunderemployment that result in reduced personal and\nhousehold income could negatively affect consumer\ncredit performance to the extent that consumers are\nless able to service their debts. In addition,\nsustained low growth, low or negative interest\nrates, inflationary pressures or recessionary\nconditions could diminish customer demand for the\nproducts and services offered by JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nconsumer businesses.\n\nAdverse economic conditions could also lead to an\nincrease in delinquencies, additions to the\nallowance for credit losses and higher net charge-\noffs, which can reduce JPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings.\nThese consequences could be significantly worse in\ncertain geographies and industry segments where\ndeclining industrial or manufacturing activity has\nresulted in or could result in higher levels of\nunemployment, or where high levels of consumer\ndebt, such as outstanding\n\nstudent loans, could impair the ability of\ncustomers to pay their other consumer loan\nobligations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings from its consumer\nbusinesses could also be adversely affected by\ngovernmental policies and actions that affect\nconsumers, including:\n\n\u2022 policies and initiatives relating to medical\ninsurance, education, immigration, employment\nstatus and housing, and\n\n\u2022 policies aimed at the economy more broadly, such\nas higher taxes and increased regulation which\ncould result in reductions in consumer disposable\nincome.\n\nUnfavorable market and economic conditions can have\nan adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s wholesale\nbusinesses.\n\nIn JPMorgan Chase\u2019s wholesale businesses, market\nand economic factors can affect the volume of\ntransactions that JPMorgan Chase executes for its\nclients or for which it advises clients, and,\ntherefore, the revenue that JPMorgan Chase receives\nfrom those transactions. These factors can also\ninfluence the willingness of other financial\ninstitutions and investors to participate in\ncapital markets transactions that JPMorgan Chase\nmanages, such as loan syndications or securities\nunderwriting. Furthermore, if a significant and\nsustained deterioration in market conditions were\nto occur, the profitability of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\ncapital markets businesses, including its loan\nsyndication, securities underwriting and leveraged\nlending activities, could be reduced to the extent\nthat those businesses:\n\n\u2022 earn less fee revenue due to lower transaction\nvolumes, including when clients are unwilling or\nunable to refinance their outstanding debt\nobligations in unfavorable market conditions, or\n\n\u2022 dispose of portions of credit commitments at a\nloss, or hold larger residual positions in credit\ncommitments that cannot be sold at favorable\nprices.\n\nAn adverse change in market conditions in\nparticular segments of the economy, such as a\nsudden and severe downturn in oil and gas prices or\nan increase in commodity prices, or sustained\nchanges in consumer behavior that affect specific\neconomic sectors, could have a material adverse\neffect on clients of JPMorgan Chase whose\noperations or financial condition are directly or\nindirectly dependent on the health or stability of\nthose market segments or economic sectors, as well\nas clients that are engaged in related businesses.\nJPMorgan Chase could incur credit losses on its\nloans and other credit commitments to clients that\noperate in, or are dependent on, any sector of the\neconomy that is under stress.\n\nThe fees that JPMorgan Chase earns from managing\nclient assets or holding assets under custody for\nclients could be diminished by declining asset\nvalues or other adverse macroeconomic conditions.\nFor example, higher interest rates or a downturn in\nfinancial markets could affect the valuations of\nclient assets that JPMorgan Chase manages or\n      \n  15  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                                                  \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\nholds under custody, which, in turn, could affect\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s revenue from fees that are based\non the amount of assets under management or\ncustody. Similarly, adverse macroeconomic or market\nconditions could prompt outflows from JPMorgan\nChase funds or accounts, or cause clients to invest\nin products that generate lower revenue.\nSubstantial and unexpected withdrawals from a\nJPMorgan Chase fund can also hamper the investment\nperformance of the fund, particularly if the\noutflows create the need for the fund to dispose of\nfund assets at disadvantageous times or prices, and\ncould lead to further withdrawals based on the\nweaker investment performance.\n\nAn economic downturn or sustained changes in\nconsumer behavior that results in shifts in\nconsumer and business spending could also have a\nnegative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nwholesale clients, and thereby diminish JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s earnings from its wholesale operations. For\nexample, the businesses of certain of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s wholesale clients are dependent on\nconsistent streams of rental income from commercial\nreal estate properties which are owned or being\nbuilt by those clients. Sustained adverse economic\nconditions could result in reductions in the rental\ncash flows that owners or developers receive from\ntheir tenants which, in turn, could depress the\nvalues of the properties and impair the ability of\nborrowers to service or refinance their commercial\nreal estate loans. These consequences could result\nin JPMorgan Chase experiencing increases in the\nallowance for credit losses, higher delinquencies,\ndefaults and charge-offs within its commercial real\nestate loan portfolio and incurring higher costs\nfor servicing a larger volume of delinquent loans\nin that portfolio, thereby reducing JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s earnings from its wholesale businesses.\n\nChanges in interest rates and credit spreads can\nadversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings, its\nliquidity or its capital levels.\n\nWhen interest rates are high or increasing,\nJPMorgan Chase can generally be expected to earn\nhigher net interest income. However, higher\ninterest rates can also lead to:\n\n\u2022 fewer originations of commercial and residential\nreal estate loans\n\n\u2022 losses on underwriting exposures or incremental\nclient-specific downgrades, or increases in the\nallowance for credit losses and net charge-offs due\nto higher financing costs for clients\n\n\u2022 the loss of deposits, particularly if customers\nwithdraw deposits because they believe that\ninterest rates offered by JPMorgan Chase are lower\nthan those of competitors or if JPMorgan Chase\nmakes incorrect assumptions about depositor\nbehavior\n\n\u2022 losses on available-for-sale (\u201cAFS\u201d) securities\nheld in the investment securities portfolio\n\n\u2022 lower net interest income if central banks\nintroduce interest rate increases more quickly than\nanticipated\n\nand this results in a misalignment in the pricing\nof short-term and long-term borrowings\n\n\u2022 less liquidity in the financial markets, and\n\n\u2022 higher funding costs.\n\nAll of these outcomes could adversely affect\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings or its liquidity and\ncapital levels. Higher interest rates can also\nnegatively affect the payment performance on loans\nwithin JPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer and wholesale loan\nportfolios that are linked to variable interest\nrates. If borrowers of variable rate loans are\nunable to afford higher interest payments, those\nborrowers may reduce or stop making payments,\nthereby causing JPMorgan Chase to incur losses and\nincreased operational costs related to servicing a\nhigher volume of delinquent loans.\n\nOn the other hand, a low or negative interest rate\nenvironment may cause:\n\n\u2022 net interest margins to be compressed, which\ncould reduce the amounts that JPMorgan Chase earns\non its investment securities portfolio to the\nextent that it is unable to reinvest\ncontemporaneously in higher-yielding instruments\n\n\u2022 unanticipated or adverse changes in depositor\nbehavior, which could negatively affect JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s broader asset and liability management\nstrategy, and\n\n\u2022 a reduction in the value of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nmortgage servicing rights (\u201cMSRs\u201d) asset, thereby\ndecreasing revenues.\n\nWhen credit spreads widen, it becomes more\nexpensive for JPMorgan Chase to borrow. JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s credit spreads may widen or narrow not only\nin response to events and circumstances that are\nspecific to JPMorgan Chase but also as a result of\ngeneral economic and geopolitical events and\nconditions. Changes in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit\nspreads will affect, positively or negatively,\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings on certain liabilities,\nsuch as derivatives, that are recorded at fair\nvalue.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s results may be materially affected\nby market fluctuations and significant changes in\nthe value of financial instruments.\n\nThe value of securities, derivatives and other\nfinancial instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or\nin which it makes markets can be materially\naffected by market fluctuations. Market volatility,\nilliquid market conditions and other disruptions in\nthe financial markets may make it extremely\ndifficult to value certain financial instruments.\nSubsequent valuations of financial instruments in\nfuture periods, in light of factors then\nprevailing, may result in significant changes in\nthe value of these instruments. In addition, at the\ntime of any disposition of these financial\ninstruments, the price that JPMorgan Chase\nultimately realizes will depend on the demand and\nliquidity in the market at that time and may be\nmaterially lower than their\n      \n  16  \n      \ncurrent fair value. Any of these factors could\ncause a decline in the value of financial\ninstruments that JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it\nmakes markets, which may have an adverse effect on\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s results of operations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s risk management and monitoring\nprocesses, including its stress testing framework,\nseek to quantify and manage JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nexposure to more extreme market moves. However,\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s hedging and other risk management\nstrategies may not be effective, and it could incur\nsignificant losses, if extreme market events were\nto occur.\n                                                                                                            \n  Credit                                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nJPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected by\nadverse changes in the financial condition of\nclients, counterparties, custodians and CCPs.\n\nJPMorgan Chase routinely executes transactions with\nclients and counterparties such as corporations,\nfinancial institutions, asset managers, hedge\nfunds, securities exchanges and government entities\nwithin and outside the U.S. Many of these\ntransactions expose JPMorgan Chase to the credit\nrisk of its clients and counterparties, and can\ninvolve JPMorgan Chase in disputes and litigation\nif a client or counterparty defaults. JPMorgan\nChase can also be subject to losses or liability\nwhere a financial institution that it has appointed\nto provide custodial services for client assets or\nfunds becomes insolvent as a result of fraud or the\nfailure to abide by existing laws and obligations,\nor where clients are unable to access assets held\nby JPMorgan Chase as custodian due to governmental\nactions or other factors.\n\nA default by, or the financial or operational\nfailure of, a CCP through which JPMorgan Chase\nexecutes contracts would require JPMorgan Chase to\nreplace those contracts, thereby increasing its\noperational costs and potentially resulting in\nlosses. In addition, JPMorgan Chase can be exposed\nto losses if a member of a CCP in which JPMorgan\nChase is also a member defaults on its obligations\nto the CCP because of requirements that each member\nof the CCP absorb a portion of those losses.\nFurthermore, JPMorgan Chase can be subject to\nbearing its share of non-default losses incurred by\na CCP, including losses from custodial, settlement\nor investment activities or due to cyber or other\nsecurity breaches.\n\nAs part of its clearing services activities,\nJPMorgan Chase is exposed to the risk of\nnonperformance by its clients, which it seeks to\nmitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate\ncollateral. JPMorgan Chase is also exposed to\nintra-day credit risk of its clients in connection\nwith providing cash management, clearing, custodial\nand other transaction services to those clients. If\na client for which JPMorgan Chase provides these\nservices becomes bankrupt or insolvent, JPMorgan\nChase may incur losses, become involved in disputes\nand litigation with one or more CCPs, the client\u2019s\nbankruptcy estate and other creditors, or be\nsubject to regulatory investigations. All of the\nforegoing events can increase JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\noperational and\n\nlitigation costs, and JPMorgan Chase may suffer\nlosses to the extent that any collateral that it\nhas received is insufficient to cover those losses.\n\nTransactions with government entities, including\nnational, state, provincial, municipal and local\nauthorities, can expose JPMorgan Chase to enhanced\nsovereign, credit, operational and reputation\nrisks. Government entities may, among other things,\nclaim that actions taken by government officials\nwere beyond the legal authority of those officials\nor repudiate transactions authorized by a previous\nincumbent government. These types of actions have\nin the past caused, and could in the future cause,\nJPMorgan Chase to suffer losses or hamper its\nability to conduct business in the relevant\njurisdiction.\n\nIn addition, local laws, rules and regulations\ncould limit JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to resolve\ndisputes and litigation in the event of a\ncounterparty default or unwillingness to make\npreviously agreed-upon payments, which could\nsubject JPMorgan Chase to losses.\n\nDisputes may arise with counterparties to\nderivatives contracts with regard to the terms, the\nsettlement procedures or the value of underlying\ncollateral. The disposition of those disputes could\ncause JPMorgan Chase to incur unexpected\ntransaction, operational and legal costs, or result\nin credit losses.

This type of interrelationship could\nexacerbate JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit, liquidity and\nmarket risk exposure and potentially cause it to\nincur losses, including fair value losses in its\nmarket-making businesses and investment portfolios.\nIn addition, JPMorgan Chase may be required to\nincrease the allowance for credit losses with\nrespect to certain clients or industries in order\nto align with directives or expectations of its\nbanking regulators.\n\nSimilarly, challenging economic conditions that\naffect a particular industry or geographic area\ncould lead to concerns about the credit quality of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s borrowers or counterparties not\nonly in that particular industry or geography but\nin related or dependent industries, wherever\nlocated. These conditions could also heighten\nconcerns about the ability of customers of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s consumer businesses who live in those areas\nor work in those affected industries or related or\ndependent industries to meet their obligations to\nJPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors\nvarious segments of its credit and market risk\nexposures to assess the potential risks of\nconcentration or contagion, but its ability to\ndiversify or hedge its exposure against those risks\nmay be limited.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer businesses can also be\nharmed by an excessive expansion of consumer credit\nby bank or non-bank competitors. Heightened\ncompetition for certain types of consumer loans\ncould prompt industry-wide reactions such as\nsignificant reductions in the pricing or margins of\nthose loans or the making of loans to less-\ncreditworthy borrowers. If large numbers of\nconsumers subsequently default on their loans,\nwhether due to weak credit profiles, an economic\ndownturn or other factors, this could impair their\nability to repay obligations owed to JPMorgan Chase\nand result in higher charge-offs and other credit-\nrelated losses. More broadly, widespread defaults\non consumer debt could lead to recessionary\nconditions in the\n\nU.S. economy, and JPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer\nbusinesses may earn lower revenues in such an\nenvironment.\n\nIf JPMorgan Chase is unable to reduce positions\neffectively during a market dislocation, this can\nincrease both the market and credit risks\nassociated with those positions and the level of\nrisk-weighted-assets (\u201cRWA\u201d) that JPMorgan Chase\nholds on its balance sheet. These factors could\nadversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s capital position,\nfunding costs and the profitability of its\nbusinesses.\n                                                                                                            \n  Liquidity                                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to operate its businesses\ncould be impaired if its liquidity is constrained.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s liquidity could be impaired at any\ngiven time by factors such as:\n\n\u2022 market-wide illiquidity or disruption\n\n\u2022 unforeseen liquidity or capital requirements,\nincluding as a result of changes in laws, rules and\nregulations\n\n\u2022 inability to sell assets, or to sell assets at\nfavorable times or prices\n\n\u2022 default by a CCP or other significant market\nparticipant\n\n\u2022 unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral\n\n\u2022 unexpected loss of consumer deposits or higher\nthan anticipated draws on lending-related\ncommitments, and\n\n\u2022 lack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan\nChase or financial institutions in general.\n\nA reduction in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s liquidity may be\ncaused by events over which it has little or no\ncontrol. For example, periods of market stress, low\ninvestor confidence and significant market\nilliquidity could result in higher funding costs\nfor JPMorgan Chase and could limit its access to\nsome of its traditional sources of liquidity.\n\nJPMorgan Chase may need to raise funding from\nalternative sources if its access to stable and\nlower-cost sources of funding, such as deposits and\nborrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks, is\nreduced. Alternative sources of funding could be\nmore expensive or limited in availability. JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s funding costs could also be negatively\naffected by actions that JPMorgan Chase may take in\norder to:\n\n\u2022 satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and\nnet stable funding ratio requirements\n\n\u2022 address obligations under its resolution plan, or\n\n\u2022 satisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions\noutside the U.S. relating to the pre-positioning of\nliquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal\nentities.\n\nMore generally, if JPMorgan Chase fails to\neffectively manage its liquidity, this could\nconstrain its ability to fund or invest in its\nbusinesses and subsidiaries, and thereby adversely\naffect its results of operations.\n      \n  18  \n      \nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company and\ndepends on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to\nmake payments on its outstanding securities.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company that\nholds the stock of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and an\nintermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase\nHoldings LLC (the \u201cIHC\u201d). The IHC in turn generally\nholds the stock of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s subsidiaries\nother than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its\nsubsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and\nprovides intercompany lending to the holding\ncompany.\n\nThe holding company is obligated to contribute to\nthe IHC substantially all the net proceeds received\nfrom securities issuances (including issuances of\nsenior and subordinated debt securities and of\npreferred and common stock).\n\nThe ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the\nIHC to make payments to the holding company is also\nlimited. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to\nregulatory restrictions on its dividend\ndistributions, as well as capital adequacy\nrequirements, such as the Supplementary Leverage\nRatio (\u201cSLR\u201d), and liquidity requirements and other\nregulatory restrictions on its ability to make\npayments to the holding company. The IHC is\nprohibited from paying dividends or extending\ncredit to the holding company if certain capital or\nliquidity thresholds are breached or if limits are\notherwise imposed by JPMorgan Chase\u2019s management or\nBoard of Directors.\n\nAs a result of these arrangements, the ability of\nthe holding company to make various payments is\ndependent on its receiving dividends from JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. and dividends and borrowings from\nthe IHC. These limitations could affect the holding\ncompany\u2019s ability to:\n\n\u2022 pay interest on its debt securities\n\n\u2022 pay dividends on its equity securities\n\n\u2022 redeem or repurchase outstanding securities, and\n\n\u2022 fulfill its other payment obligations.\n\nThese arrangements could also result in the holding\ncompany seeking protection under bankruptcy laws or\notherwise entering into resolution proceedings at a\ntime earlier than would have been the case absent\nthe existence of the capital and liquidity\nthresholds to which the IHC is subject.\n\nReductions in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit ratings may\nadversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its principal\nsubsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies.\nRating agencies evaluate general, firm-specific and\nindustry-specific factors when determining credit\nratings for a particular financial institution,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 expected future profitability\n\n\u2022 risk management practices\n\n\u2022 legal expenses\n\n\u2022 ratings differentials between bank holding\ncompanies and their bank and non-bank subsidiaries\n\n\u2022 regulatory developments\n\n\u2022 assumptions about government support, and\n\n\u2022 economic and geopolitical developments.\n\nJPMorgan Chase closely monitors and manages, to the\nextent that it is able, factors that could\ninfluence its credit ratings. However, there is no\nassurance that JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit ratings will\nnot be lowered in the future. Furthermore, any such\ndowngrade could occur at times of broader market\ninstability when JPMorgan Chase\u2019s options for\nresponding to events may be more limited and\ngeneral investor confidence is low.\n\nA reduction in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit ratings\ncould curtail JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business activities\nand reduce its profitability in a number of ways,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 reducing its access to capital markets\n\n\u2022 materially increasing its cost of issuing and\nservicing securities\n\n\u2022 triggering additional collateral or funding\nrequirements, and\n\n\u2022 decreasing the number of investors and\ncounterparties that are willing or permitted to do\nbusiness with or lend to JPMorgan Chase.\n\nAny rating reduction could also increase the credit\nspreads charged by the market for taking credit\nrisk on JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries.\nThis could, in turn, adversely affect the value of\ndebt and other obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co.\nand its subsidiaries.\n\nThe transition to alternative reference rates could\nexpose JPMorgan Chase to operational risks or\nlitigation and other disputes.\n\nRegulators, industry bodies and other market\nparticipants in the U.S. and other countries\ncontinue to engage in initiatives to introduce and\nencourage the use of alternative reference rates to\nreplace certain interest rate indices that are\ndeemed to be \u201cbenchmarks\u201d, and certain of these\nalternative rates have gained or are gaining\nacceptance among market participants. However,\nthere is no assurance that:\n\n\u2022 any of these new rates will be similar to, or\nproduce the economic equivalent of, the benchmarks\nthat they seek to replace\n\n\u2022 arrangements by market participants to prepare\nfor the discontinuation of certain benchmarks and\nthe transition to alternative reference rates will\nbe fully effective, or\n\n\u2022 a particular alternative reference rate will be\nwidely accepted by market participants, or that\nmarket acceptance of that rate will not be hindered\nby the introduction of other reference rates.\n      \n  19  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                                                  \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\nFor example, vast amounts of loans, mortgages,\nsecurities, derivatives and other financial\ninstruments are still linked to the London\nInterbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) benchmark, and\nsignificant progress has been made by regulators,\nindustry bodies and market participants to\nintroduce and implement the Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as a replacement rate for\nU.S. dollar LIBOR. However, if market participants\nhave not implemented effective operational and\nother arrangements to address the transition from\nU.S. dollar LIBOR to SOFR, this could result in\ndislocation in the financial markets, volatility in\nthe pricing of securities, derivatives and other\ninstruments, and the suppression of capital markets\nactivities, all of which could have a negative\nimpact on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s results of operations\nand on U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked securities, credit\nor other instruments which are issued, funded,\nserviced or held by JPMorgan Chase.\n\nJPMorgan Chase could also become involved in\nlitigation and other types of disputes with\nclients, customers, counterparties and investors as\na consequence of the transition from U.S. dollar\nLIBOR and other benchmark rates to replacement\nrates, including claims that JPMorgan Chase has:\n\n\u2022 treated clients, customers, counterparties or\ninvestors unfairly, or caused them to experience\nlosses, higher financing costs or lower returns on\ninvestments\n\n\u2022 failed to appropriately communicate the effects\nof the transition from benchmark rates on the\nproducts that JPMorgan Chase has sold to its\nclients and customers, or failed to disclose\npurported conflicts of interest\n\n\u2022 made inappropriate product recommendations to or\ninvestments on behalf of its clients, or sold\nproducts that did not serve their intended purpose,\nin connection with the transition from benchmark\nrates\n\n\u2022 engaged in anti-competitive behavior, or in the\nmanipulation of markets or specific benchmarks, in\nconnection with the discontinuation of or\ntransition from benchmark rates, or\n\n\u2022 disadvantaged clients, customers, counterparties\nor investors when interpreting or making\ndeterminations under the terms of agreements or\nfinancial instruments.\n\nThese types of claims could subject JPMorgan Chase\nto higher legal expenses and operational costs,\nrequire it to pay significant amounts in connection\nwith resolving litigation and other disputes, and\nharm its reputation.\n                                                                                                            \n  Capital                                                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \nMaintaining the required level and composition of\ncapital may impact JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to\nsupport business activities, meet evolving\nregulatory requirements and distribute capital to\nshareholders.\n\nJPMorgan Chase is subject to various regulatory\ncapital requirements, including leverage- and risk-\nbased capital requirements. In addition, as a\nGlobally Systemically\n\nImportant Bank (\u201cGSIB\u201d), JPMorgan Chase is required\nto hold additional capital buffers, including a\nGSIB surcharge, a Stress Capital Buffer (\u201cSCB\u201d),\nand a countercyclical buffer, each of which is\nreassessed at least annually. The amount of capital\nthat JPMorgan Chase is required to hold in order to\nsatisfy these leverage-and risk-based requirements\ncould increase at any given time due to factors\nsuch as:\n\n\u2022 actions by banking regulators, including changes\nin laws, rules, and regulations\n\n\u2022 actions taken by the Federal Reserve or the U.S.\ngovernment in response to the economic effects of\nsystemic events, such as the actions taken in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic which led to an\nexpansion of the Federal Reserve balance sheet,\ngrowth in deposits held by JPMorgan Chase and other\nU.S. financial institutions and, consequently, an\nincrease in leverage exposure and the GSIB\nsurcharge\n\n\u2022 changes in the composition of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbalance sheet or developments that could increase\nRWA, such as increased market risk, customer\ndelinquencies, client credit rating downgrades or\nother factors, and\n\n\u2022 increases in estimated stress losses as\ndetermined by the Federal Reserve under the\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, which\ncould increase JPMorgan Chase\u2019s SCB.\n\nAny failure by or inability of JPMorgan Chase to\nmaintain the required level and composition of\ncapital, or unfavorable changes in applicable\ncapital requirements, could have an adverse impact\non JPMorgan Chase\u2019s shareholders, such as:\n\n\u2022 reducing the amount of common stock that JPMorgan\nChase is permitted to repurchase\n\n\u2022 requiring the issuance of, or prohibiting the\nredemption of, capital instruments in a manner\ninconsistent with JPMorgan Chase\u2019s capital\nmanagement strategy\n\n\u2022 constraining the amount of dividends that may be\npaid on common stock, or\n\n\u2022 curtailing JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business activities\nor operations.\n                                                                                                            \n  Operational                                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses are dependent on the\neffectiveness of its operational systems and those\nof other market participants.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses rely on the ability of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s financial, accounting, transaction\nexecution, data processing and other operational\nsystems to process, record, monitor and report a\nlarge number of transactions on a continuous basis,\nand to do so accurately, quickly and securely. In\naddition to proper design, installation,\nmaintenance and training, the effective\n      \n  20  \n      \nfunctioning of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational systems\ndepends on:\n\n\u2022 the quality of the information contained in those\nsystems, as inaccurate, outdated or corrupted data\ncan significantly compromise the functionality or\nreliability of a particular system and other\nsystems to which it transmits or from which it\nreceives information, and\n\n\u2022 the ability of JPMorgan Chase to appropriately\nmaintain and upgrade its systems on a regular\nbasis, and to ensure that any changes introduced to\nits systems are managed carefully to ensure\nsecurity and operational continuity and adherence\nto all applicable legal and regulatory\nrequirements.\n\nJPMorgan Chase also depends on its ability to\naccess and use the operational systems of third\nparties, including its custodians, vendors (such as\nthose that provide data and cloud computing\nservices, and security and technology services) and\nother market participants (such as clearing and\npayment systems, CCPs and securities exchanges).\n\nThe ineffectiveness, failure or other disruption of\noperational systems upon which JPMorgan Chase\ndepends, including due to a systems malfunction,\ncyberbreach or other systems failure, could result\nin unfavorable ripple effects in the financial\nmarkets and for JPMorgan Chase and its clients and\ncustomers, including:\n\n\u2022 delays or other disruptions in providing\nservices, liquidity or information to clients and\ncustomers\n\n\u2022 the inability to settle transactions or obtain\naccess to funds and other assets, including those\nfor which physical settlement and delivery is\nrequired\n\n\u2022 failure to timely settle or confirm transactions\n\n\u2022 the possibility that funds transfers, capital\nmarkets trades or other transactions are executed\nerroneously, as a result of illegal conduct or with\nunintended consequences\n\n\u2022 financial losses, including due to loss-sharing\nrequirements of CCPs, payment systems or other\nmarket infrastructures, or as possible restitution\nto clients and customers\n\n\u2022 higher operational costs associated with\nreplacing services provided by a system that is\nunavailable\n\n\u2022 client or customer dissatisfaction with JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s products and services\n\n\u2022 limitations on JPMorgan Chase's ability to\ncollect data as required in connection with\nregulatory or other investigations\n\n\u2022 regulatory fines, penalties, or other sanctions\nagainst JPMorgan Chase\n\n\u2022 loss of confidence in the ability of JPMorgan\nChase, or financial institutions generally, to\nprotect against and withstand operational\ndisruptions, or\n\n\u2022 harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\n\nAs the speed, frequency, volume, interconnectivity\nand complexity of transactions continue to\nincrease, it can become more challenging to\neffectively maintain and upgrade JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\noperational systems and infrastructure, especially\ndue to the heightened risks that:\n\n\u2022 attempts by third parties to defraud JPMorgan\nChase or its clients and customers may increase,\nevolve or become more complex, particularly during\nperiods of market disruption or economic\nuncertainty\n\n\u2022 errors made by JPMorgan Chase or another market\nparticipant, whether inadvertent or malicious,\ncause widespread system disruption\n\n\u2022 isolated or seemingly insignificant errors in\noperational systems compound, or migrate to other\nsystems over time, to become larger issues\n\n\u2022 failures in synchronization or encryption\nsoftware, or degraded performance of\nmicroprocessors, could cause disruptions in\noperational systems, or the inability of systems to\ncommunicate with each other, and\n\n\u2022 third parties may attempt to block the use of key\ntechnology solutions by claiming that the use\ninfringes on their intellectual property rights.\n\nIf JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational systems, or those\nof newly-acquired businesses or of external parties\non which JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses depend, are\nunable to meet the requirements of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbusinesses and operations or bank regulatory\nstandards, or if they fail or have other\nsignificant shortcomings, JPMorgan Chase could be\nmaterially and adversely affected.\n\nA successful cyber attack affecting JPMorgan Chase\ncould cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase and\nits clients and customers.\n\nJPMorgan Chase experiences numerous cyber attacks\non its computer systems, software, networks and\nother technology assets on a daily basis from\nvarious actors, including groups acting on behalf\nof hostile countries, cyber-criminals,\n\u201chacktivists\u201d (i.e., individuals or groups that use\ntechnology to promote a political agenda or social\nchange) and others. These cyber attacks can take\nmany forms, including attempts to introduce\ncomputer viruses or malicious code, which are\ncommonly referred to as \u201cmalware,\u201d into JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s systems. These attacks are often designed\nto:\n\n\u2022 obtain unauthorized access to confidential\ninformation belonging to JPMorgan Chase or its\nclients, customers, counterparties or employees\n\n\u2022 manipulate data\n\n\u2022 destroy data or systems with the aim of rendering\nservices unavailable\n\n\u2022 disrupt, sabotage or degrade service on JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s systems\n      \n  21  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                                                  \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\n\u2022 steal money, or\n\n\u2022 extort money through the use of so-called\n\u201cransomware.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan Chase has also experienced:\n\n\u2022 significant distributed denial-of-service attacks\nintended to disrupt online banking services and\nother business activities, and\n\n\u2022 a higher volume and complexity of cyber attacks\nagainst the backdrop of heightened geopolitical\ntensions.\n\nJPMorgan Chase has experienced security breaches\ndue to cyber attacks in the past, and it is\ninevitable that additional breaches will occur in\nthe future. Any such breach could result in serious\nand harmful consequences for JPMorgan Chase or its\nclients and customers.\n\nA principal reason that JPMorgan Chase cannot\nprovide absolute security against cyber attacks is\nthat it may not always be possible to anticipate,\ndetect or recognize threats to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nsystems, or to implement effective preventive\nmeasures against all breaches because:\n\n\u2022 the techniques used in cyber attacks evolve\nfrequently and are increasingly sophisticated, and\ntherefore may not be recognized until launched\n\n\u2022 cyber attacks can originate from a wide variety\nof sources, including JPMorgan Chase\u2019s own\nemployees, cyber-criminals, hacktivists, groups\nlinked to terrorist organizations or hostile\ncountries, or third parties whose objective is to\ndisrupt the operations of financial institutions\nmore generally\n\n\u2022 JPMorgan Chase does not have control over the\ncybersecurity of the systems of the large number of\nclients, customers, counterparties and third-party\nservice providers with which it does business, and\n\n\u2022 it is possible that a third party, after\nestablishing a foothold on an internal network\nwithout being detected, might obtain access to\nother networks and systems.\n\nThe risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack\ncould increase in the future due to factors such\nas:\n\n\u2022 JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ongoing expansion of its mobile\nbanking and other internet-based product offerings\nand its internal use of internet-based products and\napplications, including those that use cloud\ncomputing services\n\n\u2022 the acquisition and integration of new\nbusinesses, and\n\n\u2022 the increased use of remote access and third\nparty video conferencing solutions to facilitate\nwork-from-home arrangements for employees.\n\nIn addition, a third party could misappropriate\nconfidential information obtained by intercepting\nsignals or\n\ncommunications from mobile devices used by JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s employees.\n\nA successful penetration or circumvention of the\nsecurity of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems or the systems\nof a vendor, governmental body or another market\nparticipant could cause serious negative\nconsequences, including:\n\n\u2022 significant disruption of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\noperations and those of its clients, customers and\ncounterparties, including losing access to\noperational systems\n\n\u2022 misappropriation of confidential information of\nJPMorgan Chase or that of its clients, customers,\ncounterparties, employees or regulators\n\n\u2022 disruption of or damage to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nsystems and those of its clients, customers and\ncounterparties\n\n\u2022 the inability, or extended delays in the ability,\nto fully recover and restore data that has been\nstolen, manipulated or destroyed, or the inability\nto prevent systems from processing fraudulent\ntransactions\n\n\u2022 violations by JPMorgan Chase of applicable\nprivacy and other laws\n\n\u2022 financial loss to JPMorgan Chase or to its\nclients, customers, counterparties or employees\n\n\u2022 loss of confidence in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\ncybersecurity and business resiliency measures\n\n\u2022 dissatisfaction among JPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients,\ncustomers or counterparties\n\n\u2022 significant exposure to litigation and regulatory\nfines, penalties or other sanctions, and\n\n\u2022 harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\n\nThe extent of a particular cyber attack and the\nsteps that JPMorgan Chase may need to take to\ninvestigate the attack may not be immediately\nclear, and it may take a significant amount of time\nbefore such an investigation can be completed.\nWhile such an investigation is ongoing, JPMorgan\nChase may not necessarily know the full extent of\nthe harm caused by the cyber attack, and that\ndamage may continue to spread. These factors may\ninhibit JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to provide rapid,\nfull and reliable information about the cyber\nattack to its clients, customers, counterparties\nand regulators, as well as the public. Furthermore,\nit may not be clear how best to contain and\nremediate the harm caused by the cyber attack, and\ncertain errors or actions could be repeated or\ncompounded before they are discovered and\nremediated. Any or all of these factors could\nfurther increase the costs and consequences of a\ncyber attack.\n      \n  22  \n      \nJPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected if it\nfails to identify and address operational risks\nassociated with the introduction of or changes to\nproducts, services and delivery platforms.\n\nWhen JPMorgan Chase launches a new product or\nservice, introduces a new platform for the delivery\nor distribution of products or services (including\nmobile connectivity, electronic trading and cloud\ncomputing), acquires or invests in a business or\nmakes changes to an existing product, service or\ndelivery platform, it may not fully appreciate or\nidentify new operational risks that may arise from\nthose changes, or may fail to implement adequate\ncontrols to mitigate the risks associated with\nthose changes. Any significant failure in this\nregard could diminish JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to\noperate one or more of its businesses or result in:\n\n\u2022 potential liability to clients, counterparties\nand customers\n\n\u2022 increased operating expenses\n\n\u2022 higher litigation costs, including regulatory\nfines, penalties and other sanctions\n\n\u2022 damage to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation\n\n\u2022 impairment of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s liquidity\n\n\u2022 regulatory intervention, or\n\n\u2022 weaker competitive standing.\n\nAny of the foregoing consequences could materially\nand adversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses\nand results of operations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational costs and customer\nsatisfaction could be adversely affected by the\nfailure of an external operational system.\n\nExternal operational systems with which JPMorgan is\nconnected, whether directly or indirectly, can be\nsources of operational risk to JPMorgan Chase.\nJPMorgan Chase may be exposed not only to a systems\nfailure or cyber attack that may be experienced by\na vendor or market infrastructure with which\nJPMorgan Chase is directly connected, but also to a\nsystems breakdown or cyber attack involving another\nparty to which such a vendor or infrastructure is\nconnected. Similarly, retailers, payment systems\nand processors, data aggregators and other external\nparties with which JPMorgan Chase\u2019s customers do\nbusiness can increase JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational\nrisk. This is particularly the case where\nactivities of customers or other parties are beyond\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s security and control systems,\nincluding through the use of the internet, cloud\ncomputing services, and personal smart phones and\nother mobile devices or services.\n\nIf an external party obtains access to customer\naccount data on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems, whether\nauthorized or unauthorized, and that party\nexperiences a cyberbreach of its own systems or\nmisappropriates that data, this could\n\nresult in a variety of negative outcomes for\nJPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 heightened risk that external parties will be\nable to execute fraudulent transactions using\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems\n\n\u2022 losses from fraudulent transactions, as well as\npotential liability for losses that exceed\nthresholds established in consumer protection laws,\nrules and regulations\n\n\u2022 increased operational costs to remediate the\nconsequences of the external party\u2019s security\nbreach, and\n\n\u2022 reputational harm arising from the perception\nthat JPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems may not be secure.\n\nAs JPMorgan Chase\u2019s interconnectivity with clients,\ncustomers and other external parties continues to\nexpand, JPMorgan Chase increasingly faces the risk\nof operational failure or cyber attacks with\nrespect to the systems of those parties. Security\nbreaches affecting JPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients or\ncustomers, or systems breakdowns or failures,\nsecurity breaches or human error or misconduct\naffecting other external parties, may require\nJPMorgan Chase to take steps to protect the\nintegrity of its own operational systems or to\nsafeguard confidential information, including\nrestricting the access of customers to their\naccounts. These actions can increase JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s operational costs and potentially diminish\ncustomer satisfaction and confidence in JPMorgan\nChase.\n\nFurthermore, the widespread and expanding\ninterconnectivity among financial institutions,\nclearing banks, CCPs, payments processors,\nfinancial technology companies, securities\nexchanges, clearing houses and other financial\nmarket infrastructures increases the risk that the\ndisruption of an operational system involving one\ninstitution or entity, including due to a cyber\nattack, may cause industry-wide operational\ndisruptions that could materially affect JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s ability to conduct business.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business and operations rely on\nits ability, and the ability of key external\nparties, to maintain appropriately-staffed\nworkforces, and on the competence, trustworthiness,\nhealth and safety of employees.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to operate its businesses\nefficiently and profitably, to offer products and\nservices that meet the expectations of its clients\nand customers, and to maintain an effective risk\nmanagement framework is highly dependent on its\nability to staff its operations appropriately and\non the competence, integrity, health and safety of\nits employees. JPMorgan Chase's businesses and\noperations similarly rely on the workforces of\nthird parties, including employees of vendors,\ncustodians and financial markets infrastructures,\nand of businesses that it may seek to acquire.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses could be materially and\nadversely affected by:\n\n\u2022 the ineffective implementation of business\ndecisions\n      \n  23  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                                                  \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\n\u2022 any failure to institute controls that\nappropriately address risks associated with\nbusiness activities, or to appropriately train\nemployees with respect to those risks and controls\n\n\u2022 staffing shortages, particularly in tight labor\nmarkets\n\n\u2022 the possibility that significant portions of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s workforce are unable to work\neffectively, including because of illness,\nquarantines, shelter-in-place arrangements,\ngovernment actions or other restrictions in\nconnection with health emergencies, the spread of\ninfectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics\n\n\u2022 a significant operational breakdown or failure,\ntheft, fraud or other unlawful conduct, or\n\n\u2022 other negative outcomes caused by human error or\nmisconduct by an employee of JPMorgan Chase or of\nanother party on which JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses\nor operations depend.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations could also be impaired\nif the measures taken by it or by governmental\nauthorities to help ensure the health and safety of\nits employees are ineffective, or if any external\nparty on which JPMorgan Chase relies fails to take\nappropriate and effective actions to protect the\nhealth and safety of its employees.\n\nJPMorgan Chase faces substantial legal and\noperational risks in the processing and\nsafeguarding of personal information.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses and operations are\nsubject to complex and evolving laws, rules and\nregulations, both within and outside the U.S.,\ngoverning the privacy and protection of personal\ninformation of individuals. Governmental\nauthorities around the world have adopted and are\nconsidering the adoption of numerous legislative\nand regulatory initiatives concerning privacy, data\nprotection and security. Litigation or enforcement\nactions relating to these laws, rules and\nregulations could result in\n\nfines or orders requiring that JPMorgan Chase\nchange its data-related practices, which could have\nan adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to\nprovide products and otherwise harm its business\noperations.\n\nImplementing processes relating to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\ncollection, use, sharing and storage of personal\ninformation to comply with all applicable laws,\nrules and regulations in all relevant\njurisdictions, including where the laws of\ndifferent jurisdictions are in conflict, can:\n\n\u2022 increase JPMorgan Chase\u2019s compliance and\noperating costs\n\n\u2022 hinder the development of new products or\nservices, curtail the offering of existing products\nor services, or affect how products and services\nare offered to clients and customers\n\n\u2022 demand significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nmanagement, and\n\n\u2022 require JPMorgan Chase to structure its\nbusinesses, operations and systems in less\nefficient ways.\n\nNot all of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients, customers,\nvendors, counterparties and other external parties\nmay have appropriate controls in place to protect\nthe confidentiality, integrity or availability of\nthe information exchanged between them and JPMorgan\nChase, particularly where information is\ntransmitted by electronic means. JPMorgan Chase\ncould be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines,\npenalties or other sanctions if personal\ninformation of clients, customers, employees or\nothers were to be mishandled or misused, such as\nsituations where such information is:\n\n\u2022 erroneously provided to parties who are not\npermitted to have the information, or\n\n\u2022 intercepted or otherwise compromised by\nunauthorized third parties.\n\nConcerns regarding the effectiveness of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s measures to safeguard personal information,\nor even the perception that those measures are\ninadequate, could cause JPMorgan Chase to lose\nexisting or potential clients and customers or\nemployees, and thereby reduce JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nrevenues. Furthermore, any failure or perceived\nfailure by JPMorgan Chase to comply with applicable\nprivacy or data protection laws, rules and\nregulations may subject it to inquiries,\nexaminations and investigations that could result\nin requirements to modify or cease certain\noperations or practices, significant liabilities or\nregulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions. Any\nof these could damage JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation\nand otherwise adversely affect its businesses.\n\nIn recent years, well-publicized incidents\ninvolving the inappropriate collection, use,\nsharing or storage of personal information have led\nto expanded governmental scrutiny of practices\nrelating to the processing or safeguarding of\npersonal information by companies in the U.S. and\nother countries. That scrutiny has in some cases\nresulted in, and could in the future lead to, the\nadoption of stricter laws, rules and regulations\nrelating to the collection, use, sharing and\nstorage of personal information. These types of\nlaws, rules and regulations could prohibit or\nsignificantly restrict financial services firms\nsuch as JPMorgan Chase from transferring\ninformation across national borders or sharing\ninformation among affiliates or with third parties\nsuch as vendors, thereby increase compliance costs,\nor could restrict JPMorgan Chase\u2019s use of personal\ninformation when developing or offering products or\nservices to customers. Some countries are\nconsidering or have adopted legislation\nimplementing data protection requirements or\nrequiring local storage and processing of data\nwhich could increase the cost and complexity of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s delivery of products and services.\nThese restrictions could also inhibit JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s development or marketing of certain\nproducts or services, or increase the costs of\noffering them to customers.\n      \n  24  \n      \nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations, results and reputation\ncould be harmed by occurrences of extraordinary\nevents beyond its control.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business and operational systems\ncould be seriously disrupted, and its reputation\ncould be harmed, by events or contributing factors\nthat are wholly or partially beyond its control,\nincluding material instances of:\n\n\u2022 cyber attacks\n\n\u2022 security breaches of its physical premises,\nincluding threats to health and safety\n\n\u2022 power, telecommunications or internet outages, or\nshutdowns of mass transit\n\n\u2022 failure of, or loss of access to, technology or\noperational systems, including any resulting loss\nof critical data\n\n\u2022 damage to or loss of property or assets of\nJPMorgan Chase or third parties, and any consequent\ninjuries, including in connection with any\nconstruction projects undertaken by JPMorgan Chase\n\n\u2022 effects of climate change\n\n\u2022 natural disasters or severe weather conditions\n\n\u2022 accidents such as explosions or structural\nfailures\n\n\u2022 health emergencies, the spread of infectious\ndiseases, epidemics or pandemics, or\n\n\u2022 events arising from local or larger-scale civil\nor political unrest, any outbreak or escalation of\nhostilities, or terrorist acts.\n\nJPMorgan Chase maintains a Firmwide resiliency\nprogram that is intended to enable it to recover\ncritical business functions and supporting assets,\nincluding staff, technology and facilities, in the\nevent of a business disruption, including due to\nthe occurrence of an extraordinary event beyond its\ncontrol. There can be no assurance that JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s resiliency plans will fully mitigate all\npotential business continuity risks to JPMorgan\nChase, its clients, and customers and third parties\nwith which it does business, or that its resiliency\nplans will be adequate to address the effects of\nsimultaneous occurrences of multiple business\ndisruption events. In addition, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nability to respond effectively to a business\ndisruption event could be hampered to the extent\nthat the members of its workforce, physical assets\nor systems and other support infrastructure needed\nto address the event are geographically dispersed,\nor conversely, if such an event were to occur in an\narea in which they are concentrated. Further,\nshould extraordinary events or the factors that\ncause or contribute to those events become more\nchronic, the disruptive effects of those events on\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business and operations, and on\nits clients, customers, counterparties and\nemployees, could become more significant and long-\nlasting.\n\nAny significant failure or disruption of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s operations or operational systems, or the\noccurrence of one or more extraordinary events that\nare beyond its control, could:\n\n\u2022 hinder JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to provide\nservices to its clients and customers or to\ntransact with its counterparties\n\n\u2022 require it to expend significant resources to\ncorrect the failure or disruption or to address the\nevent\n\n\u2022 cause it to incur losses or liabilities,\nincluding from loss of revenue, damage to or loss\nof property, or injuries\n\n\u2022 disrupt market infrastructure systems on which\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses rely\n\n\u2022 expose it to litigation or regulatory fines,\npenalties or other sanctions, and\n\n\u2022 harm its reputation.\n\nEnhanced regulatory and other standards for the\noversight of vendors and other service providers\ncan result in higher costs and other potential\nexposures.\n\nJPMorgan Chase must comply with enhanced regulatory\nand other standards associated with doing business\nwith vendors and other service providers, including\nstandards relating to the outsourcing of functions\nas well as the performance of significant banking\nand other functions by subsidiaries. JPMorgan Chase\nincurs significant costs and expenses in connection\nwith its initiatives to address the risks\nassociated with oversight of its internal and\nexternal service providers. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nfailure to appropriately assess and manage these\nrelationships, especially those involving\nsignificant banking functions, shared services or\nother critical activities, could materially\nadversely affect JPMorgan Chase. Specifically, any\nsuch failure could result in:\n\n\u2022 potential harm to clients and customers, and any\nliability associated with that harm\n\n\u2022 regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions\n\n\u2022 lower revenues, and the opportunity cost from\nlost revenues\n\n\u2022 increased operational costs, or\n\n\u2022 harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s risk management framework may not\nbe effective in identifying and mitigating every\nrisk to JPMorgan Chase.\n\nAny inadequacy or lapse in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s risk\nmanagement framework, governance structure,\npractices, models or reporting systems could expose\nit to unexpected losses, and its financial\ncondition or results of operations could be\nmaterially and adversely affected.

Any deficiencies in the quality or\neffectiveness of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s data gathering,\nanalysis and validation processes could result in\nineffective risk management practices. These\ndeficiencies could also result in inaccurate or\nuntimely risk reporting.\n\nMany of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s risk management strategies\nand techniques consider historical market behavior\nand to some degree are based on management\u2019s\nsubjective judgment or assumptions. For example,\nmany models used by JPMorgan Chase are based on\nassumptions regarding historical correlations among\nprices of various asset classes or other market\nindicators. In times of market stress, including\ndifficult or less liquid market environments, or in\nthe event of other unforeseen circumstances,\npreviously uncorrelated indicators may become\ncorrelated. Conversely, previously-correlated\nindicators may become uncorrelated at those times.\nSudden market movements and unanticipated market or\neconomic movements could, in some circumstances,\nlimit the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s risk\nmanagement strategies, causing it to incur losses.\n\nJPMorgan Chase could recognize unexpected losses,\nits capital levels could be reduced and it could\nface greater regulatory scrutiny if its models,\nestimations or judgments, including those used in\nits financial statements, prove to be inadequate or\nincorrect.\n\nJPMorgan Chase has developed and uses a variety of\nmodels and other analytical and judgment-based\nestimations to measure, monitor and implement\ncontrols over its market, credit, capital,\nliquidity, operational and other risks. JPMorgan\nChase also uses internal models and estimations as\na basis for its stress testing and in connection\nwith the preparation of its financial statements\nunder U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\n(\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d).\n\nThese models and estimations are based on a variety\nof assumptions and historical trends, and are\nperiodically\n\nreviewed and modified as necessary. The models and\nestimations that JPMorgan Chase uses may not be\neffective in all cases to identify, observe and\nmitigate risk due to a variety of factors, such as:\n\n\u2022 reliance on historical trends that may not\npersist in the future, including assumptions\nunderlying the models and estimations such as\ncorrelations among certain market indicators or\nasset prices\n\n\u2022 inherent limitations associated with forecasting\nuncertain economic and financial outcomes\n\n\u2022 historical trend information may be incomplete,\nor may not be indicative of severely negative\nmarket conditions such as extreme volatility,\ndislocation or lack of liquidity\n\n\u2022 sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in\nprices of certain loans and securities may make it\nmore difficult to value certain financial\ninstruments\n\n\u2022 technology that is introduced to run models or\nestimations may not perform as expected, or may not\nbe well understood by the personnel using the\ntechnology\n\n\u2022 models and estimations may contain erroneous\ndata, valuations, formulas or algorithms, and\n\n\u2022 review processes may fail to detect flaws in\nmodels and estimations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase may experience unexpected losses if\nmodels, estimates or judgments used or applied in\nconnection with its risk management activities or\nthe preparation of its financial statements prove\nto have been inadequate or incorrect. For example,\nwhere quoted market prices are not available for\ncertain financial instruments that require a\ndetermination of their fair value, JPMorgan Chase\nmay make fair value determinations based on\ninternally developed models or other means which\nultimately rely to some degree on management\nestimates and judgment.\n\nSimilarly, JPMorgan Chase establishes an allowance\nfor expected credit losses related to its credit\nexposures which requires significant judgments,\nincluding forecasts of how macroeconomic conditions\nmight impair the ability of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nclients and customers to repay their loans or other\nobligations. These types of estimates and judgments\nmay not prove to be accurate due to a variety of\nfactors, as noted above. This is particularly true\nwhen the current and forecasted environments are\nsignificantly different from the historical\nenvironments upon which the models were developed,\nas JPMorgan Chase experienced during the early\nstages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increased\nuncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of\njudgment and analytics to inform any adjustments\nthat JPMorgan Chase may make to model outputs than\nwould otherwise be the case.\n\nSome of the models and other analytical and\njudgment-based estimations used by JPMorgan Chase\nin managing\n      \n  26  \n      \nrisks are subject to review by, and require the\napproval of, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s regulators. These\nreviews are required before JPMorgan Chase may use\nthose models and estimations for calculating market\nrisk RWA, credit risk RWA and operational risk RWA\nunder Basel III. If JPMorgan Chase\u2019s models or\nestimations are not approved by its regulators, it\nmay be subject to higher capital charges, which\ncould adversely affect its financial results or\nlimit the ability to expand its businesses.\n\nLapses in controls over disclosure or financial\nreporting could materially affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nprofitability or reputation.\n\nThere can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\ndisclosure controls and procedures will be\neffective in every circumstance, or that a material\nweakness or significant deficiency in internal\ncontrol over financial reporting will not occur.\nAny such lapses or deficiencies could result in\ninaccurate financial reporting which, in turn,\ncould:\n\n\u2022 materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbusiness and results of operations or financial\ncondition\n\n\u2022 restrict its ability to access the capital\nmarkets\n\n\u2022 require it to expend significant resources to\ncorrect the lapses or deficiencies\n\n\u2022 expose it to litigation or regulatory fines,\npenalties or other sanctions\n\n\u2022 harm its reputation, or\n\n\u2022 otherwise diminish investor confidence in\nJPMorgan Chase.\n                                                                                                            \n  Strategic                                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \nIf JPMorgan Chase\u2019s management fails to develop and\nexecute effective business strategies, and to\nanticipate changes affecting those strategies,\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s competitive standing and results\ncould suffer.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business strategies significantly\naffect its competitive standing and operations.\nThese strategies relate to:\n\n\u2022 the products and services that JPMorgan Chase\noffers\n\n\u2022 the geographies in which it operates\n\n\u2022 the types of clients and customers that it serves\n\n\u2022 the businesses that it acquires or in which it\ninvests\n\n\u2022 the counterparties with which it does business,\nand\n\n\u2022 the methods and distribution channels by which it\noffers products and services.\n\nIf management makes choices about these strategies\nand goals that prove to be incorrect, are based on\nincomplete, inaccurate or fraudulent information,\ndo not accurately assess the competitive landscape\nand industry trends, or fail to address changing\nregulatory and market environments or the\nexpectations of clients, customers,\n\ninvestors, employees and other stakeholders, then\nthe franchise values and growth prospects of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses may suffer and its\nearnings could decline.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s growth prospects also depend on\nmanagement\u2019s ability to develop and execute\neffective business plans to address these strategic\npriorities, both in the near term and over longer\ntime horizons. Management\u2019s effectiveness in this\nregard will affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to\ndevelop and enhance its resources, control expenses\nand return capital to shareholders. Each of these\nobjectives could be adversely affected by any\nfailure on the part of management to:\n\n\u2022 devise effective business plans and strategies\n\n\u2022 offer products and services that meet changing\nexpectations of clients and customers\n\n\u2022 allocate capital in a manner that promotes long-\nterm stability to enable JPMorgan Chase to build\nand invest in market-leading businesses, even in a\nhighly stressed environment\n\n\u2022 allocate capital appropriately due to imprecise\nmodeling or subjective judgments made in connection\nwith those allocations\n\n\u2022 conduct appropriate due diligence on prospective\nbusiness acquisitions or investments, or\neffectively integrate newly-acquired businesses\n\n\u2022 appropriately address concerns of clients,\ncustomers, investors, employees and other\nstakeholders, including with respect to ESG matters\n\n\u2022 react quickly to changes in market conditions or\nmarket structures, or\n\n\u2022 develop and enhance the operational, technology,\nrisk, financial and managerial resources necessary\nto grow and manage JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses.\n\nFurthermore, JPMorgan Chase may incur costs in\nconnection with disposing of excess properties,\npremises and facilities, and those costs could be\nmaterial to its results of operations in a given\nperiod.\n\nJPMorgan Chase faces significant and increasing\ncompetition in the rapidly evolving financial\nservices industry.\n\nJPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive\nenvironment in which it must evolve and adapt to\nthe significant changes as a result of changes in\nfinancial regulation, technological advances,\nincreased public scrutiny and changes in economic\nconditions. JPMorgan Chase expects that competition\nin the U.S. and global financial services industry\nwill continue to be intense.

For example,\naggressive or less disciplined lending practices by\nnonbank competitors could lead to a loss of market\nshare for traditional banks, and in an economic\ndownturn could result in instability in the\nfinancial services industry and adversely impact\nother market participants, including JPMorgan\nChase.\n\nNew competitors in the financial services industry\ncontinue to emerge. For example, technological\nadvances and the growth of e-commerce have made it\npossible for non-depository institutions to offer\nproducts and services that traditionally were\nbanking products. These advances have also allowed\nfinancial institutions and other companies to\nprovide electronic and internet-based financial\nsolutions, including electronic securities and\ncryptocurrency trading, lending and other\nextensions of credit to consumers, payments\nprocessing and online automated algorithmic-based\ninvestment advice. Furthermore, both financial\ninstitutions and their non-banking competitors face\nthe risk that payments processing and other\nproducts and services, including deposits and other\ntraditional banking products, could be\nsignificantly disrupted by the use of new\ntechnologies, such as cryptocurrencies and other\napplications using secure distributed ledgers, that\nrequire no intermediation. New technologies have\nrequired and could require JPMorgan Chase to spend\nmore to modify or adapt its products to attract and\nretain clients and customers or to match products\nand services offered by its competitors, including\ntechnology companies. In addition, new technologies\nmay be used by customers, or breached or\ninfiltrated by third parties, in unexpected ways,\nwhich can increase JPMorgan Chase\u2019s costs for\ncomplying with laws, rules and regulations that\napply to the offering of products and services\nthrough those technologies and reduce the income\nthat JPMorgan Chase earns from providing products\nand services through those technologies.\n\nOngoing or increased competition may put pressure\non the pricing for JPMorgan Chase\u2019s products and\nservices or may cause JPMorgan Chase to lose market\nshare, particularly with respect to traditional\nbanking products. This competition may be on the\nbasis of quality and variety of products and\nservices offered, transaction execution,\ninnovation, reputation and price. The failure of\nany of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses to meet the\nexpectations of clients and customers, whether due\nto general market conditions, under-performance, a\ndecision not to offer a particular product or\nservice, changes in client and customer\nexpectations or other factors, could affect\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to attract or retain\nclients and customers. Any such impact could, in\nturn, reduce JPMorgan Chase\u2019s revenues. Increased\ncompetition also\n\nmay require JPMorgan Chase to make additional\ncapital investments in its businesses, or to extend\nmore of its capital on behalf of its clients in\norder to remain competitive.\n\nThe effects of climate change could adversely\naffect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business and operations,\nboth directly and as a result of impacts on its\nclients and customers.\n\nJPMorgan Chase operates in many regions, countries\nand communities around the world where its\nbusiness, and the activities of its clients and\ncustomers, could be adversely affected by climate\nchange. Climate change could manifest as a\nfinancial risk to JPMorgan Chase either through\nchanges in the physical climate or from the process\nof transitioning to a lower-carbon economy. Both\nphysical risks and transition risks associated with\nclimate change could have negative impacts on the\nfinancial condition or creditworthiness of\nJPMorgan\u2019s clients and customers, and on its\nexposure to those clients and customers.\n\nClimate-related physical risks include the\nincreased frequency or severity of acute weather\nevents, such as floods, wildfires and tropical\nstorms, and chronic shifts in the climate, such as\npersistent changes in precipitation levels, rising\nsea levels, or increases in average ambient\ntemperature.Potential adverse impacts of climate-\nrelated physical risks include:\n\n\u2022 declines in asset values, including due to the\ndestruction or degradation of property\n\n\u2022 reduced availability or increased cost of\ninsurance for clients of JPMorgan Chase\n\n\u2022 interruptions to business operations, including\nsupply chain disruption, and\n\n\u2022 population migration or unemployment in affected\nregions.\n\nTransition risks arise from societal adjustment to\na lower-carbon economy, such as changes in public\npolicy, adoption of new technologies or changes in\nconsumer preferences towards low-carbon goods and\nservices. These risks could also be influenced by\nchanges in the physical climate. Potential adverse\nimpacts of transition risks include:\n\n\u2022 sudden devaluation of assets, including\nunanticipated write-downs (\u201cstranded assets\u201d)\n\n\u2022 increased operational and compliance costs driven\nby changes in climate policy\n\n\u2022 increased energy costs driven by governmental\nactions and initiatives such as higher taxation and\naccelerated decarbonization policies\n\n\u2022 negative consequences to business models, and the\nneed to make changes in response to those\nconsequences, and\n\n\u2022 damage to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation, including\ndue to any perception that its business practices\nare\n      \n  28  \n      \ncontrary to public policy or the preferences of\ndifferent stakeholders.\n\nClimate risks can also arise from the\ninconsistencies and conflicts in the manner in\nwhich climate policy and financial regulation is\nimplemented in the many regions where JPMorgan\nChase operates, including initiatives to apply and\nenforce policy and regulation with extraterritorial\neffect.\n                                                                                                            \n  Conduct                                                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \nConduct failure by JPMorgan Chase employees can\nharm clients and customers, impact market\nintegrity, damage JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation and\ntrigger litigation and regulatory action.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s employees interact with clients,\ncustomers and counterparties, and with each other,\nevery day. All employees are expected to\ndemonstrate values and exhibit the behaviors that\nare an integral part of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Code of\nConduct and How We Do Business Principles,\nincluding JPMorgan Chase\u2019s commitment to \u201cdo first\nclass business in a first class way.\u201d JPMorgan\nChase endeavors to embed conduct risk management\nthroughout an employee\u2019s life cycle, including\nrecruiting, onboarding, training and development,\nand performance management. Conduct risk management\nis also an integral component of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\npromotion and compensation processes.\n\nNotwithstanding these expectations, policies and\npractices, certain employees have engaged in\nimproper or illegal conduct in the past. These\ninstances of misconduct have resulted in\nlitigation, and resolutions of governmental\ninvestigations or enforcement actions involving\nconsent orders, deferred prosecution agreements,\nnon-prosecution agreements and other civil or\ncriminal sanctions. There is no assurance that\nfurther inappropriate or unlawful actions by\nemployees have not occurred or will not occur, lead\nto a violation of the terms of these resolutions\n(and associated consequences), or that any such\nactions will always be detected, deterred or\nprevented.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation could be harmed, and\ncollateral consequences could result, from a\nfailure by one or more employees to conduct\nthemselves in accordance with JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nexpectations, policies and practices, including by\nacting in ways that harm clients, customers, other\nmarket participants, employees or others.

This\nlatter risk can be magnified by the speed and\npervasiveness with which information is\ndisseminated through those channels.\n\nSocial and environmental activists have been\nincreasingly targeting JPMorgan Chase and other\nfinancial services firms with public criticism\nconcerning their business practices, including\nbusiness relationships with clients that are\nengaged in certain sensitive industries, such as\ncompanies :\n\n\u2022 whose products are or are perceived to be harmful\nto human health, or\n\n\u2022 whose activities negatively affect or are\nperceived to negatively affect the environment,\nworkers\u2019 rights or communities.\n\nActivists have also taken actions intended to\nchange or influence JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business\npractices with respect to ESG matters, including\npublic protests at JPMorgan Chase\u2019s headquarters\nand other properties, and submitting specific ESG-\nrelated proposals for a vote by JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nshareholders.\n\nThese and other types of activist criticism and\nactions directed at JPMorgan Chase could\npotentially engender dissatisfaction among clients,\ncustomers, investors and employees with how\nJPMorgan Chase addresses ESG concerns in its\nbusiness activities. In all of these cases, the\nresulting harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation\ncould:\n\n\u2022 attract scrutiny from governmental or regulatory\nbodies\n\n\u2022 cause certain clients and customers to cease\ndoing business with JPMorgan Chase\n\n\u2022 impair JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to attract new\nclients and customers, or to expand its\nrelationships with existing clients and customers\n\n\u2022 diminish JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to hire or\nretain employees\n\n\u2022 prompt JPMorgan Chase to cease doing business\nwith certain clients or customers\n\n\u2022 cause certain investors to divest from\ninvestments in securities of JPMorgan Chase, or\n\n\u2022 otherwise negatively affect JPMorgan Chase's\nbusiness and results of operations.\n\nActions by the financial services industry\ngenerally or individuals in the industry can also\naffect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation. For example,\nthe reputation of the industry as a whole can be\ndamaged by concerns that:\n\n\u2022 consumers have been treated unfairly by a\nfinancial institution, or\n\n\u2022 a financial institution has acted inappropriately\nwith respect to the methods used to offer products\nto customers.\n\nIf JPMorgan Chase is perceived to have engaged in\nthese types of behaviors, this could weaken its\nreputation among clients or customers.\n\nFailure to effectively manage potential conflicts\nof interest or to satisfy fiduciary obligations can\nresult in litigation and enforcement actions, as\nwell as damage JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to manage potential\nconflicts of interest is highly complex due to the\nbroad range of its business activities which\nencompass a variety of transactions, obligations\nand interests with and among JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nclients and customers. JPMorgan Chase can become\nsubject to litigation, enforcement actions, and\nheightened regulatory scrutiny, and its reputation\ncan be damaged, by the failure or perceived failure\nto:\n      \n  30  \n      \n\u2022 adequately address or appropriately disclose\nconflicts of interest, including potential\nconflicts of interest that may arise in connection\nwith providing multiple products and services in,\nor having one or more investments related to, the\nsame transaction\n\n\u2022 identify and address any conflict of interest\nthat a third party with which it is does business\nmay have with respect to a transaction involving\nJPMorgan Chase\n\n\u2022 deliver appropriate standards of service and\nquality\n\n\u2022 treat clients and customers fairly and with the\nappropriate standard of care\n\n\u2022 use client and customer data responsibly and in a\nmanner that meets legal requirements and regulatory\nexpectations\n\n\u2022 provide fiduciary products or services in\naccordance with the applicable legal and regulatory\nstandards, or\n\n\u2022 handle or use confidential information of\ncustomers or clients appropriately and in\ncompliance with applicable data protection and\nprivacy laws, rules and regulations.\n\nA failure or perceived failure to appropriately\naddress conflicts of interest or fiduciary\nobligations could result in customer\ndissatisfaction, litigation and regulatory fines,\npenalties or other sanctions, and heightened\nregulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions, all of\nwhich can lead to lost revenue and higher operating\ncosts and cause serious harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nreputation.\n                                                                                                            \n  Country                                                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \nAn outbreak or escalation of hostilities between\ncountries or within a country or region could have\na material adverse effect on the global economy and\non JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses within the affected\nregion or globally.\n\nAggressive actions by hostile governments or\ngroups, including armed conflict or intensified\ncyber attacks, could expand in unpredictable ways\nby drawing in other countries or escalating into\nfull-scale war with potentially catastrophic\nconsequences, particularly if one or more of the\ncombatants possess nuclear weapons. Depending on\nthe scope of the conflict, the hostilities could\nresult in:\n\n\u2022 worldwide economic disruption\n\n\u2022 heightened volatility in financial markets\n\n\u2022 severe declines in asset values, accompanied by\nwidespread sell-offs of investments\n\n\u2022 substantial depreciation of local currencies,\npotentially leading to defaults by borrowers and\ncounterparties in the affected region\n\n\u2022 disruption of global trade, and\n\n\u2022 diminished consumer, business and investor\nconfidence.\n\nAny of the above consequences could have\nsignificant negative effects on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\noperations and\n\nearnings, both in the countries or regions directly\naffected by the hostilities or globally. Further,\nif the U.S. were to become directly involved in\nsuch a conflict, this could lead to a curtailment\nof any operations that JPMorgan Chase may have in\nthe affected countries or region, as well as in any\nnation that is aligned against the U.S. in the\nhostilities. JPMorgan Chase could also experience\nmore numerous and aggressive cyber attacks launched\nby or under the sponsorship of one or more of the\nadversaries in such a conflict.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business and operations in certain\ncountries can be adversely affected by local\neconomic, political, regulatory and social factors.\n\nSome of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase\nconducts business have economies or markets that\nare less developed and more volatile or may have\npolitical, legal and regulatory regimes that are\nless established or predictable than other\ncountries in which JPMorgan Chase operates. In\naddition, in some jurisdictions in which JPMorgan\nChase conducts business, the local economy and\nbusiness activities are subject to substantial\ngovernment influence or control. Some of these\ncountries have in the past experienced economic\ndisruptions, including:\n\n\u2022 extreme currency fluctuations\n\n\u2022 high inflation\n\n\u2022 low or negative growth, and\n\n\u2022 defaults or reduced ability to service sovereign\ndebt.\n\nThe governments in these countries have sometimes\nreacted to these developments by imposing\nrestrictive policies that adversely affect the\nlocal and regional business environment, such as:\n\n\u2022 price, capital or exchange controls, including\nimposition of punitive transfer and convertibility\nrestrictions or forced currency exchange\n\n\u2022 expropriation or nationalization of assets or\nconfiscation of property, including intellectual\nproperty, and\n\n\u2022 changes in laws, rules and regulations.\n\nThe impact of these actions could be accentuated in\ntrading markets that are smaller, less liquid and\nmore volatile than more-developed markets. These\ntypes of government actions can negatively affect\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations in the relevant\ncountry, either directly or by suppressing the\nbusiness activities of local clients or multi-\nnational clients that conduct business in the\njurisdiction.\n\nIn addition, emerging markets countries, as well as\nmore developed countries, have been susceptible to\nunfavorable social developments arising from poor\neconomic conditions or governmental actions,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 widespread demonstrations, civil unrest or\ngeneral strikes\n\n\u2022 crime and corruption\n      \n  31  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                                                  \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\n\u2022 security and personal safety issues\n\n\u2022 an outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or\nother geopolitical instabilities\n\n\u2022 overthrow of incumbent governments\n\n\u2022 terrorist attacks, and\n\n\u2022 other forms of internal discord.\n\nThese economic, political, regulatory and social\ndevelopments have in the past resulted in, and in\nthe future could lead to, conditions that can\nadversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations in\nthose countries and impair the revenues, growth and\nprofitability of those operations. In addition, any\nof these events or circumstances in one country can\naffect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations and investments\nin another country or countries, including in the\nU.S.\n                                                                                                            \n  People                                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to attract and retain\nqualified and diverse employees is critical to its\nsuccess.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s employees are its most important\nresource, and in many areas of the financial\nservices industry, competition for qualified\npersonnel is intense. JPMorgan Chase endeavors to\nattract talented and diverse new employees and\nretain, develop and motivate its existing\nemployees. JPMorgan Chase's efforts to retain\ntalented and diverse employees can be particularly\nchallenging when members of its workforce are\ntargeted for recruitment by competitors. If\nJPMorgan Chase were unable to continue to attract\nor retain qualified and diverse employees,\nincluding successors to the Chief Executive\nOfficer, members of the Operating Committee and\nother senior leaders, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s performance,\nincluding its competitive position, could be\nmaterially and adversely affected.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s increased use of hybrid work\nmodels could result in deterioration in employee\nperformance or degradation of JPMorgan Chase's\ncontrol environment which may have a material and\nadverse effect on its business and operations.\nAlternatively, discontinuing hybrid work models\ncould harm JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to attract and\nretain employees.\n\nUnfavorable changes in immigration or travel\npolicies could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbusinesses and operations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase relies on the skills, knowledge and\nexpertise of employees located throughout the\nworld. Changes in immigration or travel policies in\nthe U.S. and other countries that unduly restrict\nor otherwise make it more difficult for employees\nor their family members to work in, or travel to or\ntransfer between, jurisdictions in which JPMorgan\nChase has operations or conducts its business could\ninhibit JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to attract and\nretain qualified employees, and thereby dilute the\nquality of its workforce, or could prompt JPMorgan\nChase to\n\nmake structural changes to its worldwide or\nregional operating models that cause its operations\nto be less efficient or more costly.\n                                                                                                            \n  Legal                                                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \nJPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks from\nlitigation and formal and informal regulatory and\ngovernment investigations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is\notherwise involved in many legal proceedings,\nincluding class actions and other litigation or\ndisputes with third parties. Actions currently\npending against JPMorgan Chase may result in\njudgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other\nsanctions adverse to JPMorgan Chase. Any of these\nmatters could materially and adversely affect\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business, financial condition or\nresults of operations, or cause serious\nreputational harm. As a participant in the\nfinancial services industry, it is likely that\nJPMorgan Chase will continue to experience a high\nlevel of litigation and regulatory and government\ninvestigations related to its businesses and\noperations.\n\nRegulators and other government agencies conduct\nexaminations of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries\nboth on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses and operations are\nsubject to heightened regulatory oversight. This\nheightened regulatory scrutiny, or the results of\nsuch an investigation or examination, may lead to\nadditional regulatory investigations or enforcement\nactions. There is no assurance that those actions\nwill not result in resolutions or other enforcement\nactions against JPMorgan Chase. Furthermore, a\nsingle event involving a potential violation of law\nor regulation may give rise to numerous and\noverlapping investigations and proceedings, either\nby multiple federal, state or local agencies and\nofficials in the U.S. or, in some instances,\nregulators and other governmental officials in\nnon-U.S. jurisdictions.\n\nIf another financial institution violates a law or\nregulation relating to a particular business\nactivity or practice, this will often give rise to\nan investigation by regulators and other\ngovernmental agencies of the same or similar\nactivity or practice by JPMorgan Chase.\n\nThese and other initiatives by U.S. and non-U.S.\ngovernmental authorities may subject JPMorgan Chase\nto judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or\nother sanctions, and may require JPMorgan Chase to\nrestructure its operations and activities or to\ncease offering certain products or services. All of\nthese potential outcomes could harm JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s reputation or lead to higher operational\ncosts, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nprofitability, or result in collateral\nconsequences. In addition, the extent of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s exposure to legal and regulatory matters\ncan be unpredictable and could, in some cases,\nexceed the amount of reserves that JPMorgan Chase\nhas established for those matters.\n      \n  32  \n      \n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                                                                                          \u2502\n\u2502  Item 1B.

Firmwide overview JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $37.7 billion for 2022, down 22%,\nearnings per share of $12.09, ROE of 14% and ROTCE of 18%. \u2022 Total net revenue was $128.7 billion, up 6%,\nreflecting: \u2013 Net interest income of $66.7 billion, up 28%, driven by higher rates and loan growth,\npartially offset by lower Markets net interest income. Net interest income excluding Markets was $62.4\nbillion, up 40%.\n\n\u2013 Noninterest revenue of $62.0 billion, down 11%, driven by lower Investment Banking fees, $2.4 billion of\nnet investment securities losses in Treasury and CIO, lower net production revenue in Home Lending and lower\nauto operating lease income, largely offset by higher CIB Markets revenue and a $914 million gain on the\nsale of Visa Class B common shares (\u201cVisa B shares\u201d) in Corporate. \u2022 Noninterest expense was $76.1 billion,\nup 7%, driven by higher structural expense and continued investments in the business, including\ncompensation, technology and marketing, partially offset by lower volume- and revenue-related expense. \u2022 The\nprovision for credit losses was $6.4 billion, reflecting: \u2013 a net addition of $3.5 billion to the allowance\nfor credit losses, consisting of $2.3 billion in wholesale and $1.2 billion in consumer, driven by loan\ngrowth and deterioration in the Firm\u2019s macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction in the\nallowance related to a decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the\npandemic gradually recede, and \u2013 $2.9 billion of net charge-offs. The prior year provision was a net benefit\nof $9.3 billion, reflecting a net reduction to the allowance for credit losses of $12.1 billion. \u2022 The total\nallowance for credit losses was $22.2 billion at December 31, 2022. The Firm had an allowance for loan\nlosses to retained loans coverage ratio of 1.81%, compared with 1.62% in the prior year. \u2022 The Firm\u2019s\nnonperforming assets totaled $7.2 billion at December 31, 2022, a net decrease of $1.1 billion,\npredominantly driven by lower consumer nonaccrual loans, reflecting improved credit performance and loan\nsales. \u2022 Firmwide average loans of $1.1 trillion were up 6%, driven by higher loans across the LOBs. \u2022\nFirmwide average deposits of $2.5 trillion were up 5%, reflecting: \u2013 growth in CCB from existing and new\naccounts, and net inflows in AWM resulting from the residual effects of certain government actions,\npartially offset by the impact of growth in customer spending in CCB and migration into investments in AWM,\nand \u2013 reductions in CIB and CB due to attrition driven by the rising interest rate environment. Selected\ncapital and other metrics \u2022 CET1 capital was $219 billion, and the Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios\nwere 13.2% and 13.6%, respectively. \u2022 SLR was 5.6%. \u2022 TBVPS grew by 2%, ending 2022 at $73.12.\n                                             \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    47  \n                                             \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n\u2022 As of December 31, 2022, the Firm had average\neligible High Quality Liquid Assets (\u201cHQLA\u201d) of\napproximately $733 billion and unencumbered\nmarketable securities with a fair value of\napproximately $694 billion, resulting in\napproximately $1.4 trillion of liquidity sources.\nRefer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104\nfor additional information.

The cessation of the publication\nof the remaining principal tenors of U.S. dollar\nLIBOR (i.e., overnight, one-month, three-month,\nsix-month and 12-month LIBOR) (\u201cLIBOR Cessation\u201d)\nis scheduled for June 30, 2023.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Firm had significantly\nreduced the notional amount of its exposure to\ncontracts that reference U.S. dollar LIBOR,\nincluding in derivatives, bilateral and syndicated\nloans, securities, and debt and preferred stock\nissuances, and is on-track to meet both its\ninternal milestones for contract remediation as\nwell as the industry milestones and recommendations\npublished by National Working Groups, including the\nAlternative Reference Rates Committee in the U.S.\nThe Firm also continues to engage with clients to\nassist them with transitioning their U.S. dollar\nLIBOR-linked contracts to replacement rates in\nanticipation of LIBOR Cessation. The majority of\nthe Firm\u2019s remaining LIBOR exposure is to\nderivative contracts. The Firm will be\nparticipating in initiatives by the principal\ncentral counterparties (\u201cCCPs\u201d) to convert cleared\nderivatives contracts linked to U.S. dollar LIBOR\nin the second quarter of 2023 which will remediate\napproximately 40% of the Firm\u2019s remaining U.S.\ndollar LIBOR derivatives exposure. The Firm expects\nthat the majority of the remaining derivatives\nexposure will be remediated predominantly through\ncontractual fallback provisions.\n\nOn March 15, 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate\n(LIBOR) Act (\u201cLIBOR Act\u201d) was signed into law in\nthe U.S. The LIBOR Act provides a framework for\nreplacing U.S. dollar LIBOR as the reference rate\nin legacy financial contracts that may not\notherwise transition to a replacement rate upon\nLIBOR Cessation. In addition, the U.K. Financial\nConduct Authority is proposing that the\nadministrator of LIBOR be required to continue to\npublish the one-month, three-month and six-month\ntenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR on a \u201csynthetic\u201d basis\nwhich would allow market participants to use such\nrates through September 30, 2024. This proposal\nwould apply to contracts that are outside the scope\nof the LIBOR Act, including U.S. dollar LIBOR-\nlinked contracts that are not governed by U.S. law.\nBoth the LIBOR Act and the proposed publication of\n\u201csynthetic\u201d LIBOR are intended to facilitate, and\nreduce the risks associated with, the transition\nfrom LIBOR, including the potential for disputes or\nlitigation.\n\nThe Firm continues to make necessary changes to its\nrisk management systems in connection with the\ntransition from LIBOR, including modifications to\nits operational systems and models. In addition,\nthe Firm continues to monitor and evaluate client,\nindustry, market, regulatory and legislative\ndevelopments relating to the transition from LIBOR.\nRefer to Part 1, Item 1A: Risk Factors on pages\n9-32 of the 2022 Form 10-K and to Accounting and\nReporting Developments on page 153 for additional\ninformation.\n                                             \n  50    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                             \n                                      \n  CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  \n                                      \nThis section provides a comparative discussion of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s Consolidated Results of Operations\non a reported basis for the two-year period ended\nDecember 31, 2022, unless otherwise specified.\nRefer to Consolidated Results of Operations on\npages 52-54 of the Firm\u2019s Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 (the\n\u201c2021 Form 10-K\u201d) for a discussion of the 2021\nversus 2020 results.

Refer to\nNote 6 for additional information. 2022 compared with 2021 Investment banking fees decreased in CIB, as\nvolatile market conditions resulted in: \u2022 lower equity and debt underwriting fees due to lower issuance\nactivity, and \u2022 lower advisory fees driven by a lower level of announced deals. Refer to CIB segment results\non pages 67-72 and Note 6 for additional information.

Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment\nresults on pages 63-66, pages 67-72 and pages 73-75, respectively, and Note 6 for additional information.\nAsset management, administration and commissions revenue decreased driven by: \u2022 lower asset management fees\nin AWM resulting from lower average market levels, predominantly offset by the removal of most money market\nfund fee waivers, and net long-term inflows, \u2022 lower custody fees in Securities Services, primarily\nassociated with lower average market values of assets under custody, and \u2022 lower brokerage commissions,\nlargely in AWM, reflecting reduced volumes, partially offset by \u2022 higher commissions on travel-related\nservices and annuity sales in CCB.

The net addition to the\nallowance for credit losses consisted of: \u2022 $2.3 billion in wholesale , driven by deterioration in the\nFirm\u2019s macroeconomic outlook, and loan growth predominantly in CB and CIB, and \u2022 $1.2 billion in consumer ,\npredominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting higher outstanding balances and deterioration in the\nFirm\u2019s macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to a decrease in\nuncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede. The prior\nyear included a $12.1 billion net reduction in the allowance for credit losses. Deterioration in the Firm\u2019s\nmacroeconomic outlook included both updates to the central scenario in the fourth quarter of 2022, which now\nreflects a mild recession, as well as the impact of the increased weight placed on the adverse scenarios\nbeginning in the first quarter of 2022 due to the effects associated with higher inflation, changes in\nmonetary policy, and geopolitical risks, including the war in Ukraine.\n\nNet charge-offs were $2.9 billion, flat compared with 2021, and included: \u2022 a $309 million decrease in Card\nServices, reflecting the ongoing financial strength of U.S. consumers. However, median deposit balances\ndeclined in the second half of 2022, impacted by the growth in consumer spending, offset by \u2022 a $190 million\nincrease in net charge-offs in Auto and Banking & Wealth Management (\u201c BWM\u201d) as net charge-offs in the prior\nyear benefited from government stimulus and payment assistance programs, and an increase of $76 million in\nCIB.

These assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the normal course of\nbusiness due to the amount and timing of cash flows, which are affected by client-driven and risk management\nactivities and market conditions. The Firm believes that cash flows from operations, available cash and\nother liquidity sources, and its capacity to generate cash through secured and unsecured sources, are\nsufficient to meet its operating liquidity needs. \u2022 In 2022, cash provided resulted from higher accounts\npayable and other liabilities, lower securities borrowed, and net proceeds from sales, securitizations, and\npaydowns of loans held-for-sale, partially offset by higher trading assets. \u2022 In 2021, cash provided\nresulted from lower trading assets and higher accounts payable and other liabilities, partially offset by\nhigher securities borrowed and lower trading liabilities.\n\nInvesting activities The Firm\u2019s investing activities predominantly include originating held-for-investment\nloans, investing in the investment securities portfolio and other short-term instruments. \u2022 In 2022, cash\nused resulted from net originations of loans and higher securities purchased under resale agreements,\npartially offset by net proceeds from investment securities. \u2022 In 2021, cash used resulted from net\npurchases of investment securities and higher net originations of loans, partially offset by lower\nsecurities purchased under resale agreements. Financing activities The Firm\u2019s financing activities include\nacquiring customer deposits and issuing long-term debt and preferred stock. \u2022 In 2022, cash used reflected\nlower deposits, partially offset by net proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings. \u2022 In 2021, cash\nprovided reflected higher deposits and net proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings, partially offset\nby a decrease in securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements. \u2022 For both periods, cash was used\nfor repurchases of common stock and cash dividends on common and preferred stock. * * * Refer to\nConsolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 55-56, Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96, and Liquidity\nRisk Management on pages 97-104, and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows on page 163 for a further\ndiscussion of the activities affecting the Firm\u2019s cash flows.\n                                             \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    57  \n                                             \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n                                                    \n  EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM\u2019S USE  \n  OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES                    \n                                                    \n                                                                                                            \n  Non-GAAP financial measures                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial\nStatements in accordance with U.S. GAAP; these\nfinancial statements appear on pages 159-163. That\npresentation, which is referred to as \u201creported\u201d\nbasis, provides the reader with an understanding of\nthe Firm\u2019s results that can be tracked consistently\nfrom year-to-year and enables a comparison of the\nFirm\u2019s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial\nstatements of other companies.\n\nIn addition to analyzing the Firm\u2019s results on a\nreported basis, management reviews Firmwide\nresults, including the overhead ratio, on a\n\u201cmanaged\u201d basis; these Firmwide managed basis\nresults are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm\nalso reviews the results of the LOBs on a managed\nbasis. The Firm\u2019s definition of managed basis\nstarts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP\nresults and includes certain reclassifications to\npresent total net revenue for the Firm (and each of\nthe reportable business segments) on an FTE basis.\nAccordingly, revenue from investments that receive\ntax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented\nin the managed results on a basis comparable to\ntaxable investments and securities. These financial\nmeasures allow\n\nmanagement to assess the comparability of revenue\nfrom year-to-year arising from both taxable and\ntax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax\nimpact related to tax-exempt items is recorded\nwithin income tax expense. These adjustments have\nno impact on net income as reported by the Firm as\na whole or by the LOBs.\n\nManagement also uses certain non-GAAP financial\nmeasures at the Firm and business-segment level\nbecause these other non-GAAP financial measures\nprovide information to investors about the\nunderlying operational performance and trends of\nthe Firm or of the particular business segment, as\nthe case may be, and therefore facilitate a\ncomparison of the Firm or the business segment with\nthe performance of its relevant competitors. Refer\nto Business Segment Results on pages 61-80 for\nadditional information on these non-GAAP measures.\nNon-GAAP financial measures used by the Firm may\nnot be comparable to similarly named non-GAAP\nfinancial measures used by other companies.\n\nThe following summary table provides a\nreconciliation from the Firm\u2019s reported U.S. GAAP\nresults to managed basis.\n                                                                                                            \n                    \u2026                                  \u2026                                  \u2026                 \n         \u2026          \u2026           \u2026          2\u2026          \u2026           \u2026          2\u2026          \u2026           \u2026     \n         \u2026          \u2026           \u2026          R\u2026          \u2026           \u2026          R\u2026          \u2026           \u2026     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026       $  \u2026        $  \u2026       $  4\u2026       $  \u2026        $  \u2026       $  4\u2026       $  \u2026        $  \u2026     \n         \u2026          \u2026           \u2026          6\u2026          \u2026           \u2026          6\u2026          \u2026           \u2026     \n         \u2026          \u2026           \u2026          5\u2026          \u2026           \u2026          5\u2026          \u2026           \u2026     \n         \u2026          \u2026           \u2026          1\u2026          \u2026           \u2026          1\u2026          \u2026           \u2026     \n         \u2026             NA       \u2026          7\u2026             NA       \u2026          6\u2026             NA       \u2026     \n         \u2026          \u2026           \u2026          5\u2026          \u2026           \u2026          5\u2026          \u2026           \u2026     \n         \u2026             NA       \u2026          -\u2026             NA       \u2026          1\u2026             NA       \u2026     \n         \u2026          \u2026           \u2026          5\u2026          \u2026           \u2026          3\u2026          \u2026           \u2026     \n         \u2026          \u2026           \u2026          1\u2026          \u2026           \u2026          6\u2026          \u2026           \u2026     \n      $  \u2026             NA    $  \u2026       $  4\u2026             NA    $  \u2026       $  2\u2026             NA    $  \u2026     \n         \u2026  %          NM       \u2026  %       59  %          NM       \u2026  %       56  %          NM       \u2026  %  \n                                                                                                            \n(a) Predominantly recognized in CIB, CB and Corporate.\n                                             \n  58    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                             \nNet interest income, net yield, and noninterest\nrevenue excluding CIB Markets In addition to\nreviewing net interest income, net yield, and\nnoninterest revenue on a managed basis, management\nalso reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets,\nas shown below.

The management reporting process that\nderives business segment results includes the\nallocation of certain income and expense items. The\nFirm also assesses the level of capital required\nfor each LOB on at least an annual basis. The Firm\nperiodically assesses the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications used\nfor segment reporting, and further refinements may\nbe implemented in future periods. The Firm\u2019s LOBs\nalso provide various business metrics which are\nutilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts\nin assessing performance.\n\nRevenue sharing\n\nWhen business segments join efforts to sell\nproducts and services to the Firm\u2019s clients and\ncustomers, the participating business segments may\nagree to share revenue from those transactions.\nRevenue is generally recognized in the segment\nresponsible for the related product or service,\nwith allocations to the other segment(s) involved\nin the transaction. The segment results reflect\nthese revenue-sharing agreements.\n\nExpense Allocation\n\nWhere business segments use services provided by\ncorporate support units, or another business\nsegment, the costs of those services are allocated\nto the respective business segments. The expense is\ngenerally\n\nallocated based on the actual cost and use of\nservices provided. In contrast, certain costs and\ninvestments related to corporate support units,\ntechnology and operations that are not currently\nutilized by any LOB, are not allocated to the\nbusiness segments and are retained in Corporate.\nExpense retained in Corporate generally includes\ncosts that would not be incurred if the segments\nwere stand-alone businesses, and other items not\naligned with a particular business segment.\n\nFunds transfer pricing\n\nFunds transfer pricing (\u201cFTP\u201d) is the process by\nwhich the Firm allocates interest income and\nexpense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and\ntransfers the primary interest rate risk and\nliquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.\n\nThe funds transfer pricing process considers the\ninterest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of\nassets and liabilities and off-balance sheet\nproducts. Periodically, the methodology and\nassumptions utilized in the FTP process are\nadjusted to reflect economic conditions and other\nfactors, which may impact the allocation of net\ninterest income to the segments.\n\nAs a result of the rising interest rate\nenvironment, the cost of funds for assets and the\ncredits earned for liabilities have generally\nincreased, impacting the business segments\u2019 net\ninterest income. During the period ended December\n31, 2022, this has resulted in higher cost of funds\nfor loans and contributed to margin expansion on\ndeposits.\n                                             \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    61  \n                                             \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nForeign exchange risk\n\nForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs\nand Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain\nrevenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages\nthese risks centrally and reports the impact of\nforeign exchange rate movements related to the\ntransferred risk in its results. Refer to Market\nRisk Management on page 137 for additional\ninformation.\n\nDebt expense and preferred stock dividend\nallocation\n\nAs part of the funds transfer pricing process,\nalmost all of the cost of the credit spread\ncomponent of outstanding unsecured long-term debt\nand preferred stock dividends is allocated to the\nreportable business segments, while the balance of\nthe cost is retained in Corporate. The methodology\nto allocate the cost of unsecured long-term debt\nand preferred stock dividends to the business\nsegments is aligned with the relevant regulatory\ncapital requirements and funding needs of the LOBs,\nas applicable. The allocated cost of unsecured\nlong-term debt is included in a business segment\u2019s\nnet interest income, and net income is reduced by\npreferred stock dividends to arrive at a\n\nbusiness segment\u2019s net income applicable to common\nequity.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for\nadditional information.\n\nCapital allocation\n\nThe amount of capital assigned to each business\nsegment is referred to as equity. The Firm\u2019s\nallocation methodology incorporates Basel III\nStandardized Risk-weighted assets (\u201cRWA\u201d), Basel\nIII Advanced RWA, the global systemically important\nbanks (\u201cGSIB\u201d) surcharge, and a simulation of\ncapital in a severe stress environment. At least\nannually, the assumptions, judgments and\nmethodologies used to allocate capital are\nreassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated\nto the LOBs may change. As of January 1, 2023, the\nFirm has changed its line of business capital\nallocations primarily as a result of updates to the\nFirm\u2019s capital requirements and changes in RWA for\neach LOB.\n\nRefer to Line of business equity on page 93 for\nadditional information on capital allocation.\n

Markets\nincludes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity\nMarkets. Markets revenue consists of principal\ntransactions, fees, commissions and other income,\nas well as net interest income. The Firm assesses\nits Markets business performance on a total revenue\nbasis, as offsets may occur across revenue line\nitems. For example, securities that generate net\ninterest income may be risk-managed by derivatives\nthat are reflected at fair value in principal\ntransactions revenue. Refer to Notes 6 and 7 for a\ndescription of the composition of these income\nstatement line items.\n\nPrincipal transactions reflects revenue on\nfinancial instruments and commodities transactions\nthat arise from client-driven market-making\nactivity. Principal transactions revenue includes\namounts recognized upon executing new transactions\nwith market participants, as well as \u201cinventory-\nrelated revenue\u201d, which is revenue recognized from\ngains and losses on derivatives and other\ninstruments that the Firm has been holding in\nanticipation of, or in response to, client demand,\nand changes in the fair value of instruments used\nby the Firm to actively manage the risk exposure\narising from such inventory. Principal transactions\nrevenue recognized upon executing new transactions\nwith market participants is affected by many\nfactors including the level of client activity, the\nbid-offer spread (which is the\n\ndifference between the price at which a market\nparticipant is willing and able to sell an\ninstrument to the Firm and the price at which\nanother market participant is willing and able to\nbuy it from the Firm, and vice versa), market\nliquidity and volatility. These factors are\ninterrelated and sensitive to the same factors that\ndrive inventory-related revenue, which include\ngeneral market conditions, such as interest rates,\nforeign exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity\nand commodity prices, as well as other\nmacroeconomic conditions.\n                                             \n  70    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n

Net revenue was $11.5 billion, up 15%. Net\ninterest income was $8.2 billion, up 35%, driven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates and growth in\nloans, predominantly offset by the impact of higher funding costs and lower deposits. Noninterest revenue\nwas $3.3 billion, down 15%, driven by lower investment banking revenue and net markdowns on held-for-sale\npositions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio. The decreases were partially\noffset by a gain on an equity method investment received in partial satisfaction of a loan. Noninterest\nexpense was $4.7 billion, up 17%, largely driven by higher volume-and revenue-related expense, as well as\nstructural expense, including higher compensation expense, and expense associated with growth in payments.\nThe provision for credit losses was $1.3 billion, predominantly driven by a net addition to the allowance\nfor credit losses, reflecting deterioration in the Firm\u2019s macroeconomic outlook and loan growth. The\nprovision for credit losses in the prior year was a net benefit of $947 million, driven by a net reduction\nin the allowance for credit losses.\n                                             \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    73  \n                                             \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  CB product revenue consists of the following:                                                             \n  Lendingincludes a variety of financing alternatives, which are primarily provided on a secured basis;     \n  collateral includes receivables, inventory, equipment, real estate or other assets.

Noninterest expense was\n$11.8 billion, up 8%, driven by higher structural expense and investments in the business, largely\ncompensation. The provision for credit losses was $128 million, driven by a net addition to the allowance\nfor credit losses.

Net revenue was $80 million, compared with a loss of $3.5 billion driven by higher net interest income\ndue to higher rates, partially offset by lower noninterest revenue. Noninterest revenue was a loss of $1.8\nbillion, compared with a gain of $68 million driven by: \u2022 higher net investment securities losses on sales\nof U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, and U.S. Treasuries associated with repositioning the investment\nsecurities portfolio, \u2022 the impact of movements in foreign exchange on certain revenues, primarily as result\nof the U.S. dollar strengthening, \u2022 net losses related to cash deployment transactions, which were more than\noffset by the related net interest income earned on those transactions, \u2022 net losses, including hedging\ncosts on an equity method investment related to the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives, and \u2022\nnet losses on certain legacy private equity investments compared with net gains in prior year. partially\noffset by \u2022 a gain on the sale of Visa B shares.

Noninterest expense\nwas $1.0 billion, down $768 million, predominantly driven by: \u2022 lower structural expense reflecting the\nimpact of movements in foreign exchange on certain expenses primarily as a result of the U.S. dollar\nstrengthening, and lower retained technology expense, and \u2022 a lower contribution to the Firm\u2019s Foundation.\npartially offset by \u2022 higher investments, including the costs associated with the Firm's international\nconsumer growth initiatives.

When the Firm extends a\nconsumer or wholesale loan, advises customers and\nclients on their investment decisions, makes\nmarkets in securities, or offers other products or\nservices, the Firm takes on some degree of risk.\nThe Firm\u2019s overall objective is to manage its\nbusiness, and the associated risks, in a manner\nthat balances serving the interests of its clients,\ncustomers and investors, and protecting the safety\nand soundness of the Firm.\n\nThe Firm believes that effective risk management\nrequires, among other things:\n\n\u2022 Acceptance of responsibility, including\nidentification and escalation of risks by all\nindividuals within the Firm;\n\n\u2022 Ownership of risk identification, assessment,\ndata and management within each of the LOBs and\nCorporate; and\n\n\u2022 A Firmwide risk governance and oversight\nstructure.\n\nThe Firm follows a disciplined and balanced\ncompensation framework with strong internal\ngovernance and independent oversight by the Board\nof Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d). The impact of risk and\ncontrol issues is carefully considered in the\nFirm\u2019s performance evaluation and incentive\ncompensation processes.\n                                                                                                            \n  Risk governance framework                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm\u2019s risk governance framework involves\nunderstanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and\nimpacts of risks.\n\nDrivers of risks are factors that cause a risk to\nexist. Drivers of risks include, but are not\nlimited to, the economic environment, regulatory or\ngovernment policy, competitor or market evolution,\nbusiness decisions, process or judgment error,\ndeliberate wrongdoing, dysfunctional markets, and\nnatural disasters.\n\nTypes of risks are categories by which risks\nmanifest themselves. The Firm\u2019s risks are generally\ncategorized in the following four risk types:\n\n\u2022 Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital,\nliquidity or reputation associated with poorly\ndesigned or failed business plans or inadequate\nresponses to changes in the operating environment.\n\n\u2022 Credit and investment risk is the risk associated\nwith the default or change in credit profile of a\nclient, counterparty or customer; or loss of\nprincipal or a reduction in expected returns on\ninvestments, including\n\nconsumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and\ninvestment portfolio risk.\n\n\u2022 Market risk is the risk associated with the\neffect of changes in market factors, such as\ninterest and foreign exchange rates, equity and\ncommodity prices, credit spreads or implied\nvolatilities, on the value of assets and\nliabilities held for both the short and long term.\n\n\u2022 Operational risk is the risk of an adverse\noutcome resulting from inadequate or failed\ninternal processes or systems; human factors; or\nexternal events impacting the Firm\u2019s processes or\nsystems. Operational risk includes compliance,\nconduct, legal, and estimations and model risk.\n\nImpacts of risks are consequences of risks, both\nquantitative and qualitative. There may be many\nconsequences of risks manifesting, including\nquantitative impacts such as a reduction in\nearnings and capital, liquidity outflows, and fines\nor penalties, or qualitative impacts such as damage\nto the Firm\u2019s reputation, loss of clients and\ncustomers, and regulatory and enforcement actions.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s risk governance framework is managed on\na Firmwide basis. The Firm has an Independent Risk\nManagement (\u201cIRM\u201d) function, which is comprised of\nRisk Management and Compliance. The Firm\u2019s Chief\nExecutive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) appoints, subject to\napproval by the Risk Committee of the Board of\nDirectors (the \u201cBoard Risk Committee\u201d), the Firm\u2019s\nChief Risk Officer (\u201cCRO\u201d) to lead the IRM function\nand maintain the risk governance framework of the\nFirm. The framework is subject to approval by the\nBoard Risk Committee through its review and\napproval of the Risk Governance and Oversight\nPolicy.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s CRO oversees and delegates authority to\nthe Firmwide Risk Executives (\u201cFREs\u201d), the Chief\nRisk Officers of the LOBs and Corporate (\u201cLOB\nCROs\u201d), and the Firm\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer\n(\u201cCCO\u201d), who, in turn, establish Risk Management\nand Compliance organizations, develop the Firm\u2019s\nrisk governance policies and standards, and define\nand oversee the implementation of the Firm\u2019s risk\ngovernance framework. The LOB CROs oversee risks\nthat arise in their LOBs and Corporate, while FREs\noversee risks that span across the LOBs and\nCorporate, functions and regions. Each area of the\nFirm giving rise to risk is expected to operate\nwithin the parameters identified by the IRM\nfunction, and within its own management-identified\nrisk and control standards.\n                                                                                                            \n  Three lines of defense                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm\u2019s \u201cthree lines of defense\u201d are as follows:\n\nThe first line of defense consists of each LOB,\nTreasury and CIO, and certain Other Corporate\ninitiatives, including their aligned Operations,\nTechnology and Control Management.

The CMDC also reviews the\ndevelopment of and succession for key executives.\nAs part of the Board\u2019s role of reinforcing,\ndemonstrating and communicating the \u201ctone at the\ntop,\u201d the CMDC oversees the Firm\u2019s culture,\nincluding reviewing updates from management\nregarding significant conduct issues and any\nrelated actions with respect to employees,\nincluding compensation actions. The Public\nResponsibility Committee oversees and reviews the\nFirm's positions and practices on public\nresponsibility matters such as community\ninvestment, fair lending, sustainability, consumer\npractices and other public policy issues that\nreflect the Firm's values and character and could\nimpact the Firm's reputation among its\nstakeholders. The Committee also provides guidance\non these matters to management and the Board, as\nappropriate. The Corporate Governance & Nominating\nCommittee exercises general oversight with respect\nto the governance of the Board of Directors. It\nreviews the qualifications of and recommends to the\nBoard proposed nominees for election to the Board.\nThe Committee evaluates and recommends to the Board\ncorporate governance practices applicable to the\nFirm. It also reviews the framework for assessing\nthe Board\u2019s performance and self-evaluation.\nManagement oversight The Firm\u2019s senior management-\nlevel committees that are primarily responsible for\nkey risk-related functions include: The Firmwide\nRisk Committee (\u201cFRC\u201d) is the Firm\u2019s highest\nmanagement-level risk committee. It oversees the\nrisks inherent in the Firm\u2019s business and provides\na forum for discussion of topics, and issues that\nare raised or escalated by its members and other\ncommittees. The Firmwide Control Committee (\u201cFCC\u201d)\nis an escalation committee for senior management to\nreview and discuss the Firmwide operational risk\nenvironment including identified issues,\noperational risk metrics and significant events\nthat have been escalated. Line of Business and\nRegional Risk Committees are responsible for\noverseeing the governance, limits, and controls\nthat have been established within the scope of\ntheir respective activities. These committees\nreview the ways in which the particular LOB or the\nbusinesses operating in a particular region could\nbe exposed to adverse outcomes, with a focus on\nidentifying, accepting, escalating and/or requiring\nremediation of matters brought to these committees.\n\nLine of Business and Corporate Function Control\nCommittees over see the operational risk and\ncontrol environment of their respective business or\nfunction, inclusive of Operational Risk, Compliance\nand Conduct Risks. As part of that mandate, they\nare responsible for reviewing indicators of\nelevated or emerging risks and other data that may\nimpact the level of operational risk in a business\nor function, addressing key operational risk issues\n, with an emphasis on processes with control\nconcerns and overseeing control remediation. The\nAsset and Liability Committee (\u201cALCO\u201d) is\nresponsible for overseeing the Firm\u2019s asset and\nliability management (\u201cALM\u201d), including the\nactivities and frameworks supporting management of\nthe balance sheet, liquidity risk, interest rate\nrisk, and capital risk. The Firmwide Valuation\nGovernance Forum (\u201cVGF\u201d) is composed of senior\nfinance and risk executives and is responsible for\noverseeing the management of risks arising from\nvaluation activities conducted across the Firm.\nRisk governance and oversight functions The Firm\nmanages its risk through risk governance and\noversight functions. The scope of a particular\nfunction or business activity may include one or\nmore drivers, types and/or impacts of risk. For\nexample, Country Risk Management oversees country\nrisk which may be a driver of risk or an\naggregation of exposures that could give rise to\nmultiple risk types such as credit or market risk.\nThe following sections discuss the risk governance\nand oversight functions that have been established\nto manage the risks inherent in the Firm\u2019s business\nactivities.\n                                                      \n  Risk governance and oversight functions       Page  \n  Strategic Risk                                  85  \n  Capital Risk                                 86-96  \n  Liquidity Risk                              97-104  \n  Reputation Risk                                105  \n  Consumer Credit Risk                       110-115  \n  Wholesale Credit Risk                      116-126  \n  Investment Portfolio Risk                      130  \n  Market Risk                                131-138  \n  Country Risk                               139-140  \n  Climate Risk                                   141  \n  Operational Risk                           142-148  \n  Compliance Risk                                145  \n  Conduct Risk                                   146  \n  Legal Risk                                     147  \n  Estimations and Model Risk                     148  \n                                                      \n                                             \n  84    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                             \n                             \n  STRATEGIC RISK MANAGEMENT  \n                             \nStrategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital,\nliquidity or reputation associated with poorly\ndesigned or failed business plans or inadequate\nresponses to changes in the operating environment.\n                                                                                                            \n  Management and oversight                                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \nThe Operating Committee, together with the senior\nleadership of each LOB and Corporate, is\nresponsible for managing the Firm\u2019s most\nsignificant strategic risks.

The Firm\u2019s ICAAP integrates\nstress testing protocols with capital planning. The\nFirm\u2019s Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing\nand approving the capital planning framework.\n\nStress testing assesses the potential impact of\nalternative economic and business scenarios on the\nFirm\u2019s earnings and capital. Economic scenarios,\nand the parameters underlying those scenarios, are\ndefined centrally and applied uniformly across the\nbusinesses. These scenarios are articulated in\nterms of macroeconomic factors, which are key\ndrivers of business results; global market shocks,\nwhich generate short-term but severe trading\nlosses; and idiosyncratic operational risk events.\nThe scenarios are intended to capture and stress\nkey vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks facing\nthe Firm.

The\nOCC establishes similar minimum capital\nrequirements and standards for the Firm\u2019s IDI\nsubsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nThe U.S. capital requirements generally follow the\nCapital Accord of the Basel Committee, as amended\nfrom time to time.\n\nBasel III Overview\n\nThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum\ncapital ratios and overall capital adequacy\nstandards for large and internationally active U.S.\nBHCs and banks, including the Firm and its IDI\nsubsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nThe minimum amount of regulatory capital that must\nbe held by BHCs and banks is determined by\ncalculating RWA, which are on-balance sheet assets\nand off-balance sheet exposures, weighted according\nto risk. Two comprehensive approaches are\nprescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized\napproach (\u201cBasel III Standardized\u201d), and an\nadvanced approach (\u201cBasel III Advanced\u201d). For each\nof the risk-based capital ratios, the capital\nadequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower\nof the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared\nto their respective regulatory capital ratio\nrequirements. The Firm\u2019s Basel III Standardized\nrisk-based ratios are currently more binding than\nthe Basel III Advanced risk-based ratios.\n\nBasel III establishes capital requirements for\ncalculating credit risk RWA and market risk RWA,\nand in the case of Basel III Advanced, operational\nrisk RWA. Key differences in the calculation of\ncredit risk RWA between the Standardized and\nAdvanced approaches are that for Basel III\nAdvanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-\nsensitive approaches which largely rely on the use\nof internal credit models and parameters, whereas\nfor Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is\ngenerally based on supervisory risk-weightings\nwhich vary primarily by counterparty type and asset\nclass. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally\nconsistent basis between Basel III Standardized and\nBasel III Advanced. In addition to the RWA\ncalculated under these approaches, the Firm may\nsupplement such amounts to incorporate management\njudgment and feedback from its regulators.\n\nBasel III also includes a requirement for Advanced\nApproaches banking organizations, including the\nFirm, to calculate the SLR. Refer to SLR on page 93\nfor additional information.\n\nKey Regulatory Developments\n\nCECL regulatory capital transition.\n\nUntil December 31, 2021, the Firm\u2019s capital\nreflected a two year delay of the effects of CECL\nprovided by the Federal Reserve Board in response\nto the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBeginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9 billion CECL\ncapital benefit is being phased out at 25% per year\nover a three-year period. As of December 31, 2022,\nthe Firm\u2019s CET1 capital reflected the remaining\n$2.2 billion benefit associated with the CECL\ncapital transition provisions.\n\nAdditionally, effective January 1, 2022, the Firm\nphased out 25% of the other CECL capital transition\nprovisions which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted\naverage assets, total leverage exposure and RWA, as\napplicable.\n\nRefer to Note 1 for further information on the CECL\naccounting guidance.\n                                             \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    87  \n                                             \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nStandardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk\n. On January 1, 2022, the Firm adopted\n\u201cStandardized Approach for Counterparty Credit\nRisk\u201d (\u201cSA-CCR\u201d), which replaced the Current\nExposure Method used to measure derivatives\ncounterparty exposure under the Standardized and\nAdvanced approach RWA where internal models are not\nused, as well as leverage exposure used to\ncalculate the SLR in the regulatory capital\nframework. The rule issued by the U.S. banking\nregulators in November 2019 applies to Basel III\nAdvanced Approaches banking organizations, such as\nthe Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\n\nThe adoption of SA-CCR on January 1, 2022 increased\nthe Firm\u2019s Standardized RWA by approximately $40\nbillion based on the Firm's derivatives exposure as\nof December 31, 2021, which resulted in a decrease\nof approximately 30 bps to the Firm's CET1 capital\nratio and a modest decrease in its total leverage\nexposure. In addition, the adoption of SA-CCR\nincreased the Firm's Advanced RWA, but to a lesser\nextent than Standardized RWA.\n                                             \n  88    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                             \nRisk-based Capital Regulatory Requirements\n\nThe following chart presents the Firm\u2019s Basel III\nCET1 capital ratio requirements under the Basel III\nrules currently in effect.\n\nAll banking institutions are currently required to\nhave a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-\nweighted assets.\n\nCertain banking organizations, including the Firm,\nare required to hold additional levels of capital\nto serve as a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d. The\ncapital conservation buffer incorporates a GSIB\nsurcharge, a discretionary countercyclical capital\nbuffer and a fixed capital conservation buffer of\n2.5% for Advanced regulatory capital requirements\nand a variable SCB requirement, floored at 2.5%,\nfor Standardized regulatory capital requirements.\n\nUnder the Federal Reserve\u2019s GSIB rule, the Firm is\nrequired to assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual\nbasis under two separately prescribed methods based\non data for the previous fiscal year-end, and is\nsubject to the higher of the two. \u201cMethod 1\u201d\nreflects the GSIB surcharge as prescribed by the\nBasel Committee\u2019s assessment methodology, and is\ncalculated by the Financial Stability Board (\u201cFSB\u201d)\nacross five criteria: size, cross-jurisdictional\nactivity, interconnectedness, complexity and\nsubstitutability. \u201cMethod 2\u201d, calculated by the\nFirm, modifies the Method 1 requirements to include\na measure of short-term wholesale funding in place\nof substitutability, and introduces a GSIB score\n\u201cmultiplication factor\u201d.\n                                             \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    89  \n                                             \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nThe following table presents the Firm\u2019s effective\nGSIB surcharge for the years ended December 31,\n2023, 2022 and 2021. For 2023, the Firm\u2019s effective\nGSIB surcharge under Method 1 and Method 2 has\nincreased to 2.5% and 4.0%, respectively.\n                                                   \n                   2023         2022         2021  \n  Method 1    2.5     %    2.0     %    2.0     %  \n  Method 2    4.0     %    3.5     %    3.5     %  \n                                                   \nOn November 21, 2022, the FSB released its annual GSIB list based upon data as of December 31, 2021, which\naffirmed the Firm\u2019s Method 1 GSIB surcharge of 2.5% (up from 2.0%), effective January 1, 2023. The Firm\u2019s\nMethod 2 surcharge calculated using data as of December 31, 2021 is 4.5%, which will be effective January 1,\n2024. The Firm\u2019s estimated Method 2 surcharge calculated using data as of December 31, 2022 is 4.5%.\nAccordingly, based on the GSIB rule currently in effect, the Firm\u2019s effective GSIB surcharge is expected to\nincrease to 4.5% on January 1, 2024. The U.S. federal regulatory capital standards include a framework for\nsetting a discretionary countercyclical capital buffer taking into account the macro financial environment\nin which large, internationally active banks function. As of December 31, 2022, the U.S. countercyclical\ncapital buffer remained at 0%. The Federal Reserve will continue to review the buffer at least annually. The\nbuffer can be increased if the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC determine that systemic risks are meaningfully\nabove normal and can be calibrated up to an additional 2.5% of RWA subject to a 12-month implementation\nperiod. Failure to maintain regulatory capital equal to or in excess of the risk-based regulatory capital\nminimum plus the capital conservation buffer (inclusive of the GSIB surcharge) and any countercyclical\nbuffer will result in limitations to the amount of capital that the Firm may distribute, such as through\ndividends and common share repurchases, as well as certain executive discretionary bonus payments. Risk-\nbased Capital Targets The Firm\u2019s current target for its Basel III Standardized CET1 capital ratio is 13.0%\nfor the first quarter of 2023, increasing to 13.5% for the first quarter of 2024 with consideration for an\nincrease in the GSIB surcharge in 2024, and assuming no change in the Stress Capital Buffer. The Firm\u2019s\nquarterly capital ratios may vary from these targets dependent on market conditions. These targets are based\non the Basel III capital rules currently in effect. Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity The Federal Reserve\u2019s TLAC\nrule requires the U.S. GSIB top-tier holding companies, including the Firm, to maintain minimum levels of\nexternal TLAC and eligible long-term debt (\u201celigible LTD\u201d). Refer to TLAC on page 95 for additional\ninformation.\n\nLeverage-based Capital Regulatory Requirements Supplementary leverage ratio Banking organizations subject to\nthe Basel III Advanced approach are currently required to have a minimum SLR of 3.0%. Certain banking\norganizations, including the Firm, are also required to hold an additional 2.0% leverage buffer. The SLR is\ndefined as Tier 1 capital under Basel III divided by the Firm\u2019s total leverage exposure. Total leverage\nexposure is calculated by taking the Firm\u2019s total average on-balance sheet assets, less amounts permitted to\nbe deducted for Tier 1 capital, and adding certain off-balance sheet exposures, such as undrawn commitments\nand derivatives potential future exposure. Failure to maintain an SLR equal to or greater than the\nregulatory requirement will result in limitations on the amount of capital that the Firm may distribute such\nas through dividends and common share repurchases, as well as on certain executive discretionary bonus\npayments. Other regulatory capital In addition to meeting the capital ratio requirements of Basel III, the\nFirm and its IDI subsidiaries must also maintain minimum capital and leverage ratios in order to be \u201cwell-\ncapitalized\u201d under the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and the Prompt Corrective Action (\u201cPCA\u201d)\nrequirements of the FDIC Improvement Act (\u201cFDICIA\u201d), respectively.

ROE is measured and internal\ntargets for expected returns are established as key\nmeasures of a business segment\u2019s performance. The\nFirm\u2019s allocation methodology incorporates Basel\nIII Standardized RWA, Basel III Advanced RWA, the\nGSIB surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a\nsevere stress environment.

Effective July 1, 2021, the Firm became subject to the normal capital\ndistribution restrictions provided under the regulatory capital framework. (b) On March 15, 2020, in\nresponse to the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended\nrepurchases of its common stock. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve directed all large banks, including the\nFirm, to discontinue net share repurchases through the end of 2020.\n\nThe Board of Directors\u2019 authorization to repurchase common shares is utilized at management\u2019s discretion,\nand the timing of purchases and the exact amount of common shares that may be repurchased is subject to\nvarious factors, including market conditions; legal and regulatory considerations affecting the amount and\ntiming of repurchase activity; the Firm\u2019s capital position (taking into account goodwill and intangibles);\ninternal capital generation; and alternative investment opportunities. The $30 billion common share\nrepurchase program approved by the Board does not establish specific price targets or timetables. The\nrepurchase program may be suspended by management at any time; and may be executed through open market\npurchases or privately negotiated transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 plans, which are written trading\nplans that the Firm may enter into from time to time under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934 and which allow the Firm to repurchase its common shares during periods when it may otherwise not be\nrepurchasing common shares \u2014 for example, during internal trading blackout periods.

The CFP also identifies the alternative\ncontingent funding and liquidity resources\navailable to the Firm and its legal entities in a\nperiod of stress. LCR and HQLA The LCR rule\nrequires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is\nsufficient to meet their respective estimated total\nnet cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-\nday period of significant stress. Eligible HQLA,\nfor purposes of calculating the LCR, is the amount\nof unencumbered HQLA that satisfy certain\noperational considerations as defined in the LCR\nrule. HQLA primarily consist of cash and certain\nhigh-quality liquid securities as defined in the\nLCR rule. Under the LCR rule, the amount of\neligible HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nthat is in excess of its stand-alone 100% minimum\nLCR requirement, and that is not transferable to\nnon-bank affiliates, must be excluded from the\nFirm\u2019s reported eligible HQLA.

(d) Excludes average excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not\ntransferable to non-bank affiliates. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR decreased during the three\nmonths ended December 31, 2022, compared with the three months ended September 30, 2022 reflecting a\ndecrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s HQLA, primarily due to a reduction in cash associated with a decline\nin deposits, and loan growth. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s average LCR for the three months ended December\n31, 2022 decreased when compared with the same period in the prior year, reflecting a decrease in JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A.\u2019s HQLA as a result of a reduction in cash from loan growth and a decline in deposits as\nwell as lower market values of HQLA-eligible investment securities. Refer to Note 10 for additional\ninformation on the Firm's investment securities portfolio. The Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average\nLCR fluctuates from period to period due to changes in its eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as\na result of ongoing business activity. Refer to the Firm\u2019s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports, which are available\non the Firm\u2019s website, for a further discussion of the Firm\u2019s LCR. Other liquidity sources In addition to\nthe assets reported in the Firm\u2019s eligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable\nsecurities, such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm believes would be available to raise\nliquidity. This includes excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not\ntransferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair value of these securities was approximately $694 billion and\n$914 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, although the amount of liquidity that could be\nraised at any particular time would be dependent on prevailing market conditions. The fair value decreased\ncompared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to a decrease in excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A., as noted above. The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the FHLBs and the\ndiscount window at the Federal Reserve Banks as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of\napproximately $323 billion and $308 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. This borrowing\ncapacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm\u2019s eligible HQLA or other\nunencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and other\ncentral banks. Available borrowing capacity increased from December 31, 2021 primarily due to increased\ncredit card receivables pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks. Although available, the Firm does not view\nthis borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and the other central banks as a\nprimary source of liquidity.\n                                             \n  98    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                             \n                                                                                                            \n  NSFR                                                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nThe net stable funding ratio (\u201cNSFR\u201d) is a\nliquidity requirement for large banking\norganizations that is intended to measure the\nadequacy of \u201cavailable\u201d stable funding that is\nsufficient to meet their \u201crequired\u201d amounts of\nstable funding over a one-year horizon.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Firm and JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. were compliant with the 100%\nminimum NSFR requirement, based on the Firm\u2019s\ncurrent interpretation of the final rule.

A significant portion of the Firm\u2019s\ndeposits are consumer deposits and wholesale\noperating deposits, which are both considered to be\nstable sources of liquidity. Wholesale operating\ndeposits are considered to be stable sources of\nliquidity because they are generated from customers\nthat maintain operating service relationships with\nthe Firm.\n\nThe Firm believes that average deposit balances are\ngenerally more representative of deposit trends\nthan period-end deposit balances. However, during\nperiods of market disruption those trends could be\naffected.\n\nAverage deposits were higher for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, reflecting:\n\n\u2022 growth in CCB from existing and new accounts\nacross both consumer and small business customers,\npartially offset by a decline in deposits starting\nin the second half of 2022, impacted by growth in\ncustomer spending, and\n\n\u2022 net inflows in AWM resulting from the residual\neffects of certain government actions, partially\noffset by migration into investments starting in\nthe second quarter of 2022 as a result of the\nrising interest rate environment\n\npartially offset by\n\n\u2022 lower average deposits in CIB and CB due to\nattrition, also as a result of the rising interest\nrate environment.\n\nPeriod-end deposits decreased reflecting:\n\n\u2022 attrition in CB and CIB, particularly non-\noperating deposits in CB, partially offset by net\nissuances of structured notes in Markets,\n\n\u2022 net outflows into investments in AWM amid the\nrising interest rate environment, and\n\n\u2022 a decline in balances in existing accounts in CCB\ndue to higher customer spending, predominantly\noffset by net inflows into new accounts.\n\nThe increase in deposits for both spot and averages\nin Corporate was driven by the Firm's international\nconsumer growth initiatives.\n\nRefer to the discussion of the Firm\u2019s Consolidated\nBalance Sheets Analysis and the Business Segment\nResults on pages 55-56 and pages 61-80,\nrespectively, for further information on deposit\nand liability balance trends.\n\nCertain deposits are covered by insurance\nprotection that provides additional funding\nstability and results in a benefit to the LCR.\nDeposit insurance protection may be available to\ndepositors in the countries in which the deposits\nare placed. For example, the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) provides deposit\ninsurance protection for deposits placed in a U.S.\ndepository institution. At December 31, 2022 and\n2021, the Firmwide estimated uninsured deposits\nwere $1,383.7 billion and $1,489.6 billion,\nrespectively, primarily reflecting wholesale\noperating deposits.\n                                              \n  100    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nTotal uninsured deposits include time deposits.

The Firm provides credit\nto a variety of clients and customers, ranging from\nlarge corporate and institutional clients to\nindividual consumers and small businesses. In its\nconsumer businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit\nrisk primarily through its home lending, credit\ncard, auto, and business banking businesses. In its\nwholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit\nrisk through its underwriting, lending, market-\nmaking, and hedging activities with and for clients\nand counterparties, as well as through its\noperating services activities (such as cash\nmanagement and clearing activities), and securities\nfinancing activities. The Firm is also exposed to\ncredit risk through its investment securities\nportfolio and cash placed with banks.\n\nCredit Risk Management monitors, measures and\nmanages credit risk throughout the Firm and defines\ncredit risk policies and procedures. The Firm\u2019s\ncredit risk management governance includes the\nfollowing activities:\n\n\u2022 Maintaining a credit risk policy framework\n\n\u2022 Monitoring, measuring and managing credit risk\nacross all portfolio segments, including\ntransaction and exposure approval\n\n\u2022 Setting industry and geographic concentration\nlimits, as appropriate, and establishing\nunderwriting guidelines\n\n\u2022 Assigning and managing credit authorities in\nconnection with the approval of credit exposure\n\n\u2022 Managing criticized exposures and delinquent\nloans, and\n\n\u2022 Estimating credit losses and supporting\nappropriate credit risk-based capital management\n                                                                                                            \n  Risk identification and measurement                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \nTo measure credit risk, the Firm employs several\nmethodologies for estimating the likelihood of\nobligor or counterparty default. Methodologies for\nmeasuring credit risk vary depending on several\nfactors, including type of asset (e.g., consumer\nversus wholesale), risk measurement parameters\n(e.g., delinquency status and borrower\u2019s credit\nscore versus wholesale risk-rating) and risk\nmanagement and collection processes (e.g., retail\ncollection center versus centrally managed workout\ngroups). Credit risk measurement is based on the\nprobability of default of an obligor or\ncounterparty, the loss severity given a default\nevent and the exposure at default.\n\nBased on these factors and the methodology and\nestimates described in Note 13 and Note 10, the\nFirm estimates credit losses for its exposures. The\nallowance for loan losses reflects estimated credit\nlosses related to the consumer and wholesale held-\nfor-investment loan portfolios, the allowance for\nlending-related commitments reflects estimated\ncredit losses related to the Firm\u2019s lending-related\ncommitments and the allowance for investment\nsecurities reflects estimated credit losses related\nto the investment securities portfolio. Refer to\nNote 13, Note 10 and Critical Accounting Estimates\nused by the Firm on pages 149-152 for further\ninformation.\n\nIn addition, potential and unexpected credit losses\nare reflected in the allocation of credit risk\ncapital and represent the potential volatility of\nactual losses relative to the established\nallowances for loan losses and lending-related\ncommitments. The analyses for these losses include\nstress testing that considers alternative economic\nscenarios as described below.\n                                                                                                            \n  Stress testing                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \nStress testing is important in measuring and\nmanaging credit risk in the Firm\u2019s credit\nportfolio. The stress testing process assesses the\npotential impact of alternative economic and\nbusiness scenarios on estimated credit losses for\nthe Firm. Economic scenarios and the underlying\nparameters are defined centrally, articulated in\nterms of macroeconomic factors and applied across\nthe businesses. The stress test results may\nindicate credit migration, changes in delinquency\ntrends and potential losses in the credit\nportfolio. In addition to the periodic stress\ntesting processes, management also considers\nadditional stresses outside these scenarios,\nincluding industry and country- specific stress\nscenarios, as necessary. The Firm uses stress\ntesting to inform decisions on setting risk\nappetite both at a Firm and LOB level, as well as\nto assess the impact of stress on individual\ncounterparties.\n                                              \n  106    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Risk monitoring and management                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm has developed policies and practices that\nare designed to preserve the independence and\nintegrity of the approval and decision-making\nprocess for extending credit so that credit risks\nare assessed accurately, approved properly,\nmonitored regularly and managed actively at both\nthe transaction and portfolio levels. The policy\nframework establishes credit approval authorities,\nconcentration limits, risk-rating methodologies,\nportfolio review parameters and guidelines for\nmanagement of distressed exposures. In addition,\ncertain models, assumptions and inputs used in\nevaluating and monitoring credit risk are\nindependently validated by groups that are separate\nfrom the LOBs.\n\nConsumer credit risk is monitored for delinquency\nand other trends, including any concentrations at\nthe portfolio level, as certain of these trends can\nbe addressed through changes in underwriting\npolicies and portfolio guidelines. Consumer Risk\nManagement evaluates delinquency and other trends\nagainst business expectations, current and\nforecasted economic conditions, and industry\nbenchmarks. Historical and forecasted economic\nperformance and trends are incorporated into the\nmodeling of estimated consumer credit losses and\nare part of the monitoring of the credit risk\nprofile of the portfolio.\n\nWholesale credit risk is monitored regularly at an\naggregate portfolio, industry, and individual\nclient and counterparty level with established\nconcentration limits that are reviewed and revised\nperiodically as deemed appropriate by management.\nIndustry and counterparty limits, as measured in\nterms of exposure and economic risk appetite, are\nsubject to stress-based loss constraints. Wrong-way\nrisk is the risk that exposure to a counterparty is\npositively correlated with the impact of a default\nby the same counterparty, which could cause\nexposure to increase at the same time as the\ncounterparty\u2019s capacity to meet its obligations is\ndecreasing.\n\nManagement of the Firm\u2019s wholesale credit risk\nexposure is accomplished through a number of means,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 Loan underwriting and credit approval processes\n\n\u2022 Loan syndications and participations\n\n\u2022 Loan sales and securitizations\n\n\u2022 Credit derivatives\n\n\u2022 Master netting agreements, and\n\n\u2022 Collateral and other risk-reduction techniques\n\nIn addition to Credit Risk Management, an\nindependent Credit Review function is responsible\nfor:\n\n\u2022 I ndependently validating or changing the risk\ngrades assigned to exposures in the Firm\u2019s\nwholesale credit portfolio, and assessing the\ntimeliness of risk grade changes initiated by\nresponsible business units; and\n\n\u2022 Evaluating the effectiveness of the credit\nmanagement processes of the LOBs and Corporate,\nincluding the adequacy of credit analyses and risk\ngrading/loss given default (\u201cLGD\u201d) rationales,\nproper monitoring and management of credit\nexposures, and compliance with applicable grading\npolicies and underwriting guidelines.\n\nRefer to Note 12 for further discussion of consumer\nand wholesale loans.\n                                                                                                            \n  Risk reporting                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \nTo enable monitoring of credit risk and effective\ndecision-making, aggregate credit exposure, credit\nquality forecasts, concentration levels and risk\nprofile changes are reported regularly to senior\nmembers of Credit Risk Management. Detailed\nportfolio reporting of industry, clients,\ncounterparties and customers, product and geography\nare prepared, and the appropriateness of the\nallowance for credit losses is reviewed by senior\nmanagement at least on a quarterly basis. Through\nthe risk reporting and governance structure, credit\nrisk trends and limit exceptions are provided\nregularly to, and discussed with, risk committees,\nsenior management and the Board of Directors.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    107  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n                    \n  CREDIT PORTFOLIO  \n                    \nCredit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or\ncustomer.

other loans, largely offset\nby higher retained residential real estate loans.\nThe following discussions provide information\nconcerning individual loan products. Refer to Note\n12 for further information about this portfolio,\nincluding information about delinquencies, loan\nmodifications and other credit quality indicators.\nResidential real estate: The residential real\nestate portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and\nloans at fair value, predominantly consists of\nprime mortgage loans and home equity lines of\ncredit. Retained loans increased compared to\nDecember 31, 2021 reflecting originations, net of\npaydowns. Retained nonaccrual loans decreased from\nDecember 31, 2021 reflecting improved credit\nperformance and loan sales. Net recoveries were\nlower for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared\nto the prior year driven by lower prepayments due\nto higher interest rates, partially offset by lower\ngross charge-offs. Loans at fair value decreased\nfrom December 31, 2021, as warehouse loan sales in\nHome Lending outpaced originations due to higher\ninterest rates and loan sales in CIB outpaced loan\npurchase activity. Nonaccrual loans at fair value\ndecreased from December 31, 2021 driven by net\nportfolio activity in CIB. The carrying value of\nhome equity lines of credit outstanding was $15.7\nbillion at December 31, 2022. This amount included\n$5.1 billion of HELOCs that have recast from\ninterest-only to fully amortizing payments or have\nbeen modified and $5.0 billion of interest-only\nballoon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030.\nThe Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their\nrevolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn\nline to the extent permitted by law when borrowers\nare exhibiting a material deterioration in their\ncredit risk profile. At December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nthe carrying value of interest-only residential\nmortgage loans were $36.3 billion and $30.0\nbillion, respectively. These loans have an\ninterest-only payment period generally followed by\nan adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing\npayment period to maturity and are typically\noriginated as higher-balance loans to higher-income\nborrowers, predominantly in AWM. The interest-only\nresidential mortgage loan portfolio reflected net\nrecoveries for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe credit performance of this portfolio is\ncomparable with the performance of the broader\nprime mortgage portfolio.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the\nFirm\u2019s residential mortgage portfolio insured\nand/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies,\npredominantly loans held-for-sale and loans at fair\nvalue.

The scored Auto net charge-off\nrates were 0.24% and 0.04% for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNonperforming assets The following table presents\ninformation as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, about\nconsumer, excluding credit card, nonperforming\nassets.\n                                                                           \n  Nonperforming assets(a)                                                  \n  December 31, (in millions)                                               \n  Nonaccrual loans                                   2022            2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Residential real estate(b)               $  4,196        $  5,231        \n  Auto and other(c)                             129             119        \n  Total nonaccrual loans                      4,325           5,350        \n  Assets acquired in loan satisfactions                                    \n  Real estate owned                             129             112        \n  Other                                          28              22        \n  Total assets acquired in loan                 157             134        \n  satisfactions                                                            \n  Total nonperforming assets               $  4,482        $  5,484        \n                                                                           \n(a) At December 31, 2022 and 2021, nonperforming\nassets excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past\ndue and insured by U.S. government agencies of $302\nmillion and $623 million, respectively.

A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm\u2019s wholesale businesses is\ngenerally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it\noriginates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations\nand credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth\nreviews of client credit quality and transaction structure, inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of\nindustry, product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 118-121 for further\ninformation. The Firm\u2019s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM, and Corporate, as\nwell as the risk-rated BWM and auto dealer exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is\napplied when determining the allowance for loan losses. In 2022, wholesale credit continued to perform well\nwith charge-offs remaining low. As of December 31, 2022, retained loans increased by $43.3 billion driven by\nCIB and CB, including higher revolver utilization, partially offset by a decline in AWM. Lending-related\ncommitments decreased $14.5 billion, driven by net portfolio activity in CIB, including a decrease in held-\nfor-sale positions in the bridge financing portfolio, largely offset by net portfolio activity in AWM and\nCB. As of December 31, 2022, the investment-grade percentage of the portfolio remained relatively flat at\n70%, while criticized exposure decreased by $6.9 billion from $38.2 billion to $31.3 billion. As of December\n31, 2022, nonperforming exposure decreased by $406.0 million driven by a decline in lending-related\ncommitments in CIB and loans in AWM as a result of client-specific upgrades, paydowns and cancelled\ncommitments, largely offset by client-specific downgrades in CIB including downgrades to certain Russia and\nRussia-associated clients in the first quarter of 2022.

ratings of the reference entity on which protection has been purchased.

commitments\n(including revolving credit facilities) and\nguarantees, to address the financing needs of its\nclients. The contractual amounts of these financial\ninstruments represent the maximum possible credit\nrisk should the clients draw down on these\ncommitments or when the Firm fulfills its\nobligations under these guarantees, and the clients\nsubsequently fail to perform according to the terms\nof these contracts. Most of these commitments and\nguarantees have historically been refinanced,\nextended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn\nupon or a default occurring. As a result, the Firm\ndoes not believe that the total contractual amount\nof these wholesale lending-related commitments is\nrepresentative of the Firm\u2019s expected future credit\nexposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28\nfor further information on wholesale lending-\nrelated commitments. Receivables from customers\nReceivables from customers reflect held-for-\ninvestment margin loans to brokerage clients in\nCIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets\nmaintained in the clients\u2019 brokerage accounts\n(e.g., cash on deposit, and liquid and readily\nmarketable debt or equity securities). Because of\nthis collateralization, no allowance for credit\nlosses is generally held against these receivables.\nTo manage its credit risk, the Firm establishes\nmargin requirements and monitors the required\nmargin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires\nclients to deposit additional cash or other\ncollateral, or to reduce positions, when\nappropriate. These receivables are reported within\naccrued interest and accounts receivable on the\nFirm\u2019s Consolidated balance sheets. Derivative\ncontracts Derivatives enable clients and\ncounterparties to manage risk, including credit\nrisk and risks arising from fluctuations in\ninterest rates, foreign exchange and equities and\ncommodities prices. The Firm makes markets in\nderivatives in order to meet these needs and uses\nderivatives to manage certain risks associated with\nnet open risk positions from its market-making\nactivities, including the counterparty credit risk\narising from derivative receivables. The Firm also\nuses derivative instruments to manage its own\ncredit risk and other market risk exposure. The\nnature of the counterparty and the settlement\nmechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk\nto which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives,\nthe Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the\nderivative counterparty. For exchange-traded\nderivatives (\u201cETD\u201d), such as futures and options,\nand cleared over-the-counter (\u201cOTC-cleared\u201d)\nderivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the\ncredit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible,\nthe Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk\nexposures arising from derivative contracts through\nthe use of legally enforceable master netting\narrangements and collateral agreements. The\npercentage of the Firm\u2019s OTC derivative\ntransactions subject to collateral agreements \u2014\nexcluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are\nnot typically covered by collateral agreements due\nto their short\n\nmaturity and centrally cleared trades that are\nsettled daily \u2014 was approximately 87% and 88% at\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Refer to\nNote 5 for additional information on the Firm\u2019s use\nof collateral agreements and further discussion of\nderivative contracts, counterparties and settlement\ntypes. The fair value of derivative receivables\nreported on the Consolidated balance sheets were\n$70.9 billion and $57.1 billion at December 31,\n2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase was\nprimarily driven by higher foreign exchange as a\nresult of market movements. Derivative receivables\nrepresent the fair value of the derivative\ncontracts after giving effect to legally\nenforceable master netting agreements and the\nrelated cash collateral held by the Firm. In\naddition, the Firm held liquid securities and other\ncash collateral that may be used as security when\nthe fair value of the client\u2019s exposure is in the\nFirm\u2019s favor. For these purposes, the definition of\nliquid securities is consistent with the definition\nof high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR\nrule. In management\u2019s view, the appropriate measure\nof current credit risk should also take into\nconsideration other collateral, which generally\nrepresents securities that do not qualify as high\nquality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The\nbenefits of these additional collateral amounts for\neach counterparty are subject to a legally\nenforceable master netting agreement and limited to\nthe net amount of the derivative receivables for\neach counterparty. The Firm also holds additional\ncollateral (primarily cash, G7 government\nsecurities, other liquid government agency and\nguaranteed securities, and corporate debt and\nequity securities) delivered by clients at the\ninitiation of transactions, as well as collateral\nrelated to contracts that have a non-daily call\nfrequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed\nto return but has not yet settled as of the\nreporting date. Although this collateral does not\nreduce the balances and is not included in the\ntables below, it is available as security against\npotential exposure that could arise should the fair\nvalue of the client\u2019s derivative contracts move in\nthe Firm\u2019s favor. Refer to Note 5 for additional\ninformation on the Firm\u2019s use of collateral\nagreements.

These measures all\nincorporate netting and collateral benefits, where\napplicable.\n\nPeak represents a conservative measure of potential\nderivative exposure, including the benefit of\ncollateral, to a counterparty calculated in a\nmanner that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5%\nconfidence level over the life of the transaction.\nPeak is the primary measure used by the Firm for\nsetting credit limits for derivative contracts,\nsenior management reporting and derivatives\nexposure management.\n\nDRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk\nof derivative exposure, including the benefit of\ncollateral, on a basis intended to be equivalent to\nthe risk of loan exposures. DRE is a less extreme\nmeasure of potential credit loss than Peak and is\nused as an input for aggregating derivative credit\nrisk exposures with loans and other credit risk.\n\nFinally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair\nvalue of the Firm\u2019s derivative exposure, including\nthe benefit of collateral, at future time periods.\nAVG over the total life of the derivative contract\nis used as the primary metric for pricing purposes\nand is used to calculate credit risk capital and\nCVA, as further described below.\n\nThe fair value of the Firm\u2019s derivative receivables\nincorporates CVA to reflect the credit quality of\ncounterparties. CVA is based on the Firm\u2019s AVG to a\ncounterparty and the counterparty\u2019s credit spread\nin the credit derivatives market. The Firm believes\nthat active risk management is essential to\ncontrolling the dynamic credit risk in the\nderivatives portfolio. In addition, the Firm\u2019s risk\n\nmanagement process for derivatives exposures takes\ninto consideration the potential impact of wrong-\nway risk, which is broadly defined as the risk that\nexposure to a counterparty is positively correlated\nwith the impact of a default by the same\ncounterparty, which could cause exposure to\nincrease at the same time as the counterparty\u2019s\ncapacity to meet its obligations is decreasing.\nMany factors may influence the nature and magnitude\nof these correlations over time. To the extent that\nthese correlations are identified, the Firm may\nadjust the CVA associated with a particular\ncounterparty\u2019s AVG. The Firm risk manages exposure\nto changes in CVA by entering into credit\nderivative contracts, as well as interest rate,\nforeign exchange, equity and commodity derivative\ncontracts.\n\nThe below graph shows exposure profiles to the\nFirm\u2019s current derivatives portfolio over the next\n10 years as calculated by the Peak, DRE and AVG\nmetrics. The three measures generally show that\nexposure will decline after the first year, if no\nnew trades are added to the portfolio.\n                                                                                                            \n  Exposure profile of derivatives measures                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \nDecember 31, 2022\n\n(in billions)\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    125  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nCredit derivatives The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in its capacity as a\nmarket-maker, and second, as an end-user to manage the Firm\u2019s own credit risk associated with various\nexposures.

(b) Prior-period amount has been revised to\nconform with the current presentation The credit\nderivatives used in credit portfolio management\nactivities do not qualify for hedge accounting\nunder U.S. GAAP; these derivatives are reported at\nfair value, with gains and losses recognized in\nprincipal transactions revenue. In contrast, the\nloans and lending-related commitments being risk-\nmanaged are accounted for on an accrual basis. This\nasymmetry in accounting treatment, between loans\nand lending-related commitments and the credit\nderivatives used in credit portfolio management\nactivities, causes earnings volatility that is not\nrepresentative, in the Firm\u2019s view, of the true\nchanges in value of the Firm\u2019s overall credit\nexposure. The effectiveness of credit default swaps\n(\u201cCDS\u201d) as a hedge against the Firm\u2019s exposures may\nvary depending on a number of factors, including\nthe named reference entity (i.e., the Firm may\nexperience losses on specific exposures that are\ndifferent than the named reference entities in the\npurchased CDS); the contractual terms of the CDS\n(which may have a defined credit event that does\nnot align with an actual loss realized by the\nFirm); and the maturity of the Firm\u2019s CDS\nprotection (which in some cases may be shorter than\nthe Firm\u2019s exposures). However, the Firm generally\nseeks to purchase credit protection with a maturity\ndate that is the same or similar to the maturity\ndate of the exposure for which the protection was\npurchased, and remaining differences in maturity\nare actively monitored and managed by the Firm.\nRefer to Credit derivatives in Note 5 for further\ninformation on credit derivatives and derivatives\nused in credit portfolio management activities.\n                                              \n  126    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                               \n  ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  \n                               \nThe Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement's estimate of expected credit losses\nover the remaining expected life of the Firm's\nfinancial assets measured at amortized cost and\ncertain off-balance sheet lending-related\ncommitments. The Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses\ncomprises: \u2022 the allowance for loan losses, which\ncovers the Firm\u2019s retained loan portfolios (scored\nand risk-rated) and is presented separately on the\nConsolidated balance sheets, \u2022 the allowance for\nlending-related commitments, which is reflected in\naccounts payable and other liabilities on the\nConsolidated balance sheets, and \u2022 the allowance\nfor credit losses on investment securities, which\nis reflected in investment securities on the\nConsolidated balance sheets. Discussion of changes\nin the allowance The allowance for credit losses as\nof December 31, 2022 was $22.2 billion , reflecting\na net addition of $3.5 billion from December 31,\n2021, consisting of: \u2022 $2.3 billion in wholesale,\ndriven by deterioration in the Firm\u2019s macroeconomic\noutlook and loan growth, predominantly in CB and\nCIB, and \u2022 $1.2 billion in consumer, predominantly\ndriven by Card Services, reflecting higher\noutstanding balances and deterioration in the\nFirm\u2019s macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a\nreduction in the allowance related to a decrease in\nuncertainty associated with borrower behavior as\nthe effects of the pandemic gradually recede.\nDeterioration in the Firm\u2019s macroeconomic outlook\nincluded both updates to the central scenario in\nthe fourth quarter of 2022, which now reflects a\nmild recession, as well as the impact of the\nincreased weight placed on the adverse scenarios\nbeginning in the first quarter of 2022 due to the\neffects associated with higher inflation, changes\nin monetary policy, and geopolitical risks,\nincluding the war in Ukraine. The Firm's allowance\nfor credit losses is estimated using a weighted\naverage of five internally developed macroeconomic\nscenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more\npunitive macroeconomic factors than the central\ncase assumptions provided in the table below,\nresulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment\nrate peaking at 5.6% in the second quarter of 2024,\nand a 1.2% lower U.S. real GDP exiting the second\nquarter of 2024.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s central case assumptions reflected U.S.\nunemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:\n                                                                                               \n                                    Assumptions at December 31, 2022                           \n                                                                2Q23       4Q23       2Q24     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. unemployment rate(a)                                      3.8  %     4.3  %     5.0  %  \n  YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                                 1.5  %     0.4  %       \u2014  %  \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                                    Assumptions at December 31, 2021                           \n                                                                2Q22       4Q22       2Q23     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. unemployment rate(a)                                      4.2  %     4.0  %     3.9  %  \n  YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                                 3.1  %     2.8  %     2.1  %  \n                                                                                               \n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S.\nunemployment rate.

The investment securities portfolio is\npredominantly held by Treasury and CIO in\nconnection with the Firm's balance sheet and asset-\nliability management objectives. Principal\ninvestments are predominantly privately-held\nfinancial instruments and are managed in the LOBs\nand Corporate. Investments are typically intended\nto be held over extended periods and, accordingly,\nthe Firm has no expectation for short-term realized\ngains with respect to these investments. Investment\nsecurities risk Investment securities risk includes\nthe exposure associated with a default in the\npayment of principal and interest. This risk is\nmitigated given that the investment securities\nportfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly\nconsists of high-quality securities. At December\n31, 2022, the Treasury and CIO investment\nsecurities portfolio, net of the allowance for\ncredit losses, was $629.3 billion, and the average\ncredit rating of the securities comprising the\nportfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings\nwhere available, and where not available, based\nprimarily upon internal risk ratings). Refer to\nCorporate segment results on pages 79-80 and Note\n10 for further information on the investment\nsecurities portfolio and internal risk ratings.\nRefer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104\nfor further information on related liquidity risk.\nRefer to Market Risk Management on pages 131-138\nfor further information on the market risk inherent\nin the portfolio. Governance and oversight\nInvestment securities risks are governed by the\nFirm\u2019s Risk Appetite framework, and reviewed at the\nCTC Risk Committee with regular updates provided to\nthe Board Risk Committee. The Firm\u2019s independent\ncontrol functions are responsible for reviewing the\nappropriateness of the carrying value of investment\nsecurities in accordance with relevant policies.\nApproved levels for investment securities are\nestablished for each risk category, including\ncapital and credit risks.\n\nPrincipal investment risk Principal investments are\ntypically privately-held financial instruments\nrepresenting ownership interests or other forms of\njunior capital. In general, principal investments\ninclude tax-oriented investments and investments\nmade to enhance or accelerate the Firm\u2019s business\nstrategies and exclude those that are consolidated\non the Firm's balance sheets. These investments are\nmade by dedicated investing businesses or as part\nof a broader business strategy.

Governance and\noversight The Firm\u2019s approach to managing principal\nrisk is consistent with the Firm\u2019s risk governance\nstructure. The Firm has established a Firmwide risk\npolicy framework for all principal investing\nactivities that includes approval by executives who\nare independent from the investing businesses, as\nappropriate. The Firm\u2019s independent control\nfunctions are responsible for reviewing the\nappropriateness of the carrying value of\ninvestments in accordance with relevant policies.\nAs part of the risk governance structure, approved\nlevels for investments are established and\nmonitored for each relevant business or segment in\norder to manage the overall size of the portfolios.\nThe Firm also conducts stress testing on these\nportfolios using specific scenarios that estimate\nlosses based on significant market moves and/or\nother risk events.\n                                              \n  130    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                          \n  MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT  \n                          \nMarket risk is the risk associated with the effect\nof changes in market factors such as interest and\nforeign exchange rates, equity and commodity\nprices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on\nthe value of assets and liabilities held for both\nthe short and long term.\n                                                                                                            \n  Market Risk Management                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nMarket Risk Management monitors market risks\nthroughout the Firm and defines market risk\npolicies and procedures.\n\nMarket Risk Management seeks to manage risk,\nfacilitate efficient risk/return decisions, reduce\nvolatility in operating performance and provide\ntransparency into the Firm\u2019s market risk profile\nfor senior management, the Board of Directors and\nregulators. Market Risk Management is responsible\nfor the following functions:\n\n\u2022 Maintaining a market risk policy framework\n\n\u2022 Independently measuring, monitoring and\ncontrolling LOB, Corporate, and Firmwide market\nrisk\n\n\u2022 Defining, approving and monitoring of limits\n\n\u2022 Performing stress testing and qualitative risk\nassessments\n                                                                                                            \n  Risk measurement                                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \nMeasures used to capture market risk\n\nThere is no single measure to capture market risk\nand therefore Market Risk Management uses various\nmetrics, both statistical and nonstatistical, to\nassess risk including:\n\n\u2022 Value-at-risk (VaR)\n\n\u2022 Stress testing\n\n\u2022 Profit and loss drawdowns\n\n\u2022 Earnings-at-risk\n\n\u2022 Other sensitivity-based measures\n                                                                                                            \n  Risk monitoring and control                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nMarket risk exposure is managed primarily through a\nseries of limits set in the context of the market\nenvironment and business strategy. In setting\nlimits, Market Risk Management takes into\nconsideration factors such as market volatility,\nproduct liquidity, accommodation of client\nbusiness, and management judgment. Market Risk\nManagement maintains different levels of limits.\nFirm level limits include VaR and stress limits.\nSimilarly, LOB and Corporate limits include VaR and\nstress limits and may be supplemented by certain\nnonstatistical risk measures such as profit and\nloss drawdowns. Limits may also be set within the\nLOBs and Corporate, as well as at the legal entity\nlevel.\n\nMarket Risk Management sets limits and regularly\nreviews and updates them as appropriate. Senior\nmanagement is responsible for reviewing and\napproving certain of these risk limits on an\nongoing basis. Limits that have not been reviewed\nwithin specified time periods by Market Risk\nManagement are reported to senior management. The\nLOBs and Corporate are responsible for adhering to\nestablished limits against which exposures are\nmonitored and reported.\n\nLimit breaches are required to be reported in a\ntimely manner to limit approvers, which include\nMarket Risk Management and senior management. In\nthe event of a breach, Market Risk Management\nconsults with senior members of appropriate groups\nwithin the Firm to determine the suitable course of\naction required to return the applicable positions\nto compliance, which may include a reduction in\nrisk in order to remedy the breach or granting a\ntemporary increase in limits to accommodate an\nexpected increase in client activity and/or market\nvolatility. Certain Firm, Corporate or LOB-level\nlimit breaches are escalated as appropriate.\n\nModels used to measure market risk are inherently\nimprecise and are limited in their ability to\nmeasure certain risks or to predict losses. This\nimprecision may be heightened when sudden or severe\nshifts in market conditions occur. For additional\ndiscussion on model uncertainty refer to\nEstimations and Model Risk Management on page 148.\n\nMarket Risk Management periodically reviews the\nFirm\u2019s existing market risk measures to identify\nopportunities for enhancement, and to the extent\nappropriate, will calibrate those measures\naccordingly over time.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    131  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nThe following table summarizes the predominant business activities and related market risks, as well as\npositions which give rise to market risk and certain measures used to capture those risks, for each LOB and\nCorporate.\n\nIn addition to the predominant business activities, each LOB and Corporate may engage in principal investing\nactivities.

The framework\u2019s approach\nassumes that historical changes in market values\nare representative of the distribution of potential\noutcomes in the immediate future. The Firm believes\nthe use of Risk Management VaR provides a daily\nmeasure of risk that is closely aligned to risk\nmanagement decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate\nand, along with other market risk measures,\nprovides the appropriate information needed to\nrespond to risk events.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR is calculated\nassuming a one-day holding period and an expected\ntail-loss methodology which approximates a 95%\nconfidence level. Risk Management VaR provides a\nconsistent framework to measure risk profiles and\nlevels of diversification across product types and\nis used for aggregating risks and monitoring limits\nacross businesses. VaR results are reported to\nsenior management, the Board of Directors and\nregulators.\n\nUnderlying the overall VaR model framework are\nindividual VaR models that simulate historical\nmarket returns for individual risk factors and/or\nproduct types. To capture material market risks as\npart of the Firm\u2019s risk management framework,\ncomprehensive VaR model calculations are performed\ndaily for businesses whose activities give rise to\nmarket risk. These VaR models are granular and\nincorporate numerous risk factors and inputs to\nsimulate daily changes in market values over the\nhistorical period; inputs are selected based on the\nrisk profile of each portfolio, as sensitivities\nand historical time series used to generate daily\nmarket values may be different across product types\nor risk management systems. The VaR model results\nacross all portfolios are aggregated at the Firm\nlevel.\n\nAs VaR is based on historical data, it is an\nimperfect measure of market risk exposure and\npotential future losses. In addition, based on\ntheir reliance on available historical data,\nlimited time horizons, and other factors, VaR\nmeasures are inherently limited in their ability to\nmeasure certain risks and to predict losses,\nparticularly those associated with market\nilliquidity and sudden or severe shifts in market\nconditions.\n\nFor certain products, specific risk parameters are\nnot captured in VaR due to the lack of liquidity\nand availability of appropriate historical data.\nThe Firm uses proxies to estimate the VaR for these\nand other products when daily time series are not\navailable. It is likely that using an actual price-\nbased time series for these products, if available,\nwould affect the VaR results presented. The Firm\ntherefore considers other nonstatistical measures\nsuch as stress\n\ntesting, in addition to VaR, to capture and manage\nits market risk positions.\n\nThe daily market data used in VaR models may be\ndifferent than the independent third-party data\ncollected for VCG price testing in its monthly\nvaluation process. For example, in cases where\nmarket prices are not observable, or where proxies\nare used in VaR historical time series, the data\nsources may differ. Refer to Valuation process in\nNote 2 for further information on the Firm\u2019s\nvaluation process. As VaR model calculations\nrequire daily data and a consistent source for\nvaluation, it may not be practical to use the data\ncollected in the VCG monthly valuation process for\nVaR model calculations.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s VaR model calculations are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in response to changes in\nthe composition of the Firm\u2019s portfolios, changes\nin market conditions, improvements in the Firm\u2019s\nmodeling techniques and measurements, and other\nfactors. Such changes may affect historical\ncomparisons of VaR results. Refer to Estimations\nand Model Risk Management on page 148 for\ninformation regarding model reviews and approvals.\n\nThe Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated\nVaR in accordance with regulatory rules\n(\u201cRegulatory VaR\u201d), which is used to derive the\nFirm\u2019s regulatory VaR-based capital requirements\nunder Basel III capital rules. This Regulatory VaR\nmodel framework currently assumes a ten business-\nday holding period and an expected tail loss\nmethodology which approximates a 99% confidence\nlevel. Regulatory VaR is applied to \u201ccovered\u201d\npositions as defined by Basel III capital rules,\nwhich may be different than the positions included\nin the Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR. For example,\ncredit derivative hedges of accrual loans are\nincluded in the Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR, while\nRegulatory VaR excludes these credit derivative\nhedges. In addition, in contrast to the Firm\u2019s Risk\nManagement VaR, Regulatory VaR currently excludes\nthe diversification benefit for certain VaR models.\n\nRefer to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Basel III Pillar 3\nRegulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are\navailable on the Firm\u2019s website, for additional\ninformation on Regulatory VaR and the other\ncomponents of market risk regulatory capital for\nthe Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-\nbased measure and the respective backtesting).\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

the portfolio VaR and the sum of its\nindividual components. This reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across\nLOBs, Corporate, and risk types.\n\n(b) In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's internal model governance, the credit risk\ncomponent of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening\nof the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to\nmaintain consistency. This exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.\n\n(c) In March 2022, the effects of nickel price increases and the associated volatility in the nickel market\nresulted in elevated average and maximum Credit Portfolio VaR.\n\n(d) The decrease in Corporate and other LOB VaR was driven by lower market values for a legacy private\nequity position in Corporate which is publicly traded.\n\n(e) The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the\ncomponents, and consequently, diversification benefit is not meaningful.\n\nAverage Total VaR increased by $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 when compared with the prior\nyear. The increase was driven by the effects of nickel price increases and the associated volatility in the\nnickel market observed in March 2022 impacting Credit Portfolio VaR, predominantly offset by a decrease in\nCorporate and other LOB VaR.\n\nThe following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the four trailing quarters. The movement in VaR\nin March 2022 was driven by changes in nickel-related counterparty exposure in the Firm's Credit Portfolio.\n                                                                                                            \n                                         Daily Risk Management VaR                                          \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                      \n  First Quarter    Second Quarter    Third Quarter    Fourth Quarter  \n  2022             2022              2022             2022            \n                                                                      \n                                              \n  134    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  VaR backtesting                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the\ndaily gains and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the\nchart below do not reflect the Firm\u2019s reported revenue as they exclude certain components of total net\nrevenue, such as those associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven\ntrading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, other valuation adjustments and net\ninterest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or\nloss on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the\nrequirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.\n\nA backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the\nprior day. Under the Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are\nconsistent with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR\nbacktesting exceptions five times every 100 trading days on average. The number of VaR backtesting\nexceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the\ncurrent level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility during the 12\nmonths of historical data used in the VaR calculation.\n\nFor the 12 months ended December 31, 2022, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 136 of the 259 days, and\nobserved 17 VaR backtesting exceptions. Firmwide backtesting loss days can differ from the loss days for\nwhich Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets posted losses, as disclosed in CIB Markets revenue, as the\npopulation of positions which compose each metric are different and due to the exclusion of certain\ncomponents of total net revenue in backtesting gains and losses as described above. For more information on\nCIB Markets revenue, refer to pages 70-71.\n\nThe following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the\ntrailing 12 months and three months ended December 31, 2022. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a\npercentage of the corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are\nshown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the\nintervals that are greater than one hundred percent.

While VaR reflects the risk of\nloss due to adverse changes in markets using recent\nhistorical market behavior, stress testing reflects\nthe risk of loss from hypothetical changes in the\nvalue of market risk sensitive positions applied\nsimultaneously. Stress testing measures the Firm\u2019s\nvulnerability to losses under a range of stressed\nbut possible economic and market scenarios. The\nresults are used to understand the exposures\nresponsible for those potential losses and are\nmeasured against limits.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s stress framework covers market risk\nsensitive positions in the LOBs and Corporate. The\nframework is used to calculate multiple magnitudes\nof potential stress for both market rallies and\nmarket sell-offs, assuming significant changes in\nmarket factors such as credit spreads, equity\nprices, interest rates, currency rates and\ncommodity prices, and combines them in multiple\nways to capture an array of hypothetical economic\nand market scenarios.\n\nThe Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus\non tail events in specific asset classes and\ngeographies, including how the event may impact\nmultiple market factors simultaneously. Scenarios\nalso incorporate specific idiosyncratic risks and\nstress basis risk between different products. The\nflexibility in the stress framework allows the Firm\nto construct new scenarios that can test the\noutcomes against possible future stress events.\nStress testing results are reported periodically to\nsenior management of the Firm, as appropriate.\n\nStress scenarios are governed by the overall stress\nframework, under the oversight of Market Risk\nManagement, and the models to calculate the stress\nresults are subject to the Firm\u2019s Estimations and\nModel Risk Management Policy. The Firmwide Market\nRisk Stress Methodology Committee reviews and\napproves changes to stress testing methodology and\nscenarios across the Firm. Significant changes to\nthe framework are escalated to senior management,\nas appropriate.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s stress testing framework is utilized in\ncalculating the Firm\u2019s CCAR and other stress test\nresults, which are reported periodically to the\nBoard of Directors. In addition, stress testing\nresults are incorporated into the Firm\u2019s Risk\nAppetite framework, and are reported periodically\nto the Board Risk Committee.\n                                                                                                            \n  Profit and loss drawdowns                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \nProfit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight\ntrading losses above certain levels of risk\ntolerance. A profit and loss drawdown is a decline\nin revenue from its year-to-date peak level.\n                                                                                                            \n  Earnings-at-risk                                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \nThe effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm\u2019s\nreported net income is important as interest rate\nrisk represents one of the Firm\u2019s significant\nmarket risks. Interest rate risk arises not only\nfrom trading activities but also from the\n\nFirm\u2019s traditional banking activities, which\ninclude extension of loans and credit facilities,\ntaking deposits, issuing debt and the investment\nsecurities portfolio. Refer to the table on page\n132 for a summary by LOB and Corporate, identifying\npositions included in earnings-at-risk .\n\nThe CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm\u2019s\nstructural interest rate risk policy and related\nlimits, which are subject to approval by the Board\nRisk Committee. Treasury and CIO, working in\npartnership with the LOBs, calculates the Firm\u2019s\nstructural interest rate risk profile and reviews\nit with senior management, including the CTC Risk\nCommittee. In addition, oversight of structural\ninterest rate risk is managed through a dedicated\nrisk function reporting to the CTC CRO. This risk\nfunction is responsible for providing independent\noversight and governance around assumptions and\nestablishing and monitoring limits for structural\ninterest rate risk. The Firm manages structural\ninterest rate risk generally through its investment\nsecurities portfolio and interest rate derivatives.\n\nStructural interest rate risk can arise due to a\nvariety of factors, including:\n\n\u2022 Differences in timing among the maturity or\nrepricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance\nsheet instruments\n\n\u2022 Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities\nand off-balance sheet instruments that are maturing\nor repricing at the same time\n\n\u2022 Differences in the amounts by which short-term\nand long-term market interest rates change (for\nexample, changes in the slope of the yield curve)\n\n\u2022 The impact of changes in the maturity of various\nassets, liabilities or off-balance sheet\ninstruments as interest rates change\n\nThe Firm manages interest rate exposure related to\nits assets and liabilities on a consolidated,\nFirmwide basis. Business units transfer their\ninterest rate risk to Treasury and CIO through\nfunds transfer pricing, which takes into account\nthe elements of interest rate exposure that can be\nrisk-managed in financial markets. These elements\ninclude asset and liability balances and\ncontractual rates of interest, contractual\nprincipal payment schedules, expected prepayment\nexperience, interest rate reset dates and\nmaturities, rate indices used for repricing, and\nany interest rate ceilings or floors for adjustable\nrate products.\n\nOne way that the Firm evaluates its structural\ninterest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk.\nEarnings-at-risk estimates the Firm\u2019s interest rate\nexposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is\npresented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which\nincludes net interest income and certain interest\nrate sensitive fees. The baseline uses market\ninterest rates and, in the case of deposits,\npricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations\nof changes to this baseline for interest rate-\nsensitive assets and liabilities denominated in\nU.S. dollars and other currencies (\u201cnon-U.S.\ndollar\u201d currencies). These simulations primarily\ninclude retained loans,\n                                              \n  136    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \ndeposits, deposits with banks, investment\nsecurities, long-term debt and any related interest\nrate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of other\npositions in risk management VaR and other\nsensitivity-based measures as described on page\n132. Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the\npotential change to a net interest income baseline\nover the following 12 months utilizing multiple\nassumptions. These scenarios include a parallel\nshift involving changes to both short-term and\nlong-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield\ncurve involving holding short-term rates constant\nand increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield\ncurve involving increasing short-term rates and\nholding long-term rates constant or holding short-\nterm rates constant and decreasing long-term rates.\nThese scenarios consider many different factors,\nincluding: \u2022 The impact on exposures as a result of\ninstantaneous changes in interest rates from\nbaseline rates. \u2022 Forecasted balance sheet, as well\nas modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior,\nbut excluding assumptions about actions that could\nbe taken by the Firm or its clients and customers\nin response to instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage\nprepayment assumptions are based on the interest\nrates used in the scenarios compared with\nunderlying contractual rates, the time since\norigination, and other factors which are updated\nperiodically based on historical experience.\nDeposit forecasts are a key assumption in the\nFirm\u2019s earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects\ncertain assumptions relating to the reversal of\nQuantitative Easing that are highly uncertain and\nrequire management judgment. Therefore, the actual\namount of deposits held by the Firm, at any\nparticular time, could be impacted by actions the\nFederal Reserve may take as part of monetary\npolicy, including through the use of the Reverse\nRepurchase Facility. In addition, there are other\nfactors that impact the amount of deposits held at\nthe Firm such as the level of loans across the\nindustry and competition for deposits. \u2022 The\npricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit\nbetas, represent the amount by which deposit rates\npaid could change upon a given change in market\ninterest rates. The deposit rates paid in these\nscenarios differ from actual deposit rates paid,\ndue to repricing lags and other factors. The Firm\u2019s\nearnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in response to changes in\nthe composition of the Firm\u2019s balance sheet,\nchanges in market conditions, improvements in the\nFirm\u2019s simulation and other factors. The Firm is\ncurrently evaluating the modeling of repricing lags\nfor deposits in its earnings-at-risk scenarios.\nIncorporating repricing lags, in the current\nenvironment, would significantly affect the U.S.\ndollar interest rate scenarios, with higher\ninterest rate scenarios expected to result in a\npositive impact, and lower interest rate scenarios\nexpected to result in a negative impact, on the\nFirm\u2019s earnings-at-risk. While a relevant measure\nof the\n\nFirm\u2019s interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk\nanalysis does not represent a forecast of the\nFirm\u2019s net interest income (Refer to Outlook on\npage 49 for additional information) .

These tailored stress results are used to\ninform potential risk reduction across the Firm, as necessary. Risk reporting Country exposure and stress\nare measured and reported regularly, and used by Country Risk Management to identify trends and monitor high\nusages and breaches against limits. For country risk management purposes, the Firm may report exposure to\njurisdictions that are not fully autonomous, including Special Administrative Regions (\u201cSAR\u201d) and dependent\nterritories, separately from the independent sovereign states with which they are associated. The following\ntable presents the Firm\u2019s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of December 31, 2022, and\ntheir comparative exposures as of December 31, 2021. The selection of countries represents the Firm\u2019s\nlargest total exposures by individual country, based on the Firm\u2019s internal country risk management\napproach, and does not represent the Firm\u2019s view of any existing or potentially adverse credit conditions.\nCountry exposures may fluct uate from period to period due to client activity and market flows. The increase\nin exposure to Germany and the decrease in exposure to the U.K. were primarily due to changes in cash\nplacements with the central banks of those countries driven by balance sheet and liquidity management\nactivities. The decrease in exposure to Australia was driven by reductions in cash placed with the central\nbank of Australia and government debt securities, due to client-driven market-making activities and lower\nclient cash deposits resulting from higher interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, exposure to Russia was\napproximately $500 million. This amount excludes certain deposits placed on behalf of clients, largely at\nthe Russian National Settlement Depository. In accordance with requirements of the Bank of Russia, these\ndeposits were transferred to the Depository Insurance Agency of Russia on February 3, 2023.\n                                                                                                            \n  Top 20                                                                                                    \n  country\u2026                                                                                                  \n  (exclud\u2026                                                                                                  \n  the                                                                                                       \n  U.S.)(a)            2022                                                                                  \n  December        Deposits                         Trading                                         2021(f)  \n  31,  (in            with                             and                           Total           Total  \n  billion\u2026        banks(b)       Lending(\u2026       investin\u2026       Other(e)         exposure        exposure  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Germany     $       79.5    $       11.3    $        1.9    $       0.5    $        93.2    $       61.7  \n  United              30.8            23.0            14.5            1.8             70.1            96.4  \n  Kingdom                                                                                                   \n  Japan               48.2             3.1             4.2            0.3             55.8            45.5  \n  Austral\u2026            15.9             6.2             3.6              \u2014             25.7            39.1  \n  France               0.4            11.4             2.6            3.7             18.1            14.0  \n  Brazil               4.2             4.9             8.7              \u2014             17.8            12.0  \n  Switzer\u2026             8.8             3.3             1.6            1.6             15.3            20.9  \n  Canada               2.6            10.2             1.5            0.1             14.4            16.9  \n  China                2.5             5.7             5.5              \u2014             13.7            18.6  \n  South                1.4             3.5             4.9            0.2             10.0             8.7  \n  Korea                                                                                                     \n  Singapo\u2026             1.2             4.6             3.7            0.4              9.9            12.3  \n  Belgium              6.3             1.7             1.2              \u2014              9.2             6.8  \n  India                1.3             4.0             2.8            0.9              9.0            14.7  \n  Saudi                0.7             5.6             1.6              \u2014              7.9             9.1  \n  Arabia                                                                                                    \n  Netherl\u2026             0.2             7.2            -0.8            0.5              7.1             6.8  \n  Spain                0.4             4.9             0.5              \u2014              5.8            10.1  \n  Mexico               0.5             4.4             0.5              \u2014              5.4             4.9  \n  Luxembo\u2026             0.9             2.9             1.5              \u2014              5.3            11.5  \n  Hong                 2.8             0.9             0.7            0.1              4.5             5.9  \n  Kong SAR                                                                                                  \n  Sweden               1.1             3.1             0.2              \u2014              4.4             4.4  \n                                                                                                            \n(a) Country exposures presented in the table\nreflect 87% and 88% of total F irmwide non-U.S.\nexposure, where exposure is attributed to an\nindividual country, at December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively.

Climate risk is categorized into physical\nrisk and transition risk.\n\nPhysical risk refers to economic costs and\nfinancial loss associated with a changing climate.\nAcute physical risk drivers include the increased\nfrequency or severity of climate and weather\nevents, such as floods, wildfires and tropical\nstorms. Chronic physical risk drivers include more\ngradual shifts in the climate, such as rising sea\nlevels, persistent changes in precipitation levels\nand increases in average ambient temperatures.\n\nTransition risk refers to the financial and\neconomic implications associated with a societal\nadjustment to a low-carbon economy. Transition risk\ndrivers include possible changes in public policy,\nadoption of new technologies and shifts in consumer\npreferences. Transition risks may also be\ninfluenced by changes in the physical climate.\n                                                                                                            \n   Organization and management                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm has a Climate Risk Management function\nthat is responsible for establishing the Firmwide\nframework and strategy for managing climate risk.\nThe Climate Risk Management function engages across\nthe Firm to help integrate climate risk\nconsiderations into existing risk management\nframeworks, as appropriate.\n\nOther responsibilities of Climate Risk Management\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 Setting policies, standards, procedures and\nprocesses to support identification, escalation,\nmonitoring and management of climate risk across\nthe Firm\n\n\u2022 Developing metrics, scenarios, and stress testing\nmechanisms designed to assess the range of\npotential climate-related financial and economic\nimpacts to the Firm\n\n\u2022 Establishing a Firmwide climate risk data\nstrategy and the supporting climate risk technology\ninfrastructure\n\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the\nidentification, assessment and management of\nclimate risks present in their business activities\nand for adherence to applicable climate-related\nlaws, rules and regulations.\n                                                                                                            \n  Governance and oversight                                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm\u2019s approach to managing climate risk is\nconsistent with the Firm\u2019s risk governance\nstructure.

The Control\nManagement Organization, which consists of control\nmanagers within each LOB and Corporate, is\nresponsible for the day-to-day execution of the\nCCOR Framework.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s Global Chief Compliance Officer (\u201cCCO\u201d)\nand FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk\nAppetite is responsible for defining the CCOR\nManagement Framework and establishing the minimum\nstandards for its execution. The LOB and Corporate\naligned CCOR Lead Officers report to the Global CCO\nand FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk\nAppetite and are independent of the respective\nbusinesses or functions they oversee. The CCOR\nManagement Framework is included in the Risk\nGovernance and Oversight Policy that is reviewed\nand approved by the Board Risk Committee\nperiodically.\n\nOperational Risk Identification\n\nThe Firm utilizes a structured risk and control\nself-assessment process that is executed by the\nLOBs and Corporate. As part of this process, the\nLOBs and Corporate evaluate the effectiveness of\ntheir respective control environment to assess\nwhere controls have failed, and to determine where\nremediation efforts may be required. The Firm\u2019s\nOperational Risk and Compliance organization\n(\u201cOperational Risk and Compliance\u201d) provides\noversight of and challenge to these evaluations and\nmay also perform independent assessments of\nsignificant operational risk events and areas of\nconcentrated or emerging risk.\n\nOperational Risk Measurement\n\nOperational Risk and Compliance performs an\nindependent assessment of the operational risks\ninherent within the LOBs and Corporate, which\nincludes evaluating the effectiveness of the\ncontrol environments and reporting the results to\nsenior management.\n\nIn addition, Operational Risk and Compliance\nassesses operational risks through quantitative\nmeans, including operational risk-based capital and\nestimation of operational risk losses under both\nbaseline and stressed conditions.\n\nThe primary component of the operational risk\ncapital estimate is the Loss Distribution Approach\n(\u201cLDA\u201d) statistical model, which simulates the\nfrequency and severity of future operational risk\nloss projections based on historical data. The LDA\nmodel is used to estimate an aggregate operational\nrisk loss over a one-year time horizon, at a 99.9%\nconfidence level. The LDA model incorporates actual\ninternal operational risk losses in the quarter\nfollowing the period in which those losses were\nrealized, and the calculation generally continues\nto reflect such losses even after the issues or\nbusiness activities giving rise to the losses have\nbeen remediated or reduced.\n\nAs required under the Basel III capital framework,\nthe Firm\u2019s operational risk-based capital\nmethodology, which uses the Advanced Measurement\nApproach (\u201cAMA\u201d), incorporates internal and\nexternal losses as well as management\u2019s view of\ntail risk captured through operational risk\nscenario analysis, and evaluation of key business\nenvironment and internal control metrics. The Firm\ndoes not reflect the impact of insurance in its AMA\nestimate of operational risk capital.\n\nThe Firm considers the impact of stressed economic\nconditions on operational risk losses and develops\na forward looking view of material operational risk\nevents that may occur in a stressed environment.\nThe Firm\u2019s operational risk stress testing\nframework is utilized in calculating results for\nthe Firm\u2019s CCAR and other stress testing processes.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for\ninformation related to operational risk RWA, and\nCCAR.\n\nOperational Risk Monitoring and testing\n\nThe results of risk assessments performed by\nOperational Risk and Compliance are used in\nconnection with their independent monitoring and\ntesting compliance of the LOBs and Corporate with\nlaws, rules and regulations. Through monitoring and\ntesting, Operational Risk and Compliance\nindependently identify areas of heightened\noperational risk and tests the effectiveness of\ncontrols within the LOBs and Corporate.\n                                              \n  142    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nManagement of Operational Risk\n\nThe operational risk areas or issues identified\nthrough monitoring and testing are escalated to the\nLOBs and Corporate to be remediated through action\nplans, as needed, to mitigate operational risk.\nOperational Risk and Compliance may advise the LOBs\nand Corporate in the development and implementation\nof action plans.\n\nOperational Risk Reporting\n\nAll employees of the Firm are expected to escalate\nrisks appropriately. Risks identified by\nOperational Risk and Compliance are escalated to\nthe appropriate LOB and Corporate Control\nCommittees, as needed. Operational Risk and\nCompliance has established standards designed to\nensure that consistent operational risk reporting\nand operational risk reports are produced on a\nFirmwide basis as well as by the LOBs and\nCorporate. Reporting includes the evaluation of key\nrisk and performance indicators against established\nthresholds as well as the assessment of different\ntypes of operational risk against stated risk\nappetite. The standards reinforce escalation\nprotocols to senior management and to the Board of\nDirectors.\n                                                                                                            \n  Subcategories and examples of operational risks                                                           \n                                                                                                            \nOperational risk can manifest itself in various\nways. Operational risk subcategories include\nCompliance risk, Conduct risk, Legal risk, and\nEstimations and Model risk. Refer to pages 145,\n146, 147 and 148, respectively for more information\non Compliance, Conduct, Legal, and Estimations and\nModel risk. Details on other select examples of\noperational risks such as cybersecurity, business\nand technology resiliency, payment fraud and third-\nparty outsourcing are provided below.\n\nWar in Ukraine and Sanctions\n\nIn response to the war in Ukraine, numerous\nfinancial and economic sanctions have been imposed\non Russia and Russia-associated entities and\nindividuals by various governments around the\nworld, including the authorities in the U.S., U.K.\nand EU. These sanctions are complex and continue to\nevolve. The Firm continues to face increased\noperational risk associated with addressing these\ncomplex compliance-related matters. To manage this\nincreased risk, the Firm has implemented controls\nreasonably designed to mitigate the risk of non-\ncompliance and to prevent dealing with sanctioned\npersons or in property subject to sanctions, as\nwell as to block or restrict payments as required\nby the applicable regulations.\n\nCybersecurity risk\n\nCybersecurity risk is the risk of the Firm\u2019s\nexposure to harm or loss resulting from misuse or\nabuse of technology by malicious actors.\nCybersecurity risk is an important and continuously\nevolving focus for the Firm. Significant resources\nare devoted to protecting and enhancing the\nsecurity of computer systems, software, networks,\nstorage devices, and other technology assets. The\nFirm\u2019s security efforts are designed to protect\nagainst, among other things, cybersecurity attacks\nby unauthorized parties attempting to obtain access\nto confidential information, destroy data,\n\ndisrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or\ncause other damage.\n\nThe Firm has experienced, and expects that it will\ncontinue to experience, a higher volume and\ncomplexity of cyber attacks against the backdrop of\nheightened geopolitical tensions. The Firm has\nimplemented precautionary measures and controls\nreasonably designed to address this increased risk,\nsuch as enhanced threat monitoring. There can be no\nassurance that the measures taken by the Firm will\nbe successful in defending against cyber attacks.\n\nOngoing business expansions may expose the Firm to\npotential new threats as well as expanded\nregulatory scrutiny including the introduction of\nnew cybersecurity requirements. The Firm continues\nto make significant investments in enhancing its\ncyber defense capabilities and to strengthen its\npartnerships with the appropriate government and\nlaw enforcement agencies and other businesses in\norder to understand the full spectrum of\ncybersecurity risks in the operating environment,\nenhance defenses and improve resiliency against\ncybersecurity threats. The Firm actively\nparticipates in discussions and simulations of\ncybersecurity risks both internally and with law\nenforcement, government officials, peer and\nindustry groups, and has significantly increased\nefforts to educate employees and certain clients on\nthe topic of cybersecurity risks.\n\nThird parties with which the Firm does business or\nthat facilitate the Firm\u2019s business activities\n(e.g., vendors, supply chain, exchanges, clearing\nhouses, central depositories, and financial\nintermediaries) are also sources of cybersecurity\nrisk to the Firm. Third party cybersecurity\nincidents such as system breakdowns or failures,\nmisconduct by the employees of such parties, or\ncyber attacks, including ransomware and supply-\nchain compromises, could affect their ability to\ndeliver a product or service to the Firm or result\nin lost or compromised information of the Firm or\nits clients. Clients are also sources of\ncybersecurity risk to the Firm and its information\nassets, particularly when their activities and\nsystems are beyond the Firm\u2019s own security and\ncontrol systems. As a result, the Firm engages in\nregular and ongoing discussions with certain\nvendors and clients regarding cybersecurity risks\nand opportunities to improve security. However,\nwhere cybersecurity incidents occur as a result of\nclient failures to maintain the security of their\nown systems and processes, clients are responsible\nfor losses incurred.\n\nTo help safeguard the confidentiality, integrity\nand availability of the Firm\u2019s infrastructure,\nresources and information, the Firm maintains a\nInformation Security Program designed to prevent,\ndetect, and respond to cyberattacks. The Board of\nDirectors is periodically provided with updates on\nthe Firm\u2019s Information Security Program,\nrecommended changes, cybersecurity policies and\npractices, ongoing efforts to improve security, as\nwell as the Firm\u2019s efforts regarding significant\ncybersecurity events. In addition, the Firm has a\ncybersecurity incident response\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    143  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nplan (\u201cIRP\u201d) designed to enable the Firm to respond\nto attempted cybersecurity incidents, coordinate\nsuch responses with law enforcement and other\ngovernment agencies, and notify clients and\ncustomers, as applicable. Among other key focus\nareas, the IRP is designed to mitigate the risk of\ninsider trading connected to a cybersecurity\nincident, and includes various escalation points.\n\nThe Global Cybersecurity and Technology Controls\norganization, working with each of the Firm\u2019s LOBs\nand Corporate, is responsible for identifying\ntechnology and cybersecurity risks and is\nresponsible for the controls to manage threats. The\norganization consists of business aligned\ninformation security personnel that are supported\nwithin the organization by the following products\nand services that execute the Information Security\nProgram for the Firm:\n\n\u2022 Cyber Operations\n\n\u2022 Identity & Access Management\n\n\u2022 Governance, Risk & Controls\n\n\u2022 Global Technology Product Security\n\nThe Global Cybersecurity and Technology Controls\ngovernance structure is designed to identify,\nescalate, and mitigate information security risks.\nThis structure uses key governance forums to\ndisseminate information and monitor technology\nefforts. These forums are established at multiple\nlevels throughout the Firm. The forums are used to\nescalate information security risks or other\nmatters as appropriate.\n\nThe IRM function provides oversight of the\nactivities designed to identify, assess, measure,\nand mitigate cybersecurity risk.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s Security Awareness Program includes\ntraining that reinforces the Firm's Information\nTechnology Risk and Security Management policies,\nstandards and practices, as well as the expectation\nthat employees comply with these policies. The\nSecurity Awareness Program engages personnel\nthrough training on how to identify potential\ncybersecurity risks and protect the Firm\u2019s\nresources and information. This training is\nmandatory for all employees globally on a periodic\nbasis, and it is supplemented by Firmwide testing\ninitiatives, including periodic phishing tests. The\nFirm provides specialized security training for\ncertain employee roles such as application\ndevelopers. Finally, the Firm\u2019s Global Privacy\nProgram requires all employees to take periodic\nawareness training on data privacy. This privacy-\nfocused training includes information about\nconfidentiality and security, as well as responding\nto unauthorized access to or use of information.\n\nBusiness and technology resiliency risk\n\nDisruptions can occur due to forces beyond the\nFirm\u2019s control such as the spread of infectious\ndiseases or pandemics, severe weather, power or\ntelecommunications loss, failure of a third party\nto provide expected services, cyberattacks and\nterrorism. The Firmwide Business Resiliency Program\nis designed to enable the Firm to prepare for,\nadapt to, withstand and recover from business\ndisruptions including occurrence of an\nextraordinary event beyond its control that may\nimpact critical business functions and supporting\nassets (i.e., staff, technology, facilities and\nthird parties). The program includes governance,\nawareness training, planning and testing of\nrecovery strategies, as well as strategic and\ntactical initiatives to identify, assess, and\nmanage business interruption and public safety\nrisks.\n\nPayment fraud risk\n\nPayment fraud risk is the risk of external and\ninternal parties unlawfully obtaining personal\nmonetary benefit through misdirected or otherwise\nimproper payment. The Firm employs various controls\nfor managing payment fraud risk as well as\nproviding employee and client education and\nawareness trainings.\n\nThird-party outsourcing risk\n\nThe Firm\u2018s Third-Party Oversight (\u201cTPO\u201d) and Inter-\naffiliates Oversight (\u201cIAO\u201d) frameworks assist the\nLOBs and Corporate in selecting, documenting,\nonboarding, monitoring and managing their supplier\nrelationships including services provided by\naffiliates. The objectives of the TPO framework are\nto hold suppliers and other third parties to a high\nlevel of operational performance and to mitigate\nkey risks, including data loss and business\ndisruptions. The Corporate Third-Party Oversight\ngroup is responsible for Firmwide training,\nmonitoring, reporting and standards.\n                                                                                                            \n  Insurance                                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \nOne of the ways in which operational risk may be\nmitigated is through insurance maintained by the\nFirm. The Firm purchases insurance from commercial\ninsurers and maintains a wholly-owned captive\ninsurer, Park Assurance Company. Insurance may also\nbe required by third parties with whom the Firm\ndoes business.\n                                              \n  144    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                              \n  COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT  \n                              \nCompliance risk, a subcategory of operational risk,\nis the risk of failing to comply with laws, rules,\nregulations or codes of conduct and standards of\nself-regulatory organizations.\n                                                                                                            \n  Overview                                                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \nEach of the LOBs and Corporate hold primary\nownership of and accountability for managing their\ncompliance risk. The Firm\u2019s Operational Risk and\nCompliance Organization (\u201cOperational Risk and\nCompliance\u201d), which is independent of the LOBs and\nCorporate, provides independent review, monitoring\nand oversight of business operations with a focus\non compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations\napplicable to the delivery of the Firm\u2019s products\nand services to clients and customers.\n\nThese compliance risks relate to a wide variety of\nlaws, rules and regulations varying across the LOBs\nand Corporate, and jurisdictions, and include risks\nrelated to financial products and services,\nrelationships and interactions with clients and\ncustomers, and employee activities. For example,\ncompliance risks include those associated with\nanti-money laundering compliance, trading\nactivities, market conduct, and complying with the\nlaws, rules, and regulations related to the\noffering of products and services across\njurisdictional borders. Compliance risk is also\ninherent in the Firm\u2019s fiduciary activities,\nincluding the failure to exercise the applicable\nstandard of care to act in the best interest of\nfiduciary clients and customers or to treat\nfiduciary clients and customers fairly.\n\nOther functions provide oversight of significant\nregulatory obligations that are specific to their\nrespective areas of responsibility.\n\nOperational Risk and Compliance implements policies\nand standards designed to govern, identify,\nmeasure, monitor and test, manage, and report on\ncompliance risk.\n                                                                                                            \n  Governance and oversight                                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \nOperational Risk and Compliance is led by the\nFirm\u2019s Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and\nQualitative Risk Appetite.\n\nThe Firm maintains oversight and coordination of\nits compliance risk through the implementation of\nthe CCOR Management Framework.

The\nCode requires employees to promptly report any\npotential or actual violation of the Code, any Firm\npolicy, or any law or regulation applicable to the\nFirm\u2019s business. It also requires employees to\nreport any illegal conduct, or conduct that\nviolates the underlying principles of the Code, by\nany of the Firm\u2019s employees, clients, customers,\nsuppliers, contract workers, business partners, or\nagents. Training is assigned to newly hired\nemployees upon joining the Firm, and to current\nemployees periodically on an ongoing basis.\nEmployees are required to affirm their compliance\nwith the Code annually.\n\nEmployees can report any potential or actual\nviolations of the Code through the Firm\u2019s Conduct\nHotline by phone or the internet. The Hotline is\nanonymous, except in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions\nwhere laws prohibit anonymous reporting, and is\navailable at all times globally, with translation\nservices. It is administered by an outside service\nprovider. The Code prohibits retaliation against\nanyone who raises an issue or concern in good\nfaith.

The estimation methods\nare of varying levels of sophistication and are\nused for many purposes, such as the valuation of\npositions and measurement of risk, assessing\nregulatory capital requirements, conducting stress\ntesting, evaluating the allowance for credit losses\nand making business decisions. A dedicated\nindependent function, Model Risk Governance and\nReview (\u201cMRGR\u201d), defines and governs the Firm\u2019s\npolicies relating to the management of model risk\nand risks associated with certain analytical and\njudgment-based estimations, such as those used in\nrisk management, budget forecasting and capital\nplanning and analysis.\n\nThe governance of analytical and judgment-based\nestimations within MRGR\u2019s scope follows a\nconsistent approach which is used for models, as\ndescribed in detail below.\n\nModel risks are owned by the users of the models\nwithin the Firm based on the specific purposes of\nsuch models. Users and developers of models are\nresponsible for developing, implementing and\ntesting their models, as well as referring models\nto MRGR for review and approval. Once models have\nbeen approved, model users and developers are\nresponsible for maintaining a robust operating\nenvironment, and must monitor and evaluate the\nperformance of the models on an ongoing basis.\nModel users and developers may seek to enhance\nmodels in response to changes in the portfolios and\nin product and market developments, as well as to\ncapture improvements in available modeling\ntechniques and systems capabilities.\n\nModels are tiered based on an internal standard\naccording to their complexity, the exposure\nassociated with the model and the Firm\u2019s reliance\non the model. This tiering is subject to the\napproval of MRGR. In its review of a model, MRGR\nconsiders whether the model is suitable for the\nspecific purposes for which it will be used. When\nreviewing a model, MRGR analyzes and challenges the\nmodel methodology and the reasonableness of model\nassumptions, and may perform or require additional\ntesting, including back-testing of model outcomes.\nModel reviews are approved by the appropriate level\nof management within MRGR based on the relevant\nmodel tier.\n\nUnder the Firm\u2019s Estimations and Model Risk\nManagement Policy, MRGR reviews and approves new\nmodels, as well as material changes to existing\nmodels, prior to their use. In certain\ncircumstances, exceptions may be granted to the\nFirm\u2019s policy to allow a model to be used prior to\nreview or approval. MRGR may also require the user\nto take appropriate actions to mitigate the model\nrisk if it is to be used in the interim. These\nactions will depend on the model and may include,\nfor example, limitation of trading activity.\n\nWhile models are inherently imprecise, the degree\nof imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by\nthe market or economic environment. This is\nparticularly true when the current and forecasted\nenvironments are significantly different from the\nhistorical environments upon which the models were\ndeveloped, as the Firm experienced during the early\nstages of the COVID-19 pandemic. This increased\nuncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of\njudgment and analytics to inform any adjustments\nthat the Firm may make to model outputs than would\notherwise be the case.\n\nRefer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the\nFirm on pages 149-152 and Note 2 for a summary of\nmodel-based valuations and other valuation\ntechniques.\n                                              \n  148    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                                                  \n  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM  \n                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s accounting policies and use of\nestimates are integral to understanding its\nreported results. The Firm\u2019s most complex\naccounting estimates require management\u2019s judgment\nto ascertain the appropriate carrying value of\nassets and liabilities. The Firm has established\npolicies and control procedures intended to ensure\nthat estimation methods, including any judgments\nmade as part of such methods, are well-controlled,\nindependently reviewed and applied consistently\nfrom period to period. The methods used and\njudgments made reflect, among other factors, the\nnature of the assets or liabilities and the related\nbusiness and risk management strategies, which may\nvary across the Firm\u2019s businesses and portfolios.\nIn addition, the policies and procedures are\nintended to ensure that the process for changing\nmethodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The\nFirm believes its estimates for determining the\ncarrying value of its assets and liabilities are\nappropriate. The following is a brief description\nof the Firm\u2019s critical accounting estimates\ninvolving significant judgments.\n                                                                                                            \n  Allowance for credit losses                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement\u2019s estimate of expected credit losses\nover the remaining expected life of the Firm\u2019s\nfinancial assets measured at amortized cost and\ncertain off-balance sheet lending-related\ncommitments. The allowance for credit losses\ncomprises:\n\n\u2022 The allowance for loan losses, which covers the\nFirm\u2019s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-\nrated),\n\n\u2022 The allowance for lending-related commitments,\nand\n\n\u2022 The allowance for credit losses on investment\nsecurities.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses involves\nsignificant judgment on a number of matters\nincluding development and weighting of\nmacroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of\nhistorical loss experience, assessment of risk\ncharacteristics, assignment of risk ratings,\nvaluation of collateral, and the determination of\nremaining expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note\n13 for further information on these judgments as\nwell as the Firm\u2019s policies and methodologies used\nto determine the Firm\u2019s allowance for credit\nlosses.\n\nOne of the most significant judgments involved in\nestimating the Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses\nrelates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to\nestimate credit losses over the eight-quarter\nforecast period within the Firm\u2019s methodology. The\neight-quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of\nmacroeconomic variables (\u201cMEVs\u201d) that are relevant\nfor exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit\nlosses being driven primarily by a subset of less\nthan twenty variables. The specific variables that\nhave the greatest effect on the modeled losses of\neach portfolio vary by portfolio and geography.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include\nregional U.S. unemployment rates, HPI and U.S. real\nGDP.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S.\nreal GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices,\nU.S. interest rates, corporate credit spreads, oil\nprices, commercial real estate prices and HPI.\n\nChanges in the Firm\u2019s assumptions and forecasts of\neconomic conditions could significantly affect its\nestimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio\nat the balance sheet date or lead to significant\nchanges in the estimate from one reporting period\nto the next.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes\nin any one factor or input might affect the overall\nallowance for credit losses because management\nconsiders a wide variety of factors and inputs in\nestimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes\nin the factors and inputs considered may not occur\nat the same rate and may not be consistent across\nall geographies or product types, and changes in\nfactors and inputs may be directionally\ninconsistent, such that improvement in one factor\nor input may offset deterioration in others.\n\nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate\nmacroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the\nmodeled credit losses determined using its central\nand relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which\nare two of the five scenarios considered in\nestimating the allowances for loan losses and\nlending-related commitments. The central and\nrelative adverse scenarios each included a full\nsuite of MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths\nand peaks/troughs of those variables over the\neight-quarter forecast period.\n\nFor example, compared to the Firm\u2019s central\nscenario shown on page 127 and in Note 13 , the\nFirm\u2019s relative adverse scenario assumes an\nelevated U.S. unemployment rate, averaging\napproximately 1.9% higher over the eight-quarter\nforecast, with a peak difference of approximately\n2.8% in the fourth quarter of 2023; lower U.S. real\nGDP with a slower recovery, remaining nearly 3.1%\nlower at the end of the eight-quarter forecast,\nwith a peak difference of approximately 3.9% in the\nfourth quarter of 2023; and lower national HPI with\na peak difference of approximately 8.4% in the\nthird quarter of 2024.\n\nThis analysis is not intended to estimate expected\nfuture changes in the allowance for credit losses,\nfor a number of reasons, including:\n\n\u2022 The allowance as of December 31, 2022, reflects\ncredit losses beyond those estimated under the\ncentral scenario due to the weight placed on the\nadverse scenarios.\n\n\u2022 The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both\ninterrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this\nanalysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more\nsevere changes in macroeconomic variables.\n\n\u2022 Expectations of future changes in portfolio\ncomposition and borrower behavior can significantly\naffect the allowance for credit losses.\n\nTo demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss\nestimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of December\n31, 2022, the\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    149  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nFirm compared the modeled estimates under its\nrelative adverse scenario to its central scenario.\nWithout considering offsetting or correlated\neffects in other qualitative components of the\nFirm\u2019s allowance for credit losses, the comparison\nbetween these two scenarios for the exposures below\nreflect the following differences: \u2022 An increase of\napproximately $500 million for residential real\nestate loans and lending-related commitments \u2022 An\nincrease of approximately $2.2 billion for credit\ncard loans \u2022 An increase of approximately $3.9\nbillion for wholesale loans and lending-related\ncommitments This analysis relates only to the\nmodeled credit loss estimates and is not intended\nto estimate changes in the overall allowance for\ncredit losses as it does not reflect any potential\nchanges in other adjustments to the quantitative\ncalculation, which would also be influenced by the\njudgment management applies to the modeled lifetime\nloss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and\nimprecision of these modeled lifetime loss\nestimates based on then-current circumstances and\nconditions. Recognizing that forecasts of\nmacroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain,\nparticularly in light of the recent economic\nconditions, the Firm believes that its process to\nconsider the available information and associated\nrisks and uncertainties is appropriately governed\nand that its estimates of expected credit losses\nwere reasonable and appropriate for the period\nended December 31, 2022 .\n\nFair value JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its\nassets and liabilities at fair value. The majority\nof such assets and liabilities are measured at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis, including derivatives,\nstructured note products and certain securities\nfinancing agreements.

Estimating fair\nvalue requires the application of judgment. The\ntype and level of judgment required is largely\ndependent on the amount of observable market\ninformation available to the Firm. For instruments\nvalued using internally developed valuation models\nand other valuation techniques that use significant\nunobservable inputs and are therefore classified\nwithin level 3 of the fair value hierarchy,\njudgments used to estimate fair value are more\nsignificant than those required when estimating the\nfair value of instruments classified within levels\n1 and 2.\n\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an\ninstrument within level 3, management must first\ndetermine the appropriate valuation model or other\nvaluation technique to use. Second, the lack of\nobservability of certain significant inputs\nrequires management to assess relevant empirical\ndata in deriving valuation inputs including, for\nexample, transaction details, yield curves,\ninterest rates, prepayment speed, default rates,\nvolatilities, correlations, prices (such as\ncommodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of\ncomparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and\ncredit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further\ndiscussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments,\nincluding unobservable inputs used.\n\nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3,\nmanagement judgment must be applied to assess the\nappropriate level of valuation adjustments to\nreflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm\u2019s\ncreditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity\nconsiderations, unobservable parameters, and for\nportfolios that meet specified criteria, the size\nof the net open risk position. The judgments made\nare typically affected by the type of product and\nits specific contractual terms, and the level of\nliquidity for the product or within the market as a\nwhole. In periods of heightened market volatility\nand uncertainty judgments are further affected by\nthe wider variation of reasonable valuation\nestimates, particularly for positions that are less\nliquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of\nvaluation adjustments applied by the Firm.\n\nImprecision in estimating unobservable market\ninputs or other factors can affect the amount of\ngain or loss recorded for a particular position.\nFurthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation\nmethods are appropriate and consistent with those\nof other market participants, the methods and\nassumptions used reflect management judgment and\nmay vary across the Firm\u2019s businesses and\nportfolios.\n\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions\nin the determination of fair value. The use of\nmethodologies or assumptions different than those\nused by the Firm could result in a different\nestimate of fair value at the reporting date. Refer\nto Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm\u2019s\nvaluation process and hierarchy, and its\ndetermination of fair value for individual\nfinancial instruments.\n                                                                                                            \n  Goodwill impairment                                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \nUnder U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to\nreporting units and tested for impairment at least\nannually. The Firm\u2019s process and methodology used\nto conduct goodwill impairment testing is described\nin Note 15.\n\nManagement applies significant judgment when\ntesting goodwill for impairment. The goodwill\nassociated with each business combination is\nallocated to the related reporting units for\ngoodwill impairment testing.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Firm\nreviewed current economic conditions, estimated\nmarket cost of equity, as well as actual business\nresults and projections of business performance.\nBased on such reviews, the Firm has concluded that\ngoodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2022.\nFor each of the reporting units, fair value\nexceeded carrying value by at least 10% and there\nwas no indication of a significant risk of goodwill\nimpairment based on current projections and\nvaluations.\n\nThe projections for the Firm\u2019s reporting units are\nconsistent with management\u2019s current business\noutlook assumptions in the short term, and the\nFirm\u2019s best estimates of long-term growth and\nreturn on equity in the longer term. Where\npossible, the Firm uses third-party and peer data\nto benchmark its assumptions and estimates.\n\nRefer to Note 15 for additional information on\ngoodwill, including the goodwill impairment\nassessment as of December 31, 2022.\n                                                                                                            \n  Credit card rewards liability                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \nJPMorgan Chase offers credit cards with various\nrewards programs which allow cardholders to earn\nrewards points based on their account activity and\nthe terms and conditions of the rewards program.\nGenerally, there are no limits on the points that\nan eligible cardholder can earn, nor do the points\nexpire, and the points can be redeemed for a\nvariety of rewards, including cash (predominantly\nin the form of account credits), gift cards and\ntravel. The Firm maintains a rewards liability\nwhich represents the estimated cost of rewards\npoints earned and expected to be redeemed by\ncardholders. The liability is accrued as the\ncardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when\nthe cardholder redeems points. This liability was\n$11.3 billion and $9.8 billion at December 31, 2022\nand 2021, respectively, and is recorded in accounts\npayable and other liabilities on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets. The increase in the liability was\ndriven by continued growth in rewards points earned\non increased cardholder spending and promotional\noffers outpacing redemptions throughout 2022.\n\nThe rewards liability is sensitive to redemption\nrate (\u201cRR\u201d) and cost per point (\u201cCPP\u201d) assumptions.\nThe RR assumption is used to estimate the number of\npoints earned by customers that will be redeemed\nover the life of the account. The CPP assumption is\nused to estimate the cost of future point\nredemptions. These assumptions are evaluated\nperiodically considering historical actuals,\ncardholder redemption behavior and management\njudgment.

These laws are often\ncomplex and may be subject to different\ninterpretations. To determine the financial\nstatement impact of accounting for income taxes,\nincluding the provision for income tax expense and\nunrecognized tax benefits, JPMorgan Chase must make\nassumptions and judgments about how to interpret\nand apply these complex tax laws to numerous\ntransactions and business events, as well as make\njudgments regarding the timing of when certain\nitems may affect taxable income in the U.S. and\nnon-U.S. tax jurisdictions.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s interpretations of tax laws around\nthe world are subject to review and examination by\nthe various taxing authorities in the jurisdictions\nwhere the Firm operates, and disputes may occur\nregarding its view on a tax position. These\ndisputes over interpretations with the various\ntaxing authorities may be settled by audit,\nadministrative appeals or adjudication in the court\nsystems of the tax jurisdictions in which the Firm\noperates. JPMorgan Chase regularly reviews whether\nit may be assessed additional income taxes as a\nresult of the resolution of these matters, and the\nFirm records additional unrecognized tax benefits,\nas appropriate. In addition, the Firm may revise\nits estimate of income taxes due to changes in\nincome tax laws, legal interpretations, and\nbusiness strategies. It is possible that revisions\nin the Firm\u2019s estimate of income taxes may\nmaterially affect the Firm\u2019s results of operations\nin any reporting period.\n\nDeferred taxes arise from differences between\nassets and liabilities measured for financial\nreporting versus income tax return purposes.\nDeferred tax assets are recognized if, in\nmanagement\u2019s judgment, their realizability is\ndetermined to be more likely than not . Deferred\ntaxes are measured using enacted tax rates expected\nto apply to taxable income in the years in which\nthose temporary differences are expected to be\nrecovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes\nof a change in tax rates is recognized within the\nprovision for income taxes in the period enacted.\n\nThe Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in\nconnection with certain tax attributes, including\nnet operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards and\nforeign tax credit (\u201cFTC\u201d) carryforwards. The Firm\nperforms regular reviews to ascertain whether its\ndeferred tax assets are realizable. These reviews\ninclude management\u2019s estimates and assumptions\nregarding future taxable income , including foreign\nsource income, and may incorporate various tax\nplanning strategies, including strategies that may\nbe available to utilize NOLs and FTCs before they\nexpire. In connection with these reviews, if it is\ndetermined that a deferred tax asset is not\nrealizable, a valuation allowance is\n\nestablished. The valuation allowance may be\nreversed in a subsequent reporting period if the\nFirm determines that, based on revised estimates of\nfuture taxable income or changes in tax planning\nstrategies, it is more likely than not that all or\npart of the deferred tax asset will become\nrealizable. As of December 31, 2022, management has\ndetermined it is more likely than not that the Firm\nwill realize its deferred tax assets, net of the\nexisting valuation allowance.\n\nThe Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as\nnecessary when new information becomes available,\nincluding changes in tax law and regulations, and\ninteractions with taxing authorities. Uncertain tax\npositions that meet the more-likely-than-not\nrecognition threshold are measured to determine the\namount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax\nposition is measured at the largest amount of\nbenefit that management believes is more likely\nthan not to be realized upon settlement. It is\npossible that the reassessment of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nunrecognized tax benefits may have a material\nimpact on its effective income tax rate in the\nperiod in which the reassessment occurs. Although\nthe Firm believes that its estimates are\nreasonable, the final tax amount could be different\nfrom the amounts reflected in the Firm\u2019s income tax\nprovisions and accruals.

(\u201cJPMorgan\nChase\u201d or the \u201cFirm\u201d) is responsible for\nestablishing and maintaining adequate internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. Internal control\nover financial reporting is a process designed by,\nor under the supervision of, the Firm\u2019s principal\nexecutive and principal financial officers, or\npersons performing similar functions, and effected\nby JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Board of Directors, management\nand other personnel, to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial\nstatements for external purposes in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d).\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures\nthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records,\nthat, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly\nreflect the transactions and dispositions of the\nFirm\u2019s assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to\npermit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the Firm are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nmanagement and directors; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use or\ndisposition of the Firm\u2019s assets that could have a\nmaterial effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not prevent or\ndetect misstatements. Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are\nsubject to the risk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or\nthat the degree of compliance with the policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate. Management has\ncompleted an assessment of the effectiveness of the\nFirm\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as\nof December 31, 2022. In making the assessment,\nmanagement used the \u201cInternal Control \u2014 Integrated\nFramework\u201d (\u201cCOSO 2013\u201d) promulgated by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d).\n\nBased upon the assessment performed, management\nconcluded that as of December 31, 2022, JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s internal control over financial reporting\nwas effective based upon the COSO 2013 framework.\nAdditionally, based upon management\u2019s assessment,\nthe Firm determined that there were no material\nweaknesses in its internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2022.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Firm\u2019s internal control\nover financial reporting as of December 31, 2022,\nhas been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an\nindependent registered public accounting firm, as\nstated in their report which appears herein.\n\nJames Dimon\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial\nOfficer\n\nFebruary 21, 2023\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    155  \n                                              \nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.:\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal\nControl over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated\nbalance sheets of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its\nsubsidiaries (the \u201cFirm\u201d) as of December 31, 2022\nand 2021, and the related consolidated statements\nof income, comprehensive income, changes in\nstockholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for each of the\nthree years in the period ended December 31, 2022,\nincluding the related notes (collectively referred\nto as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d).

Also in our opinion, the Firm\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective\ninternal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2022, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the COSO.\n\nChange in Accounting Principle\n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, the Firm changed the manner\nin which it accounts for credit losses on certain\nfinancial instruments in 2020.\n                                                                                                            \n  Basis for Opinions                                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm\u2019s management is responsible for these\nconsolidated financial statements, for maintaining\neffective internal control over financial\nreporting, and for its assessment of the\neffectiveness of internal control over financial\nreporting, included in the accompanying\nManagement\u2019s report on internal control over\nfinancial reporting. Our responsibility is to\nexpress opinions on the Firm\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial statements and on the Firm\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting based on our\naudits. We are a public accounting firm registered\nwith the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Firm in accordance\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities\nand Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the\nstandards of the PCAOB. Those standards require\nthat we plan and perform the audits to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether the consolidated\nfinancial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and\nwhether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements\nincluded performing procedures to assess the risks\nof material misstatement of the consolidated\nfinancial statements, whether due to error or\nfraud, and performing procedures that respond to\nthose risks. Such procedures included examining, on\na test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the\naccounting principles used and significant\nestimates made by management, as well as evaluating\nthe overall presentation of the consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our audit of internal control\nover financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial\nreporting, assessing the risk that a material\nweakness exists, and testing and evaluating the\ndesign and operating effectiveness of internal\ncontrol based on the assessed risk. Our audits also\nincluded performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis\nfor our opinions.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over\nFinancial Reporting\n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting is a process designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and\nprocedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of\nrecords that, in reasonable detail, accurately and\nfairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of\nthe assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded as\nnecessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and\ndirectors of the company; and (iii) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have\na material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not prevent or\ndetect misstatements. Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are\nsubject to the risk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or\nthat the degree of compliance with the policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate.\n                                                   \n  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP300 Madison AvenueNew  \n  York, NY 10017                                   \n                                                   \n                                              \n  156    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n                                                                                                            \n  Critical Audit Matters                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nThe critical audit matters communicated below are\nmatters arising from the current period audit of\nthe consolidated financial statements that were\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the\naudit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated\nfinancial statements and (ii) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex\njudgments. The communication of critical audit\nmatters does not alter in any way our opinion on\nthe consolidated financial statements, taken as a\nwhole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matters below, providing separate\nopinions on the critical audit matters or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\nAllowance for Loan Losses \u2013 Portfolio-based\ncomponent of Wholesale Loan and Credit Card Loan\nPortfolios\n\nAs described in Note 13 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, the allowance for loan losses\nfor the portfolio-based component of the wholesale\nand credit card loan portfolios was $17.0 billion\non total portfolio-based retained loans of $785.9\nbillion at December 31, 2022 . The Firm\u2019s allowance\nfor loan losses represents management\u2019s estimate of\nexpected credit losses over the remaining expected\nlife of the Firm's loan portfolios and considers\nexpected future changes in macroeconomic\nconditions. The portfolio-based component of the\nFirm\u2019s allowance for loan losses for the wholesale\nand credit card retained loan portfolios begins\nwith a quantitative calculation of expected credit\nlosses over the expected life of the loan by\napplying credit loss factors to the estimated\nexposure at default. The credit loss factors\napplied are determined based on the weighted\naverage of five internally developed macroeconomic\nscenarios that take into consideration the Firm's\neconomic outlook as derived through forecast\nmacroeconomic variables, the most significant of\nwhich are U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross\ndomestic product. This quantitative calculation is\nfurther adjusted to take into consideration model\nimprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and\nother subjective factors that are not yet otherwise\nreflected in the credit loss estimate.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination\nthat performing procedures relating to the\nallowance for loan losses for the portfolio-based\ncomponent of the wholesale and credit card loan\nportfolios is a critical audit matter are (i) the\nsignificant judgment and estimation by management\nin the forecast of macroeconomic variables,\nspecifically U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross\ndomestic product, as the Firm\u2019s forecasts of\neconomic conditions significantly affect its\nestimate of expected credit losses at the balance\nsheet date, (ii) the significant judgment and\nestimation by management in determining the\nquantitative calculation utilized in their credit\nloss estimates and the adjustments to take into\nconsideration model imprecision, emerging risk\nassessments, trends and other subjective factors\nthat are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit\nloss estimate, which both in turn led to a high\ndegree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and\neffort in performing procedures and in\n\nevaluating audit evidence obtained relating to the\ncredit loss estimates and the appropriateness of\nthe adjustments to the credit loss estimates, and\n(iii) the audit effort involved the use of\nprofessionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing\nprocedures and evaluating audit evidence in\nconnection with forming our overall opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements. These procedures\nincluded testing the effectiveness of controls\nrelating to the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses,\nincluding controls over model validation and\ngeneration of macroeconomic scenarios. These\nprocedures also included, among others, testing\nmanagement\u2019s process for estimating the allowance\nfor loan losses, which involved (i) evaluating the\nappropriateness of the models and methodologies\nused in quantitative calculations; (ii) evaluating\nthe reasonableness of forecasts of U.S.\nunemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product;\n(iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of data\nused in the estimate; and (iv) evaluating the\nreasonableness of management\u2019s adjustments to the\nquantitative output for the impacts of model\nimprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and\nother subjective factors that are not yet otherwise\nreflected in the credit loss estimate. These\nprocedures also included the use of professionals\nwith specialized skill and knowledge to assist in\nevaluating the appropriateness of certain models,\nmethodologies and macroeconomic variables .\n\nFair Value of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments\n\nAs described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, the Firm carries $1.1\ntrillion of its assets and $453.7 billion of its\nliabilities at fair value on a recurring basis.\nIncluded in these balances are $13.6 billion of\ntrading assets and $37.8 billion of liabilities\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring basis,\ncollectively financial instruments, which are\nclassified as level 3 as they contain one or more\ninputs to valuation which are unobservable and\nsignificant to their fair value measurement. The\nFirm utilized internally developed valuation models\nand unobservable inputs to estimate fair value of\nthe level 3 financial instruments. The unobservable\ninputs used by management to estimate the fair\nvalue of certain of these financial instruments\ninclude volatility relating to interest rates,\ncorrelation relating to interest rates, equity\nprices, credit and foreign exchange rates, and\nBermudan switch values.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination\nthat performing procedures relating to the fair\nvalue of certain level 3 financial instruments is a\ncritical audit matter are (i) the significant\njudgment and estimation by management in\ndetermining the inputs to estimate fair value,\nwhich in turn led to a high degree of auditor\njudgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing\nprocedures and in evaluating audit evidence\nobtained related to the fair value of these\nfinancial instruments, and (ii) the audit effort\ninvolved the use of professionals with specialized\nskill and knowledge.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    157  \n                                              \nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting\nFirm\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing\nprocedures and evaluating audit evidence in\nconnection with forming our overall opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements. These procedures\nincluded testing the effectiveness of controls\nrelating to the Firm\u2019s determination of the fair\nvalue, including controls over models, inputs, and\ndata. These procedures also included, among others,\nthe involvement of professionals with specialized\nskill and knowledge to assist in developing an\nindependent estimate of fair value for a sample of\nthese financial instruments and comparing\nmanagement\u2019s estimate to the independently\ndeveloped estimate of fair value. Developing the\nindependent estimate involved testing the\ncompleteness and accuracy of data provided by\nmanagement, developing independent inputs and, as\nappropriate, evaluating and utilizing management\u2019s\naforementioned unobservable inputs.\n\nFebruary 21, 2023\n\nWe have served as the Firm\u2019s auditor since 1965.\n                                              \n  158    JPMorgan

(\u201cJPMorgan Chase\u201d or the \u201cFirm\u201d), a financial holding company incorporated under\nDelaware law in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The\nFirm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial\nbanking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 32 for a further discussion of\nthe Firm\u2019s business segments. The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its\nsubsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting\nand reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. Certain amounts reported in prior periods\nhave been revised to conform with the current presentation. Consolidation The Consolidated Financial\nStatements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling\nfinancial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Assets held\nfor clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not\nincluded on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial\ninterest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable\ninterest entity. Voting interest entities Voting interest entities are entities that have sufficient equity\nand provide the equity investors voting rights that enable them to make significant decisions relating to\nthe entity\u2019s operations. For these types of entities, the Firm\u2019s determination of whether it has a\ncontrolling interest is primarily based on the amount of voting equity interests held. Entities in which the\nFirm has a controlling financial interest, through ownership of the majority of the entities\u2019 voting equity\ninterests, or through other contractual rights that give the Firm control, are consolidated by the Firm.\nInvestments in companies in which the Firm has significant influence over operating and financing decisions\n(but does not own a majority of the voting equity interests) are accounted for (i) in accordance with the\nequity method of accounting, or (ii) at fair value if the fair value option was elected. These investments\nare generally included in other assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue. Certain Firm-\nsponsored asset management funds are structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies. For\nmany of these entities, the Firm is the general partner or managing member, but the non-affiliated partners\nor members have the ability to remove the Firm as the general partner or managing member without cause\n(i.e., kick-out rights), based on a simple majority vote, or the non-affiliated partners or members have\nrights to participate in important decisions. Accordingly, the Firm does not consolidate these voting\ninterest entities. However, in the limited cases where the non-managing partners or members do not have\nsubstantive kick-out or participating rights, the Firm evaluates the funds as VIEs and consolidates the\nfunds if the Firm is the general partner or managing member and has both power and a potentially significant\ninterest. The Firm\u2019s investment companies and asset management funds have investments in both publicly-held\nand privately-held entities, including investments in buyouts, growth equity and venture opportunities.\nThese investments are accounted for under investment company guidelines and, accordingly, irrespective of\nthe percentage of equity ownership interests held, are carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair\nvalue, and are recorded in other assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue. If\nconsolidated, the Firm retains the accounting under such specialized investment company guidelines. Variable\ninterest entities VIEs are entities that, by design, either (1) lack sufficient equity to permit the entity\nto finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) have\nequity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity\u2019s\noperations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not\nhave the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The most common type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs\nare commonly used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and distribute the cash\nflows from those assets to investors. The basic SPE structure involves a company selling assets to the SPE;\nthe SPE funds the purchase of those assets by issuing securities to investors. The legal documents that\ngovern the transaction specify how the cash earned on the assets must be allocated to the SPE\u2019s investors\nand other parties that have rights to those cash flows. SPEs are generally structured to insulate investors\nfrom claims on the SPE\u2019s assets by creditors of other entities, including the creditors of the seller of the\nassets. The primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has a controlling financial interest) is\nrequired to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is the party that has\nboth (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic\nperformance; and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the obligation to absorb losses or the right to\nreceive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. To assess whether the Firm\nhas the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic\nperformance, the Firm considers all the facts and circumstances, including its role in establishing the VIE\nand its ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment\n                                              \n  164    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nincludes, first, identifying the activities that most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance;\nand second, identifying which party, if any, has power over those activities. In general, the parties that\nmake the most significant decisions affecting the VIE (such as asset managers, collateral managers,\nservicers, or owners of call options or liquidation rights over the VIE\u2019s assets) or have the right to\nunilaterally remove those decision-makers are deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE. To\nassess whether the Firm has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from\nthe VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Firm considers all of its economic interests,\nincluding debt and equity investments, servicing fees, and derivatives or other arrangements deemed to be\nvariable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires that the Firm apply judgment in determining whether\nthese interests, in the aggregate, are considered potentially significant to the VIE. Factors considered in\nassessing significance include: the design of the VIE, including its capitalization structure; subordination\nof interests; payment priority; relative share of interests held across various classes within the VIE\u2019s\ncapital structure; and the reasons why the interests are held by the Firm. The Firm performs on-going\nreassessments of: (1) whether entities previously evaluated under the majority voting-interest framework\nhave become VIEs, based on certain events, and are therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework; and\n(2) whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding the Firm\u2019s involvement with a VIE cause the\nFirm\u2019s consolidation conclusion to change. Refer to Note 14 for further discussion of the Firm\u2019s VIEs.\nRevenue recognition Interest income The Firm recognizes interest income on loans, debt securities, and other\ndebt instruments, generally on a level-yield basis, based on the underlying contractual rate. Refer to Note\n7 for further information. Revenue from contracts with customers JPMorgan Chase recognizes noninterest\nrevenue from certain contracts with customers , in investment banking fees, deposit-related fees, asset\nmanagement administration and commissions, and components of card income, when the Firm\u2019s related\nperformance obligations are satisfied. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion of the Firm\u2019s revenue from\ncontracts with customers. Principal transactions revenue JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and\nliabilities at fair value. Changes in fair value are reported primarily in principal transactions revenue.\nRefer to Notes 2 and 3 for further discussion of fair value measurement. Refer to Note 6 for further\ndiscussion of principal transactions revenue. Use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated financial\nstatements The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expense, and\ndisclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates.\nForeign currency translation JPMorgan Chase revalues assets, liabilities, revenue and expense denominated in\nnon-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars using applicable exchange rates. Gains and losses relating to\ntranslating functional currency financial statements for U.S. reporting are included in the Consolidated\nstatements of comprehensive income. Gains and losses relating to nonfunctional currency transactions,\nincluding non-U.S. operations where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, are reported in the\nConsolidated statements of income. Offsetting assets and liabilities U.S. GAAP permits entities to present\nderivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral\nreceivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master\nnetting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities sold and purchased under repurchase agreements\nand securities borrowed or loaned under securities loan agreements to be presented net when specified\nconditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has\nelected to net such balances where it has determined that the specified conditions are met. The Firm uses\nmaster netting agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk in certain transactions, including derivative\ncontracts, resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements. A master netting\nagreement is a single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that\nagreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the\nevent of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver\ncollateral or margin when due). Upon the exercise of derivatives termination rights by the non-defaulting\nparty (i) all transactions are terminated, (ii) all transactions are valued and the positive values of \u201cin\nthe money\u201d transactions are netted against the negative values of \u201cout of the money\u201d transactions and (iii)\nthe only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount. Upon\nexercise of default rights under repurchase agreements and securities loan agreements in general (i) all\ntransactions are terminated and accelerated, (ii) all values of securities or cash held or to be delivered\nare calculated, and all such sums are netted against each other and (iii) the only remaining payment\nobligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    165  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nTypical master netting agreements for these types\nof transactions also often contain a\ncollateral/margin agreement that provides for a\nsecurity interest in, or title transfer of,\nsecurities or cash collateral/margin to the party\nthat has the right to demand margin (the \u201cdemanding\nparty\u201d). The collateral/margin agreement typically\nrequires a party to transfer collateral/margin to\nthe demanding party with a value equal to the\namount of the margin deficit on a net basis across\nall transactions governed by the master netting\nagreement, less any threshold. The\ncollateral/margin agreement grants to the demanding\nparty, upon default by the counterparty, the right\nto set-off any amounts payable by the counterparty\nagainst any posted collateral or the cash\nequivalent of any posted collateral/margin. It also\ngrants to the demanding party the right to\nliquidate collateral/margin and to apply the\nproceeds to an amount payable by the counterparty.\nRefer to Note 5 for further discussion of the\nFirm\u2019s derivative instruments. Refer to Note 11 for\nfurther discussion of the Firm\u2019s securities\nfinancing agreements. Statements of cash flows For\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s Consolidated statements of cash\nflows, cash is defined as those amounts included in\ncash and due from banks and deposits with banks on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets. Accounting\nstandard adopted January 1, 2023 Financial\nInstruments \u2013 Credit Losses: Troubled Debt\nRestructurings (\u201cTDRs\u201d) The adoption of this\nguidance eliminates the accounting and disclosure\nrequirements for TDRs, including the requirement to\nmeasure the allowance using a discounted cash flow\n(\u201cDCF\u201d) methodology, and allows the option of a\nnon-DCF portfolio-based approach for modified loans\nto troubled borrowers. If a DCF methodology is\nstill applied for these modified loans, the\ndiscount rate must be the post-modification\neffective interest rate, instead of the pre-\nmodification effective interest rate. The Firm\nelected to apply its non-DCF, portfolio-based\nallowance approach for modified loans to troubled\nborrowers for all portfolios except modified\nnonaccrual risk-rated loans which the Firm elected\nto continue applying a DCF methodology. See Note 13\nfor a description of the portfolio-based allowance\napproach and the asset-specific allowance approach.\nThis guidance was adopted on January 1, 2023 under\nthe modified retrospective method which resulted in\na net decrease to the allowance for credit losses\nof approximately $ 600million and an increase to\nretained earnings of approximately $ 450million,\nafter-tax predominantly driven by residential real\nestate and credit card.\n\nAccounting standard adopted January 1, 2020\nFinancial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses (\u201cCECL\u201d) The\nadoption of this guidance established a single\nallowance framework for all financial assets\nmeasured at amortized cost and certain off-balance\nsheet credit exposures. This framework requires\nthat management\u2019s estimate reflects credit losses\nover the instrument\u2019s remaining expected life and\nconsiders expected future changes in macroeconomic\nconditions. Prior to the adoption of the CECL\naccounting guidance, the Firm\u2019s allowance for\ncredit losses represented management\u2019s estimate of\nprobable credit losses inherent in the Firm\u2019s\nretained loan portfolios and certain lending-\nrelated commitments.

These assets and liabilities\nare predominantly carried at fair value on a recurring basis (i.e., assets and liabilities that are measured\nand reported at fair value on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated balance sheets). Certain assets, liabilities and\nunfunded lending-related commitments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they are\nnot measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain\ncircumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). Fair value is defined as the price that\nwould be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants at the measurement date. Fair value is based on quoted market prices or inputs, where\navailable. If prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based on valuation models and other\nvaluation techniques that consider relevant transaction characteristics (such as maturity) and use, as\ninputs, observable or unobservable market parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities,\nprices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), correlations, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.\nValuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value, as\ndescribed below. The level of precision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect\nthe amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its\nvaluation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and\nassumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm\u2019s businesses and portfolios. The\nFirm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of different\nmethodologies or assumptions by other market participants compared with those used by the Firm could result\nin the Firm deriving a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Valuation process Risk-taking\nfunctions are responsible for providing fair value estimates for assets and liabilities carried on the\nConsolidated balance sheets at fair value. The Firm\u2019s Valuation Control Group (\u201cVCG\u201d), which is part of the\nFirm\u2019s Finance function and independent of the risk-taking functions, is responsible for verifying these\nestimates and determining any fair value adjustments that may be required to ensure that the Firm\u2019s\npositions are recorded at fair value. In addition, the Firm\u2019s Valuation Governance Forum (\u201cVGF\u201d), which is\ncomposed of senior finance and risk executives, is responsible for overseeing the management of risks\narising from valuation activities conducted across the Firm. The Firmwide VGF is chaired by the Firmwide\nhead of the VCG (under the direction of the Firm\u2019s Controller), and includes sub-forums covering the CIB,\nCCB, CB, AWM and certain corporate functions including Treasury and CIO. Price verification process The VCG\nverifies fair value estimates provided by the risk-taking functions by leveraging independently derived\nprices, valuation inputs and other market data, where available. Where independent prices or inputs are not\navailable, the VCG performs additional review to ensure the reasonableness of the estimates. The additional\nreview may include evaluating the limited market activity including client unwinds, benchmarking valuation\ninputs to those used for similar instruments, decomposing the valuation of structured instruments into\nindividual components, comparing expected to actual cash flows, reviewing profit and loss trends, and\nreviewing trends in collateral valuation. There are also additional levels of management review for more\nsignificant or complex positions. The VCG determines any valuation adjustments that may be required to the\nestimates provided by the risk-taking functions. No adjustments to quoted prices are applied for instruments\nclassified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy (refer to the discussion below for further information\non the fair value hierarchy). For other positions, judgment is required to assess the need for valuation\nadjustments to appropriately reflect liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and, for certain\nportfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The determination of such\nadjustments follows a consistent framework across the Firm: \u2022 Liquidity valuation adjustments are considered\nwhere an observable external price or valuation parameter exists but is of lower reliability, potentially\ndue to lower market activity. Liquidity valuation adjustments are made based on current market conditions.\nFactors that may be considered in determining the liquidity adjustment include analysis of: (1) the\nestimated bid-offer spread for the instrument being traded; (2) alternative pricing points for similar\ninstruments in active markets; and (3) the range of reasonable values that the price or parameter could\ntake. \u2022 The Firm manages certain portfolios of financial instruments on the basis of net open risk exposure\nand, as permitted by U.S. GAAP, has elected to estimate the fair value of such portfolios on the basis of a\ntransfer of the entire net open risk position in an orderly transaction. Where this is the case, valuation\nadjustments may be necessary to reflect the cost of exiting a larger-than-normal market-size net open risk\nposition. Where applied, such adjustments are based on factors that a relevant market participant would\nconsider in the transfer of the net open risk position, including the size of the adverse market move that\nis likely to occur during the period required to reduce the net open risk position to a normal market-size.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    167  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n\u2022 Uncertainty adjustments related to unobservable\nparameters may be made when positions are valued\nusing prices or input parameters to valuation\nmodels that are unobservable due to a lack of\nmarket activity or because they cannot be implied\nfrom observable market data. Such prices or\nparameters must be estimated and are, therefore,\nsubject to management judgment. Adjustments are\nmade to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the\nresulting valuation estimate. \u2022 Where appropriate,\nthe Firm also applies adjustments to its estimates\nof fair value in order to appropriately reflect\ncounterparty credit quality (CVA), the Firm\u2019s own\ncreditworthiness (DVA) and the impact of funding\n(FVA), using a consistent framework across the\nFirm. Refer to Credit and funding adjustments on\npage 184 of this Note for more information on such\nadjustments. Valuation model review and approval If\nprices or quotes are not available for an\ninstrument or a similar instrument, fair value is\ngenerally determined using valuation models that\nconsider relevant transaction terms such as\nmaturity and use as inputs market-based or\nindependently sourced parameters. Where this is the\ncase the price verification process described above\nis applied to the inputs in those models. Under the\nFirm\u2019s Estimations and Model Risk Management\nPolicy, MRGR reviews and approves new models, as\nwell as material changes to existing models, prior\nto implementation in the operating environment. In\ncertain circumstances exceptions may be granted to\nthe Firm\u2019s policy to allow a model to be used prior\nto review or approval. MRGR may also require the\nuser to take appropriate actions to mitigate the\nmodel risk if it is to be used in the interim.\nThese actions will depend on the model and may\ninclude, for example, limitation of trading\nactivity. Fair value hierarchy A three-level fair\nvalue hierarchy has been established under U.S.\nGAAP for disclosure of fair value measurements. The\nfair value hierarchy is based on the observability\nof inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability\nas of the measurement date. The three levels are\ndefined as follows. \u2022 Level 1 \u2013 inputs to the\nvaluation methodology are quoted prices\n(unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in\nactive markets. \u2022 Level 2 \u2013 inputs to the valuation\nmethodology include quoted prices for similar\nassets and liabilities in active markets, and\ninputs that are observable for the asset or\nliability, either directly or indirectly, for\nsubstantially the full term of the financial\ninstrument. \u2022 Level 3 \u2013 one or more inputs to the\nvaluation methodology are unobservable and\nsignificant to the fair value measurement. A\nfinancial instrument\u2019s categorization within the\nfair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level\nof input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement.\n

for at the lower of cost or net realizable\nvalue. \u201cNet realizable value\u201d is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell\n(\u201ctransaction costs\u201d). Transaction costs for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories are either not\napplicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair\nvalue for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net\nrealizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because\nunder fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 5 for\na further discussion of the Firm\u2019s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value\ndisclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.\n\n(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical\nsecurities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    173  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its\nequivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private\nequity funds, real estate and other funds, were $ 950million and $ 801million, respectively. Included in\nthese balances at December 31, 2022 and 2021, were trading assets of $ 43million and $ 51million,\nrespectively, and other assets of $ 907million and $ 750million, respectively.\n\n(e) At December 31, 2022 and 2021, included $ 9.7billion and $ 26.2billion, respectively, of residential\nfirst-lien mortgages, and $ 6.8billion and $ 8.2billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages.\nResidential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs\nand government agencies of $ 2.4billion and $ 13.6billion, respectively.\n\n(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables\nand the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement\nexists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit\nassociated with cash collateral.\n                                              \n  174    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nLevel 3 valuations\n\nThe Firm has established well-structured processes for determining fair value, including for instruments\nwhere fair value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). Refer to pages 167-171 of\nthis Note for further information on the Firm\u2019s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the\ndetermination of fair value for individual financial instruments. Estimating fair value requires the\napplication of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of\nobservable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed\nvaluation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore\nclassified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more\nsignificant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and\n2. In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first\ndetermine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, due to the lack of\nobservability of significant inputs, management must assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation\ninputs including transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates,\nvolatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable\ninstruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. The following table presents the Firm\u2019s primary level\n3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial\ninstruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or\narithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is\nbased on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3\nfinancial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted\nand can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or\nlevel 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable\ncomponents of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified\nwithin levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is\nrepresentative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments\nwithin a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values\npresented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being\nused to value. In the Firm\u2019s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect\nthe degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm\u2019s estimates and\nassumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the\nrelative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts\nmay have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly\ndifferent implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or\nstrike prices. The input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and\nparameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance\nsheet date.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    175  \n                                              \n

The impact of changes in inputs may not be\nindependent, as a change in one unobservable input may give rise to a change in another unobservable input.\nWhere relationships do exist between two unobservable inputs, those relationships are discussed below.\nRelationships may also exist between observable and unobservable inputs (for example, as observable interest\nrates rise, unobservable prepayment rates decline); such relationships have not been included in the\ndiscussion below. In addition, for each of the individual relationships described below, the inverse\nrelationship would also generally apply. The following discussion also provides a description of attributes\nof the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the\nvaluation of the Firm\u2019s positions. Yield \u2013 The yield of an asset is the interest rate used to discount\nfuture cash flows in a discounted cash flow calculation. An increase in the yield, in isolation, would\nresult in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Credit spread \u2013 The credit spread is the amount of\nadditional annualized return over the market interest rate that a market participant would demand for taking\nexposure to the credit risk of an instrument. The credit spread for an instrument forms part of the discount\nrate used in a discounted cash flow calculation. Generally, an increase in the credit spread would result in\na decrease in a fair value measurement. The yield and the credit spread of a particular mortgage-backed\nsecurity primarily reflect the risk inherent in the instrument. The yield is also impacted by the absolute\nlevel of the coupon paid by the instrument (which may not correspond directly to the level of inherent\nrisk). Therefore, the range of yield and credit spreads reflects the range of risk inherent in various\ninstruments owned by the Firm. The risk inherent in mortgage-backed securities is driven by the\nsubordination of the security being valued and the characteristics of the underlying mortgages within the\ncollateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores, LTV ratios for residential mortgages and the nature of\nthe property and/or any tenants for commercial mortgages. For corporate debt securities, obligations of U.S.\nstates and municipalities and other similar instruments, credit spreads reflect the credit quality of the\nobligor and the tenor of the obligation. Prepayment speed \u2013 The prepayment speed is a measure of the\nvoluntary unscheduled principal repayments of a prepayable obligation in a collateralized pool. Prepayment\nspeeds generally decline as borrower delinquencies rise. An increase in prepayment speeds, in isolation,\nwould result in a decrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a premium to par and an increase\nin a fair value measurement of assets valued at a discount to par. Prepayment speeds may vary from\ncollateral pool to collateral pool, and are driven by the type and location of the underlying borrower, and\nthe remaining tenor of the obligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or floating) of interest\nrate being paid by the borrower. Typically collateral pools with higher borrower credit quality have a\nhigher prepayment rate than those with lower borrower credit quality, all other factors being equal.\nConditional default rate \u2013 The conditional default rate is a measure of the reduction in the outstanding\ncollateral balance underlying a collateralized obligation as a result of defaults. While there is typically\nno direct relationship between conditional default rates and prepayment speeds, collateralized obligations\nfor which the underlying collateral has high prepayment speeds will tend to have lower conditional default\nrates. An increase in conditional default rates would generally be accompanied by an increase in loss\nseverity and an increase in credit spreads. An increase in the conditional default rate, in isolation, would\nresult in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Conditional default rates reflect the quality of the\ncollateral underlying a securitization and the structure of the securitization itself. Based on the types of\nsecurities owned in the Firm\u2019s market-making portfolios, conditional default rates are most typically at the\nlower end of the range presented. Loss severity \u2013 The loss severity (the inverse concept is the recovery\nrate) is the expected amount of future realized losses resulting from the ultimate liquidation of a\nparticular loan, expressed as the net amount of loss relative to the outstanding loan balance. An increase\nin loss severity is generally accompanied by an increase in conditional default rates. An increase in the\nloss severity, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The loss severity\napplied in valuing a mortgage-backed security investment depends on factors relating to the underlying\nmortgages, including the LTV ratio, the nature of the lender\u2019s lien on the property and other instrument-\nspecific factors.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    177  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nCorrelation \u2013 Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two variables.\nCorrelation is a pricing input for a derivative product where the payoff is driven by one or more underlying\nrisks. Correlation inputs are related to the type of derivative (e.g., interest rate, credit, equity,\nforeign exchange and commodity) due to the nature of the underlying risks. When parameters are positively\ncorrelated, an increase in one parameter will result in an increase in the other parameter. When parameters\nare negatively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in a decrease in the other parameter. An\nincrease in correlation can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement. Given a short\ncorrelation position, an increase in correlation, in isolation, would generally result in a decrease in a\nfair value measurement. The level of correlation used in the valuation of derivatives with multiple\nunderlying risks depends on a number of factors including the nature of those risks. For example, the\ncorrelation between two credit risk exposures would be different than that between two interest rate risk\nexposures. Similarly, the tenor of the transaction may also impact the correlation input, as the\nrelationship between the underlying risks may be different over different time periods. Furthermore,\ncorrelation levels are very much dependent on market conditions and could have a relatively wide range of\nlevels within or across asset classes over time, particularly in volatile market conditions. Volatility \u2013\nVolatility is a measure of the variability in possible returns for an instrument, parameter or market index\ngiven how much the particular instrument, parameter or index changes in value over time. Volatility is a\npricing input for options, including equity options, commodity options, and interest rate options.\nGenerally, the higher the volatility of the underlying, the riskier the instrument. Given a long position in\nan option, an increase in volatility, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair value\nmeasurement. The level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular option-based derivative depends\non a number of factors, including the nature of the risk underlying the option (e.g., the volatility of a\nparticular equity security may be significantly different from that of a particular commodity index), the\ntenor of the derivative as well as the strike price of the option. Bermudan switch value \u2013 The switch value\nis the difference between the overall value of a Bermudan swaption, which can be exercised at multiple\npoints in time, and its most expensive European swaption and reflects the additional value that the multiple\nexercise dates provide the holder. Switch values are dependent on market conditions and can vary greatly\ndepending on a number of factors, such as the tenor of the underlying swap as well as the strike price of\nthe option. An increase in switch value, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair value\nmeasurement . Interest rate curve \u2013 represents the relationship of interest rates over differing tenors. The\ninterest rate curve is used to set interest rate and foreign exchange derivative cash flows and is also a\npricing input used in the discounting of any derivative cash flow. Forward price \u2013 Forward price is the\nprice at which the buyer agrees to purchase the asset underlying a forward contract on the predetermined\nfuture delivery date, and is such that the value of the contract is zero at inception. The forward price is\nused as an input in the valuation of certain derivatives and depends on a number of factors including\ninterest rates, the current price of the underlying asset, and the expected income to be received and costs\nto be incurred by the seller as a result of holding that asset until the delivery date. An increase in the\nforward can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement. Changes in level 3 recurring\nfair value measurements The following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets\namounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of\nthe fair value hierarchy for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. When a determination is made\nto classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the\nunobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically\ninclude, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components\nthat are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the\ntable below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation\nmethodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using\nsecurities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as\nthese level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the\nfollowing tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm\u2019s risk management activities

CVA represents the\nadjustment, relative to the relevant benchmark\ninterest rate, necessary to reflect counterparty\nnonperformance risk. The Firm estimates CVA using a\nscenario analysis to estimate the expected positive\ncredit exposure across all of the Firm\u2019s existing\npositions with each counterparty, and then\nestimates losses based on the probability of\ndefault and estimated recovery rate as a result of\na counterparty credit event considering contractual\nfactors designed to mitigate the Firm\u2019s credit\nexposure, such as collateral and legal rights of\noffset. The key inputs to this methodology are (i)\nthe probability of a default event occurring for\neach counterparty, as derived from observed or\nestimated CDS spreads; and (ii) estimated recovery\nrates implied by CDS spreads, adjusted to consider\nthe differences in recovery rates as a derivative\ncreditor relative to those reflected in CDS\nspreads, which generally reflect senior unsecured\ncreditor risk. FVA represents the adjustment to\nreflect the impact of funding and is recognized\nwhere there is evidence that a market participant\nin the principal market would incorporate it in a\ntransfer of the instrument. The Firm\u2019s FVA\nframework, applied to uncollateralized (including\npartially collateralized) over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d)\nderivatives incorporates key inputs such as: (i)\nthe expected funding requirements arising from the\nFirm\u2019s positions with\n\neach counterparty and collateral arrangements; and\n(ii) the estimated market funding cost in the\nprincipal market which, for derivative liabilities,\nconsiders the Firm\u2019s credit risk (DVA). For\ncollateralized derivatives, the fair value is\nestimated by discounting expected future cash flows\nat the relevant overnight indexed swap rate given\nthe underlying collateral agreement with the\ncounterparty, and therefore a separate FVA is not\nnecessary.\nThe following table provides the impact of credit\nand funding adjustments on principal transactions\nrevenue in the respective periods, excluding the\neffect of any associated hedging activities. The\nFVA presented below includes the impact of the\nFirm\u2019s own credit quality on the inception value of\nliabilities as well as the impact of changes in the\nFirm\u2019s own credit quality over time.\n                                                                    \n  Year ended December 31,                                           \n  (in millions)                         2022       2021       2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Credit and funding adjustments:                                   \n  Derivatives CVA                    $    22    $   362    $  -337  \n  Derivatives FVA                         42         47        -64  \n                                                                    \nValuation adjustments on fair value option elected\nliabilities\n\nThe valuation of the Firm\u2019s liabilities for which\nthe fair value option has been elected requires\nconsideration of the Firm\u2019s own credit risk.

In November 2022, the Firm sold approximately 3million Visa B shares,\nresulting in a net pretax gain of $ 914million recorded in other income. Visa B shares are subject to\ncertain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A common shares (\u201cVisa A shares\u201d) at a\nspecified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. In connection\nwith the sale, and consistent with the Firm\u2019s sale of 20million Visa B shares in 2013, the Firm entered into\na derivative instrument with the purchaser of the shares, under which the Firm retains the risk associated\nwith changes in the conversion rate.\n\nUnder the terms of the derivative instrument, the Firm will (a) make or receive payments based on subsequent\nchanges in the conversion rate and (b) make periodic interest payments to the purchaser of the Visa B\nshares. The payments under the derivative continue as long as the Visa B shares remain subject to transfer\nrestrictions. The derivative is accounted for at fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology based\nupon the Firm\u2019s estimate of the timing and magnitude of final resolution of the litigation matters. The\nderivative is recorded in trading liabilities and changes in fair value are recognized in other income. As\nof December 31, 2022, the Firm held derivative instruments associated with the 23million Visa B shares that\nit has sold, which are all subject to similar terms and conditions.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Firm\u2019s remaining interest in Visa B shares was approximately 37million shares.\nOn January 5, 2023, Visa filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC indicating that the conversion rate\nof Visa B shares to Visa A shares decreased from 1.6059to 1.5991effective December 29, 2022. The conversion\nrate may be further adjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the litigation matters. The\noutcome of those litigation matters, and the effect that the resolution of those matters may have on the\nconversion rate, is unknown, and accordingly, as of December 31, 2022, there is significant uncertainty\nregarding the date of the termination of transfer restrictions and the value of the final conversion rate.\nAs a result of this, as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B shares are not considered to be similar\nto Visa A shares, and they continue to be held at their nominal carrying value.\n\nAdditional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not carried on the\nConsolidated balance sheets at fair value U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of\ncertain financial instruments, which are included in the following table. However, this table does not\ninclude other items, such as nonfinancial assets, intangible assets, certain financial instruments, and\ncustomer relationships. In the opinion of management, these items, in the aggregate, add significant value\nto JPMorgan Chase, but their fair value is not disclosed in this table. Financial instruments for which\ncarrying value approximates fair value Certain financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets are carried at amounts that approximate fair value, due to their short-term\nnature and generally negligible credit risk. These instruments include cash and due from banks, deposits\nwith banks, federal funds sold, securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed, short-\nterm receivables and accrued interest receivable, short-term borrowings, federal funds purchased, securities\nloaned and sold under repurchase agreements, accounts payable, and\n                                              \n  186    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \naccrued liabilities. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that the fair value of deposit liabilities with no\nstated maturity (i.e., demand, savings and certain money market deposits) be equal to their carrying value;\nrecognition of the inherent funding value of these instruments is not permitted.\nThe following table presents, by fair value hierarchy classification, the carrying values and estimated fair\nvalues at December 31, 2022 and 2021, of financial assets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments\nthat are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, and their classification within

estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the\ncharacteristics of the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual\nfees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and\nprimary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the\nvalue of the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan\u2019s allowance for\nloan losses, which represents the loan\u2019s expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The\ndifference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to\nchanges in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that\naffect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value.\n(b) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.\nThe majority of the Firm\u2019s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-\nrelated commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.\n                                                                                                            \n           De\u2026                                               De\u2026                                            \n           31,                                               31,                                            \n           20\u2026                                               20\u2026                                            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                     Es\u2026                                               Es\u2026                                  \n                     fa\u2026                                               fa\u2026                                  \n                     va\u2026                                               va\u2026                                  \n                     hi\u2026                                               hi\u2026                                  \n                                                   To\u2026                                                Tot\u2026  \n  (\u2026       Ca\u2026       Le\u2026       Le\u2026       Le\u2026       es\u2026       Ca\u2026       Le\u2026       Lev\u2026       Le\u2026       est\u2026  \n  b\u2026       va\u2026       1         2           3       fa\u2026       va\u2026       1         2            3       fair  \n                                                   va\u2026                                                val\u2026  \n  W\u2026                                                                                                        \n  l\u2026    $  2.3    $  \u2014      $  \u2014      $  3.2    $  3.2    $  2.1    $  \u2014      $  \u2014       $  2.9    $   2.9  \n  c\u2026                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \n(a) Excludes the current carrying values of the guarantee liability and the offsetting asset, each of which\nis recognized at fair value at the inception of the guarantees.\n(b) Includes the wholesale allowance for lending-related commitments.\nThe Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.

The Firm has elected to measure\ncertain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income statement volatility\ncaused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain instruments\nthat otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements\nthat are accounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are\nmanaged on a fair value basis. The Firm\u2019s election of fair value includes the following instruments: \u2022 Loans\npurchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting,\nor managed on a fair value basis, including lending-related commitments \u2022 Certain securities financing\nagreements \u2022 Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit\nderivatives, which would otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument \u2022\nStructured notes and other hybrid instruments, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain\nembedded derivatives, that are issued or transacted as part of client-driven activities \u2022 Certain long-term\nbeneficial interests issued by CIB\u2019s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying assets are\ncarried at fair value\n                                              \n  188    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nChanges in fair value under the fair value option election\nThe following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for\nthe years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, for items for which the fair value option was elected.

Refer to Note 7 for\nfurther information regarding interest income and interest expense.\nDetermination of instrument-specific credit risk for items for which the fair value option was elected The\nfollowing describes how the gains and losses that are attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit\nrisk, were determined. \u2022 Loans and lending-related commitments: For floating-rate instruments, all changes\nin value are attributed to instrument-specific credit risk. For fixed-rate instruments, an allocation of the\nchanges in value for the period is made between those changes in value that are interest rate-related and\nchanges in value that are credit-related. Allocations are generally based on an analysis of borrower-\nspecific credit spread and recovery information, where available, or benchmarking to similar entities or\nindustries. \u2022 Long-term debt: Changes in value attributable to instrument-specific credit risk were derived\nprincipally from observable changes in the Firm\u2019s credit spread as observed in the bond market. \u2022 Securities\nfinancing agreements: Generally, for these types of agreements, there is a requirement that collateral be\nmaintained with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned; as a result, there\nwould be no adjustment or an immaterial adjustment for instrument-specific credit risk related to these\nagreements.\n                                              \n

These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are insured and/or guaranteed by U.S.\ngovernment agencies.\n(b) There were noperforming loans that were ninety days or more past due as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n(c) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-\nterm beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests,\nfor which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-protected\nstructured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of\nprincipal at maturity, but for structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an\nunderlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit\nrisk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.\n(d) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the\ncontractual principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm\u2019s\nnext call date.\n(e) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair\nvalue option was elected was $ 7.6billion and $ 11.9billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value\nof $ 24million and $ 10million, respectively.

JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit portfolios to\nassess potential credit risk concentrations and to obtain additional collateral when deemed necessary and\npermitted under the Firm\u2019s agreements. Senior management is significantly involved in the credit approval\nand review process, and risk levels are adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm\u2019s risk appetite. In the\nFirm\u2019s consumer portfolio, concentrations are managed primarily by product and by U.S. geographic region,\nwith a key focus on trends and concentrations at the portfolio level, where potential credit risk\nconcentrations can be remedied through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. Refer to\nNote 12 for additional information on the geographic composition of the Firm\u2019s consumer loan portfolios. In\nthe wholesale portfolio, credit risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by industry and monitored\nregularly on both an aggregate portfolio level and on an individual client or counterparty basis. The Firm\u2019s\nwholesale exposure is managed through loan syndications and participations, loan sales, securitizations,\ncredit derivatives, master netting agreements, collateral and other risk-reduction techniques. Refer to Note\n12 for additional information on loans. The Firm does not believe that its exposure to any particular loan\nproduct or industry segment results in a significant concentration of credit risk. Terms of loan products\nand collateral coverage are included in the Firm\u2019s assessment when extending credit and establishing its\nallowance for loan losses.\n                                              \n  192    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nThe table below presents both on\u2013balance sheet and off\u2013balance sheet consumer and wholesale credit exposure\nby the Firm\u2019s three credit portfolio segments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

JPMorgan Chase\nmakes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk\nexposures. Predominantly all of the Firm\u2019s derivatives are entered into for market-making or risk management\npurposes. Market-making derivatives The majority of the Firm\u2019s derivatives are entered into for market-\nmaking purposes. Clients use derivatives to mitigate or modify interest rate, credit, foreign exchange,\nequity and commodity risks. The Firm actively manages the risks from its exposure to these derivatives by\nentering into other derivative contracts or by purchasing or selling other financial instruments that\npartially or fully offset the exposure from client derivatives. Risk management derivatives The Firm manages\ncertain market and credit risk exposures using derivative instruments, including derivatives in hedge\naccounting relationships and other derivatives that are used to manage risks associated with specified\nassets and liabilities. The Firm generally uses interest rate derivatives to manage the risk associated with\nchanges in interest rates. Fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market value as\ninterest rates change. Similarly, interest income and expense increase or decrease as a result of variable-\nrate assets and liabilities resetting to current market rates, and as a result of the repayment and\nsubsequent origination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at current market rates. Gains and\nlosses on the derivative instruments related to these assets and liabilities are expected to substantially\noffset this variability. Foreign currency derivatives are used to manage the foreign exchange risk\nassociated with certain foreign currency\u2013denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and liabilities and\nforecasted transactions, as well as the Firm\u2019s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches\nwhose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. As a result of fluctuations in foreign currencies, the\nU.S. dollar\u2013equivalent values of the foreign currency\u2013denominated assets and liabilities or the forecasted\nrevenues or expenses increase or decrease. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments related to these\nforeign currency\u2013denominated assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions, are expected to\nsubstantially offset this variability. Commodities derivatives are used to manage the price risk of certain\ncommodities inventories. Gains or losses on these derivative instruments are expected to substantially\noffset the depreciation or appreciation of the related inventory. Credit derivatives are used to manage the\ncounterparty credit risk associated with loans and lending-related commitments. Credit derivatives\ncompensate the purchaser when the entity referenced in the contract experiences a credit event, such as\nbankruptcy or a failure to pay an obligation when due. Credit derivatives primarily consist of CDS. Refer to\nthe Credit derivatives section on pages 205-207 of this Note for a further discussion of credit derivatives.\nRefer to the risk management derivatives gains and losses table on page 205 and the hedge accounting gains\nand losses tables on pages 202-204 of this Note for more information about risk management derivatives.\nDerivative counterparties and settlement types The Firm enters into OTC derivatives, which are negotiated\nand settled bilaterally with the derivative counterparty. The Firm also enters into, as principal, certain\nETD such as futures and options, and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with CCPs. ETD contracts are generally\nstandardized contracts traded on an exchange and cleared by the CCP, which is the Firm\u2019s counterparty from\nthe inception of the transactions. OTC-cleared derivatives are traded on a bilateral basis and then novated\nto the CCP for clearing. Derivative clearing services The Firm provides clearing services for clients in\nwhich the Firm acts as a clearing member at certain exchanges and clearing houses. The Firm does not reflect\nthe clients\u2019 derivative contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 28 for further\ninformation on the Firm\u2019s clearing services. Accounting for derivatives All free-standing derivatives that\nthe Firm executes for its own account are required to be recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair\nvalue. As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets derivative assets and liabilities, and the related cash\ncollateral receivables and payables, when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists between the\nFirm and the derivative counterparty. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and\nliabilities. The accounting for changes in value of a derivative depends on whether or not the transaction\nhas been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are\nreported and measured at fair value through earnings. The tabular disclosures on pages 198-205 of this Note\nprovide additional information on the amount of, and reporting for, derivative assets, liabilities, gains\nand losses. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for a further discussion of derivatives embedded in structured notes.\n                                              \n  194    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nDerivatives designated as hedges The Firm applies hedge accounting to certain derivatives executed for risk\nmanagement purposes \u2013 generally interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. However, JPMorgan\nChase does not seek to apply hedge accounting to all of the derivatives associated with the Firm\u2019s risk\nmanagement activities. For example, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to purchased CDS used to manage\nthe credit risk of loans and lending-related commitments, because of the difficulties in qualifying such\ncontracts as hedges. For the same reason, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to certain interest rate,\nforeign exchange, and commodity derivatives used for risk management purposes. To qualify for hedge\naccounting, a derivative must be highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being\nhedged. In addition, for a derivative to be designated as a hedge, the risk management objective and\nstrategy must be documented. Hedge documentation must identify the derivative hedging instrument, the asset\nor liability or forecasted transaction and type of risk to be hedged, and how the effectiveness of the\nderivative is assessed prospectively and retrospectively. To assess effectiveness, the Firm uses statistical\nmethods such as regression analysis, nonstatistical methods such as dollar-value comparisons of the change\nin the fair value of the derivative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item, and\nqualitative comparisons of critical terms and the evaluation of any changes in those terms. The extent to\nwhich a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in\nthe fair value or cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed and documented at least quarterly. If it is\ndetermined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is\ndiscontinued. There are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair value hedges, cash flow hedges\nand net investment hedges. JPMorgan Chase uses fair value hedges primarily to hedge fixed-rate long-term\ndebt, AFS securities and certain commodities inventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, the changes in\nthe fair value of the derivative, and in the value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are\nrecognized in earnings. Certain amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in OCI\nand recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then\nthe adjustment to the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the hedged item, and for\nbenchmark interest rate hedges, is amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment. Derivative amounts affecting\nearnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item \u2013 primarily net interest\nincome and principal transactions revenue. JPMorgan Chase uses cash flow hedges primarily to hedge the\nexposure to variability in forecasted cash flows from floating-rate assets and liabilities and foreign\ncurrency\u2013denominated revenue and expense. For qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the\nderivative are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings as the hedged item affects earnings. Derivative\namounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item \u2013 primarily\nnoninterest revenue, net interest income and compensation expense. If the hedge relationship is terminated,\nthen the change in value of the derivative recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when the cash flows\nthat were hedged affect earnings. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted\ntransaction is expected to not occur according to the original hedge forecast, any related derivative values\nrecorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings. JPMorgan Chase uses net investment hedges to\nprotect the value of the Firm\u2019s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose\nfunctional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. For qualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair\nvalue of the derivatives due to changes in spot foreign exchange rates are recorded in OCI as translation\nadjustments. Amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded directly in earnings.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    195  \n

Derivatives contracts generally require\nadditional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined rating threshold is\nbreached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting\ncorresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional\ncollateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings\ndowngrade), nor in termination payment requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based\nupon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative\ncontract.\n                                                                                                            \n  Liquidity                                                                                                 \n  impact of                                                                                                 \n  downgrade                                                                                                 \n  triggers                                                                                                  \n  on OTC and                                                                                                \n  OTC-cleared             December 31,                                 December 31,                         \n  derivatives                     2022                                         2021                         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (in millions)           Single-notch              Two-notch          Single-notch              Two-notch  \n                             downgrade              downgrade             downgrade              downgrade  \n  Amount of                                                                                                 \n  additional                                                                                                \n  collateral to     $              128    $             1,293    $              219    $             1,577  \n  be                                                                                                        \n  posted upon                                                                                               \n  downgrade(a)                                                                                              \n  Amount                                                                                                    \n  required to                                                                                               \n  settle                                                                                                    \n  contracts with                    88                    925                    98                    787  \n  termination                                                                                               \n  triggers upon                                                                                             \n  downgrade(b)                                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \n(a) Includes the additional collateral to be posted for initial margin.\n\n(b) Amounts represent fair values of derivative payables, and do not reflect collateral posted.\n\nDerivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset\n\nIn certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains\nthe economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in\ncontemplation of the initial transfer.

Gains\nand losses were recorded in net interest income.\n(b) Effective January 1, 2022, the Firm updated its presentation in the tables above to include the\namortization of income/expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the\nhedged item; prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Excludes the\naccrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items.\n(c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for\nchanges in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due\nto changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded\nprimarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.\n(d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at\nthe lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value).

Gains\nand losses were recorded in principal transactions\nrevenue.\nGains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives The Firm makes\nmarkets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks\nassociated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit\nrisk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified\nrisk management categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are\nprimarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 6 for information on principal\ntransactions revenue.\n\nCredit derivatives Credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk\nassociated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) and which allow one party (the\nprotection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Credit derivatives\nexpose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller, as the protection seller\nis required to make payments under the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event, such\nas a bankruptcy, a failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring. The seller of credit protection\nreceives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument referenced in\nthe contract will be subject to a credit event. The Firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the\ncredit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes. First, in its capacity as a\nmarket-maker, the Firm actively manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit\nprotection, predominantly on corporate debt obligations, to meet the needs of customers. Second, as an end-\nuser, the Firm uses credit derivatives to manage credit risk associated with lending exposures (loans and\nunfunded commitments) in its wholesale and consumer businesses and derivatives counterparty exposures in its\nwholesale businesses, and to manage the credit risk arising from certain financial instruments in the Firm\u2019s\nmarket-making businesses. Following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    205  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nCredit default swaps Credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single reference entity\n(\u201csingle-name\u201d), broad-based index or portfolio. The Firm purchases and sells protection on both single-\nname and index-reference obligations. Single-name CDS and index CDS contracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared\nderivative contracts. Single-name CDS are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity,\nwhile index CDS contracts are used to manage the credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or\ncredit market segments. Like the S&P 500 and other market indices, a CDS index consists of a portfolio of\nCDS across many reference entities. New series of CDS indices are periodically established with a new\nunderlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in the credit markets. If one of the reference\nentities in the index experiences a credit event, then the reference entity that defaulted is removed from\nthe index. CDS can also be referenced against specific portfolios of reference names or against customized\nexposure levels based on specific client demands: for example, to provide protection against the first $\n1million of realized credit losses in a $ 10million portfolio of exposure. Such structures are commonly\nknown as tranche CDS. For both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS contracts, upon the occurrence of a\ncredit event, under the terms of a CDS contract neither party to the CDS contract has recourse to the\nreference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between\nthe face value of the CDS contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at settlement of the\ncredit derivative contract, also known as the recovery value. The protection purchaser does not need to hold\nthe debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the CDS\ncontract when a credit event occurs. Credit-related notes A credit-related note is a funded derivative with\na credit risk component where the issuer of the credit-related note purchases from the note investor credit\nprotection on a reference entity or an index. Under the contract, the investor pays the issuer the par value\nof the note at the inception of the transaction, and in return, the issuer pays periodic payments to the\ninvestor, based on the credit risk of the referenced entity. The issuer also repays the investor the par\nvalue of the note at maturity unless the reference entity (or one of the entities that makes up a reference\nindex) experiences a specified credit event. If a credit event occurs, the issuer is not obligated to repay\nthe par value of the note, but rather, the issuer pays the investor the difference between the par value of\nthe note and the fair value of the defaulted reference obligation at the time of settlement. Neither party\nto the credit-related note has recourse to the defaulting reference entity. The following tables present a\nsummary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased\nas of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Upon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of protection would typically\npay out only a percentage of the full notional amount of net protection sold, as the amount actually\nrequired to be paid on the contracts takes into account the recovery value of the reference obligation at\nthe time of settlement. The Firm manages the credit risk on contracts to sell protection by purchasing\nprotection with identical or similar underlying reference entities. Other purchased protection referenced in\nthe following tables includes credit derivatives bought on related, but not identical, reference positions\n(including indices, portfolio coverage and other reference points) as well as protection purchased by CIB\nthrough credit-related notes primarily in its market-making businesses. In addition, the Firm obtains credit\nprotection against certain loans in the retained consumer portfolio through the issuance of credit-related\nnotes. Since these credit-related notes are not part of the market-making businesses they are not included\nin the table below.\n                                              \n  206    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nThe Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for\nsuch derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence\nof a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic\nhedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm\u2019s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.\n

and noninterest\nexpense\n\nNoninterest revenue The Firm records noninterest\nrevenue from certain contracts with customers in\ninvestment banking fees, deposit-related fees,\nasset management, administration, and commissions,\nand components of card income. The related\ncontracts are often terminable on demand and the\nFirm has no remaining obligation to deliver future\nservices. For arrangements with a fixed term, the\nFirm may commit to deliver services in the future.\nRevenue associated with these remaining performance\nobligations typically depends on the occurrence of\nfuture events or underlying asset values, and is\nnot recognized until the outcome of those events or\nvalues are known. Investment banking fees This\nrevenue category includes debt and equity\nunderwriting and advisory fees. As an underwriter,\nthe Firm helps clients raise capital via public\noffering and private placement of various types of\ndebt and equity instruments. Underwriting fees are\nprimarily based on the issuance price and quantity\nof the underlying instruments, and are recognized\nas revenue typically upon execution of the client\u2019s\ntransaction. The Firm also manages and syndicates\nloan arrangements.

Substantially all the defined benefit pension plans are closed to\nnew participants. The principal defined benefit pension plan in the U.S., which covered substantially all\nU.S. employees, was closed to new participants and frozen for existing participants on January 1, 2020, (and\nJanuary 1, 2019 for new hires on or after December 2, 2017). Interest credits continue to accrue to\nparticipants\u2019 accounts based on their accumulated balances. The Firm maintains funded and unfunded\npostretirement benefit plans that provide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees and\nretirees as well as their dependents covered under these programs. None of these plans have a material\nimpact on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Firm also provides a qualified defined\ncontribution plan in the U.S. and maintains other similar arrangements in certain non-U.S. locations. The\nmost significant of these plans is the JPMorgan Chase 401(k) Savings Plan (\u201cthe 401(k) Savings Plan\u201d), which\ncovers substantially all U.S. employees. Employees can contribute to the 401(k) Savings Plan on a pretax\nand/or Roth 401(k) after-tax basis. The Firm makes an annual matching contribution as well as an annual\nprofit-sharing contribution to the 401(k) Savings Plan on behalf of eligible participants.\nThe following table presents the pretax benefit obligations, plan assets, the net funded status, and the\namounts recorded in AOCI on the Consolidated balance sheets for the Firm\u2019s significant defined benefit\npension and OPEB plans.\n                                                                                       \n                                                        Defined benefit                \n  As of or for the year ended December 31,       pension and OPEB plans                \n  (in millions)                                                    2022          2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Projected benefit obligations               $                 -13,545    $  -18,046  \n  Fair value of plan assets                                      19,890        25,692  \n  Net funded status                                               6,345         7,646  \n  Accumulated other comprehensive                                -1,916          -453  \n  income/(loss)                                                                        \n                                                                                       \nThe weighted-average discount rate used to value the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nwas 5.14% and 2.54%, respectively.\n\nGains and losses\n\nGains or losses resulting from changes in the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets are\nrecorded in OCI.

Amortization is generally\nover the average expected remaining lifetime of plan participants, given the frozen status of most plans.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, a remeasurement of the Firm\u2019s U.S. principal defined benefit plan\nin the third quarter, was required as a result of a pension settlement. The remeasurement resulted in a\nreduction in the fair value of the Firm\u2019s U.S. principal defined benefit plan assets, reflecting market\nconditions at the time of remeasurement, and a reduction in the plan\u2019s projected benefit obligation totaling\n$ 4.0billion and $ 2.6billion, respectively, resulting in a net decrease of $ 1.4billion in pre-tax AOCI.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the net gain was predominantly attributable to market-driven increases\nin the fair value of plan assets and the discount rate.\nThe following table presents the net periodic benefit costs reported in the Consolidated statements of\nincome for the Firm\u2019s defined benefit pension, defined contribution and OPEB plans, and in other\ncomprehensive income for the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.\n                                                                                                 \n                                                Pension and OPEB plans                           \n  Year ended December 31, (in millions)                           2022         2021        2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Total net periodic defined benefit plan    $                    -192    $    -201    $   -285  \n  cost/(credit)(a)                                                                               \n  Total defined contribution plans                               1,408        1,333       1,332  \n  Total pension and OPEB cost included in    $                   1,216    $   1,132    $  1,047  \n  noninterest expense                                                                            \n  Total recognized in other comprehensive    $                   1,459    $  -1,129    $   -214  \n  (income)/loss                                                                                  \n                                                                                                 \n(a) Includes pension settlement loss of $ 92million and $ 33million, respectively, for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021.\n                                              \n  212    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nThe following table presents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine the net periodic\nbenefit costs for the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.\n                                                                                                           \n                                          Defined benefit pension and OPEB plans                           \n  Year ended December 31,                                                   2022       2021       2020     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Discount rate                                                             2.54  %    2.17  %    2.93  %  \n  Expected long-term rate of return on                                      3.68  %    2.97  %    3.91  %  \n  plan assets                                                                                              \n                                                                                                           \nPlan assumptions The Firm\u2019s expected long-term rate\nof return is a blended weighted average, by asset\nallocation of the projected long-term returns for\nthe various asset classes, taking into\nconsideration local market conditions and the\nspecific allocation of plan assets. Returns on\nasset classes are developed using a forward-looking\napproach and are not strictly based on historical\nreturns, with consideration given to current market\nconditions and the portfolio mix of each plan. The\ndiscount rates used in determining the benefit\nobligations are generally provided by the Firm\u2019s\nactuaries, with the Firm\u2019s principal defined\nbenefit pension plan using a rate that was selected\nby reference to the yields on portfolios of bonds\nwith maturity dates and coupons that closely match\neach of the plan\u2019s projected cash flows.\n\nInvestment strategy and asset allocation The assets\nof the Firm\u2019s defined benefit pension plans are\nheld in various trusts and are invested in well-\ndiversified portfolios of equity and fixed income\nsecurities, cash and cash equivalents, and\nalternative investments. The Firm regularly reviews\nthe asset allocations and asset managers, as well\nas other factors that could impact the portfolios,\nwhich are rebalanced when deemed necessary. The\napproved asset allocation ranges by asset class for\nthe Firm\u2019s principal defined benefit plan are 42-\n100% debt securities, 0- 40% equity securities, 0-\n3% real estate, and 0- 12% alternatives as of\nDecember 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, assets\nheld by the Firm\u2019s defined benefit pension and OPEB\nplans do not include securities issued by JPMorgan\nChase or its affiliates, except through indirect\nexposures through investments in exchange traded\nfunds, mutual funds and collective investment funds\nmanaged by third-parties. The defined benefit\npension and OPEB plans hold investments that are\nsponsored or managed by affiliates of JPMorgan\nChase in the amount of $ 1.7billion and $\n2.5billion, as of December 31, 2022

long-term share-based awards to\ncertain employees under its LTIP, as amended and restated effective May 15, 2018, and subsequently amended\neffective May 18, 2021. Under the terms of the LTIP, as of December 31, 2022, 69million shares of common\nstock were available for issuance through May 2025. The LTIP is the only active plan under which the Firm is\ncurrently granting share-based incentive awards. In the following discussion, the LTIP, plus prior Firm\nplans and plans assumed as the result of acquisitions, are referred to collectively as the \u201cLTI Plans,\u201d and\nsuch plans constitute the Firm\u2019s share-based incentive plans. RSUs are awarded at no cost to the recipient\nupon their grant. Generally, RSUs are granted annually and vest at a rate of 50% after two yearsand 50%\nafter three yearsand are converted into shares of common stock as of the vesting date. In addition, RSUs\ntypically include full-career eligibility provisions, which allow employees to continue to vest upon\nvoluntary termination based on age and/or service-related requirements, subject to post-employment and other\nrestrictions. All RSU awards are subject to forfeiture until vested and contain clawback provisions that may\nresult in cancellation under certain specified circumstances. Predominantly all RSUs entitle the recipient\nto receive cash payments equivalent to any dividends paid on the underlying common stock during the period\nthe RSUs are outstanding. Performance share units (\u201cPSUs\u201d) are granted annually, and approved by the Firm\u2019s\nBoard of Directors, to members of the Firm\u2019s Operating Committee under the variable compensation program.\nPSUs are subject to the Firm\u2019s achievement of specified performance criteria over a three-year period. The\nnumber of awards that vest can range from zeroto 150% of the grant amount. In addition, dividends that\naccrue during the vesting period are reinvested in dividend equivalent share units. PSUs and the related\ndividend equivalent share units are converted into shares of common stock after vesting. Once the PSUs and\ndividend equivalent share units have vested, the shares of common stock that are delivered, after applicable\ntax withholding, must be retained for an additional holding period, for a total combined vesting and holding\nperiod of approximately fiveto eightyears from the grant date depending on regulations in certain countries.\nUnder the LTI Plans, stock appreciation rights (\u201cSARs\u201d) and stock options have generally been granted with\nan exercise price equal to the fair value of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s common stock on the grant date. SARs and stock\noptions generally expire ten yearsafter the grant date. In 2021, the Firm awarded its Chairman and CEO and\nits President and Chief Operating Officer 1.5million and 750,000SARs, respectively. There were no grants of\nSARs or stock options in 2022 and grants in 2020 were not material. The Firm separately recognizes\ncompensation expense for each tranche of each award, net of estimated forfeitures, as if it were a separate\naward with its own vesting date. Generally, for each tranche granted, compensation expense is recognized on\na straight-line basis from the grant date until the vesting date of the respective tranche, provided that\nthe employees will not become full-career eligible during the vesting period. For awards with full-career\neligibility provisions and awards granted with no future substantive service requirement, the Firm accrues\nthe estimated value of awards expected to be awarded to employees as of the grant date without giving\nconsideration to the impact of post-employment restrictions. For each tranche granted to employees who will\nbecome full-career eligible during the vesting period, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line\nbasis from the grant date until the earlier of the employee\u2019s full-career eligibility date or the vesting\ndate of the respective tranche. The Firm\u2019s policy for issuing shares upon settlement of employee share-based\nincentive awards is to issue either new shares of common stock or treasury shares. During 2022, 2021 and\n2020, the Firm settled all of its employee share-based awards by issuing treasury shares. Refer to Note 23\nfor further information on the classification of share-based awards for purposes of calculating earnings per\nshare.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    215  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nRSUs, PSUs, SARs and stock options activity\n\nGenerally, compensation expense for RSUs and PSUs is measured based on the number of units granted\nmultiplied by the stock price at the grant date, and for SARs and stock options, is measured at the grant\ndate using the Black-Scholes valuation model.

Debt securities\nclassified as trading assets are discussed in Note\n2. Predominantly all of the Firm\u2019s AFS and HTM\nsecurities are held by Treasury and CIO in\nconnection with its asset-liability management\nactivities. AFS securities are carried at fair\nvalue on the Consolidated balance sheets.\nUnrealized gains and losses, after any applicable\nhedge accounting adjustments or allowance for\ncredit losses, are reported in AOCI. The specific\nidentification method is used to determine realized\ngains and losses on AFS securities, which are\nincluded in investment securities gains/(losses) on\nthe Consolidated statements of income. HTM\nsecurities, which the Firm has the intent and\nability to hold until maturity, are carried at\namortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses,\non the Consolidated balance sheets. For both AFS\nand HTM securities, purchase discounts or premiums\nare generally amortized into interest income on a\nlevel-yield basis over the contractual life of the\nsecurity. However, premiums on certain callable\ndebt securities are amortized to the earliest call\ndate. During 2022 and 2021, the Firm transferred $\n78.3billion and $ 104.5billion of investment\nsecurities, respectively, from AFS to HTM for\ncapital management purposes. AOCI included pretax\nunrealized gains/(losses) of $( 4.8) billion and $\n425million, respectively, on the securities at the\ndates of transfer. Unrealized gains or losses at\nthe date of transfer of these securities continue\nto be reported in AOCI and are amortized into\ninterest income on a level-yield basis over the\nremaining life of the securities. This amortization\nwill offset the effect on interest income of the\namortization of the premium or discount resulting\nfrom the transfer recorded at fair value. Transfers\nof securities from AFS to HTM are non-cash\ntransactions and are recorded at fair value.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    217  \n

of $\n96million and $ 42million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(c) Excludes $ 2.5billion and $ 1.9billion of accrued interest receivable at December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, included in accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Consolidated balance sheets. The\nFirm generally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable, consistent\nwith its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income. The Firm did\nnot reverse through interest income any accrued interest receivable for the years ended December 31, 2022\nand 2021.\nAt December 31, 2022 , the investment securities portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average\ncredit rating of AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily\nupon internal risk ratings). Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of securities and\ndifferentiate risk within the portfolio. The Firm\u2019s internal risk ratings generally align with the\nqualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to\nchanges in the economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody\u2019s, however the quantitative characteristics\n(e.g., probability of default (\u201cPD\u201d) and loss given default (\u201cLGD\u201d)) may differ as they reflect internal\nhistorical experiences and assumptions. Risk ratings are assigned at acquisition, reviewed on a regular and\nongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and adjusted as necessary over the life of the investment for\nupdated information affecting the issuer\u2019s ability to fulfill its obligations.\n                                              \n  218    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nAFS securities impairment\nThe following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses by aging category for AFS securities\nat December 31, 2022 and 2021.

The Firm\nrecognizes impairment losses in earnings if the\nFirm has the intent to sell the debt security, or\nif it is more likely than not that the Firm will be\nrequired to sell the debt security before recovery\nof its amortized cost. In these circumstances the\nimpairment loss is recognized in investment\nsecurities gains/(losses) in the Consolidated\nStatements of Income and is equal to the full\ndifference between the amortized cost (net of\nallowance if applicable) and the fair value of the\nsecurity. For impaired debt securities that the\nFirm has the intent and ability to hold, the\nsecurities are evaluated to determine if a credit\nloss exists. If it is determined that a credit loss\nexists, that loss is recognized as an allowance for\ncredit losses through the provision for credit\nlosses in the Consolidated Statements of Income,\nlimited by the amount of impairment. Any impairment\non debt securities that the Firm has the intent and\nability to hold not due to credit losses is\nrecorded in OCI. Factors considered in evaluating\ncredit losses include adverse conditions\nspecifically related to the industry, geographic\narea or financial condition of the issuer or\nunderlying collateral of a security; and payment\nstructure of the security. When assessing\nsecurities issued in a securitization for credit\nlosses, the Firm estimates cash flows considering\nrelevant market and economic data, underlying loan-\nlevel data, and structural features of the\nsecuritization, such as subordination, excess\nspread, overcollateralization or other forms of\ncredit enhancement, and compares the losses\nprojected for the underlying collateral (\u201cpool\nlosses\u201d) against the level of credit enhancement in\nthe securitization structure to determine whether\nthese features are sufficient to absorb the pool\nlosses, or whether a credit loss exists. For\nbeneficial interests in securitizations that are\nrated below \u201cAA\u201d at their acquisition, or that can\nbe contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in\nsuch a way that the Firm would not recover\nsubstantially all of its recorded investment, the\nFirm evaluates impairment for credit losses when\nthere is an adverse change in expected cash flows.\n\nHTM securities \u2013 credit risk Allowance for credit\nlosses The allowance for credit losses represents\nexpected credit losses over the remaining expected\nlife of HTM securities. The allowance for credit\nlosses on HTM obligations of U.S. states and\nmunicipalities and commercial mortgage-backed\nsecurities is calculated by applying statistical\ncredit loss factors (estimated PD and LGD) to the\namortized cost. The credit loss factors are derived\nusing a weighted average of five internally\ndeveloped eight-quarter macroeconomic scenarios,\nfollowed by a single year straight-line\ninterpolation to revert to long run historical\ninformation for periods beyond the forecast period.\nRefer to Note 13 for further information on the\neight-quarter macroeconomic forecast. The allowance\nfor credit losses on HTM collateralized loan\nobligations and U.S. residential mortgage-backed\nsecurities is calculated as the difference between\nthe amortized cost and the present value of the\ncash flows expected to be collected, discounted at\nthe security\u2019s effective interest rate. These cash\nflow estimates are developed based on expectations\nof underlying collateral performance derived using\nthe eight-quarter macroeconomic forecast and the\nsingle year straight-line interpolation, as well as\nconsidering the structural features of the\nsecurity. The application of different inputs and\nassumptions into the calculation of the allowance\nfor credit losses is subject to significant\nmanagement judgment, and emphasizing one input or\nassumption over another, or considering other\ninputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of\nthe allowance for credit losses on HTM securities.\nCredit quality indicator The primary credit quality\nindicator for HTM securities is the risk rating\nassigned to each security. At both December 31,\n2022 and 2021, all HTM securities were rated\ninvestment grade and were current and accruing,\nwith approximately 98% rated at least AA+.\nAllowance for credit losses on investment\nsecurities The allowance for credit losses on\ninvestment securities was $ 96million, $ 42million\nand $ 78million as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and\n2020, respectively.

The effective yield considers the contractual coupon,\namortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-\nequivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal\nprepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected\nmaturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average\nyield is calculated to the earliest call date.\n(b) Substantially all of the Firm\u2019s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in\n10years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects\nanticipated future prepayments, is approximately eight yearsfor agency residential MBS, and six yearsfor\nboth agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and nonagency residential collateralized\nmortgage obligations.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    221  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Note 11 \u2013 Securities financing activities                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \nJPMorgan Chase enters into resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements\n(collectively, \u201csecurities financing agreements\u201d) primarily to finance the Firm\u2019s inventory positions,\nacquire securities to cover short sales, accommodate customers\u2019 financing needs, settle other securities\nobligations and to deploy the Firm\u2019s excess cash. Securities financing agreements are treated as\ncollateralized financings on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated balance sheets. Where appropriate under applicable\naccounting guidance, securities financing agreements with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis.\nRefer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. Fees received and paid\nin connection with securities financing agreements are recorded over the life of the agreement in interest\nincome and interest expense on the Consolidated statements of income. The Firm has elected the fair value\noption for certain securities financing agreements. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding the\nfair value option. The securities financing agreements for which the fair value option has been elected are\nreported within securities purchased under resale agreements, securities loaned or sold under repurchase\nagreements, and securities borrowed on the Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements carried at\nfair value, current-period interest accruals are recorded within interest income and interest expense, with\nchanges in fair value reported in principal transactions revenue. However, for financial instruments\ncontaining embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with accounting\nguidance for hybrid instruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest elements, are reported in\nprincipal transactions revenue. Securities financing agreements not elected under the fair value option are\nmeasured at amortized cost. As a result of the Firm\u2019s credit risk mitigation practices described below, the\nFirm did not hold any allowance for credit losses with respect to resale and securities borrowed\narrangements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Credit risk mitigation practices Securities financing\nagreements expose the Firm primarily to credit and liquidity risk. To manage these risks, the Firm monitors\nthe value of the underlying securities (predominantly high-quality securities collateral, including\ngovernment-issued debt and U.S. GSEs and government agencies MBS) that it has received from or provided to\nits counterparties compared to the value of cash proceeds and exchanged collateral, and either requests\nadditional collateral or returns securities or collateral when appropriate. Margin levels are initially\nestablished based upon the counterparty, the type of underlying securities, and the permissible collateral,\nand are monitored on an ongoing basis. In resale and securities borrowed agreements, the Firm is exposed to\ncredit risk to the extent that the value of the securities received is less than initial cash principal\nadvanced and any collateral amounts exchanged. In repurchase and securities loaned agreements, credit risk\nexposure arises to the extent that the value of underlying securities advanced exceeds the value of the\ninitial cash principal received, and any collateral amounts exchanged. Additionally, the Firm typically\nenters into master netting agreements and other similar arrangements with its counterparties, which provide\nfor the right to liquidate the underlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged in the event of a\ncounterparty default. It is also the Firm\u2019s policy to take possession, where possible, of the securities\nunderlying resale and securities borrowed agreements. Refer to Note 29 for further information regarding\nassets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements.\n                                              \n  222    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nThe table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm\u2019s securities financing agreements, as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master\nnetting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the\nFirm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing\nagreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral\nwith its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not\neligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal\nopinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with securities\nfinancing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the\ntable below as \u201cAmounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,\u201d and reduces the \u201cNet amounts\u201d\npresented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances\nare presented gross in the \u201cNet amounts\u201d below. In transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a\nsecurities-for-securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as\ncollateral, the Firm recognizes the securities received at fair value within other assets and the obligation\nto return those securities within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n

The Firm\naccounts for loans based on the following categories: \u2022 Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment\n(i.e., \u201cretained\u201d) \u2022 Loans held-for-sale \u2022 Loans at fair value The following provides a detailed accounting\ndiscussion of the Firm\u2019s loans by category: Loans held-for-investment Originated or purchased loans held-\nfor-investment, including PCD, are recorded at amortized cost, reflecting the principal amount outstanding,\nnet of the following: unamortized deferred loan fees, costs, premiums or discounts; charge-offs; collection\nof cash; and foreign exchange. Credit card loans also include billed finance charges and fees. Interest\nincome Interest income on performing loans held-for-investment is accrued and recognized as interest income\nat the contractual rate of interest. Purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees\nor costs, are amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment of\nyield. The Firm classifies accrued interest on loans, including accrued but unbilled interest on credit card\nloans, in accrued interest and accounts receivables on the Consolidated balance sheets. For credit card\nloans, accrued interest once billed is then recognized in the loan balances, with the related allowance\nrecorded in the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses on accrued interest\non credit card loans are recognized in the provision for credit losses and charge-offs are recognized by\nreversing interest income. For other loans, the Firm generally does not recognize an allowance for credit\nlosses on accrued interest receivables, consistent with its policy to write them off no later than 90 days\npast due by reversing interest income. Nonaccrual loans Nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of\ninterest has been suspended. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S.\ngovernment agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status and considered nonperforming when full payment of\nprincipal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has\nbeen in default for a period of 90days or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of\ncollection. A loan is determined to be past due when the minimum payment is not received from the borrower\nby the contractually specified due date or for certain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), when a\nmonthly payment is due and unpaid for 30days or more. Finally, collateral-dependent loans are typically\nmaintained on nonaccrual status. On the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all interest accrued but\nnot collected is reversed against interest income. In addition, the amortization of deferred amounts is\nsuspended. Interest income on nonaccrual loans may be recognized as cash interest payments are received\n(i.e., on a cash basis) if the recorded loan balance is deemed fully collectible; however, if there is doubt\nregarding the ultimate collectibility of the recorded loan balance, all interest cash receipts are applied\nto reduce the carrying value of the loan (the cost recovery method). For consumer loans, application of this\npolicy typically results in the Firm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual consumer loans on a cash\nbasis. A loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is reasonably assured and there has been\ndemonstrated performance under the terms of the loan or, if applicable, the terms of the restructured loan.\nAs permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans are generally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual\nstatus; accordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans continue to accrue until the loan is\ncharged off or paid in full. Allowance for loan losses The allowance for loan losses represents the\nestimated expected credit losses in the held-for-investment loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and is\nrecognized on the balance sheet as a contra asset, which brings the amortized cost to the net carrying\nvalue. Changes in the allowance for loan losses are recorded in the provision for credit losses on the\nFirm\u2019s Consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note 13 for further information on the Firm\u2019s accounting\npolicies for the allowance for loan losses. Charge-offs Consumer loans are generally charged off or charged\ndown to the lower of the amortized cost or the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair\nvalue less estimated costs to sell), with an offset to the allowance for loan losses, upon reaching\nspecified stages of delinquency in accordance with standards established by the FFIEC. Residential real\nestate loans, unmodified credit card loans and scored business banking loans are generally charged off no\nlater than 180days past due. Scored auto and modified credit card loans are charged off no later than\n120days past due. Certain consumer loans are charged off or charged down to their net realizable value\nearlier than the FFIEC charge-off standards in the following circumstances: \u2022 Loans modified in a TDR that\nare determined to be collateral-dependent. \u2022 Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event that suggests\na loss is either known or highly certain are subject to accelerated charge-off standards (e.g.,\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    225  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nresidential real estate and auto loans are charged off or charged down within 60days of receiving\nnotification of a bankruptcy filing). \u2022 Auto loans upon repossession of the automobile. Other than in\ncertain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not recognize charge-offs on the government-\nguaranteed portion of loans. Wholesale loans are charged off when it is highly certain that a loss has been\nrealized. The determination of whether to recognize a charge-off includes many factors, including the\nprioritization of the Firm\u2019s claim in bankruptcy, expectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and\nvaluation of the borrower\u2019s equity or the loan collateral. When a loan is charged down to the lower of its\namortized cost or the estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral, the determination of the\nfair value of the collateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g., securities, real estate). In cases\nwhere the collateral is in the form of liquid securities, the fair value is based on quoted market prices or\nbroker quotes. For illiquid securities or other financial assets, the fair value of the collateral is\ngenerally estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For residential real estate loans, collateral values\nare based upon external valuation sources. When it becomes likely that a borrower is either unable or\nunwilling to pay, the Firm utilizes a broker\u2019s price opinion, appraisal and/or an automated valuation model\nof the home based on an exterior-only valuation (\u201cexterior opinions\u201d), which is then updated at least every\n12months, or more frequently depending on various market factors. As soon as practicable after the Firm\nreceives the property in satisfaction of a debt (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession), the\nFirm generally obtains an appraisal based on an inspection that includes the interior of the home (\u201cinterior\nappraisals\u201d). Exterior opinions and interior appraisals are discounted based upon the Firm\u2019s experience with\nactual liquidation values as compared with the estimated values provided by exterior opinions and interior\nappraisals, considering state-specific factors. For commercial real estate loans, collateral values are\ngenerally based on appraisals from internal and external valuation sources. Collateral values are typically\nupdated every sixto twelve months, either by obtaining a new appraisal or by performing an internal\nanalysis, in accordance with the Firm\u2019s policies. The Firm also considers both borrower- and market-specific\nfactors, which may result in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price opinions at more frequent\nintervals. Loans held-for-sale Loans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value, with\nvaluation changes recorded in noninterest revenue. For consumer loans, the valuation is performed on a\nportfolio basis. For wholesale loans, the valuation is performed on an individual loan basis. Interest\nincome on loans held-for-sale is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Loan\norigination fees or costs and purchase price discounts or premiums are deferred in a contra loan account\nuntil the related loan is sold. The deferred fees or costs and discounts or premiums are an adjustment to\nthe basis of the loan and therefore are included in the periodic determination of the lower of cost or fair\nvalue adjustments and/or the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale. Because these loans are recognized\nat the lower of cost or fair value, the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not\napply to these loans. However, loans held-for-sale are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above.\nLoans at fair value Loans for which the fair value option has been elected are measured at fair value, with\nchanges in fair value recorded in noninterest revenue. Interest income on these loans is accrued and\nrecognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Changes in fair value are recognized in noninterest\nrevenue. Loan origination fees are recognized upfront in noninterest revenue. Loan origination costs are\nrecognized in the associated expense category as incurred. Because these loans are recognized at fair value,\nthe Firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans at\nfair value are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above. Refer to Note 3 for further information\non the Firm\u2019s elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 and Note 3 for\nfurther information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.\n                                              \n  226    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nLoan classification changes Loans in the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to sell are\ntransferred to the held-for-sale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer.\nCredit-related losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses; non-credit related losses such as\nthose due to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are recognized in noninterest\nrevenue. In the event that management decides to retain a loan in the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is\ntransferred to the held-for-investment portfolio at amortized cost on the date of transfer. These loans are\nsubsequently assessed for impairment based on the Firm\u2019s allowance methodology. Refer to Note 13 for a\nfurther discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses. Loan\nmodifications The Firm seeks to modify certain loans in conjunction with its loss mitigation activities.\nThrough the modification, JPMorgan Chase grants one or more concessions to a borrower who is experiencing\nfinancial difficulty in order to minimize the Firm\u2019s economic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession of\nthe collateral, and to ultimately maximize payments received by the Firm from the borrower. The concessions\ngranted vary by program and by borrower-specific characteristics, and may include interest rate reductions,\nterm extensions, payment delays, principal forgiveness, or the acceptance of equity or other assets in lieu\nof payments. Such modifications are accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term and other\ninsignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs. Loans, except for credit card\nloans, modified in a TDR are generally placed on nonaccrual status, although in many cases such loans were\nalready on nonaccrual status prior to modification. These loans may be returned to performing status (the\naccrual of interest is resumed) if the following criteria are met: (i) the borrower has performed under the\nmodified terms for a minimum of six monthsand/or sixpayments, and (ii) the Firm has an expectation that\nrepayment of the modified loan is reasonably assured based on, for example, the borrower\u2019s debt capacity and\nlevel of future earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other current market considerations. In certain\nlimited and well-defined circumstances in which the loan is current at the modification date, such loans are\nnot placed on nonaccrual status at the time of modification. Loans modified in TDRs are generally measured\nfor impairment using the Firm\u2019s established asset-specific allowance methodology, which considers the\nexpected re-default rates for the modified loans. A loan modified in a TDR generally remains subject to the\nasset-specific component of the allowance throughout its remaining life, regardless of whether the loan is\nperforming and has been returned to accrual status. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion of the\nmethodology used to estimate the Firm\u2019s asset-specific allowance. Foreclosed property The Firm acquires\nproperty from borrowers through loan restructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. Property acquired may\ninclude real property (e.g., residential real estate, land, and buildings) and commercial and personal\nproperty (e.g., automobiles, aircraft, railcars, and ships). The Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon\nreceiving assets in satisfaction of a loan (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession). For loans\ncollateralized by real property, the Firm generally recognizes the asset received at foreclosure sale or\nupon the execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction with the borrower. Foreclosed assets are\nreported in other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets and initially recognized at fair value less\nestimated costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value of the acquired property is reviewed and adjusted, if\nnecessary, to the lower of cost or fair value. Subsequent adjustments to fair value are charged/credited to\nnoninterest revenue. Operating expense, such as real estate taxes and maintenance, are charged to other\nexpense.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    227  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nLoan portfolio\nThe Firm\u2019s loan portfolio is divided into threeportfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the\nFirm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and\nWholesale.

Loans that are more than\n30days past due provide an early warning of borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and/or\nwho may be unable or unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues to age, it becomes more clear\nwhether the borrower is likely to be unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential real estate\nloans, late-stage delinquencies (greater than 150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will\nultimately result in a foreclosure or similar liquidation transaction. In addition to delinquency rates,\nother credit quality indicators for consumer loans vary based on the class of loan, as follows: \u2022 For\nresidential real estate loans, the current estimated LTV ratio, or the combined LTV ratio in the case of\njunior lien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss severity in the event of default. Additionally, LTV\nor combined LTV ratios can provide insight into a borrower\u2019s continued willingness to pay, as the\ndelinquency rate of high-LTV loans tends to be greater than that for loans where the borrower has equity in\nthe collateral. The geographic distribution of the loan collateral also provides insight as to the credit\nquality of the portfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, home price changes and specific events\nsuch as natural disasters, will affect credit quality. The borrower\u2019s current or \u201crefreshed\u201d FICO score is a\nsecondary credit quality indicator for certain loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower\u2019s\ncredit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a low FICO score (less than 660) is considered to be\nof higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a higher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high\nLTV ratio and a low FICO score is at greater risk of default than a loan to a borrower that has both a high\nLTV ratio and a high FICO score. \u2022 For scored auto and business banking loans, geographic distribution is an\nindicator of the credit performance of the portfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, geographic\ndistribution provides insights into the portfolio performance based on regional economic activity and\nevents.\n

deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19\npandemic which are still within their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are\ngenerally not considered delinquent.\n(c) Excludes mortgage loans that are 30 or more days past due insured by U.S. government agencies which were\nnot material at December 31, 2022 and 2021. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government\nguarantee.\n(d) Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated.\nApproximately 37% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien\nloans. The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses. Revolving\nloans that have been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within\nthe revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for\nthose products is higher than the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving\nperiod.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    231  \n                                              \n

At December 31, 2022, approximately 5% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or\nmore past due.\n\n(b) Nonaccrual loans exclude mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies which were not material at\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\n(c) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance,\ncertain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of\namortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the\nunderlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.\n\n(d) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $ 175million and $ 172million for the\nyears ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n(e) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n(f) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property\nvalue. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using\nnationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available\nand forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home\nequity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.\n\n(g) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower\u2019s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm\non at least a quarterly basis.\n\n(h) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO\nscore. These loans have been included in a FICO band based on management\u2019s estimation of the borrower\u2019s\ncredit quality.\n\n(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.\n\n(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding\nloan balances at December 31, 2022.\n                                              \n  232    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nLoan modifications\n\nModifications of residential real estate loans, where the Firm grants concessions to borrowers who are\nexperiencing financial difficulty are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term or\nother insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs. The carrying value of\nnew TDRs was $ 362million, $ 866million and $ 819million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and\n2020, respectively. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate\nloans have been modified in TDRs. Nature and extent of modifications The Firm\u2019s proprietary modification\nprograms as well as government programs, including U.S. GSE programs, generally provide various concessions\nto financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment\nextensions and delays of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under\nthe terms of the original agreement. The following table provides information about how residential real\nestate loans were modified in TDRs under the Firm\u2019s loss mitigation programs described above during the\nperiods presented.

In addition to\ndelinquency rates, the geographic distribution of the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the\nportfolio based on the regional economy. While the borrower\u2019s credit score is another general indicator of\ncredit quality, the Firm does not view credit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality because the\nborrower\u2019s credit score tends to be a lagging indicator. The distribution of such scores provides a general\nindicator of credit quality trends within the portfolio; however, the score does not capture all factors\nthat would be predictive of future credit performance. Refreshed FICO score information, which is obtained\nat least quarterly, for a statistically significant random sample of the credit card portfolio is indicated\nin the following table. FICO is considered to be the industry benchmark for credit scores. The Firm\ngenerally originates new credit card accounts to prime consumer borrowers. However, certain cardholders\u2019\nFICO scores may decrease over time, depending on the performance of the cardholder and changes in the credit\nscore calculation.\n\nThe following tables provide

programs\ngranting concessions to credit card borrowers who\nare experiencing financial difficulty. The Firm\ngrants concessions for most of the credit card\nloans under long-term programs. These modifications\ninvolve placing the customer on a fixed payment\nplan, generally for 60months, and typically include\nreducing the interest rate on the credit card.\nSubstantially all modifications under the Firm\u2019s\nlong-term programs are considered to be TDRs. Loans\nwith short-term or other insignificant\nmodifications that are not considered concessions\nare not TDRs. If the cardholder does not comply\nwith the modified payment terms, then the credit\ncard loan continues to age and will ultimately be\ncharged-off in accordance with the Firm\u2019s standard\ncharge-off policy.

The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the\ninternal risk rating assigned to each loan. Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of loans\nand differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings on loans consider the PD and the LGD. The PD is\nthe likelihood that a loan will default. The LGD is the estimated loss on the loan that would be realized\nupon the default of the borrower and takes into consideration collateral and structural support for each\ncredit facility. Management considers several factors to determine an appropriate internal risk rating,\nincluding the obligor\u2019s debt capacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligor\u2019s earnings, the\namount and sources for repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the\nindustry and geography in which the obligor operates. The Firm\u2019s internal risk ratings generally align with\nthe qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to\nchanges in the economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody\u2019s, however the quantitative characteristics\n(e.g., PD and LGD) may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and assumptions. The Firm\ngenerally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as\ninvestment grade, and these ratings have a lower PD and/or lower LGD than non-investment grade ratings.\nNoninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as noncriticized and criticized, and the criticized\nportion is further subdivided into performing and nonaccrual loans, representing management\u2019s assessment of\nthe collectibility of principal and interest. Criticized loans have a higher PD than noncriticized loans.\nThe Firm\u2019s definition of criticized aligns with the U.S. banking regulatory definition of criticized\nexposures, which consist of special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Risk ratings are reviewed\non a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary for updated\ninformation affecting the obligor\u2019s ability to fulfill its obligations. As noted above, the risk rating of a\nloan considers the industry in which the obligor conducts its operations. As part of the overall credit risk\nmanagement framework, the Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry and client\nexposures, with particular attention paid to industries with an actual or potential credit concern.

Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are\nnot considered concessions are not TDRs nor are loans for which the Firm has elected to suspend TDR\naccounting guidance under the option provided by the CARES Act. New TDRs during the years ended December 31,\n2022, 2021 and 2020 were $ 801million, $ 881million and $ 734million, respectively. New TDRs during the\nyears ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 reflected the extension of maturity dates, covenant waivers,\nreceipt of assets in partial satisfaction of the loan and deferral of principal and interest payments,\npredominantly in the Commercial and Industrial and Other loan classes. The impact of these modifications\nresulting in new TDRs was not material to the Firm for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\nThe carrying value of TDRs was $ 936million and $ 607million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    241  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Note 13 \u2013 Allowance for credit losses                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses over the\nremaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance\nsheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses comprises: \u2022 the allowance for loan\nlosses, which covers the Firm\u2019s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented separately\non the Consolidated balance sheets, \u2022 the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is presented on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets in accounts payable and other liabilities, and \u2022 the allowance for credit\nlosses on investment securities, which is reflected in investment securities on the Consolidated balance\nsheets. The income statement effect of all changes in the allowance for credit losses is recognized in the\nprovision for credit losses. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is complex\nand requires significant judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nAt least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of\nthe Firm. Subsequent evaluations of credit exposures, considering the macroeconomic conditions, forecasts\nand other factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in\nfuture periods. The Firm\u2019s policies used to determine its allowance for loan losses and its allowance for\nlending-related commitments are described in the following paragraphs. Refer to Note 10 for a description of\nthe policies used to determine the allowance for credit losses on investment securities. Methodology for\nallowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments The allowance for loan losses and allowance for\nlending-related commitments represents expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of retained\nloans and lending-related commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. The Firm does not record an\nallowance for future draws on unconditionally cancellable lending-related commitments (e.g., credit cards).\nExpected losses related to accrued interest on credit card loans are considered in the Firm\u2019s allowance for\nloan losses. However, the Firm does not record an allowance on other accrued interest receivables, due to\nits policy to write t hese receivables off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income. The\nexpected life of each instrument is determined by considering its contractual term, expected prepayments,\ncancellation features, and certain extension and call options. The expected life of funded credit card loans\nis generally estimated by considering expected future payments on the credit card account, and determining\nhow much of those amounts should be allocated to repayments of the funded loan balance (as of the balance\nsheet date) versus other account activity. This allocation is made using an approach that incorporates the\npayment application requirements of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of\n2009, generally paying down the highest interest rate balances first. The estimate of expected credit losses\nincludes expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off, even if such\nrecoveries result in a negative allowance. Collective and Individual Assessments When calculating the\nallowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments, the Firm assesses whether\nexposures share similar risk characteristics. If similar risk characteristics exist, the Firm estimates\nexpected credit losses collectively, considering the risk associated with a particular pool and the\nprobability that the exposures within the pool will deteriorate or default. The assessment of risk\ncharacteristics is subject to significant management judgment. Emphasizing one characteristic over another\nor considering additional characteristics could affect the allowance. \u2022 Relevant risk characteristics for\nthe consumer portfolio include product type, delinquency status, current FICO scores, geographic\ndistribution, and, for collateralized loans, current LTV ratios. \u2022 Relevant risk characteristics for the\nwholesale portfolio include risk rating, delinquency status, tenor, level and type of collateral, LOB,\ngeography, industry, credit enhancement, product type, facility purpose, and payment terms. The majority of\nthe Firm\u2019s credit exposures share risk characteristics with other similar exposures, and as a result are\ncollectively assessed for impairment (\u201cportfolio-based component\u201d). The portfolio-based component covers\nconsumer loans, performing risk-rated loans and certain lending-related commitments. If an exposure does not\nshare risk characteristics with other exposures, the Firm generally estimates expected credit losses on an\nindividual basis, considering expected repayment and conditions impacting that individual exposure (\u201casset-\nspecific component\u201d). The asset-specific component covers modified PCD loans, loans modified or reasonably\nexpected to be modified in a TDR, collateral-dependent loans, as well as, risk-rated loans that have been\nplaced on nonaccrual status. Portfolio-based component The portfolio-based component begins with a\nquantitative calculation that considers the likelihood of the borrower changing delinquency status or moving\nfrom one risk rating to another. The quantitative calculation covers expected credit losses over an\ninstrument\u2019s expected life and is estimated by applying credit loss factors to the Firm\u2019s estimated exposure\nat default. The credit loss factors incorporate the probability of borrower default as well as loss severity\nin the event of default. They are derived using\n                                              \n  242    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \na weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios over an eight-quarter forecast\nperiod, followed by a single year straight-line interpolation to revert to long run historical information\nfor periods beyond the eight-quarter forecast period. The five macroeconomic scenarios consist of a central,\nrelative adverse, extreme adverse, relative upside and extreme upside scenario, and are updated by the\nFirm\u2019s central forecasting team. The scenarios take into consideration the Firm\u2019s macroeconomic outlook,\ninternal perspectives from subject matter experts across the Firm, and market consensus and involve a\ngoverned process that incorporates feedback from senior management across LOBs, Corporate Finance and Risk\nManagement. The quantitative calculation is adjusted to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging\nrisk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet reflected in the calculation. These\nadjustments are accomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss experience, including during stressed\nperiods, for each major product or model. Management applies judgment in making this adjustment, including\ntaking into account uncertainties associated with the economic and political conditions, quality of\nunderwriting standards, borrower behavior, credit concentrations or deterioration within an industry,\nproduct or portfolio, as well as other relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit quality\nof the portfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships between these factors create further\nuncertainties. The application of different inputs into the quantitative calculation, and the assumptions\nused by management to adjust the quantitative calculation, are subject to significant management judgment,\nand emphasizing one input or assumption over another, or considering other inputs or assumptions, could\naffect the estimate of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments.\nAsset-specific component To determine the asset-specific component of the allowance, collateral-dependent\nloans (including those loans for which foreclosure is probable) and larger, nonaccrual risk-rated loans in\nthe wholesale portfolio segment are generally evaluated individually, while smaller loans (both scored and\nrisk-rated) are aggregated for evaluation using factors relevant for the respective class of assets. The\nFirm generally measures the asset-specific allowance as the difference between the amortized cost of the\nloan and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the loan\u2019s original\neffective interest rate. Subsequent changes in impairment are generally recognized as an adjustment to the\nallowance for loan losses. For collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of collateral less estimated costs\nto sell is used to determine the charge-off amount for declines in value (to reduce the amortized cost of\nthe loan to the fair value of collateral) or the amount of negative allowance that should be recognized (for\nrecoveries of prior charge-offs associated with improvements in the fair value of collateral). The asset-\nspecific component of the allowance for loans that have been or are expected to be modified in TDRs\nincorporates the effect of the modification on the loan\u2019s expected cash flows (including forgone interest,\nprincipal forgiveness, as well as other concessions), and also the potential for redefault. For residential\nreal estate loans modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs, the Firm develops product-specific\nprobability of default estimates, which are applied at a loan level to compute expected losses. In\ndeveloping these probabilities of default, the Firm considers the relationship between the credit quality\ncharacteristics of the underlying loans and certain assumptions about housing prices and unemployment, based\nupon industry-wide data. The Firm also considers its own historical loss experience to-date based on actual\nredefaulted modified loans. For credit card loans modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs, expected\nlosses incorporate projected delinquencies and charge-offs based on the Firm\u2019s historical experience by type\nof modification program. For wholesale loans modified or expected to be modified in TDRs, expected losses\nincorporate management\u2019s expectation of the borrower\u2019s ability to repay under the modified terms. Estimating\nthe timing and amounts of future cash flows is highly judgmental as these cash flow projections rely upon\nestimates such as loss severities, asset valuations, default rates (including redefault rates on modified\nloans), the amounts and timing of interest or principal payments (including any expected prepayments) or\nother factors that are reflective of current and expected market conditions. These estimates are, in turn,\ndependent on factors such as the duration of current overall economic conditions, industry, portfolio, or\nborrower-specific factors, the expected outcome of insolvency proceedings as well as, in certain\ncircumstances, other economic factors. All of these estimates and assumptions require significant management\njudgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    243  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nAllowance for credit losses and related information\nThe table below summarizes information about the allowances for credit losses, and includes a breakdown of\nloans and lending-related commitments by impairment methodology.

changes in the allowance\n\nThe allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2022 was $ 22.2billion, reflecting a net addition of $\n3.5billion from December 31, 2021, consisting of: \u2022 $ 2.3billion in wholesale, driven by deterioration in\nthe Firm\u2019s macroeconomic outlook and loan growth, predominantly in CB and CIB, and \u2022 $ 1.2billion in\nconsumer, predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting higher outstanding balances and deterioration in\nthe Firm\u2019s macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to a decrease in\nuncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede. Deterioration\nin the Firm\u2019s macroeconomic outlook included both updates to the central scenario in the fourth quarter of\n2022, which now reflects a mild recession, as well as the impact of the increased weight placed on the\nadverse scenarios beginning in the first quarter of 2022 due to the effects associated with higher\ninflation, changes in monetary policy, and geopolitical risks, including the war in Ukraine. The Firm's\nallowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic\nscenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case\nassumptions provided in the table below, resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at\n5.6% in the second quarter of 2024, and a 1.2% lower U.S. real GDP exiting the second quarter of 2024.\nThe Firm\u2019s central case assumptions reflected U.S.\nunemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:\n                                                                                               \n                                    Assumptions at December 31, 2022                           \n                                                                2Q23       4Q23       2Q24     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. unemployment rate(a)                                      3.8  %     4.3  %     5.0  %  \n  YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                                 1.5  %     0.4  %       \u2014  %  \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                                    Assumptions at December 31, 2021                           \n                                                                2Q22       4Q22       2Q23     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. unemployment rate(a)                                      4.2  %     4.0  %     3.9  %  \n  YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                                 3.1  %     2.8  %     2.1  %  \n                                                                                               \n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S.\nunemployment rate.\n(b) The year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in\nthe forecast horizon of the central scenario is\ncalculated as the percentage change in U.S. real\nGDP levels from the prior year.\nSubsequent changes to this forecast and related\nestimates will be reflected in the provision for\ncredit losses in future periods.

As asset manager\nof the funds, AWM earns a fee based on assets managed; the fee varies with each fund\u2019s investment objective\nand is competitively priced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AWM\u2019s interests are, in certain cases,\nconsidered to be significant variable interests that result in consolidation of the financial results of\nthese entities.\n\n\u2022 Commercial Banking: CB provides financing and lending-related services to a wide spectrum of clients,\nincluding certain third-party-sponsored entities that may meet the definition of a VIE. CB does not control\nthe activities of these entities and does not consolidate these entities. CB\u2019s maximum loss exposure,\nregardless of whether the entity is a VIE, is generally limited to loans and lending-related commitments\nwhich are reported and disclosed in the same manner as any other third-party transaction.\n\n\u2022 Corporate : Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of VIEs; however these\nentities are generally subject to specialized investment company accounting, which does not require the\nconsolidation of investments, including VIEs. In addition, Treasury and CIO invest in securities generally\nissued by third parties which may meet the definition of VIEs (e.g., issuers of asset-backed securities). In\ngeneral, the Firm does not have the power to direct the significant activities of these entities and\ntherefore does not consolidate these entities. Refer to Note 10 for further information on the Firm\u2019s\ninvestment securities portfolio.\n\nIn addition, CIB also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third\nparties. Refer to pages 251-252 of this Note for more information on consolidated VIE assets and liabilities\nas well as the VIEs sponsored by third parties.\nSignificant Firm-sponsored variable interest entities\nCredit card securitizations CCB\u2019s Card Services business may securitize originated credit card loans,\nprimarily through the Chase Issuance Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d). The Firm\u2019s continuing involvement in credit card\nsecuritizations includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided seller\u2019s interest in the\nreceivables, retaining certain senior and subordinated securities and maintaining escrow accounts. The Firm\nconsolidates the assets and liabilities of its sponsored credit card trusts as it is considered to be the\nprimary beneficiary of these securitization trusts based on the Firm\u2019s ability to direct the activities of\nthese VIEs through its servicing responsibilities and other duties, including making decisions as to the\nreceivables that are transferred into those trusts and as to any related modifications and workouts.\nAdditionally, the nature and extent of the Firm\u2019s other continuing involvement with the trusts, as indicated\nabove, obligates the Firm to absorb losses and gives the Firm the right to receive certain benefits from\nthese VIEs that could potentially be significant. The underlying securitized credit card receivables and\nother assets of the securitization trusts are available only for payment of the beneficial interests issued\nby the securitization trusts; they are not available to pay the Firm\u2019s other obligations or the claims of\nthe Firm\u2019s creditors. The agreements with the credit card securitization trusts require the Firm to maintain\na minimum undivided interest in the credit card trusts (generally 5%). As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the\nFirm held undivided interests in Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts of $ 6.1billion and $\n7.1billion, respectively. The Firm maintained an average undivided interest in principal\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    247  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nreceivables owned by those trusts of approximately 62% and 57% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and\n2021, respectively. The Firm did not retain any senior securities and retained $ 1.5billion of subordinated\nsecurities in certain of its credit card securitization trusts at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. The\nFirm\u2019s undivided interests in the credit card trusts and securities retained are eliminated in\nconsolidation. Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts The Firm securitizes (or has\nsecuritized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans\nprimarily in its CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective\nbusiness involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests\nin the securitization trusts.\nThe following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-\nlabel securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that\nare consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests\nor subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules),\nrecourse or guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts.

pursuant to\ncredit risk retention rules, were risk-rated \u201cA\u201d or better, on an S&P-equivalent basis. The retained\ninterests in prime residential mortgages consisted of $ 2.6billion and $ 1.6billion of investment-grade\nretained interests at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 131million of noninvestment-grade\nretained interests at December 31, 2021; noninvestment-grade retained interests were notmaterial at December\n31, 2022. The retained interests in commercial and other securitization trusts consisted of $ 5.8billion and\n$ 3.5billion of investment-grade retained interests, and $ 1.1billion and $ 929million of noninvestment-\ngrade retained interests at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(f) Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation.\n                                              \n  248    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nResidential mortgage The Firm securitizes\nresidential mortgage loans originated by CCB, as\nwell as residential mortgage loans purchased from\nthird parties by either CCB or CIB. CCB generally\nretains servicing for all residential mortgage\nloans it originated or purchased, and for certain\nmortgage loans purchased by CIB. For\nsecuritizations of loans serviced by CCB, the Firm\nhas the power to direct the significant activities\nof the VIE because it is responsible for decisions\nrelated to loan modifications and workouts. CCB may\nalso retain an interest upon securitization. In\naddition, CIB engages in underwriting and trading\nactivities involving securities issued by Firm-\nsponsored securitization trusts. As a result, CIB\nat times retains senior and/or subordinated\ninterests (including residual interests and amounts\nrequired to be held pursuant to credit risk\nretention rules) in residential mortgage\nsecuritizations at the time of securitization,\nand/or reacquires positions in the secondary market\nin the normal course of business. In certain\ninstances, as a result of the positions retained or\nreacquired by CIB or held by Treasury and CIO or\nCCB, when considered together with the servicing\narrangements entered into by CCB, the Firm is\ndeemed to be the primary beneficiary of certain\nsecuritization trusts. The Firm does not\nconsolidate residential mortgage securitizations\n(Firm-sponsored or third-party-sponsored) when it\nis not the servicer (and therefore does not have\nthe power to direct the most significant activities\nof the trust) or does not hold a beneficial\ninterest in the trust that could potentially be\nsignificant to the trust. Commercial mortgages and\nother consumer securitizations CIB originates and\nsecuritizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages\nin underwriting and trading activities involving\nthe securities issued by securitization trusts. CIB\nmay retain unsold senior and/or subordinated\ninterests (including amounts required to be held\npursuant to credit risk retention rules) in\ncommercial mortgage securitizations at the time of\nsecuritization but, generally, the Firm does not\nservice commercial loan securitizations. Treasury\nand CIO may choose to invest in these\nsecuritizations as well. For commercial mortgage\nsecuritizations the power to direct the significant\nactivities of the VIE generally is held by the\nservicer or investors in a specified class of\nsecurities (\u201ccontrolling class\u201d). The Firm\ngenerally does not retain an interest in the\ncontrolling class in its sponsored commercial\nmortgage securitization transactions. Re-\nsecuritizations The Firm engages in certain re-\nsecuritization transactions in which debt\nsecurities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for\nnew beneficial interests. These transfers occur in\nconnection with both U.S. GSEs and government\nagency sponsored VIEs, which are backed by\nresidential mortgages. The Firm\u2019s consolidation\nanalysis is largely dependent on the Firm\u2019s role\nand interest in the re-securitization trusts.\nThe following table presents the principal amount of securities transferred to re-securitization VIEs.\n                                                                            \n  Year ended December 31,                                                   \n  (in millions)                             2022         2021         2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Transfers of securities to VIEs                                           \n  U.S. GSEs and government agencies    $  16,128    $  53,923    $  46,123  \n                                                                            \nMost re-securitizations with which the Firm is\ninvolved are client-driven transactions in which a\nspecific client or group of clients is seeking a\nspecific return or risk profile. For these\ntransactions, the Firm has concluded that the\ndecision-making power of the entity is shared\nbetween the Firm and its clients, considering the\njoint effort and decisions in establishing the re-\nsecuritization trust and its assets, as well as the\nsignificant economic interest the client holds in\nthe re-securitization trust; therefore the Firm\ndoes not consolidate the re-securitization VIE. The\nFirm did not transfer any private label securities\nto re-securitization VIEs during 2022, 2021 and\n2020, and retained interests in any such Firm-\nsponsored VIEs as of December 31, 2022 and 2021\nwere not material. Additionally, the Firm may\ninvest in beneficial interests of third-party-\nsponsored re-securitizations and generally\npurchases these interests in the secondary market.\nIn these circumstances, the Firm does not have the\nunilateral ability to direct the most significant\nactivities of the re-securitization trust, either\nbecause it was not involved in the initial design\nof the trust, or the Firm was involved with an\nindependent third-party sponsor and demonstrated\nshared power over the creation of the trust;\ntherefore, the Firm does not consolidate the re-\nsecuritization VIE.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    249  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nThe following table presents information on the Firm's interests in nonconsolidated re-securitization VIEs.\n                                                                              \n  December 31,                                   Nonconsolidated              \n  (in millions)                           re-securitization VIEs              \n  U.S. GSEs and government agencies                         2022        2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Interest in VIEs                     $                   2,580    $  1,947  \n                                                                              \nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Firm did not\nconsolidate any U.S. GSE and government agency re-\nsecuritization VIEs or any Firm-sponsored private-\nlabel re-securitization VIEs. Multi-seller conduits\nMulti-seller conduit entities are separate\nbankruptcy remote entities that provide secured\nfinancing, collateralized by pools of receivables\nand other financial assets, to customers of the\nFirm. The conduits fund their financing facilities\nthrough the issuance of highly rated commercial\npaper. The primary source of repayment of the\ncommercial paper is the cash flows from the pools\nof assets. In most instances, the assets are\nstructured with deal-specific credit enhancements\nprovided to the conduits by the customers (i.e.,\nsellers) or other third parties. Deal-specific\ncredit enhancements are generally structured to\ncover a multiple of historical losses expected on\nthe pool of assets, and are typically in the form\nof overcollateralization provided by the seller.\nThe deal-specific credit enhancements mitigate the\nFirm\u2019s potential losses on its agreements with the\nconduits. To ensure timely repayment of the\ncommercial paper, and to provide the conduits with\nfunding to provide financing to customers in the\nevent that the conduits do not obtain funding in\nthe commercial paper market, each asset pool\nfinanced by the conduits has a minimum 100% deal-\nspecific liquidity facility associated with it\nprovided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. also provides the multi-seller\nconduit vehicles with uncommitted program-wide\nliquidity facilities and program-wide credit\nenhancement in the form of standby letters of\ncredit. The amount of program-wide credit\nenhancement required is based upon commercial paper\nissuance and approximates 10% of the outstanding\nbalance of commercial paper. The Firm consolidates\nits Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as the\nFirm has both the power to direct the significant\nactivities of the conduits and a potentially\nsignificant economic interest in the conduits. As\nadministrative agent and in its role in structuring\ntransactions, the Firm makes decisions regarding\nasset types and credit quality, and manages the\ncommercial paper funding needs of the conduits. The\nFirm\u2019s interests that could potentially be\nsignificant to the VIEs include the fees received\nas administrative agent and liquidity and program-\nwide credit enhancement provider, as well as the\npotential exposure created by the liquidity and\ncredit enhancement facilities provided to the\nconduits.\n\nIn the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase\nmakes markets in and invests in commercial paper\nissued by the Firm-administered multi-seller\nconduits. The Firm held $ 13.8billion and $\n13.7billion of the commercial paper issued by the\nFirm-administered multi-seller conduits at December\n31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which have been\neliminated in consolidation. The Firm\u2019s investments\nreflect the Firm\u2019s funding needs and capacity and\nwere not driven by market illiquidity. Other than\nthe amounts required to be held pursuant to credit\nrisk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated\nunder any agreement to purchase the commercial\npaper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller\nconduits. Deal-specific liquidity facilities,\nprogram-wide liquidity and credit enhancement\nprovided by the Firm have been eliminated in\nconsolidation. The Firm or the Firm-administered\nmulti-seller conduits provide lending-related\ncommitments to certain clients of the Firm-\nadministered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded\ncommitments were $ 10.6billion and $ 13.4billion at\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are\nreported as off-balance sheet lending-related\ncommitments in other unfunded commitments to extend\ncredit. Refer to Note 28 for more information on\noff-balance sheet lending-related commitments.\nMunicipal bond vehicles Municipal bond vehicles or\ntender option bond (\u201cTOB\u201d) trusts allow\ninstitutions to finance their municipal bond\ninvestments at short-term rates. In a typical TOB\ntransaction, the trust purchases highly rated\nmunicipal bond(s) of a single issuer and funds the\npurchase by issuing two types of securities: (1)\nputtable floating-rate certificates (\u201cfloaters\u201d)\nand (2) inverse floating-rate residual interests\n(\u201cresiduals\u201d). The floaters are typically purchased\nby money market funds or other short-term investors\nand may be tendered, with requisite notice, to the\nTOB trust. The residuals are retained by the\ninvestor seeking to finance its municipal bond\ninvestment. TOB transactions where the residual is\nheld by a third-party investor are typically known\nas customer TOB trusts, and non-customer TOB trusts\nare transactions where the Residual is retained by\nthe Firm. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a\nthird party. The Firm serves as sponsor for all\nnon-customer TOB transactions. The Firm may provide\nvarious services to a TOB trust, including\nremarketing agent, liquidity or tender option\nprovider, and/or sponsor. J.P. Morgan Securities\nLLC may serve as a remarketing agent on the\nfloaters for TOB trusts. The remarketing agent is\nresponsible for establishing the periodic variable\nrate on the floaters, conducting the initial\nplacement and remarketing tendered floaters. The\nremarketing agent may, but is not obligated to,\nmake markets in floaters. Floaters held by the Firm\nwere not material during 2022 and 2021. JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. or J.P. Morgan Securities LLC\noften serves as the sole liquidity or tender option\nprovider for the TOB trusts. The liquidity\nprovider\u2019s obligation to perform is conditional and\nis limited by certain events\n                                              \n  250    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n(\u201cTermination Events\u201d), which include bankruptcy or failure to pay by the municipal bond issuer or credit\nenhancement provider, an event of taxability on the municipal bonds or the immediate downgrade of the\nmunicipal bond to below investment grade. In addition, the liquidity provider\u2019s exposure is typically\nfurther limited by the high credit quality of the underlying municipal bonds, the excess collateralization\nin the vehicle, or, in certain transactions, the reimbursement agreements with the Residual holders. Holders\nof the floaters may \u201cput,\u201d or tender, their floaters to the TOB trust. If the remarketing agent cannot\nsuccessfully remarket the floaters to another investor, the liquidity provider either provides a loan to the\nTOB trust for the TOB trust\u2019s purchase of the floaters, or it directly purchases the tendered floaters. TOB\ntrusts are considered to be variable interest entities. The Firm consolidates non-customer TOB trusts\nbecause as the Residual holder, the Firm has the right to make decisions that significantly impact the\neconomic performance of the municipal bond vehicle, and it has the right to receive benefits and bear losses\nthat could potentially be significant to the municipal bond vehicle.\n\nConsolidated VIE assets and liabilities\nThe following table

The\nholders of these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan\nChase. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $ 2.1billion and\n$ 2.6billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance\nsheets.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    251  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nVIEs sponsored by third parties The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties.\nThese include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter,\nplacement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm\u2019s-length,\nand individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the\nquality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE\nthat most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially\nbe significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions\non its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any\nother third-party transaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit\nvehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing,\nenergy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the\ngeneral partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit\nvehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in\nthese partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits\nallocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding\ncommitments, was $ 30.2billion and $ 26.8billion, of which $ 10.6billion and $ 9.4billion was unfunded at\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may\nwithhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to\nNote 25 for further information on affordable housing tax credits and Note 28 for more information on off-\nbalance sheet lending-related commitments. Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm may\nprovide various services to customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option\nprovider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a\nreimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions, upon the termination of the\nvehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have\nany intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The\nFirm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that\nsignificantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm\u2019s maximum exposure as\na liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at December 31, 2022 and 2021, was $ 5.8billion and $\n6.8billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $\n8.2billion and $ 10.5billion respectively. Loan securitizations The Firm has securitized and sold a variety\nof loans, including residential mortgages, credit card receivables, commercial mortgages and other consumer\nloans. The purposes of these securitization transactions were to satisfy investor demand and to generate\nliquidity for the Firm. For loan securitizations in which the Firm is not required to consolidate the trust,\nthe Firm records the transfer of the loan receivable to the trust as a sale when all of the following\naccounting criteria for a sale are met: (1) the transferred financial assets are legally isolated from the\nFirm\u2019s creditors; (2) the transferee or beneficial interest holder can pledge or exchange the transferred\nfinancial assets; and (3) the Firm does not maintain effective control over the transferred financial assets\n(e.g., the Firm cannot repurchase the transferred assets before their maturity and it does not have the\nability to unilaterally cause the holder to return the transferred assets). For loan securitizations\naccounted for as a sale, the Firm recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference between the value of\nproceeds received (including cash, beneficial interests, or servicing assets received) and the carrying\nvalue of the assets sold. Gains and losses on securitizations are reported in noninterest revenue.\n                                              \n  252    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nSecuritization activity\nThe following table provides information related to the Firm\u2019s securitization activities for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were\nnot consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization.\n                                                                                                            \n  Year                                                                                                      \n  ended                                                                                                     \n  December                                                                                                  \n  31,                 2022       Commerci\u2026            2021       Commerci\u2026            2020       Commerci\u2026  \n  (in            Resident\u2026             and       Resident\u2026             and       Resident\u2026             and  \n  million\u2026       mortgage\u2026        other(e)       mortgage\u2026        other(e)       mortgage\u2026        other(e)  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Princip\u2026    $     10,218    $      9,036    $     23,876    $     14,917    $      7,103    $      6,624  \n  securit\u2026                                                                                                  \n  All cash                                                                                                  \n  flows                                                                                                     \n  during                                                                                                    \n  the                                                                                                       \n  period:\u2026                                                                                                  \n  Proceeds                                                                                                  \n  received                                                                                                  \n  from                                                                                                      \n  loan        $      9,783    $      8,921    $     24,450    $     15,044    $      7,321    $      6,865  \n  sales as                                                                                                  \n  financi\u2026                                                                                                  \n  instrum\u2026                                                                                                  \n  Servici\u2026                                                                                                  \n  fees                  62               2             153               1             211               1  \n  collect\u2026                                                                                                  \n  Cash                                                                                                      \n  flows                                                                                                     \n  received             489             285             578             273             801             239  \n  on                                                                                                        \n  interes\u2026                                                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \n(a) Excludes re-securitization transactions.\n(b) Predominantly includes Level 2 assets.\n(c) The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the proceeds received upon loan\nsale.\n(d) Represents prime mortgages.

These loans and excess MSRs are\nsold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions\n(e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant\nto Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency.\nThe Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the\nprimary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the\ncredit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser.

If the fair\nvalue is in excess of the carrying value, then the\nreporting unit\u2019s goodwill is considered not to be\nimpaired. If the fair value is less than the\ncarrying value, then an impairment charge is\nrecognized\n\nfor the amount by which the reporting unit\u2019s\ncarrying value exceeds its fair value, up to the\namount of goodwill allocated to that reporting\nunit. The Firm uses the reporting units\u2019 allocated\ncapital plus goodwill and other intangible assets\nas a proxy for the carrying values of equity for\nthe reporting units in the goodwill impairment\ntesting. Reporting unit equity is determined on a\nsimilar basis as the allocation of capital to the\nLOBs which takes into consideration a variety of\nfactors including capital levels of similarly rated\npeers and applicable regulatory capital\nrequirements. Proposed LOB capital levels are\nincorporated into the Firm\u2019s annual budget process,\nwhich is reviewed by the Firm\u2019s Board of Directors\nand Operating Committee. Allocated capital is\nfurther reviewed at least annually and updated as\nneeded. The primary method the Firm uses to\nestimate the fair value of its reporting units is\nthe income approach. This approach projects cash\nflows for the forecast period and uses the\nperpetuity growth method to calculate terminal\nvalues. These cash flows and terminal values, which\nare based on the reporting units\u2019 annual budgets\nand forecasts are then discounted using an\nappropriate discount rate. The discount rate used\nfor each reporting unit represents an estimate of\nthe cost of equity for that reporting unit and is\ndetermined considering the Firm\u2019s overall estimated\ncost of equity (estimated using the Capital Asset\nPricing Model), as adjusted for the risk\ncharacteristics specific to each reporting unit\n(for example, for higher levels of risk or\nuncertainty associated with the business or\nmanagement\u2019s forecasts and assumptions). To assess\nthe reasonableness of the discount rates used for\neach reporting unit, management compares the\ndiscount rate to the estimated cost of equity for\npublicly traded institutions with similar\nbusinesses and risk characteristics. In addition,\nthe weighted average cost of equity (aggregating\nthe various reporting units) is compared with the\nFirm\u2019s overall estimated cost of equity to ensure\nreasonableness. The valuations derived from the\ndiscounted cash flow analysis are then compared\nwith market-based trading and transaction multiples\nfor relevant competitors. Trading and transaction\ncomparables are used as general indicators to\nassess the overall reasonableness of the estimated\nfair values, although precise conclusions generally\ncannot be drawn due to the differences that\nnaturally exist between the Firm\u2019s businesses and\ncompetitor institutions. The Firm also takes into\nconsideration a comparison between the aggregate\nfair values of the Firm\u2019s reporting units and\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s market capitalization. In\nevaluating this comparison, the Firm considers\nseveral factors, including (i) a control premium\nthat would exist in a market transaction, (ii)\nfactors related to the level of execution risk that\nwould exist at the Firmwide level that do not exist\nat the reporting unit level and (iii) short-term\nmarket volatility and other factors that do not\ndirectly affect the value of individual reporting\nunits.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    255  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nUnanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital\nrequirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative\nchanges or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the\nFirm\u2019s reporting units to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to\nearnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill. Mortgage servicing rights\nMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others.\nThe fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to\nservice the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively\namortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased\nfrom third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. As\npermitted by U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to account for its MSRs at fair value. The Firm treats its MSRs\nas a single class of servicing assets based on the availability of market inputs used to measure the fair\nvalue of its MSR asset and its treatment of MSRs as one aggregate pool for risk management purposes. The\nFirm estimates the fair value of MSRs using an option-adjusted spread (\u201cOAS\u201d) model, which projects MSR cash\nflows over multiple interest rate scenarios in conjunction with the Firm\u2019s prepayment model, and then\ndiscounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted rates. The model considers portfolio characteristics,\ncontractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, costs to service, late\ncharges and other ancillary revenue, and other economic factors. The Firm compares fair value estimates and\nassumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers recent market activity and actual\nportfolio experience.\n                                              \n  256    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nThe fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest rates, including their effect on prepayment\nspeeds. MSRs typically decrease in value when interest rates decline because declining interest rates tend\nto increase prepayments and therefore reduce the expected life of the net servicing cash flows that comprise\nthe MSR asset. Conversely, securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities), and certain derivatives (e.g.,\nthose for which the Firm receives fixed-rate interest payments) increase in value when interest rates\ndecline. JPMorgan Chase uses combinations of derivatives and securities to manage the risk of changes in the\nfair value of MSRs. The intent is to offset any interest-rate related changes in the fair value of MSRs with\nchanges in the fair value of the related risk management instruments.\nThe following table summarizes MSR activity for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n                                                                                                   \n  As of or for the year ended December 31,                                                         \n  (in millions, except where otherwise                                                             \n  noted)                                                2022              2021               2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Fair value at beginning of period           $  5,494          $  3,276          $   4,699        \n  MSR activity:                                                                                    \n  Originations of MSRs                             798             1,659                944        \n  Purchase of MSRs                               1,400             1,363                248        \n  Disposition of MSRs(a)                          -822              -114               -176        \n  Net additions/(dispositions)                   1,376             2,908              1,016        \n  Changes due to collection/realization of        -936              -788               -899        \n  expected cash flows                                                                              \n  Changes in valuation due to inputs and                                                           \n  assumptions:                                                                                     \n  Changes due to market interest rates and       2,022               404             -1,568        \n  other(b)                                                                                         \n  Changes in valuation due to other inputs                                                         \n  and assumptions:                                                                                 \n  Projected cash flows (e.g., cost to               14               109                -54        \n  service)                                                                                         \n  Discount rates                                     \u2014                 \u2014                199        \n  Prepayment model changes and other(c)              3              -415               -117        \n  Total changes in valuation due to other           17              -306                 28        \n  inputs and assumptions                                                                           \n  Total changes in valuation due to inputs       2,039                98             -1,540        \n  and assumptions                                                                                  \n  Fair value at December 31,                  $  7,973          $  5,494          $   3,276        \n  Change in unrealized gains/(losses)                                                              \n  included in income related to MSRs held     $  2,039          $     98          $  -1,540        \n  at December 31,                                                                                  \n  Contractual service fees, late fees and        1,535             1,298              1,325        \n  other ancillary fees included in income                                                          \n  Third-party mortgage loans serviced at           584               520                448        \n  December 31, (in billions)                                                                       \n  Servicer advances, net of an allowance                                                           \n  for uncollectible amounts, at December           0.8               1.6                1.8        \n  31, (in billions)(d)                                                                             \n                                                                                                   \n(a) Includes excess MSRs transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage backed\nsecurities (\u201cSMBS\u201d) for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2020.

However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if\nthey were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    257  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nThe following table presents the components of mortgage fees and related income (including the impact of MSR\nrisk management activities) for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n                                                                                                   \n  Year ended December 31,                                                                          \n  (in millions)                                         2022              2021               2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  CCB mortgage fees and related income                                                             \n  Production revenue                         $     497          $  2,215          $   2,629        \n  Net mortgage servicing revenue:                                                                  \n  Operating revenue:                                                                               \n  Loan servicing revenue                         1,582             1,257              1,367        \n  Changes in MSR asset fair value due to                                                           \n  collection/realization of expected cash         -936              -788               -899        \n  flows                                                                                            \n  Total operating revenue                          646               469                468        \n  Risk management:                                                                                 \n  Changes in MSR asset fair value due to         2,022               404             -1,568        \n  market interest rates and other(a)                                                               \n  Other changes in MSR asset fair value                                                            \n  due to other inputs and assumptions in            17              -306                 28        \n  model(b)                                                                                         \n  Change in derivative fair value and           -1,946              -623              1,522        \n  other                                                                                            \n  Total risk management                             93              -525                -18        \n  Total net mortgage servicing revenue             739               -56                450        \n  Total CCB mortgage fees and related            1,236             2,159              3,079        \n  income                                                                                           \n  All other                                         14                11                 12        \n  Mortgage fees and related income           $   1,250          $  2,170          $   3,091        \n                                                                                                   \n(a) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest\nrates, and the difference between actual and expected prepayments.\n(b) Represents the aggregate impact of changes in model inputs and assumptions such as projected cash flows\n(e.g., cost to service), discount rates and changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes\nin market interest rates (e.g., changes in prepayments due to changes in home prices).\nChanges in fair value based on variations in\nassumptions generally cannot be easily\nextrapolated, because the relationship of the\nchange in the assumptions to the change in fair\nvalue are often highly interrelated and may not be\nlinear.

These leases generally have terms of 20years or less, determined based on\nthe contractual maturity of the lease, and include periods covered by options to extend or terminate the\nlease when the Firm is reasonably certain that it will exercise those options. All leases with lease terms\ngreater than twelve months are reported as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d)\nasset. None of these lease agreements impose restrictions on the Firm\u2019s ability to pay dividends, engage in\ndebt or equity financing transactions or enter into further lease agreements. Certain of these leases\ncontain escalation clauses that will increase rental payments based on maintenance, utility and tax\nincreases, which are non-lease components. The Firm elected not to separate lease and non-lease components\nof a contract for its real estate leases. As such, real estate lease payments represent payments on both\nlease and non-lease components. Operating lease liabilities and ROU assets are recognized at the lease\ncommencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The\nfuture lease payments are discounted at a rate that estimates the Firm\u2019s collateralized borrowing rate for\nfinancing instruments of a similar term and are included in accounts payable and other liabilities.

The\nFirm\u2019s lease financings are predominantly auto\noperating leases. These assets subject to operating\nleases are recognized in other assets on the Firm\u2019s\nConsolidated balance sheets and are depreciated on\na straight-line basis over the lease term to reduce\nthe asset to its estimated residual value.\nDepreciation expense is included in technology,\ncommunications and equipment expense in the\nConsolidated statements of income. The Firm\u2019s lease\nincome is generally recognized on a straight-line\nbasis over the lease term and is included in other\nincome in the Consolidated statements of income.\n\nOn a periodic basis, the Firm assesses leased\nassets for impairment, and if the carrying amount\nof the leased asset exceeds the undiscounted cash\nflows from the lease payments and the estimated\nresidual value upon disposition of the leased\nasset, an impairment loss is recognized.\n\nThe risk of loss on auto and equipment leased\nassets relating to the residual value of the leased\nassets is monitored through projections of the\nasset residual values at lease origination and\nperiodic review of residual values, and is\nmitigated through arrangements with certain\nmanufacturers or lessees.\nThe following

In\norder to modify exposure to interest rate and\ncurrency exchange rate movements, JPMorgan Chase\nutilizes derivative instruments, primarily interest\nrate and cross-currency interest rate swaps, in\nconjunction with some of its debt issuances. The\nuse of these instruments modifies the Firm\u2019s\ninterest expense on the associated debt. The\nmodified weighted-average interest rates for total\nlong-term debt, including the effects of related\nderivative instruments, were 4.89% and 1.43% as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. JPMorgan\nChase & Co. has guaranteed certain long-term debt\nof its subsidiaries, including structured notes.\nThese guarantees rank on parity with the Firm\u2019s\nother unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.\nThe amount of such guaranteed long-term debt and\nstructured notes was $ 28.2billion and $\n16.4billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. The Firm\u2019s unsecured debt does not\ncontain requirements that would call for an\nacceleration of payments, maturities or changes in\nthe structure of the existing debt, provide any\nlimitations on future borrowings or require\nadditional collateral, based on unfavorable changes\nin the Firm\u2019s credit ratings, financial ratios,\nearnings or stock price.\n                                              \n  264    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Note 21 \u2013 Preferred stock                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, JPMorgan Chase was authorized to issue 200million shares of preferred stock,\nin one or more series, with a par value of $ 1per share.

Subsequently, the Federal Reserve\ndirected all large banks, including the Firm, to\ndiscontinue net share repurchases through the end\nof 2020. The Board of Directors\u2019 authorization to\nrepurchase common shares is utilized at\nmanagement\u2019s discretion, and the timing of\npurchases and the exact amount of common shares\nthat may be repurchased is subject to various\nfactors, including market conditions; legal and\nregulatory considerations affecting the amount and\ntiming of repurchase activity; the Firm\u2019s capital\nposition (taking into account goodwill and\nintangibles); internal capital generation; and\nalternative investment opportunities. The $\n30billion common share repurchase program approved\nby the Board does not establish specific price\ntargets or timetables. The repurchase program may\nbe suspended by management at any time; and may be\nexecuted through open market purchases or privately\nnegotiated transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1\nplans, which are written trading plans that the\nFirm may enter into from time to time under Rule\n10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and\nwhich allow the Firm to repurchase its common\nshares during periods when it may otherwise not be\nrepurchasing common shares \u2014 for example, during\ninternal trading blackout periods.

Under the two-class\nmethod, all earnings (distributed and\nundistributed) are allocated to common stock and\nparticipating securities. JPMorgan Chase grants\nRSUs under its share-based compensation programs,\npredominantly all of which entitle recipients to\nreceive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting\nperiod on a basis equivalent to dividends paid to\nholders of the Firm\u2019s common stock. These unvested\nRSUs meet the definition of participating\nsecurities based on their respective rights to\nreceive nonforfeitable dividends, and they are\ntreated as a separate class of securities in\ncomputing basic EPS. Participating securities are\nnot included as incremental shares in computing\ndiluted EPS; refer to Note 9 for additional\ninformation.\nDiluted EPS incorporates the potential impact of\ncontingently issuable shares, including awards\nwhich require future service as a condition of\ndelivery of the underlying common stock. Diluted\nEPS is calculated under both the two-class and\ntreasury stock methods, and the more dilutive\namount is reported. For each of the periods\npresented in the table below, diluted EPS\ncalculated under the two-class method was more\ndilutive.\nThe following table presents the calculation of net\nincome applicable to

JPMorgan Chase\u2019s expense for income taxes\nincludes the current and deferred portions of that\nexpense. A valuation allowance is established to\nreduce deferred tax assets to the amount the Firm\nexpects to realize. Due to the inherent\ncomplexities arising from the nature of the Firm\u2019s\nbusinesses, and from conducting business and being\ntaxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions,\nsignificant judgments and estimates are required to\nbe made. Agreement of tax liabilities between\nJPMorgan Chase and the many tax jurisdictions in\nwhich the Firm files tax returns may not be\nfinalized for several years.

These\nunrecognized items include the tax effect of\ncertain temporary differences, the portion of gross\nstate and local unrecognized tax benefits that\nwould be offset by the benefit from associated U.S.\nfederal income tax deductions, and the portion of\ngross non-U.S. unrecognized tax benefits that would\nhave offsets in other jurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase\nevaluates the need for changes in unrecognized tax\nbenefits based on its anticipated tax return filing\npositions as part of its U.S. federal and state and\nlocal tax returns. In addition, the Firm is\npresently under audit by a number of taxing\nauthorities, most notably by the Internal Revenue\nService, as summarized in the Tax examination\nstatus table below. The evaluation of unrecognized\ntax benefits as well as the potential for audit\nsettlements make it reasonably possible that over\nthe next 12 months the gross balance of\nunrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease\nby as much as approximately $ 1.0billion. The\nchange in the unrecognized tax benefit would result\nin a payment or income statement recognition.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of\nthe beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits.\n                                                                                \n  Year ended December 31,                                                       \n  (in millions)                                   2022        2021        2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Balance at January\u00a01,                       $  4,636    $  4,250    $  4,024  \n  Increases based on tax positions related       1,234         798         685  \n  to the current period                                                         \n  Increases based on tax positions related         123         393         362  \n  to prior periods                                                              \n  Decreases based on tax positions related        -824        -657        -705  \n  to prior periods                                                              \n  Decreases related to cash settlements           -126        -148        -116  \n  with taxing authorities                                                       \n  Balance at December 31,                     $  5,043    $  4,636    $  4,250  \n                                                                                \nAfter-tax interest expense/(benefit) and penalties\nrelated to income tax liabilities recognized in\nincome tax expense were $ 141million, $ 174million\nand $ 147million in 2022, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.\n\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, in addition to the\nliability for unrecognized tax benefits, the Firm\nhad accrued $ 1.3billion and $ 1.1billion,\nrespectively, for income tax-related interest and\npenaltie s.\n\nTax examination status\nJPMorgan Chase is continually under examination by\nthe Internal Revenue Service, by taxing authorities\nthroughout the world, and by many state and local\njurisdictions throughout the U.S. The following\ntable summarizes the status of significant income\ntax examinations of JPMorgan Chase and its\nconsolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022.\n                                                                                                            \n                                     Periods under examination    Status                                    \n  JPMorgan Chase \u2013 U.S.              2011 \u2013 2013                  Field examination of amended returns      \n  JPMorgan Chase \u2013 U.S.              2014 - 2018                  Field examination of original and         \n                                                                  amended returns                           \n  JPMorgan Chase \u2013 New York State    2012 - 2014                  Field Examination                         \n  JPMorgan Chase \u2013 New York City     2015 - 2017                  Field Examination                         \n  JPMorgan Chase \u2013 U.K.              2011 \u2013 2020                  Field examination of certain select       \n                                                                  entities                                  \n                                                                                                            \n                                              \n  272    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nNote 26 \u2013 Restricted cash, other restricted\n\nassets and intercompany funds transfers\n\nRestricted cash and other restricted assets\n\nCertain of the Firm\u2019s cash and other assets are\nrestricted as to withdrawal or usage.

Such secured loans provided by any banking subsidiary to\nthe Parent Company or to any particular affiliate, together with certain other transactions with such\naffiliate (collectively referred to as \u201ccovered transactions\u201d), must be made on terms and conditions that\nare consistent with safe and sound banking practices. In addition, unless collateralized with cash or US\nGovernment debt obligations, covered transactions are generally limited to 10% of the banking subsidiary\u2019s\ntotal capital, as determined by the risk-based capital guidelines; the aggregate amount of covered\ntransactions between any banking subsidiary and all of its affiliates is limited to 20% of the banking\nsubsidiary\u2019s total capital. The Parent Company\u2019s two principal subsidiaries are JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nand JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC, an intermediate holding company (the \u201cIHC\u201d). The IHC generally holds the\nstock of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC\nalso owns other assets and provides intercompany loans to the Parent Company. The Parent Company is\nobligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances\n(including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock). The\nprincipal sources of income and funding for the Parent Company are dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nand dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. In addition to dividend restrictions set forth in\nstatutes and regulations, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have authority under the Financial\nInstitutions Supervisory Act to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations\nthey supervise, including the Parent Company and its subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies,\nif, in the banking regulator\u2019s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice\nin light of the financial condition of the banking organization. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends\nor extending credit to the Parent Company if certain capital or liquidity \u201cthresholds\u201d are breached or if\nlimits are otherwise imposed by the Parent Company\u2019s management or Board of Directors. At January 1, 2023,\nthe Parent Company\u2019s banking subsidiaries could pay, in the aggregate, approximately $ 34billion in\ndividends to their respective bank holding companies without the prior approval of their relevant banking\nregulators. The capacity to pay dividends in 2023 will be supplemented by the banking subsidiaries\u2019 earnings\nduring the year.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    273  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Note 27 \u2013 Regulatory capital                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \nThe Federal Reserve establishes capital\nrequirements, including well-capitalized\nrequirements, for the consolidated financial\nholding company. The Office of the Comptroller of\nthe Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d) establishes similar minimum\ncapital requirements and standards for the Firm\u2019s\nprincipal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum\ncapital ratios and overall capital adequacy\nstandards for large and internationally active U.S.\nbank holding companies and banks, including the\nFirm and its IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. Two comprehensive approaches are\nprescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized\napproach (\u201cBasel III Standardized\u201d), and an\nadvanced approach (\u201cBasel III Advanced\u201d). For each\nof the risk-based capital ratios, the capital\nadequacy of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nis evaluated against the lower of the Standardized\nor Advanced approaches compared to their respective\nregulatory capital ratio requirements. The three\ncomponents of regulatory capital under the Basel\nIII rules are as illustrated below: Under the risk-\nbased capital and leverage-based guidelines of the\nFederal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to\nmaintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital, Tier 1\ncapital, Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the\nSLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements\ncould cause the Federal Reserve to take action. IDI\nsubsidiaries are also subject to these capital\nrequirements established by their respective\nprimary regulators .\nThe following table presents the risk-based regulatory capital ratio requirements and well-capitalized\nratios to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were subject as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n                                                                                                            \n                Standardiz\u2026                       Advanced                                                  \n                    capital                        capital                    Well-capit\u2026                   \n                      ratio                          ratio                         ratios                   \n                requiremen\u2026                    requiremen\u2026                                                  \n                  BHC(a)(b)       IDI(c)            BHC(a)       IDI(c)            BHC(d)        IDI(e)     \n  Risk-based                                                                                                \n  capital                                                                                                   \n  ratios                                                                                                    \n  CET1                 12.0  %       7.0  %           10.5  %       7.0  %                 NA       6.5  %  \n  capital                                                                                                   \n  Tier 1               13.5          8.5              12.0          8.5               6.0  %        8.0     \n  capital                                                                                                   \n  Total                15.5         10.5              14.0         10.5              10.0          10.0     \n  capital                                                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \nNote: The table above is as defined by the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC and to\nwhich the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries are subject.\n(a) Represents the regulatory capital ratio requirements applicable to the Firm.

Beginning\nJanuary 1, 2022, the $ 2.9billion CECL capital benefit is being phased out at 25% per year over a three-year\nperiod. As of December 31, 2022, the Firm\u2019s CET1 capital reflected the remaining $ 2.2billion benefit\nassociated with the CECL capital transition provisions. Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, the Firm\nphased out 25% of the other CECL capital transition provisions which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted\naverage assets, total leverage exposure and RWA, as applicable.

The contractual amount of these financial instruments\nrepresents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the\ncommitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or\nclient subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and\nguarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a\ndefault occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm\u2019s\nview, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. To provide for expected\ncredit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses\non lending-related commitments is maintained.Refer to Note 13 for further information regarding the\nallowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual\namounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other\ncommitments at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity\nlending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not\nexperienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized\nat the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower notice\nor, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card\nlines when the borrower is 60days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are\nsignificant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline\nin the creditworthiness of the borrower.\n                                              \n  276    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n

The Firm also issues\ncommitments under multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance\nof a standby letter of credit. Guarantees U.S. GAAP requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of\na guarantee, a liability in an amount equal to the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the\nguarantee. U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a contract that contingently requires the guarantor to pay a\nguaranteed party based upon: (a) changes in an underlying asset, liability or equity security of the\nguaranteed party; or (b) a third party\u2019s failure to perform under a specified agreement. The Firm considers\nthe following off\u2013balance sheet arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: standby letters of credit and\nother financial guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, certain indemnification agreements included\nwithin third-party contractual arrangements, certain derivative contracts and the guarantees under the\nsponsored member repo program. As required by U.S. GAAP, the Firm initially records guarantees at the\ninception date fair value of the non-contingent obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of consideration\nreceived or the net present value of the premium receivable). For these obligations, the Firm records this\nfair value amount in other liabilities with an offsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums received), or\nother assets (for premiums receivable). Any premium receivable recorded in other assets is reduced as cash\nis received under the contract, and the fair value of the liability recorded at inception is amortized into\nincome as lending and deposit-related fees over the life of the guarantee contract. The lending-related\ncontingent obligation is recognized based on expected credit losses in addition to, and separate from, any\nnon-contingent obligation. Non-lending-related contingent obligations are recognized when the liability\nbecomes probable and reasonably estimable. These obligations are not recognized if the estimated amount is\nless than the carrying amount of any non-contingent liability recognized at inception (adjusted for any\namortization). Examples of non-lending-related contingent obligations include indemnifications provided in\nsales agreements, where a portion of the sale proceeds is allocated to the guarantee, which adjusts the gain\nor loss that would otherwise result from the transaction. For these indemnifications, the initial liability\nis amortized to income as the Firm\u2019s risk is reduced (i.e., over time or when the indemnification expires).\nThe contractual amount and carrying value of guarantees and indemnifications are included in the table on\npage 277.

Standby letters of credit and other\nfinancial guarantees Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional lending\ncommitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a third party under\ncertain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade\nfinancings and similar transactions.\nThe following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and\nother financial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nStandby letters of credit, other financial guarantees and other letters of credit\n                                                                                                            \n                2022                                           2021                                         \n                Standby                                        Standby                                      \n                letters of                                     letters of                                   \n  December      credit and                                     credit and                                   \n  31,           other                                 Other    other                                 Other  \n  (in           financial                           letters    financial                           letters  \n  millions)     guarantees                        of credit    guarantees                        of credit  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Investmen\u2026                   $  19,205    $         3,040                   $  19,998    $         3,087  \n  Noninvest\u2026                       8,234              1,094                       8,532              1,361  \n  Total                                                                                                     \n  contractu\u2026                   $  27,439    $         4,134                   $  28,530    $         4,448  \n  amount                                                                                                    \n  Allowance                                                                                                 \n  for                          $      82    $             6                   $     123    $             9  \n  lending-r\u2026                                                                                                \n  commitmen\u2026                                                                                                \n  Guarantee                          326                  \u2014                         353                  \u2014  \n  liability                                                                                                 \n  Total                                                                                                     \n  carrying                     $     408    $             6                   $     476    $             9  \n  value                                                                                                     \n  Commitmen\u2026                                                                                                \n  with                         $  15,296    $           795                   $  14,511    $           999  \n  collateral                                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n(a) The ratings scale is based on the Firm\u2019s internal risk ratings.

As part\nof this program, the Firm provides an\nindemnification in the lending agreements which\nprotects the lender against the failure of the\nborrower to return the lent securities. To minimize\nits liability under these indemnification\nagreements, the Firm obtains cash or other highly\nliquid collateral with a market value exceeding\n100% of the value of the securities on loan from\nthe borrower. Collateral is marked to market daily\nto help assure that collateralization is adequate.\nAdditional collateral is called from the borrower\nif a shortfall exists, or collateral may be\nreleased to the borrower in the event of\novercollateralization. If a borrower defaults, the\nFirm would use the collateral held to purchase\nreplacement securities in the market or to credit\nthe lending client or counterparty with the cash\nequivalent thereof. The cash collateral held by the\nFirm may be invested on behalf of the client in\nindemnified resale agreements, whereby the Firm\nindemnifies the client against the loss of\nprincipal invested. To minimize its liability under\nthese agreements, the Firm obtains collateral with\na market value exceeding 100% of the principal\ninvested. Derivatives qualifying as guarantees The\nFirm transacts in certain derivative contracts that\nhave the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S.\nGAAP. These contracts include written put options\nthat require the Firm to purchase assets upon\nexercise by the option holder at a specified price\nby a specified date in the future. The Firm may\nenter into written put option contracts in order to\nmeet client needs, or for other trading purposes.\nThe terms of written put options are typically five\nyearsor less. Derivatives deemed to be guarantees\nalso includes stable value contracts, commonly\nreferred to as \u201cstable value products\u201d, that\nrequire the Firm to make a payment of the\ndifference between the market value and the book\nvalue of a counterparty\u2019s reference portfolio of\nassets in the event that market value is less than\nbook value and certain other conditions have been\nmet. Stable value products are transacted in order\nto allow investors to realize investment returns\nwith less volatility than an unprotected portfolio.\nThese contracts are typically longer-term or may\nhave no stated maturity, but allow the Firm to\nelect to terminate the contract under certain\nconditions. The notional value of derivative\nguarantees generally represents the Firm\u2019s maximum\nexposure. However, exposure to certain stable value\nproducts is contractually limited to a\nsubstantially lower percentage of the notional\namount. The fair value of derivative guarantees\nreflects the probability, in the Firm\u2019s view, of\nwhether the Firm will be required to perform under\nthe contract. The Firm reduces exposures to these\ncontracts by entering into offsetting transactions,\nor by entering into contracts that hedge the market\nrisk related to the derivative guarantees.\nThe following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying as guarantees as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n                                                                                                        \n  (in millions)                                      December 31, 2022               December 31, 2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Notional amounts                                                                                      \n  Derivative guarantees                   $  59,180                       $  55,730                     \n  Stable value contracts with                31,820                          29,778                     \n  contractually limited exposure                                                                        \n  Maximum exposure of stable value                                                                      \n  contracts with contractually limited        2,063                           2,882                     \n  exposure                                                                                              \n  Fair value                                                                                            \n  Derivative payables                           649                             475                     \n                                                                                                        \nIn addition to derivative contracts that meet the\ncharacteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a\npurchaser and seller of credit protection in the\ncredit derivatives market. Refer to Note 5 for a\nfurther discussion of credit derivatives. Unsettled\nsecurities financing agreements In the normal\ncourse of business, the Firm enters into resale and\nsecurities borrowed agreements. At settlement,\nthese commitments result in the Firm advancing cash\nto and receiving securities collateral from the\ncounterparty. The Firm also enters into repurchase\nand securities loaned agreements. At settlement,\nthese commitments result in the Firm receiving cash\nfrom and providing securities collateral to the\ncounterparty. Such agreements settle at a future\ndate. These agreements generally do not meet the\ndefinition of a derivative, and therefore, are not\nrecorded on the Consolidated balance sheets until\nsettlement date. These agreements predominantly\nhave regular-way settlement terms. Refer to Note 11\nfor a further discussion of securities financing\nagreements. Loan sales- and securitization-related\nindemnifications Mortgage repurchase liability In\nconnection with the Firm\u2019s mortgage loan sale and\nsecuritization activities with U.S. GSEs the Firm\nhas made representations and warranties that the\nloans sold meet certain requirements, and that may\nrequire the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans\nand/or indemnify the loan purchaser if such\nrepresentations and warranties are breached by the\nFirm. Private label securitizations The liability\nrelated to repurchase demands associated with\nprivate label securitizations is separately\nevaluated by the Firm in establishing its\nlitigation reserves. Refer to Note 30 for\nadditional information regarding litigation. Loans\nsold with recourse The Firm provides servicing for\nmortgages and certain commercial lending products\non both a recourse and nonrecourse basis. In\nnonrecourse servicing, the principal credit risk to\nthe Firm is the cost of temporary servicing\nadvances of funds (i.e., normal servicing\nadvances). In recourse servicing, the servicer\nagrees to share credit risk with the owner of the\nmortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    279  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nor Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing predominantly occur\nwhen foreclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan are less than the sum of the\noutstanding principal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of\nthe underlying property. The Firm\u2019s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, thereby effectively\ntransferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities issued by\nthe trust. The unpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse as well as the carrying value of the\nrelated liability that the Firm has recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets, which is representative of the Firm\u2019s view of the likelihood it will have to perform under\nits recourse obligations, are disclosed in the table on page 277. Other off-balance sheet arrangements\nIndemnification agreements \u2013 general In connection with issuing securities to investors outside the U.S.,\nthe Firm may agree to pay additional amounts to the holders of the securities in the event that, due to a\nchange in tax law, certain types of withholding taxes are imposed on payments on the securities. The terms\nof the securities may also give the Firm the right to redeem the securities if such additional amounts are\npayable. The Firm may also enter into indemnification clauses in connection with the licensing of software\nto clients (\u201csoftware licensees\u201d) or when it sells a business or assets to a third party (\u201cthird-party\npurchasers\u201d), pursuant to which it indemnifies software licensees for claims of liability or damages that\nmay occur subsequent to the licensing of the software, or third-party purchasers for losses they may incur\ndue to actions taken by the Firm prior to the sale of the business or assets. It is difficult to estimate\nthe Firm\u2019s maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements, since this would require an assessment\nof future changes in tax law and future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred.\nHowever, based on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to be remote. Merchant charge-\nbacks Under the rules of payment networks, in its role as a merchant acquirer, the Firm\u2019s Merchant Services\nbusiness in CIB Payments, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card\ntransactions that result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder\u2019s\nfavor, the Firm will (through the cardholder\u2019s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder\nand will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If the Firm is unable to collect the amount from the\nmerchant, the Firm will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. The Firm\nmitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other\ncollateral. In addition, the Firm recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance\nrisk related to charge-backs. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Firm processed an\naggregate volume of $ 2,158.4billion, $ 1,886.7billion, and $ 1,597.3billion, respectively. Clearing\nServices \u2013 Client Credit Risk The Firm provides clearing services for clients by entering into securities\npurchases and sales and derivative contracts with CCPs, including ETDs such as futures and options, as well\nas OTC-cleared derivative contracts. As a clearing member, the Firm stands behind the performance of its\nclients, collects cash and securities collateral (margin) as well as any settlement amounts due from or to\nclients, and remits them to the relevant CCP or client in whole or part. There are two types of margin:\nvariation margin is posted on a daily basis based on the value of clients\u2019 derivative contracts and initial\nmargin is posted at inception of a derivative contract, generally on the basis of the potential changes in\nthe variation margin requirement for the contract. As a clearing member, the Firm is exposed to the risk of\nnonperformance by its clients, but is not liable to clients for the performance of the CCPs. Where possible,\nthe Firm seeks to mitigate its risk to the client through the collection of appropriate amounts of margin at\ninception and throughout the life of the transactions. The Firm can also cease providing clearing services\nif clients do not adhere to their obligations under the clearing agreement. In the event of nonperformance\nby a client, the Firm would close out the client\u2019s positions and access available margin. The CCP would\nutilize any margin it holds to make itself whole, with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by the\nFirm as a clearing member. The Firm reflects its exposure to nonperformance risk of the client through the\nrecognition of margin receivables from clients and margin payables to CCPs; the clients\u2019 underlying\nsecurities or derivative contracts are not reflected in the Firm\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements. It is\ndifficult to estimate the Firm\u2019s maximum possible exposure through its role as a clearing member, as this\nwould require an assessment of transactions that clients may execute in the future. However, based upon\nhistorical experience, and the credit risk mitigants available to the Firm, management believes it is\nunlikely that the Firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements and the risk of loss\nis expected to be remote. Refer to Note 5 for information on the derivatives that the Firm executes for its\nown account and records in its Consolidated Financial Statements.\n                                              \n  280    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nExchange & Clearing House Memberships The Firm is a member of several securities and derivative exchanges\nand clearing houses, both in the U.S. and other countries, and it provides clearing services to its clients.\nMembership in some of these organizations requires the Firm to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred\nby the organization as a result of the default of another member. Such obligations vary with different\norganizations. These obligations may be limited to the amount (or a multiple of the amount) of the Firm\u2019s\ncontribution to the guarantee fund maintained by a clearing house or exchange as part of the resources\navailable to cover any losses in the event of a member default. Alternatively, these obligations may also\ninclude a pro rata share of the residual losses after applying the guarantee fund. Additionally, certain\nclearing houses require the Firm as a member to pay a pro rata share of losses that may result from the\nclearing house\u2019s investment of guarantee fund contributions and initial margin, unrelated to and independent\nof the default of another member. Generally a payment would only be required should such losses exceed the\nresources of the clearing house or exchange that are contractually required to absorb the losses in the\nfirst instance. In certain cases, it is difficult to estimate the Firm\u2019s maximum possible exposure under\nthese membership agreements, since this would require an assessment of future claims that may be made\nagainst the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the\nrisk of loss to the Firm to be remote. Where the Firm\u2019s maximum possible exposure can be estimated, the\namount is disclosed in the table on page 277, in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments\nline. Sponsored member repo program The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight and\nterm resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation (\u201cFICC\u201d) on behalf of clients that become sponsored members under the FICC\u2019s rules. The\nFirm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment and performance of its sponsored member\nclients\u2019 respective obligations under the FICC\u2019s rules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these\nguarantees by obtaining a security interest in the cash or high-quality securities collateral that the\nclients place with the clearing house; therefore, the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm\u2019s\nmaximum possible exposure, without taking into consideration the associated collateral, is included in the\nExchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line on page 277. Refer to Note 11 for additional\ninformation on credit risk mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of collateral pledged\nunder repurchase agreements. Guarantees of subsidiaries In the normal course of business, the Parent Company\nmay provide counterparties with guarantees of certain of the trading and other obligations of its\nsubsidiaries on a contract-by-contract basis, as negotiated with the Firm\u2019s counterparties. The obligations\nof the subsidiaries are included on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated balance sheets or are reflected as off-balance\nsheet commitments; therefore, the Parent Company has not recognized a separate liability for these\nguarantees. The Firm believes that the occurrence of any event that would trigger payments by the Parent\nCompany under these guarantees is remote. The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and\nstructured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (\u201cJPMFC\u201d), a 100%-owned\nfinance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent\nCompany and no other subsidiary of the parent company guarantees these securities. These guarantees, which\nrank on a parity with the Firm\u2019s unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the table on\npage 277 of this Note.

The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class\naction lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement\nmatters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory\norganizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation,\nand involve each of the Firm\u2019s lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims\n(including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection\nclaims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range\nof reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $ 0to\napproximately $ 1.2billion at December 31, 2022. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible\nlosses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes\nthat an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe\nthat such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm\u2019s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably\npossible losses involves significant judgment, given: \u2022 the number, variety and varying stages of the\nproceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages, \u2022 the existence in many such\nproceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be\ndetermined, \u2022 the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding\nclass certification and the scope of many of the claims, and \u2022 the uncertainty of the various potential\noutcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the\ncourt or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory\nauthorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular\nproceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had\ndeemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm\u2019s estimate of the aggregate range\nof reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly. Set\nforth below are descriptions of the Firm\u2019s material legal proceedings. 1MDB Litigation . J.P. Morgan\n(Suisse) SA was named as a defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by 1Malaysia\nDevelopment Berhad (\u201c1MDB\u201d), a Malaysian state-owned and controlled investment fund. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA\nwas served in August 2022. The claim alleges \u201cdishonest assistance\u201d against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in\nrelation to payments of $ 300million and $ 500million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB\nand paid into an account at J.P. Morgan Suisse (SA) held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company\nbetween 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited. In September 2022, the Firm filed an application\nchallenging the validity of service and the Malaysian court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear the claim. Amrapali .\nIndia\u2019s Enforcement Directorate (\u201cED\u201d) is investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with\ninvestments made in 2010 and 2012 by twooffshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into\nresidential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (\u201cAmrapali\u201d). In 2017, numerous creditors filed\ncivil claims against Amrapali, including petitions brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering\nor failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers\u2019 petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court\nof India and are ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited\napproximately $ 31.5million. The Firm is appealing the order and the fine. Relatedly, in July 2019, the\nSupreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties,\nincluding unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects,\nviolated certain currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further\ninquiry under India\u2019s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (\u201cPMLA\u201d) and Foreign Exchange Management Act\n(\u201cFEMA\u201d). In May 2020, the ED attached approximately $ 25million from J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in\nconnection with the criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the PMLA\ninvestigation. Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. operated an escrow and\ndepository account for the Federal Government of Nigeria (\u201cFGN\u201d) and two major international oil companies.\nThe account held approximately $ 1.1billion in connection with a dispute among the clients over rights to an\noil field. Following the settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in the\naccount in 2011 and 2013 in accordance with directions received from its clients. In November 2017, the\nFederal Republic of Nigeria (\u201cFRN\u201d) commenced a claim in the English High Court for approximately $\n875million in payments made out of the accounts. The FRN alleged that the payments were\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    283  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \ninstructed as part of a complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but that JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. was or should have been on notice that the payments may be fraudulent. A trial was held between\nFebruary and April 2022. In June 2022, the Court decided the case in favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and\ndismissed it in full. In November 2022, the Court refused permission to the FRN to appeal the dismissal, and\nthe matter was concluded. Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported\nsettlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (\u201cFX\u201d) sales and trading\nactivities and controls related to those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded\nguilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The Department of Labor (\"DOL\") granted the Firm\nexemptions that permit the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset\nManager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d) through the ten-\nyeardisqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related governmental inquiry\nis a South Africa Competition Commission matter which is currently pending before the South Africa\nCompetition Tribunal. With respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of New York granted final approval to the Firm\u2019s settlement of a\nconsolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of federal\nantitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages\non behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures and options on futures. Although certain members of the\nsettlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, an agreement to resolve their\nclaims was reached in December 2022. A putative class action remains pending against the Firm and other\nforeign exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly\ninflated rates. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged\nunderlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil\nand Australia. An agreement to resolve one of the UK actions was reached in December 2022. In a putative\nclass action pending before the U.K. Competition Appeal Tribunal, proposed class representatives have\nappealed the tribunal's denial of a request for class certification on an opt-out basis. In Israel, a\nsettlement in principle has been reached in the putative class action, which remains subject to court\napproval. Interchange Litigation . Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class\naction complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of\ncredit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012,\nthe parties initially settled the cases for a cash payment, but that settlement was reversed on appeal and\nremanded to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The original class action\nwas divided into twoseparate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily\ninjunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties to the monetary class action finalized an agreement which\namends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants\ncollectively contributed an additional $ 900million to the approximately $ 5.3billion previously held in\nescrow from the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended settlement agreement was approved by the\nDistrict Court. Certain merchants appealed the District Court\u2019s approval order, and those appeals are\npending. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended class settlement, $ 700million\nhas been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with the settlement agreement.\nThe injunctive class action continues separately, and in September 2021, the District Court granted\nplaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion in part. Of the merchants who\nopted out of the amended damages class settlement, certain merchants filed individual actions raising\nsimilar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks. While some of\nthose actions remain pending, the defendants have reached settlements with the merchants who opted out\nrepresenting over half of the combined Mastercard-branded and Visa-branded payment card sales volume.\nJeffrey Epstein Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is named as a defendant in twolawsuits filed in the\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of New York which allege that JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. knowingly facilitated Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s sex trafficking and other unlawful conduct by providing banking\nservices to Epstein until 2013. One case, which was filed in November 2022, is a putative class action filed\nby an alleged sex-trafficking victim of Epstein, and the other case, which was filed in December 2022, was\nbrought on behalf of the government of the United States Virgin Islands and also alleges certain Virgin\nIslands statutory claims. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has moved to dismiss both complaints. LIBOR and Other\nBenchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various\ngovernmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association\u2019s\n(\u201cBBA\u201d) London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) for various currencies and the European Banking Federation\u2019s\nEuro Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cEURIBOR\u201d). The Swiss Competition Commission\u2019s investigation relating to\nEURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain subject, continues. In December 2016, the European\nCommission issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust\nrules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that\n                                              \n  284    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \ndecision with the European General Court, and that appeal is pending. In addition, the Firm has been named\nas a defendant along with other banks in various individual and putative class actions related to benchmark\nrates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was\nadministered by the BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other\nactions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The United States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate\nswaps sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. A consolidated putative class action related to\nthe period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was administered by ICE Benchmark Administration has been dismissed. In\naddition, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the\nFirm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to\nmonopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards. In September 2022, the Court\ndismissed plaintiffs' complaint in its entirety, and plaintiffs filed an amended complaint asserting similar\nantitrust claims, which defendants have moved to dismiss. The Firm\u2019s settlements of putative class actions\nrelated to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank\nBill Swap Reference Rate received final court approval in November 2022, while the settlement related to\nSwiss franc LIBOR remains subject to court approval. Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation . JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities\nLending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the United States District Court\nfor the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law and New\nYork State common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous\nexchange trading for securities lending transactions. Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint was\ndenied. Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action, which defendants are opposing. Shareholder\nLitigation . Several shareholder putative class actions, as well as shareholder derivative actions\npurporting to act on behalf of the Firm, have been filed against the Firm, its Board of Directors and\ncertain of its current and former officers. Certain of these shareholder suits relate to historical trading\npractices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct which\nwere the subject of the Firm\u2019s resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary\nactivities that were separately the subject of a resolution between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in\nNovember 2020. One of these shareholder derivative suits was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New\nYork in May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims relating to the historical\ntrading practices and related conduct and fiduciary activities which were the subject of the resolutions\ndescribed above. In December 2022, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss this action in full. A\nsecond shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District\nof New York in December 2022 relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct, which asserts\nbreach of fiduciary duty and contribution claims and alleges that the shareholder is excused from making a\ndemand to commence litigation because such a demand would have been futile. In addition, a consolidated\nputative class action is pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York on\nbehalf of shareholders who acquired shares of JPMorgan Chase common stock during the putative class period,\nalleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially false or misleading because they did not\ndisclose certain information relating to the historical trading practices and conduct. Defendants have moved\nto dismiss the amended complaint in this action. A separate shareholder derivative suit was filed in March\n2022 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting breaches of\nfiduciary duty and violations of federal securities laws based on the alleged failure of the Board of\nDirectors to exercise adequate oversight over the Firm\u2019s compliance with records preservation requirements\nwhich were the subject of resolutions between certain of the Firm\u2019s subsidiaries and the SEC and the CFTC.\nDefendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the amended complaint is pending. * * * In addition to the various legal\nproceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise\ninvolved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses\nto the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend\nitself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. The Firm\nhas established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance\nwith the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when\nit is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably\nestimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation\nreserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on management\u2019s\nbest judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm\u2019s legal expense was $ 266million, $ 426million and $\n1.1billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There is no assurance that\nthe Firm\u2019s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K    285  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nIn view of the inherent difficulty of predicting\nthe outcome of legal proceedings, particularly\nwhere the claimants seek very large or\nindeterminate damages, or where the matters present\nnovel legal theories, involve a large number of\nparties or are in early stages of discovery, the\nFirm cannot state with confidence what will be the\neventual outcomes of the currently pending matters,\nthe timing of their ultimate resolution or the\neventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences\nrelated to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes,\nbased upon its current knowledge and after\nconsultation with counsel, consideration of the\nmaterial legal proceedings described above and\nafter taking into account its current litigation\nreserves and its estimated aggregate range of\npossible losses, that the other legal proceedings\ncurrently pending against it should not have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Firm\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial condition. The Firm notes, however, that\nin light of the uncertainties involved in such\nproceedings, there is no assurance that the\nultimate resolution of these matters will not\nsignificantly exceed the reserves it has currently\naccrued or that a matter will not have material\nreputational consequences. As a result, the outcome\nof a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s operating results for a particular period,\ndepending on, among other factors, the size of the\nloss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s income for that period.\n                                              \n  286    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Note 31 \u2013 International operations                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \nThe following table presents income statement and balance sheet-related information for JPMorgan Chase by\nmajor international geographic area. The Firm defines international activities for purposes of this footnote\npresentation as business transactions that involve clients residing outside of the U.S., and the information\npresented below is based predominantly on the domicile of the client, the location from which the client\nrelationship is managed, booking location or the location of the trading desk. However, many of the Firm\u2019s\nU.S. operations serve international businesses. As the Firm\u2019s operations are highly integrated, estimates\nand subjective assumptions have been made to apportion revenue and expense between U.S. and international\noperations. These estimates and assumptions are consistent with the allocations used for the Firm\u2019s segment\nreporting as set forth in Note 32.

The Firm\u2019s definition of managed basis starts with the reported\nU.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each\nof the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax\ncredits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable\ninvestments and securities. This allows management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year\narising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt\nitems is recorded within income tax expense/(benefit). These adjustments have no impact on net income as\nreported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs. Capital allocation Each business segment is allocated\ncapital by taking into consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers\nand applicable regulatory capital requirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for expected returns\nare established as key measures of a business segment\u2019s performance. The Firm\u2019s allocation methodology\nincorporates Basel III Standardized RWA, Basel III Advanced RWA, the GSIB surcharge, and a simulation of\ncapital in a severe stress environment. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used\nto allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change.\nSegment results and

   \nThe table below presents an attribution of net interest income between volume and rate. The attribution\nbetween volume and rate is calculated using annual average balances for each category of assets and\nliabilities shown in the table and the corresponding annual rates (refer to pages 292-296 for more\ninformation on average balances and rates). In this analysis, when the change cannot be isolated to either\nvolume or rate, it has been allocated to volume. The annual rates include the impact of changes in market\nrates, as well as the impact of any change in composition of the various products within each category of\nasset or liability. This analysis is calculated separately for each category without consideration of the\nrelationship between categories (for example, the net spread between the rates earned on assets and the\nrates paid on liabilities that fund those assets). As a result, changes in the granularity or groupings\nconsidered in this analysis would produce a different attribution result, and due to the complexities\ninvolved, precise allocation of changes in interest rates between volume and rates is inherently complex and\njudgmental.\n                                                                                                            \n

The\nminimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on\nthe interest rate charged during the introductory\nperiod. This introductory rate is usually\nsignificantly below the fully indexed rate. The\nfully indexed rate is calculated using an index\nrate plus a margin. Once the introductory period\nends, the contractual interest rate charged on the\nloan increases to the fully indexed rate and\nadjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index.\nThe minimum payment is typically insufficient to\ncover interest accrued in the prior month, and any\nunpaid interest is deferred and added to the\nprincipal balance of the loan.
