The\nFirm maintains its focus on its culture\nof inclusion and respect, which is\nreinforced by increasing employee\nawareness and education through\nengagement, communication and training.\nAn important part of these efforts\nincludes the Firm\u2019s Business Resource\nGroups, which are groups of employees\nwho support JPMorgan Chase\u2019s diversity\nand inclusion strategies by leveraging\nthe unique perspectives of their\nmembers.\n\nAttracting and retaining employees\n\nThe goal of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nrecruitment efforts is to attract and\nhire talented individuals in all roles\nand at all career levels. The Firm\nstrives to provide both external\ncandidates and internal employees who\nare seeking a different role with\nchallenging and stimulating career\nopportunities. These opportunities\nrange from internship training programs\nfor students to entry-level, management\nand executive careers. During 2020,\napproximately two thirds of the Firm\u2019s\nemployment opportunities were filled by\nexternal candidates, with the remainder\nfilled by existing employees.\n\nDiversity is a critical area of focus\nthroughout the Firm\u2019s hiring process.\nJPMorgan Chase engages in efforts aimed\nat hiring diverse talent, including\ninitiatives focused on gender,\nunderrepresented ethnic groups, LGBT+\nindividuals, people with disabilities,\nveterans and others.

The\nFirm offers comprehensive training\nprograms to employees, with over seven\nmillion hours of training delivered\nglobally in 2020.

JPMorgan\nChase & Co. is a bank holding company\n(\u201cBHC\u201d) and a financial holding company\n(\u201cFHC\u201d) under U.S. federal law, and is\nsubject to comprehensive consolidated\nsupervision, regulation and examination\nby the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System (the \u201cFederal\nReserve\u201d). The Federal Reserve acts as\nthe supervisor of the consolidated\noperations of BHCs, and certain of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s subsidiaries are also\nregulated directly by additional\nauthorities based on the activities or\nlicenses of those subsidiaries.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s national bank\nsubsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,\nis supervised and regulated by the\nOffice of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency (\u201cOCC\u201d) and, with respect to\ncertain matters, by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (the \u201cFDIC\u201d).\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s U.S. broker-dealers\nare supervised and regulated by the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission\n(\u201cSEC\u201d) and the Financial Industry\nRegulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d), and\nsubsidiaries of the Firm that engage in\ncertain futures-related and swaps-\nrelated activities are supervised and\nregulated by the Commodity Futures\nTrading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d). J.P.\nMorgan Securities plc is a U.K.-based\nbank regulated by the U.K. Prudential\nRegulation Authority (the \u201cPRA\u201d) and\nthe U.K. Financial Conduct Authority\n(\u201cFCA\u201d).\n\nThe Firm\u2019s other non-U.S. subsidiaries\nare regulated by the banking,\nsecurities, prudential and conduct\nregulatory authorities in the countries\nin which they operate.\n\nPermissible business activities . The\nBank Holding Company Act restricts BHCs\nfrom engaging in business activities\nother than the business of banking and\ncertain closely-related activities.\nFHCs can engage in a broader range of\nfinancial activities. The Federal\nReserve has the authority to limit an\nFHC\u2019s ability to conduct otherwise\npermissible activities if the FHC or\nany of its depository institution\nsubsidiaries ceases to meet applicable\neligibility requirements. The\n\nFederal Reserve may also impose\ncorrective capital and/or managerial\nrequirements on the FHC, and if\ndeficiencies are persistent, may\nrequire divestiture of the FHC\u2019s\ndepository institutions. If any\ndepository institution controlled by an\nFHC fails to maintain a satisfactory\nrating under the Community Reinvestment\nAct, the Federal Reserve must prohibit\nthe FHC and its subsidiaries from\nengaging in any activities other than\nthose permissible for BHCs.\n\nCapital and liquidity requirements .\nThe Federal Reserve establishes\ncapital, liquidity and leverage\nrequirements for JPMorgan Chase that\nare generally consistent with the\ninternational Basel III capital and\nliquidity framework and evaluates the\nFirm\u2019s compliance with those\nrequirements. The OCC establishes\nsimilar requirements for JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A.\n\nBanking supervisors globally continue\nto refine and enhance the Basel III\ncapital framework for financial\ninstitutions. In January 2019, the\nBasel Committee issued \u201cMinimum capital\nrequirements for market risk.\u201d The\nBasel Committee expects national\nregulators to implement these revised\nmarket risk requirements for banking\norganizations in their jurisdictions by\nJanuary 2023, in line with the other\nelements of the Basel III Reforms. U.S.\nbanking regulators have announced their\nsupport for the issuance of the Basel\nIII Reforms and are considering how to\nappropriately apply such reforms in the\nU.S. In November 2019, the U.S. banking\nregulators adopted a rule implementing\n\u201cStandardized Approach for Counterparty\nCredit Risk\u201d (\u201cSA-CCR\u201d), which became\neffective in April 2020 and which has a\nmandatory compliance date of January 1,\n2022.\n\nOn October 20, 2020, the federal\nbanking agencies issued a final rule\nfor the net stable funding ratio\n(\u201cNSFR\u201d) under which large banking\norganizations such as the Firm will be\nrequired to maintain an NSFR of at\nleast 100% on an ongoing basis. The\nfinal NSFR rule will become effective\non July 1, 2021.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on\npages 91-101 and Liquidity Risk\nManagement on pages 102\u2013108 .\n\nStress tests . As a large BHC, JPMorgan\nChase is subject to supervisory stress\ntesting administered by the Federal\nReserve as part of the Federal\nReserve\u2019s annual Comprehensive Capital\nAnalysis and Review (\u201cCCAR\u201d) framework.\nThe Firm must conduct annual company-\nrun stress tests and must also submit\nan annual capital plan to the Federal\nReserve, taking into account the\nresults of separate stress tests\ndesigned by the Firm and the Federal\nReserve. The Federal Reserve uses the\nresults under the severely adverse\nscenario from its supervisory stress\ntest to determine the Firm\u2019s \u201cstress\ncapital buffer\u201d (\u201cSCB\u201d) requirement for\nthe coming year, which forms part of\nthe Firm\u2019s applicable capital buffers.\nThe Firm is required to file its annual\nCCAR submission on April 5, 2021.

The Firm publishes each year\nthe results of the annual stress tests\nfor the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. under the supervisory \u201cseverely\nadverse\u201d scenarios provided by the\nFederal Reserve and the OCC.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on\npages 91-101 for more information\nconcerning the Firm\u2019s CCAR.\n\nEnhanced prudential standards . As part\nof its mandate to identify and monitor\nrisks to the financial stability of the\nU.S. posed by large banking\norganizations, the Financial Stability\nOversight Council (\u201cFSOC\u201d) recommends\nprudential standards and reporting\nrequirements to the Federal Reserve for\nsystemically important financial\ninstitutions (\u201cSIFIs\u201d), such as\nJPMorgan Chase. The Federal Reserve has\nadopted several rules to implement\nthose heightened prudential standards,\nincluding rules relating to risk\nmanagement and corporate governance of\nsubject BHCs. JPMorgan Chase is\nrequired under these rules to comply\nwith enhanced liquidity and overall\nrisk management standards, including\noversight by the board of directors of\nrisk management activities.\n\nResolution and recovery . The Firm is\nrequired to submit periodically to the\nFederal Reserve and the FDIC a plan for\nresolution under Title I of the Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) in\nthe event of material distress or\nfailure (a \u201cresolution plan\u201d). In 2019,\nthe FDIC and Federal Reserve revised\nthe regulations governing resolution\nplan requirements, and on the basis of\nthose revisions, the Firm\u2019s resolution\nplan submissions will alternate between\n\u201ctargeted\u201d and \u201cfull\u201d plans. The Firm\u2019s\nnext \u201ctargeted\u201d resolution plan is due\nto be filed on or before July 1, 2021.\nThe Firm also has a comprehensive\nrecovery plan, updated annually,\nsummarizing the actions it would take\nto avoid failure by remaining well-\ncapitalized and well-funded in the case\nof an adverse event.\n\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is also\nrequired to provide a resolution plan\nto the FDIC. The FDIC has proposed\nchanges\n\nto its rules relating to the resolution\nplans of insured depository\ninstitutions (\u201cIDIs\u201d) in a 2019\nadvanced notice of proposed rulemaking.\nIn January 2021, the FDIC announced\nthat the moratorium on the preparation\nof resolution plans for the IDIs has\nended. Banks will be given notice of at\nleast 12 months prior to the required\nsubmission date for their IDI\nresolution plans. The OCC has published\nguidelines establishing standards for\nrecovery planning by insured national\nbanks, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nhas submitted its recovery plan to the\nOCC.\n\nCertain of the Firm\u2019s non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries are also subject to local\nresolution and recovery planning\nrequirements.\n\nOrderly liquidation authority . Certain\nfinancial companies, including JPMorgan\nChase and certain of its subsidiaries,\ncan also be subjected to resolution\nunder an \u201corderly liquidation\nauthority.\u201d The U.S. Treasury\nSecretary, in consultation with the\nPresident of the United States, must\nfirst make certain determinations\nconcerning extraordinary\n\nfinancial distress and systemic risk,\nand action must be recommended by the\nFDIC and the Federal Reserve. Absent\nsuch actions, the Firm, as a BHC, would\nremain subject to resolution under the\nBankruptcy Code. The FDIC has issued a\ndraft policy statement describing its\n\u201csingle point of entry\u201d strategy for\nresolution of SIFIs under the orderly\nliquidation authority, which seeks to\nkeep operating subsidiaries of a BHC\nopen and impose losses on shareholders\nand creditors of the BHC in\nreceivership according to their\nstatutory order of priority.\n\nHolding company as a source of\nstrength. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is\nrequired to serve as a source of\nfinancial strength for its depository\ninstitution subsidiaries and to commit\nresources to support those\nsubsidiaries, including when directed\nto do so by the Federal Reserve.\n\nRegulation of acquisitions .\nAcquisitions by BHCs and their banks\nare subject to multiple requirements\nestablished by the Federal Reserve and\nthe OCC. For example, FHCs and BHCs are\nrequired to obtain the approval of the\nFederal Reserve before they may acquire\nmore than 5% of the voting shares of an\nunaffiliated bank. In addition,\nacquisitions by financial companies are\nprohibited if, as a result of the\nacquisition, the total liabilities of\nthe financial company would exceed 10%\nof the total liabilities of all\nfinancial companies. Furthermore, for\ncertain acquisitions, the Firm must\nprovide written notice to the Federal\nReserve prior to acquiring direct or\nindirect ownership or control of any\nvoting shares of any company with over\n$10 billion in assets that is engaged\nin activities that are \u201cfinancial in\nnature.\u201d\n\nVolcker Rule . The Volcker Rule\nprohibits banking entities, including\nthe Firm, from engaging in certain\n\u201cproprietary trading\u201d activities,\nsubject to exceptions for underwriting,\nmarket-making, risk-mitigating hedging\nand certain other activities. The\nVolcker Rule also limits the\nsponsorship of, and investment in,\n\u201ccovered funds,\u201d and imposes limits on\ncertain transactions between the Firm\nand covered funds for which a JPMorgan\nChase entity serves as the investment\nmanager, investment advisor, commodity\ntrading advisor or sponsor, as well as\ncertain covered funds controlled by\nsuch funds.\n\nOngoing obligations . The Firm remains\nsubject to a consent order entered into\nwith the Federal Reserve concerning\nforeign exchange trading. The Firm is\nalso subject to obligations under the\nterms of a Deferred Prosecution\nAgreement entered into with the\nDepartment of Justice on September 29,\n2020 relating to precious metals and\nU.S. Treasuries markets investigations\nas well as under a related order issued\nby the CFTC.\n\nSubsidiary banks:\n\nThe activities of JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A., the Firm\u2019s principal subsidiary\nbank, are limited to those specifically\nauthorized under the National Bank Act\nand related interpretations of the OCC.\nThe OCC has authority to bring an\nenforcement action against JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. for unsafe or unsound\nbanking practices, which could\n     \n  4  \n     \ninclude limiting JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A.\u2019s ability to conduct otherwise\npermissible activities, or imposing\ncorrective capital or managerial\nrequirements on the bank.\n\nFDIC deposit insurance. The FDIC\ndeposit insurance fund provides\ninsurance coverage for certain deposits\nand is funded through assessments on\nbanks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A.\n\nFDIC powers upon a bank insolvency.\nUpon the insolvency of JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A., the FDIC could be appointed\nas conservator or receiver under the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Act. The FDIC\nhas broad powers to transfer assets and\nliabilities without the approval of the\ninstitution\u2019s creditors.\n\nPrompt corrective action. The Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation\nImprovement Act of 1991 requires the\nrelevant federal banking regulator to\ntake \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d with\nrespect to a depository institution if\nthat institution does not meet certain\ncapital adequacy standards. The Federal\nReserve is also authorized to take\nappropriate action against the parent\nBHC, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co.,\nbased on the undercapitalized status of\nany bank subsidiary. In certain\ninstances, the BHC would be required to\nguarantee the performance of the\ncapital restoration plan for its\nundercapitalized subsidiary.\n\nOCC Heightened Standards. The OCC has\nestablished guidelines setting forth\nheightened standards for large banks,\nincluding minimum standards for the\ndesign and implementation of a risk\ngovernance framework for banks. Under\nthese standards, a bank\u2019s risk\ngovernance framework must ensure that\nthe bank\u2019s risk profile is easily\ndistinguished and separate from that of\nits parent BHC for risk management\npurposes. The bank\u2019s board or risk\ncommittee is responsible for approving\nthe bank\u2019s risk governance framework,\nproviding active oversight of the\nbank\u2019s risk-taking activities, and\nholding management accountable for\nadhering to the risk governance\nframework.\n\nRestrictions on transactions with\naffiliates. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nand its subsidiaries are subject to\nrestrictions imposed by federal law on\nextensions of credit to, investments in\nstock or securities of, and\nderivatives, securities lending and\ncertain other transactions with,\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain other\naffiliates. These restrictions prevent\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. and other\naffiliates from borrowing from such\nsubsidiaries unless the loans are\nsecured in specified amounts and comply\nwith certain other requirements.\n\nDividend restrictions. Federal law\nimposes limitations on the payment of\ndividends by national banks, such as\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Refer to Note\n26 for the amount of dividends that\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. could pay, at\nJanuary 1, 2021, to JPMorgan Chase\nwithout the approval of the banking\nregulators. The OCC and the Federal\nReserve also have authority to prohibit\nor limit the payment of dividends of a\nbank subsidiary that they supervise if,\nin the banking regulator\u2019s opinion,\npayment of a dividend would\n\nconstitute an unsafe or unsound\npractice in light of the financial\ncondition of the bank.\n\nDepositor preference. Under federal\nlaw, the claims of a receiver of an IDI\nfor administrative expense and the\nclaims of holders of U.S. deposit\nliabilities (including the FDIC and\ndeposits in non-U.S. branches that are\ndually payable in the U.S. and in a\nnon-U.S. branch) have priority over the\nclaims of other unsecured creditors of\nthe institution, including depositors\nin non-U.S. branches and public\nnoteholders.\n\nConsumer supervision and regulation.\nJPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. are subject to supervision and\nregulation by the Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) with respect\nto federal consumer protection laws,\nincluding laws relating to fair lending\nand the prohibition of unfair,\ndeceptive or abusive acts or practices\nin connection with the offer, sale or\nprovision of consumer financial\nproducts and services. The CFPB also\nhas jurisdiction over small business\nlending activities with respect to fair\nlending and the Equal Credit\nOpportunity Act. As part of its\nregulatory oversight, the CFPB has\nauthority to take enforcement actions\nagainst firms that offer certain\nproducts and services to consumers\nusing practices that are deemed to be\nunfair, deceptive or abusive. The\nFirm\u2019s consumer activities are also\nsubject to regulation under state\nstatutes which are enforced by the\nAttorney General or empowered agency of\neach state.\n\nSecurities and broker-dealer\nregulation:\n\nThe Firm conducts securities\nunderwriting, dealing and brokerage\nactivities in the U.S. through J.P.\nMorgan Securities LLC and other non-\nbank broker-dealer subsidiaries, all of\nwhich are subject to regulations of the\nSEC, FINRA and the New York Stock\nExchange, among others. The Firm\nconducts similar securities activities\noutside the U.S. subject to local\nregulatory requirements. In the U.K.,\nthose activities are conducted by J.P.\nMorgan Securities plc. Broker-dealers\nare subject to laws and regulations\ncovering all aspects of the securities\nbusiness, including sales and trading\npractices, securities offerings,\npublication of research reports, use of\ncustomer funds, the financing of client\npurchases, capital structure, record-\nkeeping and retention, and the conduct\nof their directors, officers and\nemployees. Refer to Broker-dealer\nregulatory capital on page 101 for\ninformation concerning the capital of\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P.\nMorgan Securities plc.\n\nInvestment management regulation:\n\nThe Firm\u2019s asset and wealth management\nbusinesses are subject to significant\nregulation in jurisdictions around the\nworld relating to, among other things,\nthe safeguarding and management of\nclient assets, offerings of funds and\nmarketing activities. Certain of the\nFirm\u2019s subsidiaries are registered\nwith, and subject to oversight by, the\nSEC as investment advisers and broker-\ndealers. The Firm\u2019s registered\ninvestment advisers are subject to the\nfiduciary and other obligations imposed\nunder the Investment Advisers Act of\n1940, as well as various state\nsecurities laws. The Firm\u2019s bank\nfiduciary activities are subject to\nsupervision by the OCC.\n     \n  5  \n     \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                        \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\nDerivatives regulation:\n\nThe Firm is subject to comprehensive\nregulation of its derivatives\nbusinesses, including regulations that\nimpose capital and margin requirements,\nrequire central clearing of\nstandardized over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d)\nderivatives, mandate that certain\nstandardized OTC swaps be traded on\nregulated trading venues, and provide\nfor reporting of certain mandated\ninformation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P.\nMorgan Securities plc are registered\nwith the CFTC as \u201cswap dealers\u201d and may\nbe required to register with the SEC as\n\u201csecurity-based swap dealers.\u201d As a\nresult, these entities are or will be\nsubject to a comprehensive regulatory\nframework applicable to their swap or\nsecurity-based swap activities,\nincluding capital requirements, rules\nrequiring the collateralization of\nuncleared swaps and security-based\nswaps, rules regarding segregation of\ncounterparty collateral, business\nconduct and documentation standards,\nrecord-keeping and reporting\nobligations, and anti-fraud and anti-\nmanipulation requirements. Similar\nrequirements have also been implemented\nin the EU under the European Market\nInfrastructure Regulation (\u201cEMIR\u201d) and\nMiFID II.\n\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC is also\nregistered with the CFTC as a futures\ncommission merchant and is a member of\nthe National Futures Association.\n\nData, privacy and security regulation:\n\nThe Firm and its subsidiaries are\nsubject to numerous U.S. federal, state\nand local as well as international laws\nand regulations concerning data that\nare central to the Firm\u2019s businesses,\nfunctions and operations. These include\nlaws and regulations relating to data\nprotection, privacy, data use,\nconfidentiality, secrecy,\ncybersecurity, technology, artificial\nintelligence, data localization and\nstorage, data retention and\ndestruction, disclosure, transfer,\navailability, integrity and other\nsimilar matters. The application,\ninterpretation and enforcement of these\nlaws and regulations are often\nuncertain, particularly in light of new\nand rapidly evolving data-driven\ntechnologies and significant increase\nin computing power. These laws and\nregulations are evolving at a rapid\npace, remain a focus of regulators\nglobally, may be enforced by private\nparties or government bodies, and will\ncontinue to have a significant impact\non all of the Firm\u2019s businesses and\noperations. For example, the EU\u2019s\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation\n(\u201cGDPR\u201d) includes a complex range of\nobligations and operational\nrequirements for companies that receive\nor process personal data of persons in\nthe EU and provides for significant\npenalties for non-compliance. In\naddition, there are a number of\nlegislative proposals in the EU, the\nU.S. (at both the federal and state\nlevel) as well as other jurisdictions\nthat could impose new obligations or\nlimitations in these areas that could\naffect the Firm\u2019s businesses.\n\nThe Bank Secrecy Act and Economic\nSanctions:\n\nThe Bank Secrecy Act (\u201cBSA\u201d) requires\nall financial institutions, including\nbanks and securities broker-dealers, to\nestablish a risk-based system of\ninternal controls reasonably designed\nto prevent money laundering and the\nfinancing of\n\nterrorism. The BSA includes a variety\nof record-keeping and reporting\nrequirements, as well as due\ndiligence/know-your-customer\ndocumentation requirements. The Firm is\nalso subject to the regulations and\neconomic sanctions programs\nadministered by the U.S. Treasury\u2019s\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control\n(\u201cOFAC\u201d). In addition, the EU and the\nU.K. have adopted various economic\nsanctions programs targeted at entities\nor individuals that are, or are located\nin countries that are, involved in\nterrorism, hostilities, embezzlement or\nhuman rights violations.\n\nAnti-Corruption:\n\nThe Firm is subject to laws and\nregulations relating to corrupt and\nillegal payments to government\nofficials and others in the\njurisdictions in which it operates,\nincluding the U.S. Foreign Corrupt\nPractices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act.\n\nCompensation practices:\n\nThe Firm\u2019s compensation practices are\nsubject to oversight by the Federal\nReserve, as well as other agencies. The\nFederal Reserve has issued guidance\njointly with the FDIC and the OCC that\nis designed to ensure that incentive\ncompensation paid by banking\norganizations does not encourage\nimprudent risk-taking that threatens\nthe organizations\u2019 safety and\nsoundness. The Financial Stability\nBoard (\u201cFSB\u201d) has also established\nstandards covering compensation\nprinciples for banks. The Firm\u2019s\ncompensation practices are also subject\nto regulation and oversight by\nregulators in other jurisdictions,\nnotably the EU Fourth Capital\nRequirements Directive (\u201cCRD IV\u201d),\nwhich includes compensation-related\nprovisions. The European Banking\nAuthority has instituted guidelines on\ncompensation policies which in certain\ncountries, such as the U.K. and\nGermany, are implemented or\nsupplemented by local regulations or\nguidelines. The Firm expects that the\nimplementation of regulatory guidelines\nregarding compensation in the U.S. and\nother countries will continue to\nevolve, and may affect the manner in\nwhich the Firm structures its\ncompensation programs and practices.\n\nOther significant international\nregulatory initiatives:\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s transition period for its\ndeparture from the EU, which is\ncommonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d\nformally ended on December 31, 2020,\nand accordingly, from January 1, 2021,\nthe U.K. is no longer obligated to\nimplement EU laws.\n\nIn preparation for the completion of\nBrexit, numerous EU laws and\nregulations were separately adopted\ninto U.K. domestic legislation in order\nto ensure continuity. However, the U.K.\nplans to evaluate the extent to which\nthese EU-legacy laws and regulations\nshould change going forward and has\nalready indicated some areas where it\nmay take a different approach from the\nEU. For example, the U.K. announced it\nwill develop a U.K. settlement\ndiscipline regime rather than adopting\nthe EU\u2019s settlement discipline regime\nwhich will apply in the EU beginning in\nFebruary 2022. Additionally, the U.K.\nwill not incorporate into U.K. law the\nreporting obligation of the EU\u2019s\nSecurities Financing Transactions\nRegulation for non-financial\ncounterparties, which will apply in the\nEU beginning in January 2021. The\n     \n  6  \n     \nfull impact of these differences is not\nyet known as further details have not\nyet been published.\n\nIn the EU, policymakers continue to\nimplement an extensive and complex\nprogram of regulatory enhancement\nrelating to financial services, several\nkey elements of which are discussed\nbelow .\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic,\nin July 2020, the European Commission\n(\u201cEC\u201d) published a legislative proposal\namending the Markets in Financial\nInstruments Directive (\u201cMiFID II\u201d) .\nMiFID II requires the trading of shares\nand certain OTC derivatives to take\nplace on trading venues, and also\nsignificantly enhanced requirements for\npre- and post-trade transparency,\ntransaction reporting and investor\nprotection, and introduced a position\nlimits and reporting regime for\ncommodities.

There can be\nno assurance that, even after\nadjustments have been made to model\noutputs, JPMorgan Chase will not\nrecognize unexpected losses arising\nfrom the model uncertainty that has\nresulted from these developments.\n\nA prolongation or worsening of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and the negative\neconomic impacts of the pandemic could\nhave other significant adverse effects\non JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses, results\nof operations and financial condition,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 recognition of credit losses and\nfurther increases in the allowance for\ncredit losses, especially to the extent\nthat businesses remain closed,\nunemployment continues at elevated\nlevels, clients and customers draw on\ntheir lines of credit or significant\nnumbers of people relocate from\nmetropolitan areas\n\n\u2022 material impacts on the value of\nsecurities, derivatives and other\nfinancial instruments which JPMorgan\nChase owns or in which it makes markets\n\n\u2022 downgrades in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit\nratings\n\n\u2022 constraints on liquidity or capital\ndue to elevated levels of deposits,\nincreases in risk-weighted assets\n(\u201cRWA\u201d) related to supporting client\nactivities, downgrades in client credit\nratings, regulatory actions or other\nfactors, any or all of which could\nrequire JPMorgan Chase to take or\nrefrain from taking actions that it\notherwise would under its liquidity and\ncapital management strategies, and\n\n\u2022 the possibility that significant\nportions of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s workforce\nare unable to work effectively,\nincluding because of illness,\nquarantines, shelter-in-place\narrangements, government actions or\nother restrictions in connection with\nthe pandemic.\n\nThe extent to which the COVID-19\npandemic negatively affects JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s businesses, results of\noperations and financial condition, as\nwell as its regulatory capital and\nliquidity ratios, will depend on future\ndevelopments that are highly uncertain\nand cannot be predicted, including the\nultimate scope and duration of the\npandemic, the effectiveness of\nvaccination programs and actions taken\nby governmental authorities and other\nthird parties in response to the\npandemic.

To the extent that the\nCOVID-19 pandemic adversely affects\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business, results of\noperations and financial condition, it\nmay also have the effect of heightening\nmany of the other risks described\nbelow.\n                                                                                  \n  Regulatory                                                                      \n                                                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses are highly\nregulated, and existing, new or changed\nlaws, rules and regulations that apply\nto JPMorgan Chase have a significant\nimpact on its business and operations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase is a financial services\nfirm with operations worldwide.\nJPMorgan Chase must comply with the\nlaws, rules and regulations that apply\nto its operations in all of the\njurisdictions around the world in which\nit does business. Regulation of the\nfinancial services industry is\nextensive.\n\nThe regulation and supervision of\nfinancial services firms has expanded\nsignificantly over an extended period\nof time. The increased regulation and\nsupervision of JPMorgan Chase has\naffected the way that it conducts its\nbusiness and structures its operations.\nJPMorgan Chase could be required to\nmake further changes to its business\nand operations in response to expanded\nsupervision, new laws, rules and\nregulations, and changes to existing\nlaws, rules and regulations. These\nchanges could result in JPMorgan Chase\nincurring additional costs for\ncomplying with laws, rules and\nregulations and could reduce its\nprofitability. In response to new and\nexisting laws, rules and regulations\nand expanded supervision, JPMorgan\nChase has in the past been and could in\nthe future be, required to:\n\n\u2022 limit the products and services that\nit offers\n\n\u2022 reduce the liquidity that it can\nprovide through its market-making\nactivities\n\n\u2022 refrain from engaging in business\nopportunities that it might otherwise\npursue\n\n\u2022 pay higher taxes, assessments, levies\nor other governmental charges,\nincluding in connection with the\nresolution of tax examinations\n\n\u2022 dispose of certain assets, and do so\nat times or prices that are\ndisadvantageous\n\n\u2022 impose restrictions on certain\nbusiness activities, or\n\n\u2022 increase the prices that it charges\nfor products and services, which could\nreduce the demand for them.\n\nIn particular, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbusinesses and results of operations\ncould be adversely impacted by changes\nin laws, rules and regulations, or\nchanges in the application,\ninterpretation or enforcement of laws,\nrules and regulations, that:\n\n\u2022 proscribe or institute more stringent\nrestrictions on certain financial\nservices activities, or\n\n\u2022 introduce changes to antitrust or\nanti-competition laws, rules and\nregulations that adversely affect the\nbusiness activities of JPMorgan Chase.\n\nDifferences in financial services\nregulation can be disadvantageous for\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business.\n\nThe content and application of laws,\nrules and regulations affecting\nfinancial services firms sometimes vary\naccording to factors such as the size\nof the firm, the jurisdiction in which\nit is organized or operates, and other\ncriteria. For example:\n\n\u2022 larger firms such as JPMorgan Chase\nare often subject to more stringent\nsupervision and regulation\n\n\u2022 financial technology companies and\nother non-traditional competitors may\nnot be subject to banking regulation,\nor may be supervised by a national or\nstate regulatory agency that does not\nhave the same resources or regulatory\npriorities as the regulatory agencies\nwhich supervise more diversified\nfinancial services firms, or\n\n\u2022 the financial services regulatory\nframework in a particular jurisdiction\nmay favor financial institutions that\nare based in that jurisdiction.\n\nThese differences in the regulatory\nframework can result in a firm such as\nJPMorgan Chase losing market share to\ncompetitors that are less regulated or\nnot subject to regulation, especially\nwith respect to unregulated financial\nproducts.\n\nThere can also be significant\ndifferences in the ways that similar\nregulatory initiatives affecting the\nfinancial services industry are\nimplemented in the U.S. and in other\ncountries and regions in which JPMorgan\nChase does business. For example, when\nadopting rules that are intended to\nimplement a global regulatory standard,\na national regulator may introduce\nadditional or more restrictive\nrequirements, which can create\ncompetitive disadvantages for financial\nservices firms, such as JPMorgan Chase,\nthat may be subject to those enhanced\nregulations.\n\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives\noutside the U.S. could require JPMorgan\nChase to make significant modifications\nto its operations and legal entity\nstructure in the relevant\n      \n  10  \n      \ncountries or regions in order to comply\nwith those requirements. These include\nlaws, rules and regulations that have\nbeen adopted or proposed relating to:\n\n\u2022 the establishment of locally-based\nintermediate holding companies or\noperating subsidiaries\n\n\u2022 requirements to maintain minimum\namounts of capital or liquidity in\nlocally-based subsidiaries\n\n\u2022 the separation (or \u201cring fencing\u201d) of\ncore banking products and services from\nmarkets activities\n\n\u2022 the resolution of financial\ninstitutions\n\n\u2022 requirements for executing or\nsettling transactions on exchanges or\nthrough central counterparties (\u201cCCPs\u201d)\n\n\u2022 position limits and reporting rules\nfor derivatives\n\n\u2022 governance and accountability regimes\n\n\u2022 conduct of business and control\nrequirements, and\n\n\u2022 restrictions on compensation.\n\nThese types of differences in financial\nservices regulation, or inconsistencies\nor conflicts between laws, rules and\nregulations between different\njurisdictions, have required and could\nin the future require JPMorgan Chase\nto:\n\n\u2022 divest assets or restructure its\noperations\n\n\u2022 absorb increased operational, capital\nand liquidity costs\n\n\u2022 change the prices that it charges for\nits products and services\n\n\u2022 curtail the products and services\nthat it offers to its customers and\nclients, or\n\n\u2022 incur higher costs for complying with\ndifferent legal and regulatory\nframeworks.\n\nAny or all of these factors could harm\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to compete\nagainst other firms that are not\nsubject to the same laws, rules and\nregulations or supervisory oversight,\nor harm JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses,\nresults of operations and\nprofitability.\n\nHeightened regulatory scrutiny of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses could\nresult in higher compliance costs and\nrestrictions on its operations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations are subject\nto heightened oversight and scrutiny\nfrom regulatory authorities in many\njurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase has paid\nsignificant fines, provided other\nmonetary relief, incurred other\npenalties and experienced other\nrepercussions in connection with\nresolving investigations and\nenforcement actions by governmental\nagencies. JPMorgan Chase could become\nsubject to similar regulatory\nresolutions or other actions in the\nfuture, and addressing the requirements\nof any such resolutions or actions\ncould result in JPMorgan Chase\nincurring higher operational and\ncompliance costs or needing to comply\nwith other restrictions.\n\nIn connection with resolving specific\nregulatory investigations or\nenforcement actions, certain regulators\nhave required JPMorgan Chase and other\nfinancial institutions to admit\nwrongdoing with respect to the\nactivities that gave rise to the\nresolution. These types of admissions\ncan lead to:\n\n\u2022 greater exposure in litigation\n\n\u2022 damage to reputation\n\n\u2022 disqualification from doing business\nwith certain clients or customers, or\nin specific jurisdictions, or\n\n\u2022 other direct and indirect adverse\neffects.\n\nFurthermore, U.S. government officials\nhave demonstrated a willingness to\nbring criminal actions against\nfinancial institutions and have\nrequired that institutions plead guilty\nto criminal offenses or admit other\nwrongdoing in connection with resolving\nregulatory investigations or\nenforcement actions. Resolutions of\nthis type can have significant\ncollateral consequences for the subject\nfinancial institution, including:\n\n\u2022 loss of clients, customers and\nbusiness\n\n\u2022 restrictions on offering certain\nproducts or services, and\n\n\u2022 losing permission to operate certain\nbusinesses, either temporarily or\npermanently.\n\nJPMorgan Chase expects that:\n\n\u2022 it and other financial services firms\nwill continue to be subject to\nheightened regulatory scrutiny and\ngovernmental investigations and\nenforcement actions\n\n\u2022 regulators will continue to require\nthat financial institutions be\npenalized for actual or deemed\nviolations of law with formal and\npunitive enforcement actions, including\nthe imposition of significant monetary\nand other sanctions, rather than\nresolving these matters through\ninformal supervisory actions; and\n\n\u2022 regulators will be more likely to\npursue formal enforcement actions and\nresolutions against JPMorgan Chase to\nthe extent that it has previously been\nsubject to other governmental\ninvestigations or enforcement actions.\n\nIf JPMorgan Chase fails to meet the\nrequirements of any resolution of a\ngovernmental investigation or\nenforcement action, or to maintain risk\nand control processes that meet the\nheightened standards established by its\nregulators, it could be required to:\n\n\u2022 enter into further resolutions of\ninvestigations or enforcement actions\n\n\u2022 pay additional regulatory fines,\npenalties or judgments, or\n\n\u2022 accept material regulatory\nrestrictions on, or changes in the\nmanagement of, its businesses.\n      \n  11  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                        \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\nIn these circumstances, JPMorgan Chase\ncould also become subject to other\nsanctions, or to prosecution or civil\nlitigation with respect to the conduct\nthat gave rise to an investigation or\nenforcement action.\n\nComplying with economic sanctions and\nanti-corruption and anti-money\nlaundering laws, rules and regulations\ncan increase JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\noperational and compliance costs and\nrisks.\n\nJPMorgan Chase must comply with\neconomic sanctions and embargo programs\nadministered by the Office of Foreign\nAssets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) and similar\nnational and multi-national bodies and\ngovernmental agencies outside the U.S.,\nas well as anti-corruption and anti-\nmoney laundering laws, rules and\nregulations throughout the world.\nJPMorgan Chase can incur higher costs\nand face greater compliance risks in\nstructuring and operating its\nbusinesses to comply with these\nrequirements. Certain governments have\nenacted laws, which are commonly\nreferred to as \u201cblocking laws,\u201d that\nare designed to prohibit compliance\nwith some U.S. sanctions and may raise\nsignificant conflict of laws issues. A\nviolation of a sanction or embargo\nprogram or anti-corruption or anti-\nmoney laundering laws, rules and\nregulations, or enforcement of blocking\nlaws, could subject JPMorgan Chase, and\nindividual employees, to regulatory\nenforcement actions as well as\nsignificant civil and criminal\npenalties.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations and\nfinancial results can be negatively\nimpacted in countries with less\npredictable legal and regulatory\nframeworks .\n\nJPMorgan Chase conducts business in\ncertain countries in which the\napplication of the rule of law is\ninconsistent or less predictable,\nincluding with respect to:\n\n\u2022 the absence of a statutory or\nregulatory basis or guidance for\nengaging in specific types of business\nor transactions\n\n\u2022 conflicting or ambiguous laws, rules\nand regulations, or the inconsistent\napplication or interpretation of\nexisting laws, rules and regulations\n\n\u2022 uncertainty concerning the\nenforceability of contractual,\nintellectual property or other\nobligations\n\n\u2022 difficulty in competing in economies\nin which the government controls or\nprotects all or a portion of the local\neconomy or specific businesses, or\nwhere graft or corruption may be\npervasive, and\n\n\u2022 the threat of arbitrary regulatory\ninvestigations, civil litigations or\ncriminal prosecutions, the termination\nof licenses required to operate in the\nlocal market or the suspension of\nbusiness relationships with\ngovernmental bodies.\n\nIf the application of the laws, rules\nand regulations in a particular country\nis susceptible to producing\ninconsistent or unexpected outcomes,\nthis can create a more difficult\nenvironment in which JPMorgan Chase\nconducts its business and could\nnegatively affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\noperations\n\nand reduce its earnings with respect to\nthat country. For example, conducting\nbusiness could require JPMorgan Chase\nto devote significant additional\nresources to understanding, and\nmonitoring changes in, local laws,\nrules and regulations, as well as\nstructuring its operations to comply\nwith local laws, rules and regulations\nand implementing and administering\nrelated internal policies and\nprocedures.\n\nThere can be no assurance that JPMorgan\nChase will always be successful in its\nefforts to fully understand and to\nconduct its business in compliance with\nthe laws, rules and regulations of all\nof the jurisdictions in which it\noperates, and the risk of non-\ncompliance can be greater in countries\nthat have less predictable legal and\nregulatory systems.\n\nRequirements for the orderly resolution\nof JPMorgan Chase could result in\nJPMorgan Chase having to restructure or\nreorganize its businesses and could\nincrease its funding or operational\ncosts or curtail its business.\n\nJPMorgan Chase is required under\nFederal Reserve and FDIC rules to\nprepare and submit periodically to\nthose agencies a detailed plan for\nrapid and orderly resolution in\nbankruptcy, without extraordinary\ngovernment support, in the event of\nmaterial financial distress or failure.\nThe agencies\u2019 evaluation of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s resolution plan may change, and\nthe requirements for resolution plans\nmay be modified from time to time. Any\nsuch determinations or modifications\ncould result in JPMorgan Chase needing\nto make changes to its legal entity\nstructure or to certain internal or\nexternal activities, which could\nincrease its funding or operational\ncosts, or hamper its ability to serve\nclients and customers.\n\nIf the Federal Reserve and the FDIC\nwere both to determine that a\nresolution plan submitted by JPMorgan\nChase has deficiencies, they could\njointly impose more stringent capital,\nleverage or liquidity requirements or\nrestrictions on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\ngrowth, activities or operations. The\nagencies could also require that\nJPMorgan Chase restructure, reorganize\nor divest assets or businesses in ways\nthat could materially and adversely\naffect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations and\nstrategy.\n\nHolders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s debt\nand equity securities will absorb\nlosses if it were to enter into a\nresolution.\n\nFederal Reserve rules require that\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (the \u201cParent\nCompany\u201d) maintain minimum levels of\nunsecured external long-term debt and\nother loss-absorbing capacity with\nspecific terms (\u201celigible LTD\u201d) for\npurposes of recapitalizing JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s operating subsidiaries if the\nParent Company were to enter into a\nresolution either:\n\n\u2022 in a bankruptcy proceeding under\nChapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,\nor\n\n\u2022 in a receivership administered by the\nFDIC under Title II of the Dodd-Frank\nAct (\u201cTitle II\u201d).\n      \n  12  \n      \nIf the Parent Company were to enter\ninto a resolution, holders of eligible\nLTD and other debt and equity\nsecurities of the Parent Company will\nabsorb the losses of the Parent Company\nand its subsidiaries.\n\nThe preferred \u201csingle point of entry\u201d\nstrategy under JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nresolution plan contemplates that only\nthe Parent Company would enter\nbankruptcy proceedings. JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s subsidiaries would be\nrecapitalized, as needed, so that they\ncould continue normal operations or\nsubsequently be divested or wound down\nin an orderly manner. As a result, the\nParent Company\u2019s losses and any losses\nincurred by its subsidiaries would be\nimposed first on holders of the Parent\nCompany\u2019s equity securities and\nthereafter on its unsecured creditors,\nincluding holders of eligible LTD and\nother debt securities. Claims of\nholders of those securities would have\na junior position to the claims of\ncreditors of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nsubsidiaries and to the claims of\npriority (as determined by statute) and\nsecured creditors of the Parent\nCompany.\n\nAccordingly, in a resolution of the\nParent Company in bankruptcy, holders\nof eligible LTD and other debt\nsecurities of the Parent Company would\nrealize value only to the extent\navailable to the Parent Company as a\nshareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. and its other subsidiaries, and\nonly after any claims of priority and\nsecured creditors of the Parent Company\nhave been fully repaid.\n\nThe FDIC has similarly indicated that a\nsingle point of entry recapitalization\nmodel could be a desirable strategy to\nresolve a systemically important\nfinancial institution, such as the\nParent Company, under Title II.\nHowever, the FDIC has not formally\nadopted a single point of entry\nresolution strategy.\n\nIf the Parent Company were to approach,\nor enter into, a resolution, none of\nthe Parent Company, the Federal Reserve\nor the FDIC is obligated to follow\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s preferred resolution\nstrategy, and losses to holders of\neligible LTD and other debt and equity\nsecurities of the Parent Company, under\nwhatever strategy is ultimately\nfollowed, could be greater than they\nmight have been under JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\npreferred strategy.\n\nRegulatory uncertainties associated\nwith the U.K.\u2019s departure from the EU\ncould negatively affect JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s business, results of operations\nand operating model.\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s departure from the EU, which\nis commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d\nwas completed on December 31, 2020. The\nTrade and Cooperation Agreement entered\ninto between the U.K. and the EU in\nDecember 2020 included very limited\nprovisions relating to the conduct of\nfinancial services activities between\nthe U.K. and the EU. Accordingly,\nunless or until the U.K. and the EU\nenter into further agreements relating\nto financial services, the regulatory\nenvironment for financial services in\nthe aftermath of Brexit can be expected\nto:\n\n\u2022 significantly limit the ability of\nU.K.-based financial services firms to\nconduct business in the EU, and vice\nversa\n\n\u2022 prolong uncertainty concerning the\nlevels of market access for trading\nvenues, which could result in a\nreduction or fragmentation of market\nliquidity, and\n\n\u2022 prolong ongoing uncertainties\nconcerning optimal business models for\nfirms providing financial services,\nespecially given that any changes in\nthe regulation of such services by the\nU.K. may not benefit from equivalence\ndeterminations by the EU.\n\nAs a result of these limitations and\nuncertainties, JPMorgan Chase:\n\n\u2022 has made and is continuing to make\nappropriate changes to its legal entity\nstructure and operations in the U.K.\nand the EU to address the regulatory\nenvironment\n\n\u2022 is now maintaining, and expects that\nit will be required to sustain, a more\nfragmented operating model across its\nU.K. and EU operating entities, and\n\n\u2022 expects that, due to considerations\nsuch as operating expenses, liquidity,\nleverage and capital, this modified\nEuropean operating framework will be\nmore complex, less efficient and more\ncostly than would otherwise have been\nthe case.\n\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and\nEU and U.K. government responses to the\npandemic, including travel restrictions\nand lock-downs, have introduced delays\nand uncertainties into JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nimplementation of its plans for\nmaintaining continuity of service for\nits clients.\n\nAny or all of the above factors could\nhave an adverse effect on the overall\noperation of the financial services\nmarket across the U.K. and the EU as\nwell as JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business,\noperations and earnings in the U.K.,\nthe EU and globally.\n                                                                                  \n  Political                                                                       \n                                                                                  \nEconomic uncertainty or instability\ncaused by political developments can\nhurt JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses.\n\nThe economic environment and market\nconditions in which JPMorgan Chase\noperates continue to be uncertain due\nto political developments in the U.S.\nand other countries. Certain monetary,\nfiscal and other policy initiatives and\nproposals could cause a contraction in\nU.S. and global economic growth and\nhigher volatility in the financial\nmarkets, including :\n\n\u2022 monetary policies and actions taken\nby the Federal Reserve and other\ncentral banks or governmental\nauthorities, including any sustained\nlarge-scale asset purchases or any\nsuspension

types of political developments,\nand uncertainty about the possible\noutcomes of these developments, could:\n\n\u2022 erode investor confidence in the U.S.\neconomy and financial markets,

losses\non its market-making positions or in\nits investment portfolio, reduce its\nliquidity and capital levels, hamper\nits ability to deliver products and\nservices to its clients and customers,\nand weaken its results of operations\nand financial condition.\n                                                                                  \n  Market

affect\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses and\ninvestment and market-making positions.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s results of operations\ncan be negatively affected by adverse\nchanges in any of the following:\n\n\u2022 investor, consumer and business\nsentiment\n\n\u2022 events that reduce confidence in the\nfinancial markets\n\n\u2022 inflation or deflation\n\n\u2022 high unemployment or, conversely, a\ntightening labor market\n\n\u2022 the availability and cost of capital,\nliquidity and credit\n\n\u2022 levels and volatility of interest\nrates, credit spreads and market prices\nfor currencies, equities and\ncommodities, and the duration of any\nchanges in levels or volatility\n\n\u2022 the economic effects of outbreaks of\nhostilities, terrorism or other\ngeopolitical instabilities, cyber\nattacks, climate change, natural\ndisasters, severe weather conditions,\nhealth emergencies, the spread of\ninfectious diseases or pandemics, and\n\n\u2022 the health of the U.S. and global\neconomies.\n\nAll of these are affected by global\neconomic, market and political events\nand conditions, as well as regulatory\nrestrictions.\n\nIn addition, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\ninvestment portfolio and market-making\nbusinesses can suffer losses due to\nunanticipated market events, including:\n\n\u2022 severe declines in asset values\n\n\u2022 unexpected credit events\n\n\u2022 unforeseen events or conditions that\nmay cause previously uncorrelated\nfactors to become correlated (and vice\nversa)\n\n\u2022 the inability to effectively hedge\nmarket and other risks related to\nmarket-making and investment portfolio\npositions, or\n\n\u2022 other market risks that may not have\nbeen appropriately taken into account\nin the development, structuring or\npricing of a financial instrument.\n      \n  14  \n      \nIf JPMorgan Chase experiences\nsignificant losses in its investment\nportfolio or from market-making\nactivities, this could reduce JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s profitability and its liquidity\nand capital levels, and thereby\nconstrain the growth of its businesses.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer businesses\ncan be negatively affected by adverse\neconomic conditions.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer businesses\nare particularly affected by U.S. and\nglobal economic conditions, including:\n\n\u2022 personal and household income\ndistribution\n\n\u2022 unemployment or underemployment\n\n\u2022 prolonged periods of exceptionally\nlow interest rates\n\n\u2022 housing prices\n\n\u2022 consumer and small business\nconfidence levels\n\n\u2022 changes in consumer spending or in\nthe level of consumer debt, and\n\n\u2022 the number of personal bankruptcies.\n\nHeightened levels of unemployment or\nunderemployment that result in reduced\npersonal and household income could\nnegatively affect consumer credit\nperformance to the extent that\nconsumers are less able to service\ntheir debts. In addition, sustained low\ngrowth, low or negative interest rates,\ninflationary pressures or recessionary\nconditions could diminish customer\ndemand for the products and services\noffered by JPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer\nbusinesses.\n\nAdverse economic conditions could also\nlead to an increase in delinquencies,\nadditions to the allowance for credit\nlosses and higher net charge-offs,\nwhich can reduce JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nearnings. These consequences could be\nsignificantly worse in certain\ngeographies and industry segments where\neconomic restrictions and shutdowns\nhave occurred related to the COVID-19\npandemic, declining industrial or\nmanufacturing activity that has\nresulted in or could result in higher\nlevels of unemployment, or where high\nlevels of consumer debt, such as\noutstanding student loans, could impair\nthe ability of customers to pay their\nother consumer loan obligations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings from its\nconsumer businesses could also be\nadversely affected by governmental\npolicies and actions that affect\nconsumers, including:\n\n\u2022 policies and initiatives relating to\nmedical insurance, education,\nimmigration, employment status and\nhousing, and\n\n\u2022 policies aimed at the economy more\nbroadly, such as higher taxes and\nincreased regulation which could result\nin reductions in consumer disposable\nincome.\n\nIn addition, governmental proposals to\npermit student loan obligations to be\ndischarged in bankruptcy proceedings\ncould, if enacted into law, encourage\ncertain of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s customers\nto declare personal bankruptcy and\n\nthereby trigger defaults and charge-\noffs of credit card and other consumer\nloans extended to those customers.\n\nUnfavorable market and economic\nconditions can have an adverse effect\non JPMorgan Chase\u2019s wholesale\nbusinesses.\n\nIn JPMorgan Chase\u2019s wholesale\nbusinesses, market and economic factors\ncan affect the volume of transactions\nthat JPMorgan Chase executes for its\nclients or for which it advises\nclients, and, therefore, the revenue\nthat JPMorgan Chase receives from those\ntransactions. These factors can also\ninfluence the willingness of other\nfinancial institutions and investors to\nparticipate in capital markets\ntransactions that JPMorgan Chase\nmanages, such as loan syndications or\nsecurities underwritings. Furthermore,\nif a significant and sustained\ndeterioration in market conditions were\nto occur, the profitability of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s capital markets businesses,\nincluding its loan syndication,\nsecurities underwriting and leveraged\nlending activities, could be reduced to\nthe extent that those businesses:\n\n\u2022 earn less fee revenue due to lower\ntransaction volumes, including when\nclients are unwilling or unable to\nrefinance their outstanding debt\nobligations in unfavorable market\nconditions, or\n\n\u2022 dispose of portions of credit\ncommitments at a loss, or hold larger\nresidual positions in credit\ncommitments that cannot be sold at\nfavorable prices.\n\nAn adverse change in market conditions\nin particular segments of the economy,\nsuch as a sudden and severe downturn in\noil and gas prices or an increase in\ncommodity prices, could have a material\nadverse effect on clients of JPMorgan\nChase whose operations or financial\ncondition are directly or indirectly\ndependent on the health or stability of\nthose market segments, as well as\nclients that are engaged in related\nbusinesses. JPMorgan Chase could incur\nlosses on its loans and other credit\ncommitments to clients that operate in,\nor are dependent on, any sector of the\neconomy that is under stress.\n\nThe fees that JPMorgan Chase earns from\nmanaging client assets or holding\nassets under custody for clients could\nbe diminished by declining asset values\nor other adverse macroeconomic\nconditions. For example, higher\ninterest rates or a downturn in\nfinancial markets could affect the\nvaluations of client assets that\nJPMorgan Chase manages or holds under\ncustody, which, in turn, could affect\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s revenue from fees that\nare based on the amount of assets under\nmanagement or custody. Similarly,\nadverse macroeconomic or market\nconditions could prompt outflows from\nJPMorgan Chase funds or accounts, or\ncause clients to invest in products\nthat generate lower revenue.\nSubstantial and unexpected withdrawals\nfrom a JPMorgan Chase fund can also\nhamper the investment performance of\nthe fund, particularly if the outflows\ncreate the need for the fund to dispose\nof fund assets at disadvantageous times\nor prices, and could lead to further\nwithdrawals based on the weaker\ninvestment performance.\n      \n  15  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                        \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\nAn economic downturn that results in\nlower consumer and business spending\ncould also have a negative impact on\ncertain of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s wholesale\nclients, and thereby diminish JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s earnings from its wholesale\noperations. For example, the businesses\nof certain of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nwholesale clients are dependent on\nconsistent streams of rental income\nfrom commercial real estate properties\nwhich are owned or being built by those\nclients. Severe and sustained adverse\neconomic conditions, including higher\nunemployment caused by the COVID-19\npandemic and governmental actions taken\nin response to the pandemic, could\nresult in reductions in the rental cash\nflows that owners or developers receive\nfrom their tenants which, in turn,\ncould depress the values of the\nproperties and impair the ability of\nborrowers to service or refinance their\ncommercial real estate loans. These\nconsequences could result in JPMorgan\nChase experiencing higher\ndelinquencies, defaults and write-offs\nwithin its commercial real estate loan\nportfolio and incurring higher costs\nfor servicing a larger volume of\ndelinquent loans in that portfolio,\nthereby reducing JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nearnings from its wholesale businesses.\n\nChanges in interest rates and credit\nspreads can adversely affect certain of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s revenue and income\nstreams related to the Firm\u2019s\ntraditional banking and funding\nactivities.\n\nIn general, a low or negative interest\nrate environment may cause:\n\n\u2022 net interest margins to be\ncompressed, which could reduce the\namounts that JPMorgan Chase earns on\nits investment securities portfolio to\nthe extent that it is unable to\nreinvest contemporaneously in higher-\nyielding instruments\n\n\u2022 unanticipated or adverse changes in\ndepositor behavior, which could\nnegatively affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbroader asset and liability management\nstrategy\n\n\u2022 JPMorgan Chase to reduce the amount\nof deposits that it accepts from\ncustomers and clients, which could\nresult in lower revenues, and\n\n\u2022 a reduction in the value of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s mortgage servicing rights\n(\u201cMSRs\u201d) asset, thereby decreasing\nrevenues.\n\nWhen credit spreads widen, it becomes\nmore expensive for JPMorgan Chase to\nborrow. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit spreads\nmay widen or narrow not only in\nresponse to events and circumstances\nthat are specific to JPMorgan Chase but\nalso as a result of general economic\nand geopolitical events and conditions.\nChanges in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit\nspreads will affect, positively or\nnegatively, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings\non certain liabilities, such as\nderivatives, that are recorded at fair\nvalue.\n\nWhen interest rates are increasing,\nJPMorgan Chase can generally be\nexpected to earn higher net interest\nincome. However, higher interest rates\ncan also lead to:\n\n\u2022 fewer originations of commercial and\nresidential real estate loans\n\n\u2022 losses on underwriting exposures\n\n\u2022 the loss of deposits, including in\nthe event that JPMorgan Chase makes\nincorrect assumptions about depositor\nbehavior\n\n\u2022 lower net interest income if central\nbanks introduce interest rate increases\nmore quickly than anticipated and this\nresults in a misalignment in the\npricing of short-term and long-term\nborrowings\n\n\u2022 less liquidity in the financial\nmarkets, and\n\n\u2022 higher funding costs.\n\nAll of these outcomes could adversely\naffect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s revenues and\nits liquidity and capital levels.\nHigher interest rates can also\nnegatively affect the payment\nperformance on loans within JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s consumer and wholesale loan\nportfolios that are linked to variable\ninterest rates. If borrowers of\nvariable rate loans are unable to\nafford higher interest payments, those\nborrowers may reduce or stop making\npayments, thereby causing JPMorgan\nChase to incur losses and increased\noperational costs related to servicing\na higher volume of delinquent loans.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s results may be\nmaterially affected by market\nfluctuations and significant changes in\nthe value of financial instruments.\n\nThe value of securities, derivatives\nand other financial instruments which\nJPMorgan Chase owns or in which it\nmakes markets can be materially\naffected by market fluctuations. Market\nvolatility, illiquid market conditions\nand other disruptions in the financial\nmarkets may make it extremely difficult\nto value certain financial instruments.\nSubsequent valuations of financial\ninstruments in future periods, in light\nof factors then prevailing, may result\nin significant changes in the value of\nthese instruments. In addition, at the\ntime of any disposition of these\nfinancial instruments, the price that\nJPMorgan Chase ultimately realizes will\ndepend on the demand and liquidity in\nthe market at that time and may be\nmaterially lower than their current\nfair value. Any of these factors could\ncause a decline in the value of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s financial instruments\nwhich may have an adverse effect on\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s results of operations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s risk management and\nmonitoring processes, including its\nstress testing framework, seek to\nquantify and control JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nexposure to more extreme market moves.\nHowever, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s hedging and\nother risk management strategies may\nnot be effective, and it could incur\nsignificant losses, if extreme market\nevents were to occur.\n      \n  16  \n      \n                                                                                  \n  Credit                                                                          \n                                                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase can be negatively\naffected by adverse changes in the\nfinancial condition of clients,\ncounterparties, custodians and CCPs.\n\nJPMorgan Chase routinely executes\ntransactions with clients and\ncounterparties such as corporations,\nfinancial institutions, asset managers,\nhedge funds, exchanges and government\nentities within and outside the U.S.\nMany of these transactions expose\nJPMorgan Chase to the credit risk of\nits clients and counterparties, and can\ninvolve JPMorgan Chase in disputes and\nlitigation if a client or counterparty\ndefaults. JPMorgan Chase can also be\nsubject to losses or liability where a\nfinancial institution that it has\nappointed to provide custodial services\nfor client assets or funds becomes\ninsolvent as a result of fraud or the\nfailure to abide by existing laws and\nobligations, including under the EU\nAlternative Investment Fund Managers\nDirective.\n\nA default by, or the financial or\noperational failure of, a CCP through\nwhich JPMorgan Chase executes contracts\nwould require JPMorgan Chase to replace\nthose contracts, thereby increasing its\noperational costs and potentially\nresulting in losses. JPMorgan Chase can\nalso be exposed to losses if a member\nof a CCP in which JPMorgan Chase is\nalso a member defaults on its\nobligations to the CCP because of\nrequirements that each member of the\nCCP absorb a portion of those losses.\nAs part of its clearing services\nactivities, JPMorgan Chase is also\nexposed to the risk of nonperformance\nby its clients, which it seeks to\nmitigate by requiring clients to\nprovide adequate collateral. JPMorgan\nChase is also exposed to intra-day\ncredit risk of its clients in\nconnection with providing cash\nmanagement, clearing, custodial and\nother transaction services to those\nclients. If a client for which JPMorgan\nChase provides these services becomes\nbankrupt or insolvent, JPMorgan Chase\nmay incur losses, become involved in\ndisputes and litigation with one or\nmore CCPs, the client\u2019s bankruptcy\nestate and other creditors, or be\nsubject to regulatory investigations.\nAll of the foregoing events can\nincrease JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational\nand litigation costs, and JPMorgan\nChase may suffer losses to the extent\nthat any collateral that it has\nreceived is insufficient to cover those\nlosses. JPMorgan Chase can also be\nsubject to bearing its share of non-\ndefault losses incurred by a CCP,\nincluding losses from custodial,\nsettlement or investment activities or\ndue to cyber or other security\nbreaches.\n\nTransactions with government entities,\nincluding national, state, provincial,\nmunicipal and local authorities, can\nexpose JPMorgan Chase to enhanced\nsovereign, credit, operational and\nreputation risks. Government entities\nmay, among other things, claim that\nactions taken by government officials\nwere beyond the legal authority of\nthose officials or repudiate\ntransactions authorized by a previous\nincumbent government. These types of\nactions have in the past caused, and\ncould in the future cause, JPMorgan\nChase to suffer losses or hamper its\nability to conduct business in the\nrelevant jurisdiction.\n\nIn addition, local laws, rules and\nregulations could limit JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s ability to resolve disputes and\nlitigation in the event of a\ncounterparty default or unwillingness\nto make previously agreed-upon\npayments, which could subject JPMorgan\nChase to losses.\n\nDisputes may arise with counterparties\nto derivatives contracts with regard to\nthe terms, the settlement procedures or\nthe value of underlying collateral. The\ndisposition of those disputes could\ncause JPMorgan Chase to incur\nunexpected transaction, operational and\nlegal costs, or result in credit\nlosses. These consequences can also\nimpair JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to\neffectively manage its credit risk\nexposure from its market activities, or\ncause harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nreputation.\n\nThe financial or operational failure of\na significant market participant, such\nas a major financial institution or a\nCCP, or concerns about the\ncreditworthiness of such a market\nparticipant, can have a cascading\neffect within the financial markets.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses could be\nsignificantly disrupted by such an\nevent, particularly if it leads to\nother market participants incurring\nsignificant losses, experiencing\nliquidity issues or defaulting, and\nJPMorgan Chase is likely to have\nsignificant interrelationships with,\nand credit exposure to, such a\nsignificant market participant.\n\nJPMorgan Chase may suffer losses if the\nvalue of collateral declines in\nstressed market conditions.\n\nDuring periods of market stress or\nilliquidity, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit\nrisk may be further increased when:\n\n\u2022 JPMorgan Chase cannot realize the\nfair value of the collateral it holds\n\n\u2022 collateral is liquidated at prices\nthat are not sufficient to recover the\nfull amount owed to it, or\n\n\u2022 counterparties are unable to post\ncollateral, whether for operational or\nother reasons.\n\nFurthermore, disputes with\ncounterparties concerning the valuation\nof collateral may increase in times of\nsignificant market stress, volatility\nor illiquidity, and JPMorgan Chase\ncould suffer losses during these\nperiods if it is unable to realize the\nfair value of collateral or to manage\ndeclines in the value of collateral.\n\nJPMorgan Chase could incur significant\nlosses arising from concentrations of\ncredit and market risk.\n\nJPMorgan Chase is exposed to greater\ncredit and market risk to the extent\nthat groupings of its clients or\ncounterparties:\n\n\u2022 engage in similar or related\nbusinesses, or in businesses in related\nindustries\n\n\u2022 do business in the same geographic\nregion, or\n\n\u2022 have business profiles, models or\nstrategies that could cause their\nability to meet their obligations to be\nsimilarly affected by changes in\neconomic conditions.\n      \n  17  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                        \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\nFor example, a significant\ndeterioration in the credit quality of\none of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s borrowers or\ncounterparties could lead to concerns\nabout the creditworthiness of other\nborrowers or counterparties in similar,\nrelated or dependent industries. This\ntype of interrelationship could\nexacerbate JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit,\nliquidity and market risk exposure and\npotentially cause it to incur losses,\nincluding fair value losses in its\nmarket-making businesses and investment\nportfolios. In addition, JPMorgan Chase\nmay be required to recognize higher\nallowances for credit losses with\nrespect to certain clients or\nindustries in order to align with\ndirectives or expectations of its\nbanking regulators.\n\nSimilarly, challenging economic\nconditions that affect a particular\nindustry or geographic area could lead\nto concerns about the credit quality of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s borrowers or\ncounterparties not only in that\nparticular industry or geography but in\nrelated or dependent industries,\nwherever located. These conditions\ncould also heighten concerns about the\nability of customers of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s consumer businesses who live in\nthose areas or work in those affected\nindustries or related or dependent\nindustries to meet their obligations to\nJPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase\nregularly monitors various segments of\nits credit and market risk exposures to\nassess the potential risks of\nconcentration or contagion, but its\nefforts to diversify or hedge its\nexposures against those risks may not\nbe successful.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer businesses\ncan also be harmed by an excessive\nexpansion of consumer credit by bank or\nnon-bank competitors. Heightened\ncompetition for certain types of\nconsumer loans could prompt industry-\nwide reactions such as significant\nreductions in the pricing or margins of\nthose loans or the making of loans to\nless-creditworthy borrowers. If large\nnumbers of consumers subsequently\ndefault on their loans, whether due to\nweak credit profiles, an economic\ndownturn or other factors, this could\nimpair their ability to repay\nobligations owed to JPMorgan Chase and\nresult in higher charge-offs and other\ncredit-related losses. More broadly,\nwidespread defaults on consumer debt\ncould lead to recessionary conditions\nin the U.S. economy, and JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s consumer businesses may earn\nlower revenues in such an environment.\n\nIf JPMorgan Chase is unable to reduce\npositions effectively during a market\ndislocation, this can increase both the\nmarket and credit risks associated with\nthose positions and the level of RWA\nthat JPMorgan Chase holds on its\nbalance sheet. These factors could\nadversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\ncapital position, funding costs and the\nprofitability of its businesses.\n                                                                                  \n  Liquidity                                                                       \n                                                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to operate its\nbusinesses could be impaired if its\nliquidity is constrained.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s liquidity could be\nimpaired at any given time by factors\nsuch as:\n\n\u2022 market-wide illiquidity or disruption\n\n\u2022 unforeseen liquidity or capital\nrequirements, including as a result of\nchanges in laws, rules and regulations\n\n\u2022 inability to sell assets, or to sell\nassets at favorable times or prices\n\n\u2022 default by a CCP or other significant\nmarket participant\n\n\u2022 unanticipated outflows of cash or\ncollateral\n\n\u2022 unexpected loss of consumer deposits,\nand\n\n\u2022 lack of market or customer confidence\nin JPMorgan Chase or financial\ninstitutions in general.\n\nA reduction in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nliquidity may be caused by events over\nwhich it has little or no control. For\nexample, during periods of market\nstress, low investor confidence and\nsignificant market illiquidity could\nresult in higher funding costs for\nJPMorgan Chase and could limit its\naccess to some of its traditional\nsources of liquidity.\n\nJPMorgan Chase may need to raise\nfunding from alternative sources if its\naccess to stable and lower-cost sources\nof funding, such as deposits and\nborrowings from Federal Home Loan\nBanks, is reduced. Alternative sources\nof funding could be more expensive or\nlimited in availability. JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s funding costs could also be\nnegatively affected by actions that\nJPMorgan Chase may take in order to:\n\n\u2022 satisfy applicable liquidity coverage\nratio and net stable funding ratio\nrequirements\n\n\u2022 address obligations under its\nresolution plan, or\n\n\u2022 satisfy regulatory requirements in\njurisdictions outside the U.S. relating\nto the pre-positioning of liquidity in\nsubsidiaries that are material legal\nentities.\n\nMore generally, if JPMorgan Chase fails\nto effectively manage its liquidity,\nthis could constrain its ability to\nfund or invest in its businesses and\nsubsidiaries (including, in particular,\nits broker-dealer subsidiaries), and\nthereby adversely affect its results of\noperations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding\ncompany and depends on the cash flows\nof its subsidiaries to make payments on\nits outstanding securities.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding\ncompany that holds the stock of\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and an\nintermediate holding company, JPMorgan\nChase Holdings LLC (the \u201cIHC\u201d). The IHC\nin turn holds the stock of\nsubstantially all of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nsubsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The\nIHC also owns other assets and owes\nintercompany indebtedness to the\nholding company.\n\nThe holding company is obligated to\ncontribute to the IHC substantially all\nthe net proceeds received from\nsecurities issuances (including\nissuances of senior and subordinated\ndebt securities and of preferred and\ncommon stock).\n\nThe ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. and the IHC to make payments to\nthe holding company is also limited.\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to\nrestrictions\n      \n  18  \n      \non its dividend distributions, as well\nas capital adequacy requirements, such\nas the Supplementary Leverage Ratio\n(\u201cSLR\u201d), and liquidity requirements and\nother regulatory restrictions on its\nability to make payments to the holding\ncompany. The IHC is prohibited from\npaying dividends or extending credit to\nthe holding company if certain capital\nor liquidity thresholds are breached or\nif limits are otherwise imposed by\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s management or Board of\nDirectors.\n\nAs a result of these arrangements, the\nability of the holding company to make\nvarious payments is dependent on its\nreceiving dividends from JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. and dividends and extensions\nof credit from the IHC. These\nlimitations could affect the holding\ncompany\u2019s ability to:\n\n\u2022 pay interest on its debt securities\n\n\u2022 pay dividends on its equity\nsecurities\n\n\u2022 redeem or repurchase outstanding\nsecurities, and\n\n\u2022 fulfill its other payment\nobligations.\n\nThese regulatory restrictions and\nlimitations could also result in the\nholding company seeking protection\nunder bankruptcy laws at a time earlier\nthan would have been the case absent\nthe existence of the capital and\nliquidity thresholds to which the IHC\nis subject.\n\nReductions in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit\nratings may adversely affect its\nliquidity and cost of funding.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its\nprincipal subsidiaries are rated by\ncredit rating agencies. Rating agencies\nevaluate both general and firm-specific\nand industry-specific factors when\ndetermining credit ratings for a\nparticular financial institution,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 expected future profitability\n\n\u2022 risk management practices\n\n\u2022 legal expenses\n\n\u2022 ratings differentials between bank\nholding companies and their bank and\nnon-bank subsidiaries\n\n\u2022 regulatory developments\n\n\u2022 assumptions about government support,\nand\n\n\u2022 economic and geopolitical trends.\n\nJPMorgan Chase closely monitors and\nmanages, to the extent that it is able,\nfactors that could influence its credit\nratings. However, there is no assurance\nthat JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit ratings\nwill not be lowered in the future.\nFurthermore, any such downgrade could\noccur at times of broader market\ninstability when JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\noptions for responding to events may be\nmore limited and general investor\nconfidence is low.\n\nA reduction in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit\nratings could curtail JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbusiness activities and reduce its\nprofitability in a number of ways,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 reducing its access to capital\nmarkets\n\n\u2022 materially increasing its cost of\nissuing and servicing securities\n\n\u2022 triggering additional collateral or\nfunding requirements, and\n\n\u2022 decreasing the number of investors\nand counterparties that are willing or\npermitted to do business with or lend\nto JPMorgan Chase.\n\nAny rating reduction could also\nincrease the credit spreads charged by\nthe market for taking credit risk on\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. and its\nsubsidiaries. This could, in turn,\nadversely affect the value of debt and\nother obligations of JPMorgan Chase &\nCo. and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe reform and replacement of benchmark\nrates could adversely affect JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s funding, investments and\nfinancial products, and expose it to\nlitigation and other disputes.\n\nInterest rate, equity, foreign exchange\nrate and other types of indices which\nare deemed to be \u201cbenchmarks,\u201d\nincluding those in widespread and\nlongstanding use, have been the subject\nof ongoing international, national and\nother regulatory scrutiny and\ninitiatives and proposals for reform.\nSome of these reforms are already\neffective while others are still to be\nimplemented or are under consideration.\nThese reforms may cause certain\nbenchmarks to perform differently than\nin the past, or to disappear entirely,\nor have other consequences which cannot\nbe fully anticipated.\n\nAny of the benchmark reforms which have\nbeen proposed or implemented, or the\ngeneral increased regulatory scrutiny\nof benchmarks, could also increase the\ncosts and risks of administering or\notherwise participating in the setting\nof benchmarks and complying with\nregulations or requirements relating to\nbenchmarks. Such factors may have the\neffect of discouraging market\nparticipants from continuing to\nadminister or contribute to certain\nbenchmarks, trigger changes in the\nrules or methodologies used in certain\nbenchmarks or lead to the disappearance\nof certain benchmarks.\n\nAny of these developments, and any\nfuture initiatives to regulate, reform\nor change the administration of\nbenchmarks, could result in adverse\nconsequences to the return on, value of\nand market for loans, mortgages,\nsecurities, derivatives and other\nfinancial instruments whose returns are\nlinked to any such benchmark, including\nthose issued, funded, serviced or held\nby JPMorgan Chase.\n\nVarious regulators, industry bodies and\nother market participants in the U.S.\nand other countries are engaged in\ninitiatives to develop, introduce and\nencourage the use of alternative rates\nto replace certain benchmarks. There is\nno assurance that these new rates will\nbe accepted or widely used by market\nparticipants, or that the\ncharacteristics of any of these new\nrates will be similar to, or produce\nthe economic equivalent of, the\nbenchmarks that they seek to replace.\nIf a particular benchmark were to be\ndiscontinued and an alternative rate\nhas not been successfully introduced to\nreplace that benchmark, this could\nresult in widespread\n      \n  19  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                        \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\ndislocation in the financial markets,\nengender volatility in the pricing of\nsecurities, derivatives and other\ninstruments, and suppress capital\nmarkets activities, all of which could\nhave adverse effects on JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s results of operations.\n\nTo the extent that any guidance\nprovided by accounting standard setters\nconcerning the transition from\nbenchmark rates is not comprehensive,\nfails to provide the expected relief or\nthe ability to elect or implement that\nguidance is constrained in any\nsignificant respect, the transition\ncould:\n\n\u2022 affect hedge accounting relationships\nbetween financial instruments linked to\na particular benchmark and any related\nderivatives, which could adversely\naffect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s results of\noperations, or\n\n\u2022 increase JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational\ncosts with respect to the determination\nof whether the transition has resulted\nin the modification or extinguishment\nof specific contracts for accounting\npurposes.\n\nICE Benchmark Administration, the\nadministrator of LIBOR, has announced\nthat it will consult on its intention\nto:\n\n\u2022 cease publication of (i) all tenors\nof the euro, sterling, Swiss franc and\nyen LIBORs and (ii) the one week and\ntwo month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR,\nin each case, after December 31, 2021,\nand\n\n\u2022 cease publication of all remaining\ntenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR after June\n30, 2023.\n\nThese announcements indicate that it is\nhighly likely that various tenors of\nthe LIBOR benchmark will be\ndiscontinued on or about the timeframes\nmentioned above. Vast amounts of loans,\nmortgages, securities, derivatives and\nother financial instruments are linked\nto the LIBOR benchmark, and any\ninability of market participants and\nregulators to successfully introduce\nbenchmark rates to replace LIBOR and\nimplement effective transitional\narrangements to address the\ndiscontinuation of LIBOR could result\nin disruption in the financial markets\nand suppress capital markets\nactivities, all of which could have a\nnegative impact on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nresults of operations and on LIBOR-\nlinked securities, credit or other\ninstruments which are issued, funded,\nserviced or held by JPMorgan Chase.\n\nJPMorgan Chase could also become\ninvolved in litigation and other types\nof disputes with clients, customers,\ncounterparties and investors as a\nconsequence of the transition from\nLIBOR and other benchmark rates to\nreplacement rates, including claims\nthat JPMorgan Chase has:\n\n\u2022 treated clients, customers,\ncounterparties or investors unfairly,\nor caused them to experience losses,\nhigher financing costs or lower returns\non investments\n\n\u2022 failed to appropriately communicate\nthe effects of the transition from\nbenchmark rates on the products that\nJPMorgan Chase has sold to its clients\nand customers, or failed to disclose\npurported conflicts of interest\n\n\u2022 made inappropriate product\nrecommendations to or investments on\nbehalf of its clients, or sold products\nthat did not serve their intended\npurpose, in connection with the\ntransition from benchmark rates\n\n\u2022 engaged in anti-competitive behavior,\nor in the manipulation of markets or\nspecific benchmarks, in connection with\nthe discontinuation of or transition\nfrom benchmark rates, or\n\n\u2022 disadvantaged clients, customers,\ncounterparties or investors when\ninterpreting or making determinations\nunder the terms of agreements or\nfinancial instruments.\n\nThese types of claims could subject\nJPMorgan Chase to higher legal expenses\nand operational costs, require it to\npay significant amounts in connection\nwith resolving litigation and other\ndisputes, and harm its reputation.\n                                                                                  \n  Capital                                                                         \n                                                                                  \nMaintaining the required level and\ncomposition of capital may impact\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to support\nbusiness activities, meet evolving\nregulatory requirements and distribute\ncapital to shareholders.\n\nJPMorgan Chase is subject to various\nregulatory capital requirements,\nincluding leverage- and risk-based\ncapital requirements, that can change\ndue to actions by banking regulators.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s adherence to these\nrequirements can also evolve\ndynamically in response to changes in\nthe composition of its balance sheet or\nother factors. It is possible that\nthese changing requirements, including\nmeeting or exceeding various capital\nratio thresholds, could limit JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s ability to support its\nbusinesses and make capital\ndistributions to its shareholders.\n\nActions by the Federal Reserve and the\nU.S. government in response to the\neconomic effects of the COVID-19\npandemic have led to an expansion of\nthe Federal Reserve's balance sheet,\ngrowth in deposit balances held by\nJPMorgan Chase and other U.S. financial\ninstitutions and, consequently, an\nincrease in JPMorgan Chase's leverage\nexposure. If these trends were to\ncontinue, JPMorgan Chase may be\nrequired to hold more capital or take\nother actions in order to satisfy the\nleverage-based capital requirements\napplicable to it.\n\nJPMorgan Chase is required to submit,\nat least annually, a capital plan\ndescribing proposed dividend payments\nto shareholders, redemptions and\nrepurchases of its outstanding\nsecurities and other capital actions\nthat it intends to take. JPMorgan Chase\nconsiders various factors in managing\ncapital, including the impact of stress\non its capital levels, as determined by\nboth internal modeling and the Federal\nReserve\u2019s modeling of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\ncapital position in supervisory stress\ntests. Because the Federal Reserve and\nJPMorgan Chase use different\nforecasting models and methodologies\nwhen determining stress test results,\nthere can be significant differences\nbetween the estimates of stress loss as\ndetermined by the Federal Reserve and\nJPMorgan Chase, respectively. The\nFederal\n      \n  20  \n      \nReserve may require modifications to\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s capital plan, and may\nchange the Stress Capital Buffer\n(\u201cSCB\u201d) applicable to JPMorgan Chase,\nfrom time to time.\n\nAny failure by or inability of JPMorgan\nChase to maintain the required level\nand composition of capital, or\nunfavorable changes in the capital\nrequirements imposed by banking\nregulators, could have an adverse\nimpact on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nshareholders, such as:\n\n\u2022 reducing the amount of common stock\nthat JPMorgan Chase is permitted to\nrepurchase\n\n\u2022 requiring the issuance of, or\nprohibiting the redemption of, capital\ninstruments in a manner inconsistent\nwith JPMorgan Chase\u2019s capital\nmanagement strategy\n\n\u2022 constraining the amount of dividends\nthat may be paid on common stock, or\n\n\u2022 curtailing JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business\nactivities or operations.\n                                                                                  \n  Operational                                                                     \n                                                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses are\ndependent on the effectiveness of its\noperational systems and those of other\nmarket participants.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses rely on the\nability of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s financial,\naccounting, transaction execution, data\nprocessing and other operational\nsystems to process, record, monitor and\nreport a large number of transactions\non a continuous basis, and to do so\naccurately, quickly and securely. In\naddition to proper design,\ninstallation, maintenance and training,\nthe effective functioning of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s operational systems depends on:\n\n\u2022 the quality of the information\ncontained in those systems, as\ninaccurate, outdated or corrupted data\ncan significantly compromise the\nfunctionality or reliability of a\nparticular system and other systems to\nwhich it transmits or from which it\nreceives information, and\n\n\u2022 JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to\nappropriately maintain and upgrade its\nsystems on a regular basis, and to\nensure that any changes introduced to\nits systems are managed carefully to\nensure security and operational\ncontinuity and adhere to all applicable\nlegal and regulatory requirements.\n\nJPMorgan Chase also depends on its\nability to access and use the\noperational systems of its vendors,\ncustodians and other market\nparticipants, including clearing and\npayment systems, CCPs, securities\nexchanges and data processing, security\nand technology companies.\n\nThe ineffectiveness, failure or other\ndisruption of operational systems upon\nwhich JPMorgan Chase depends, including\ndue to a systems malfunction,\ncyberbreach or other systems failure,\ncould result in unfavorable ripple\neffects in the financial markets and\nfor JPMorgan Chase and its clients and\ncustomers, including:\n\n\u2022 delays or other disruptions in\nproviding information, services and\nliquidity to clients and customers\n\n\u2022 the inability to settle transactions\nor obtain access to funds and other\nassets, including those for which\nphysical settlement and delivery is\nrequired\n\n\u2022 failure to timely settle or confirm\ntransactions\n\n\u2022 the possibility that funds transfers,\ncapital markets trades or other\ntransactions are executed erroneously,\nas a result of illegal conduct or with\nunintended consequences\n\n\u2022 financial losses, including due to\nloss-sharing requirements of CCPs,\npayment systems or other market\ninfrastructures, or as possible\nrestitution to clients and customers\n\n\u2022 higher operational costs associated\nwith replacing services provided by a\nsystem that is unavailable\n\n\u2022 client or customer dissatisfaction\nwith JPMorgan Chase\u2019s products and\nservices\n\n\u2022 regulatory fines, penalties, or other\nsanctions against JPMorgan Chase\n\n\u2022 loss of confidence in the ability of\nJPMorgan Chase, or financial\ninstitutions generally, to protect\nagainst and withstand operational\ndisruptions, or\n\n\u2022 harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\n\nAs the speed, frequency, volume,\ninterconnectivity and complexity of\ntransactions continue to increase, it\ncan become more challenging to\neffectively maintain and upgrade\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational systems\nand infrastructure, especially due to\nthe heightened risks that:\n\n\u2022 attempts by third parties to defraud\nJPMorgan Chase or its clients and\ncustomers may increase, evolve or\nbecome more complex, particularly\nduring periods of market disruption or\neconomic uncertainty\n\n\u2022 errors made by JPMorgan Chase or\nanother market participant, whether\ninadvertent or malicious, cause\nwidespread system disruption\n\n\u2022 isolated or seemingly insignificant\nerrors in operational systems compound,\nor migrate to other systems over time,\nto become larger issues\n\n\u2022 failures in synchronization or\nencryption software, or degraded\nperformance of microprocessors due to\ndesign flaws, could cause disruptions\nin operational systems, or the\ninability of systems to communicate\nwith each other, and\n\n\u2022 third parties may attempt to block\nthe use of key technology solutions by\nclaiming that the use infringes on\ntheir intellectual property rights.\n\nIf JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational\nsystems, or those of external parties\non which JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses\ndepend, are unable to meet

or if they fail or have\nother significant shortcomings,\nJPMorgan Chase could be materially and\nadversely affected.\n\nA successful cyber attack affecting\nJPMorgan Chase could cause significant\nharm to JPMorgan Chase and its clients\nand customers.\n\nJPMorgan Chase experiences numerous\nattempted cyber attacks on its computer\nsystems, software, networks and other\ntechnology assets on a daily basis from\nvarious actors, including groups acting\non behalf of hostile countries, cyber-\ncriminals, \u201chacktivists\u201d (i.e.,\nindividuals or groups that use\ntechnology to promote a political\nagenda or social change) and others.\nThese cyber attacks can take many\nforms, including attempts to introduce\ncomputer viruses or malicious code,\nwhich is commonly referred to as\n\u201cmalware,\u201d into JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nsystems. These attacks are typically\ndesigned to:\n\n\u2022 obtain unauthorized access to\nconfidential information belonging to\nJPMorgan Chase or its clients,\ncustomers, counterparties or employees\n\n\u2022 manipulate data\n\n\u2022 destroy data or systems with the aim\nof rendering services unavailable\n\n\u2022 disrupt, sabotage or degrade service\non JPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems\n\n\u2022 steal money, or\n\n\u2022 extort money through the use of so-\ncalled \u201cransomware.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan Chase has also experienced\nsignificant distributed denial-of-\nservice attacks which are intended to\ndisrupt online banking services.\n\nJPMorgan Chase has experienced security\nbreaches due to cyber attacks in the\npast, and it is inevitable that\nadditional breaches will occur in the\nfuture. Any such breach could result in\nserious and harmful consequences for\nJPMorgan Chase or its clients and\ncustomers.\n\nA principal reason that JPMorgan Chase\ncannot provide absolute security\nagainst cyber attacks is that it may\nnot always be possible to anticipate,\ndetect or recognize threats to JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s systems, or to implement\neffective preventive measures against\nall breaches. This is because:\n\n\u2022 the techniques used in cyber attacks\nchange frequently and are increasingly\nsophisticated, and therefore may not be\nrecognized until launched\n\n\u2022 cyber attacks can originate from a\nwide variety of sources, including\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s own employees, cyber-\ncriminals, hacktivists, groups linked\nto terrorist organizations or hostile\ncountries, or third parties whose\nobjective is to disrupt the operations\nof financial institutions more\ngenerally\n\n\u2022 JPMorgan Chase does not have control\nover the cybersecurity of the systems\nof the large number of\n\nclients, customers, counterparties and\nthird-party service providers with\nwhich it does business, and\n\n\u2022 it is possible that a third party,\nafter establishing a foothold on an\ninternal network without being\ndetected, might obtain access to other\nnetworks and systems.\n\nThe risk of a security breach due to a\ncyber attack could increase in the\nfuture as JPMorgan Chase continues to\nexpand its mobile banking and other\ninternet-based product offerings and\nits internal use of internet-based\nproducts and applications. Furthermore,\nincreased use of remote access and\nthird party video conferencing\nsolutions during the COVID-19 pandemic,\nto facilitate work-from-home\narrangements for employees, could\nincrease JPMorgan Chase\u2019s exposure to\ncyber attacks. In addition, a third\nparty could misappropriate confidential\ninformation obtained by intercepting\nsignals or communications from mobile\ndevices used by JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nemployees.\n\nA successful penetration or\ncircumvention of the security of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems or the systems\nof a vendor, governmental body or\nanother market participant could cause\nserious negative consequences,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 significant disruption of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s operations and those of its\nclients, customers and counterparties,\nincluding losing access to operational\nsystems\n\n\u2022 misappropriation of confidential\ninformation of JPMorgan Chase or that\nof its clients, customers,\ncounterparties, employees or regulators\n\n\u2022 disruption of or damage to JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s systems and those of its\nclients, customers and counterparties\n\n\u2022 the inability, or extended delays in\nthe ability, to fully recover and\nrestore data that has been stolen,\nmanipulated or destroyed, or the\ninability to prevent systems from\nprocessing fraudulent transactions\n\n\u2022 violations by JPMorgan Chase of\napplicable privacy and other laws\n\n\u2022 financial loss to JPMorgan Chase or\nto its clients, customers,\ncounterparties or employees\n\n\u2022 loss of confidence in JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s cybersecurity and business\nresiliency measures\n\n\u2022 dissatisfaction among JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s clients, customers or\ncounterparties\n\n\u2022 significant exposure to litigation\nand regulatory fines, penalties or\nother sanctions, and\n\n\u2022 harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\n\nThe extent of a particular cyber attack\nand the steps that JPMorgan Chase may\nneed to take to investigate the attack\nmay not be immediately clear, and it\nmay take a significant amount of time\nbefore such an investigation can be\ncompleted. While such an investigation\nis ongoing, JPMorgan Chase may not\nnecessarily know the full extent of the\nharm caused by the cyber attack, and\nthat damage may\n      \n  22  \n      \ncontinue to spread. These factors may\ninhibit JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to\nprovide rapid, full and reliable\ninformation about the cyber attack to\nits clients, customers, counterparties\nand regulators, as well as the public.\nFurthermore, it may not be clear how\nbest to contain and remediate the harm\ncaused by the cyber attack, and certain\nerrors or actions could be repeated or\ncompounded before they are discovered\nand remediated. Any or all of these\nfactors could further increase the\ncosts and consequences of a cyber\nattack.\n\nJPMorgan Chase can be negatively\naffected if it fails to identify and\naddress operational risks associated\nwith the introduction of or changes to\nproducts, services and delivery\nplatforms.\n\nWhen JPMorgan Chase launches a new\nproduct or service, introduces a new\nplatform for the delivery or\ndistribution of products or services\n(including mobile connectivity,\nelectronic trading and cloud\ncomputing), or makes changes to an\nexisting product, service or delivery\nplatform, it may not fully appreciate\nor identify new operational risks that\nmay arise from those changes, or may\nfail to implement adequate controls to\nmitigate the risks associated with\nthose changes. Any significant failure\nin this regard could diminish JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s ability to operate one or more\nof its businesses or result in:\n\n\u2022 potential liability to clients,\ncounterparties and customers\n\n\u2022 increased operating expenses\n\n\u2022 higher litigation costs, including\nregulatory fines, penalties and other\nsanctions\n\n\u2022 damage to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation\n\n\u2022 impairment of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nliquidity\n\n\u2022 regulatory intervention, or\n\n\u2022 weaker competitive standing.\n\nAny of the foregoing consequences could\nmaterially and adversely affect\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses and results\nof operations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational costs and\ncustomer satisfaction could be\nadversely affected by the failure of an\nexternal operational system.\n\nExternal operational systems with which\nJPMorgan is connected, whether directly\nor indirectly, can be sources of\noperational risk to JPMorgan Chase.\nJPMorgan Chase may be exposed not only\nto a systems failure or cyber attack\nthat may be experienced by a vendor or\nmarket infrastructure with which\nJPMorgan Chase is directly connected,\nbut also to a systems breakdown or\ncyber attack involving another party to\nwhich such a vendor or infrastructure\nis connected. Similarly, retailers,\ndata aggregators and other external\nparties with which JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\ncustomers do business can increase\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational risk. This\nis particularly the case where\nactivities of customers or those\nparties are\n\nbeyond JPMorgan Chase\u2019s security and\ncontrol systems, including through the\nuse of the internet, cloud computing\nservices and personal smart phones and\nother mobile devices or services.\n\nIf an external party obtains access to\ncustomer account data on JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s systems, and that party\nexperiences a cyberbreach of its own\nsystems or misappropriates that data,\nthis could result in a variety of\nnegative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase\nand its clients and customers,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 heightened risk that external parties\nwill be able to execute fraudulent\ntransactions using JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nsystems\n\n\u2022 losses from fraudulent transactions,\nas well as potential liability for\nlosses that exceed thresholds\nestablished in consumer protection\nlaws, rules and regulations\n\n\u2022 increased operational costs to\nremediate the consequences of the\nexternal party\u2019s security breach, and\n\n\u2022 harm to reputation arising from the\nperception that JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nsystems may not be secure.\n\nAs JPMorgan Chase\u2019s interconnectivity\nwith clients, customers and other\nexternal parties continues to expand,\nJPMorgan Chase increasingly faces the\nrisk of operational failure or cyber\nattacks with respect to the systems of\nthose parties. Security breaches\naffecting JPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients or\ncustomers, or systems breakdowns or\nfailures, security breaches or human\nerror or misconduct affecting other\nexternal parties, may require JPMorgan\nChase to take steps to protect the\nintegrity of its own operational\nsystems or to safeguard confidential\ninformation, including restricting the\naccess of customers to their accounts.\nThese actions can increase JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s operational costs and\npotentially diminish customer\nsatisfaction and confidence in JPMorgan\nChase.\n\nFurthermore, the widespread and\nexpanding interconnectivity among\nfinancial institutions, central agents,\nCCPs, payment processors, securities\nexchanges, clearing houses and other\nfinancial market infrastructures\nincreases the risk that an operational\nfailure or cyber attack involving one\ninstitution or entity may cause\nindustry-wide operational disruptions\nthat could materially affect JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s ability to conduct business.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations could be\nimpaired if its employees, or those of\nexternal parties, are not competent and\ntrustworthy, or if measures to protect\ntheir health and safety are\nineffective.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to operate its\nbusinesses efficiently and profitably,\nto offer products and services that\nmeet the expectations of its clients\nand customers, and to maintain an\neffective risk management framework is\nhighly dependent on the competence and\nintegrity of its employees, as well as\nemployees of other parties on which\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations rely,\nincluding vendors, custodians and\nfinancial markets infrastructures.\nJPMorgan\n      \n  23  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                        \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\nChase\u2019s businesses could be materially\nand adversely affected by:\n\n\u2022 the ineffective implementation of\nbusiness decisions\n\n\u2022 any failure to institute controls\nthat appropriately address risks\nassociated with business activities, or\nto appropriately train employees with\nrespect to those risks and controls\n\n\u2022 a significant operational breakdown\nor failure, theft, fraud or other\nunlawful conduct, or\n\n\u2022 other negative outcomes caused by\nhuman error or misconduct by an\nemployee of JPMorgan Chase or of\nanother party on which JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\noperations depend.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations could also\nbe impaired if the measures taken by it\nor by governmental authorities to help\nensure the health and safety of its\nemployees are ineffective, or if any\nexternal party on which JPMorgan Chase\nrelies fails to take appropriate and\neffective actions to protect the health\nand safety of its employees.\n\nJPMorgan Chase faces substantial legal\nand operational risks in safeguarding\npersonal information.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses are subject\nto complex and evolving laws, rules and\nregulations, both within and outside\nthe U.S., governing the privacy and\nprotection of personal information of\nindividuals. The protected parties can\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 JPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients and\ncustomers, and prospective clients and\ncustomers\n\n\u2022 clients and customers of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s clients and customers\n\n\u2022 employees and prospective employees,\nand\n\n\u2022 employees of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nvendors, counterparties and other\nexternal parties.\n\nEnsuring that JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\ncollection, use, transfer and storage\nof personal information comply with all\napplicable laws, rules and regulations\nin all relevant jurisdictions,\nincluding where the laws of different\njurisdictions are in conflict, can:\n\n\u2022 increase JPMorgan Chase\u2019s compliance\nand operating costs\n\n\u2022 hinder the development of new\nproducts or services, curtail the\noffering of existing products or\nservices, or affect how products and\nservices are offered to clients and\ncustomers\n\n\u2022 demand significant oversight by\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s management, and\n\n\u2022 require JPMorgan Chase to structure\nits businesses, operations and systems\nin less efficient ways.\n\nNot all of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients,\ncustomers, vendors, counterparties and\nother external parties may have\nappropriate controls in place to\nprotect the confidentiality\n\nof the information exchanged between\nthem and JPMorgan Chase, particularly\nwhere information is transmitted by\nelectronic means. JPMorgan Chase could\nbe exposed to litigation or regulatory\nfines, penalties or other sanctions if\npersonal, confidential or proprietary\ninformation of clients, customers,\nemployees or others were to be\nmishandled or misused, such as\nsituations where such information is:\n\n\u2022 erroneously provided to parties who\nare not permitted to have the\ninformation, or\n\n\u2022 intercepted or otherwise compromised\nby third parties.\n\nConcerns regarding the effectiveness of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s measures to safeguard\npersonal information, or even the\nperception that those measures are\ninadequate, could cause JPMorgan Chase\nto lose existing or potential clients\nand customers, and thereby reduce\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s revenues. Furthermore,\nany failure or perceived failure by\nJPMorgan Chase to comply with\napplicable privacy or data protection\nlaws, rules and regulations may subject\nit to inquiries, examinations and\ninvestigations that could result in\nrequirements to modify or cease certain\noperations or practices, significant\nliabilities or regulatory fines,\npenalties or other sanctions. Any of\nthese could damage JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nreputation and otherwise adversely\naffect its businesses.\n\nIn recent years, well-publicized\nallegations involving the misuse or\ninappropriate sharing of personal\ninformation have led to expanded\ngovernmental scrutiny of practices\nrelating to the safeguarding of\npersonal information and the use or\nsharing of personal data by companies\nin the U.S. and other countries. That\nscrutiny has in some cases resulted in,\nand could in the future lead to, the\nadoption of stricter laws, rules and\nregulations relating to the use and\nsharing of personal information. These\ntypes of laws and regulations could\nprohibit or significantly restrict\nfinancial services firms such as\nJPMorgan Chase from sharing information\namong affiliates or with third parties\nsuch as vendors, and thereby increase\ncompliance costs, or could restrict\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s use of personal data\nwhen developing or offering products or\nservices to customers. These\nrestrictions could also inhibit\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s development or\nmarketing of certain products or\nservices, or increase the costs of\noffering them to customers.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations, results\nand reputation could be harmed by\ncatastrophes or other events.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business and\noperational systems could be seriously\ndisrupted, and its reputation could be\nharmed, by events or contributing\nfactors that are wholly or partially\nbeyond its control, including:\n\n\u2022 cyberbreaches or breaches of physical\npremises, including data centers\n\n\u2022 power, telecommunications or internet\noutages\n\n\u2022 failures of, or loss of access to,\noperational systems, including computer\nsystems, servers, networks and other\ntechnology assets\n      \n  24  \n      \n\u2022 damage to or loss of property or\nassets of JPMorgan Chase or third\nparties, and any consequent injuries,\nincluding in connection with any\nconstruction projects undertaken by\nJPMorgan Chase\n\n\u2022 effects of climate change\n\n\u2022 natural disasters or severe weather\nconditions\n\n\u2022 accidents such as explosions or\nstructural failures\n\n\u2022 health emergencies, the spread of\ninfectious diseases or pandemics, or\n\n\u2022 events arising from local or larger-\nscale political events, including\noutbreaks of hostilities or terrorist\nacts.\n\nJPMorgan Chase maintains a Firmwide\nresiliency program that is intended to\nenable it to recover critical business\nfunctions and supporting assets,\nincluding staff, technology and\nfacilities, in the event of a business\ninterruption. There can be no assurance\nthat JPMorgan Chase\u2019s resiliency plans\nwill fully mitigate all potential\nbusiness continuity risks to JPMorgan\nChase or its clients and customers or\nthat its resiliency plans will be\nadequate to address the effects of\nsimultaneous occurrences of multiple\ncatastrophes or other business\ninterruption events. In addition,\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to respond\neffectively to a business interruption\ncould be hampered to the extent that\nthe members of its workforce, physical\nassets or systems and other support\ninfrastructure needed to address the\nevent are geographically dispersed, or\nconversely, if a catastrophic event\noccurs in an area in which a critical\nsegment of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s workforce,\nphysical assets or systems and other\nsupport infrastructure is concentrated.\nFurther, should emergency or\ncatastrophic events such as severe or\nabnormal weather conditions or health\nemergencies, the spread of infectious\ndiseases or pandemics become more\nchronic, the disruptive effects of\nthose events on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbusiness and operations, and on its\nclients, customers, counterparties and\nemployees, could become more\nsignificant and long-lasting.\n\nAny significant failure or disruption\nof JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations or\noperational systems, or any\ncatastrophic event, could:\n\n\u2022 hinder JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to\nprovide services to its clients and\ncustomers or to transact with its\ncounterparties\n\n\u2022 require it to expend significant\nresources to correct the failure or\ndisruption\n\n\u2022 cause it to incur losses or\nliabilities, including from loss of\nrevenue, damage to or loss of property,\nor injuries\n\n\u2022 expose it to litigation or regulatory\nfines, penalties or other sanctions,\nand\n\n\u2022 harm its reputation.\n\nFurthermore, JPMorgan Chase may incur\ncosts in connection with disposing of\ncertain excess properties,\n\npremises and facilities, and those\ncosts may be material to its results of\noperations in a given period.\n\nEnhanced regulatory and other standards\nfor the oversight of vendors and other\nservice providers can result in higher\ncosts and other potential exposures.\n\nJPMorgan Chase must comply with\nenhanced regulatory and other standards\nassociated with doing business with\nvendors and other service providers,\nincluding standards relating to the\noutsourcing of functions as well as the\nperformance of significant banking and\nother functions by subsidiaries.\nJPMorgan Chase incurs significant costs\nand expenses in connection with its\ninitiatives to address the risks\nassociated with oversight of its\ninternal and external service\nproviders. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s failure to\nappropriately assess and manage these\nrelationships, especially those\ninvolving significant banking\nfunctions, shared services or other\ncritical activities, could materially\nadversely affect JPMorgan Chase.\nSpecifically, any such failure could\nresult in:\n\n\u2022 potential liability to clients and\ncustomers\n\n\u2022 regulatory fines, penalties or other\nsanctions\n\n\u2022 lower revenues, and the opportunity\ncost from lost revenues\n\n\u2022 increased operational costs, or\n\n\u2022 harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s risk management\nframework may not be effective in\nidentifying and mitigating every risk\nto JPMorgan Chase.\n\nAny inadequacy or lapse in JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s risk management framework,\ngovernance structure, practices, models\nor reporting systems could expose it to\nunexpected losses, and its financial\ncondition or results of operations\ncould be materially and adversely\naffected. Any such inadequacy or lapse\ncould:\n\n\u2022 hinder the timely escalation of\nmaterial risk issues to JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s senior management and the Board\nof Directors\n\n\u2022 lead to business decisions that have\nnegative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase\n\n\u2022 require significant resources and\ntime to remediate\n\n\u2022 lead to non-compliance with laws,\nrules and regulations\n\n\u2022 attract heightened regulatory\nscrutiny\n\n\u2022 expose JPMorgan Chase to regulatory\ninvestigations or legal proceedings\n\n\u2022 subject it to litigation or\nregulatory fines, penalties or other\nsanctions\n\n\u2022 harm its reputation, or\n\n\u2022 otherwise diminish confidence in\nJPMorgan Chase.\n\nJPMorgan Chase relies on data to assess\nits various risk exposures.

These deficiencies could\nalso result in inaccurate risk\nreporting.\n\nMany of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s risk\nmanagement strategies and techniques\nconsider historical market behavior.\nThese strategies and techniques are\nbased to some degree on management\u2019s\nsubjective judgment. For example, many\nmodels used by JPMorgan Chase are based\non assumptions regarding historical\ncorrelations among prices of various\nasset classes or other market\nindicators. In times of market stress,\nincluding difficult or less liquid\nmarket environments, or in the event of\nother unforeseen circumstances,\npreviously uncorrelated indicators may\nbecome correlated. Conversely,\npreviously-correlated indicators may\nmake unrelated movements at those\ntimes. Sudden market movements and\nunanticipated or unidentified market or\neconomic movements could, in some\ncircumstances, limit the effectiveness\nof JPMorgan Chase\u2019s risk management\nstrategies, causing it to incur losses.\n\nJPMorgan Chase could recognize\nunexpected losses, its capital levels\ncould be reduced and it could face\ngreater regulatory scrutiny if its\nmodels, estimations or judgments,\nincluding those used in its financial\nstatements, prove to be inadequate or\nincorrect.\n\nJPMorgan Chase has developed and uses a\nvariety of models and other analytical\nand judgment-based estimations to\nmeasure, monitor and implement controls\nover its market, credit, capital,\nliquidity, operational and other risks.\nThese models and estimations are based\non a variety of assumptions and\nhistorical trends, and are periodically\nreviewed and modified as necessary. The\nmodels and estimations that JPMorgan\nChase uses may not be effective in all\ncases to identify, observe and mitigate\nrisk due to a variety of factors, such\nas:\n\n\u2022 reliance on historical trends that\nmay not accurately predict future\nevents, including assumptions\nunderlying the models and estimations\nwhich predict correlation among certain\nmarket indicators or asset prices\n\n\u2022 inherent limitations associated with\nforecasting uncertain economic and\nfinancial outcomes\n\n\u2022 historical trend information may be\nincomplete, or may not anticipate\nseverely negative market conditions\nsuch as extreme volatility, dislocation\nor lack of liquidity\n\n\u2022 technology that is introduced to run\nmodels or estimations may not perform\nas expected, or may not be well\nunderstood by the personnel using the\ntechnology\n\n\u2022 models and estimations may contain\nerroneous data, valuations, formulas or\nalgorithms, and\n\n\u2022 review processes may fail to detect\nflaws in models and estimations.\n\nSome of the models and other analytical\nand judgment-based estimations used by\nJPMorgan Chase in managing\n\nrisks are subject to review by, and\nrequire the approval of, JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s regulators. These reviews are\nrequired before JPMorgan Chase may use\nthose models and estimations in\nconnection with calculating market risk\nRWA, credit risk RWA and operational\nrisk RWA under Basel III. If JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s models or estimations are not\napproved by its regulators, it may be\nsubject to higher capital charges,\nwhich could adversely affect its\nfinancial results or limit the ability\nto expand its businesses. JPMorgan\nChase also uses internal models in\nconnection with its stress testing.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s capital actions may\nrequire regulatory approval and could\nbe constrained if its banking\nregulators object to a capital plan or\nrequire the resubmission of a capital\nplan due to the perceived inadequacy of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s models, estimations or\nother factors.\n\nUnder U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d),\nJPMorgan Chase is required to use\nestimates and apply judgments in\npreparing its financial statements,\nincluding in determining the allowance\nfor credit losses, reserves related to\nlitigation and the credit card rewards\nliability. Certain financial\ninstruments require a determination of\ntheir fair value in order to prepare\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s financial statements,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 trading assets and liabilities\n\n\u2022 instruments in the investment\nportfolio\n\n\u2022 certain loans\n\n\u2022 MSRs\n\n\u2022 structured notes, and\n\n\u2022 certain repurchase and resale\nagreements.\n\nWhere quoted market prices are not\navailable for these types of financial\ninstruments, JPMorgan Chase may make\nfair value determinations based on\ninternally developed models or other\nmeans which ultimately rely to some\ndegree on management estimates and\njudgment, and these types of estimates\nand judgments may not prove to be\naccurate due to a variety of factors,\nas noted above. In addition, sudden\nilliquidity in markets or declines in\nprices of certain loans and securities\nmay make it more difficult to value\ncertain financial instruments, which\ncould lead to valuations being\nsubsequently changed or adjusted. If\nestimates or judgments underlying\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s financial statements\nprove to have been incorrect, JPMorgan\nChase may experience material losses.\n\nJPMorgan Chase establishes an allowance\nfor expected credit losses that are\ninherent in its credit exposures. It\nthen employs stress testing and other\ntechniques to determine the amounts of\ncapital and liquidity that would be\nneeded in the event of adverse economic\nor market events. These processes are\ncritical to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s results of\noperations and financial condition.\nThey require difficult, subjective and\ncomplex judgments, including forecasts\nof how economic conditions might impair\nthe ability of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nborrowers and counterparties to repay\ntheir loans or other obligations. It is\npossible that\n      \n  26  \n      \nJPMorgan Chase will fail to identify\nthe proper factors or that it will fail\nto accurately estimate the impact of\nfactors that it identifies.\n\nCertain models used by JPMorgan Chase\nin connection with the determination of\nthe allowance for credit losses have\nheightened performance risk in the\neconomic environment precipitated by\nthe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic\nand government stimulus. For example,\nat times certain macroeconomic\nvariables employed in these models\nremained well outside the range of\nhistorical data used to train the\nmodels for some stress scenarios. In\naddition, the historical relationships\nbetween these macroeconomic variables\nand consumer and wholesale credit\nlosses have deteriorated, in part due\nto the effects of the CARES Act and\ngovernment stimulus actions. As a\nresult, there continues to be\nsignificant uncertainty about the\nreliability of the projections produced\nby the models. To compensate for this\nuncertainty, JPMorgan Chase has made,\nand may continue to make, significant\nadjustments to the quantitative results\nof model calculations to take into\nconsideration model imprecision,\nemerging risks, trends and other\nfactors that are not yet reflected in\nthose calculations. There can be no\nassurance that, even after adjustments\nhave been made to model outputs,\nJPMorgan Chase will not recognize\nunexpected losses arising from the\nmodel uncertainty that has resulted\nfrom these developments.\n\nLapses in controls over disclosure or\nfinancial reporting could materially\naffect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s profitability\nor reputation.\n\nThere can be no assurance that JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s disclosure controls and\nprocedures will be effective in every\ncircumstance, or that a material\nweakness or significant deficiency in\ninternal control over financial\nreporting will not occur. Any such\nlapses or deficiencies could:\n\n\u2022 materially and adversely affect\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business and results\nof operations or financial condition\n\n\u2022 restrict its ability to access the\ncapital markets\n\n\u2022 require it to expend significant\nresources to correct the lapses or\ndeficiencies\n\n\u2022 expose it to litigation or regulatory\nfines, penalties or other sanctions\n\n\u2022 harm its reputation, or\n\n\u2022 otherwise diminish investor\nconfidence in JPMorgan Chase.\n\nJPMorgan Chase could be adversely\naffected by changes in accounting\nstandards or policies.\n\nThe preparation of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nfinancial statements is based on\naccounting standards established by the\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board\nand the Securities and Exchange\nCommission, as well as more detailed\naccounting policies established by\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s management. From time\nto time these accounting standards or\n\naccounting policies may change, and in\nsome cases these changes could have a\nsignificant effect on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nfinancial statements and may adversely\naffect its financial results or\ninvestor perceptions of those results.\n\nAs of January 1, 2020, JPMorgan Chase\nimplemented a new accounting standard,\ncommonly referred to as the Current\nExpected Credit Losses (\u201cCECL\u201d)\nframework, which requires earlier\nrecognition of expected credit losses\non loans and certain other instruments.\nThe allowance for credit losses related\nto certain of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s loans\nand other lending-related commitments\nportfolios increased upon\nimplementation of CECL, which has had a\nnegative impact on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\ncapital levels.\n\nThe ongoing impact of the adoption of\nCECL could include the following, each\nof which could result in diminished\ninvestor confidence:\n\n\u2022 greater volatility in JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s earnings and capital levels\nover economic cycles\n\n\u2022 potential reductions in its capital\ndistributions, or\n\n\u2022 increases in the allowance for credit\nlosses.\n\nIn addition, JPMorgan Chase could be\nadversely impacted by associated\nchanges in the competitive environment\nin which it operates, including changes\nin the availability or pricing of loan\nproducts, particularly during periods\nof economic stress, as well as changes\nrelated to non-U.S. financial\ninstitutions or other competitors that\nare not subject to this accounting\nstandard.\n                                                                                  \n  Strategic                                                                       \n                                                                                  \nIf JPMorgan Chase\u2019s management fails to\ndevelop and execute effective business\nstrategies, and to anticipate changes\naffecting those strategies, JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s competitive standing and\nresults could suffer.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business strategies\nsignificantly affect its competitive\nstanding and operations. These\nstrategies relate to:\n\n\u2022 the products and services that\nJPMorgan Chase offers\n\n\u2022 the geographies in which it operates\n\n\u2022 the types of clients and customers\nthat it serves\n\n\u2022 the counterparties with which it does\nbusiness, and\n\n\u2022 the methods and distribution channels\nby which it offers products and\nservices.\n\nIf management makes choices about these\nstrategies and goals that prove to be\nincorrect, do not accurately assess the\ncompetitive landscape and industry\ntrends, or fail to address changing\nregulatory and market environments or\nthe expectations of clients, customers,\ninvestors, employees and other\nstakeholders, then the franchise values\nand growth prospects of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s businesses may suffer and its\nearnings could decline.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s growth prospects also\ndepend on management\u2019s ability to\ndevelop and execute effective\n      \n  27  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                        \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\nbusiness plans to address these\nstrategic priorities, both in the near\nterm and over longer time horizons.\nManagement\u2019s effectiveness in this\nregard will affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nability to develop and enhance its\nresources, control expenses and return\ncapital to shareholders. Each of these\nobjectives could be adversely affected\nby any failure on the part of\nmanagement to:\n\n\u2022 devise effective business plans and\nstrategies\n\n\u2022 offer products and services that meet\nchanging expectations of clients and\ncustomers\n\n\u2022 allocate capital in a manner that\npromotes long-term stability to enable\nJPMorgan Chase to build and invest in\nmarket-leading businesses, even in a\nhighly stressed environment\n\n\u2022 allocate capital appropriately due to\nimprecise modeling or subjective\njudgments made in connection with those\nallocations\n\n\u2022 appropriately address concerns of\nclients, customers, investors,\nemployees and other stakeholders,\nincluding with respect to social and\nsustainability matters\n\n\u2022 react quickly to changes in market\nconditions or market structures, or\n\n\u2022 develop and enhance the operational,\ntechnology, risk, financial and\nmanagerial resources necessary to grow\nand manage JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses.\n\nJPMorgan Chase faces significant and\nincreasing competition in the rapidly\nevolving financial services industry.\n\nJPMorgan Chase operates in a highly\ncompetitive environment in which it\nmust evolve and adapt to the\nsignificant changes as a result of\nchanges in financial regulation,\ntechnological advances, increased\npublic scrutiny and changes in economic\nconditions. JPMorgan Chase expects that\ncompetition in the U.S. and global\nfinancial services industry will\ncontinue to be intense. Competitors\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 other banks and financial\ninstitutions\n\n\u2022 trading, advisory and investment\nmanagement firms\n\n\u2022 finance companies\n\n\u2022 technology companies, and\n\n\u2022 other nonbank firms that are engaged\nin providing similar products and\nservices.\n\nJPMorgan Chase cannot provide assurance\nthat the significant competition in the\nfinancial services industry will not\nmaterially and adversely affect its\nfuture results of operations.\n\nNew competitors in the financial\nservices industry continue to emerge.\nFor example, technological advances and\nthe growth of e-commerce have made it\npossible for non-depository\ninstitutions to offer products and\nservices that traditionally were\nbanking products. These advances have\n\nalso allowed financial institutions and\nother companies to provide electronic\nand internet-based financial solutions,\nincluding electronic securities\ntrading, payments processing and online\nautomated algorithmic-based investment\nadvice. Furthermore, both financial\ninstitutions and their non-banking\ncompetitors face the risk that payments\nprocessing and other services could be\nsignificantly disrupted by\ntechnologies, such as cryptocurrencies,\nthat require no intermediation. New\ntechnologies have required and could\nrequire JPMorgan Chase to spend more to\nmodify or adapt its products to attract\nand retain clients and customers or to\nmatch products and services offered by\nits competitors, including technology\ncompanies. In addition, new\ntechnologies may be used by customers,\nor breached or infiltrated by third\nparties, in unexpected ways, which can\nincrease JPMorgan Chase\u2019s costs for\ncomplying with laws, rules and\nregulations that apply to the offering\nof products and services through those\ntechnologies and reduce the income that\nJPMorgan Chase earns from providing\nproducts and services through those new\ntechnologies.\n\nOngoing or increased competition may\nput pressure on the pricing for\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s products and services\nor may cause JPMorgan Chase to lose\nmarket share, particularly with respect\nto traditional banking products such as\ndeposits and bank accounts. This\ncompetition may be on the basis of\nquality and variety of products and\nservices offered, transaction\nexecution, innovation, reputation and\nprice. The failure of any of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s businesses to meet the\nexpectations of clients and customers,\nwhether due to general market\nconditions, under-performance, a\ndecision not to offer a particular\nproduct or service, changes in client\nand customer expectations or other\nfactors, could affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nability to attract or retain clients\nand customers. Any such impact could,\nin turn, reduce JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nrevenues. Increased competition also\nmay require JPMorgan Chase to make\nadditional capital investments in its\nbusinesses, or to extend more of its\ncapital on behalf of its clients in\norder to remain competitive.\n\nClimate change manifesting as physical\nor transition risks could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s business operations, clients\nand customers.\n\nJPMorgan Chase operates in many\nregions, countries and communities\naround the world where its businesses,\nand the activities of its clients and\ncustomers, could be impacted by climate\nchange. Climate change could manifest\nas a financial risk to JPMorgan Chase\neither through changes in the physical\nclimate or from the process of\ntransitioning to a low-carbon economy,\nincluding changes in climate policy or\nin the regulation of financial\ninstitutions with respect to risks\nposed by climate change.\n\nClimate-related physical risks include\nboth acute weather events and chronic\nshifts in the climate. Potential\nphysical risks from climate change may\ninclude altered distribution and\nintensity of rainfall, prolonged\ndroughts or flooding, increased\nfrequency of wildfires, rising sea\nlevels, or a rising heat index.\n      \n  28  \n      \nTransition risks arise from the process\nof adjusting to a low-carbon economy.\nIn addition to possible changes in\nclimate policy and financial\nregulation, potential transition risks\nmay include economic and other changes\nengendered by the development of low-\ncarbon technological advances (e.g.,\nelectric vehicles and renewable energy)\nand/or changes in consumer preferences\ntowards low-carbon goods and services.\nTransition risks could be further\naccelerated by the occurrence of\nchanges in the physical climate.\n\nThese climate-related physical risks\nand transition risks could have a\nfinancial impact on JPMorgan Chase both\ndirectly on its business and operations\nand as a result of material adverse\nimpacts to its clients and customers,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 declines in asset values\n\n\u2022 reduced availability of insurance\n\n\u2022 significant interruptions to business\noperations, and\n\n\u2022 negative consequences to business\nmodels, and the need to make changes in\nresponse to those consequences.\n                                                                                  \n  Conduct                                                                         \n                                                                                  \nConduct failure by JPMorgan Chase\nemployees can harm clients and\ncustomers, impact market integrity,\ndamage JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation and\ntrigger litigation and regulatory\naction.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s employees interact\nwith clients, customers and\ncounterparties, and with each other,\nevery day. All employees are expected\nto demonstrate values and exhibit the\nbehaviors that are an integral part of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s How We Do Business\nPrinciples, including JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\ncommitment to \u201cdo first class business\nin a first class way.\u201d JPMorgan Chase\nendeavors to embed conduct risk\nmanagement throughout an employee\u2019s\nlife cycle, including recruiting,\nonboarding, training and development,\nand performance management.

Damage to JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s reputation can therefore cause\nsignificant harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbusiness and prospects, and can arise\nfrom numerous sources, including:\n\n\u2022 employee misconduct, including\ndiscriminatory behavior or harassment\nwith respect to clients, customers or\nemployees, or actions that are contrary\nto JPMorgan Chase\u2019s goal of fostering a\ndiverse and inclusive workplace\n\n\u2022 security breaches, including as a\nresult of cyber attacks\n\n\u2022 failure to safeguard client, customer\nor employee information\n\n\u2022 failure to manage risk issues\nassociated with its business activities\nor those of its clients, including\nfailure to fully discharge publicly-\nannounced commitments to support social\nand sustainability initiatives\n\n\u2022 compliance or operational failures\n\n\u2022 litigation or regulatory fines,\npenalties or other sanctions\n\n\u2022 regulatory investigations or\nenforcement actions, or resolutions of\nthese matters, and\n\n\u2022 failure or perceived failure of\nclients, customers, counterparties or\nother parties to comply with laws,\nrules or regulations, including\ncompanies in which JPMorgan Chase has\nmade principal investments, parties to\njoint ventures with JPMorgan Chase, and\nvendors with which JPMorgan Chase does\nbusiness.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation may be\nsignificantly damaged by adverse\npublicity or negative information\nregarding JPMorgan Chase, whether or\nnot true, that may be published or\nbroadcast by the media or posted on\nsocial media, non-mainstream news\nservices or other parts of the\ninternet. This latter risk can be\nmagnified by the speed and\npervasiveness with which information is\ndisseminated through those channels.\n\nSocial and environmental activists are\nincreasingly targeting financial\nservices firms such as JPMorgan Chase\nwith public criticism for their\nrelationships with clients that are\nengaged in certain sensitive\nindustries, including businesses whose\nproducts are or are perceived to be\nharmful to human health, or whose\nactivities negatively affect or are\nperceived to negatively affect the\nenvironment, workers\u2019 rights or\ncommunities. Activists have also\nengaged in public protests at JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s headquarters and other\nproperties. Activist criticism of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s relationships with\nclients in sensitive industries could\npotentially engender dissatisfaction\namong\n\nclients, customers, investors and\nemployees with how JPMorgan Chase\naddresses social and sustainability\nconcerns in its business activities.\nAlternatively, yielding to activism\ntargeted at certain sensitive\nindustries could damage JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s relationships with clients and\ncustomers, and with governmental or\nregulatory bodies in jurisdictions in\nwhich JPMorgan Chase does business,\nwhose views are not aligned with those\nof social and environmental activists.\nIn either case, the resulting harm to\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation could:\n\n\u2022 cause certain clients and customers\nto cease doing business with JPMorgan\nChase\n\n\u2022 impair JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to\nattract new clients and customers, or\nto expand its relationships with\nexisting clients and customers\n\n\u2022 diminish JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to\nhire or retain employees\n\n\u2022 prompt JPMorgan Chase to cease doing\nbusiness with certain clients or\ncustomers.\n\n\u2022 cause certain investors to divest\nfrom investments in securities of\nJPMorgan Chase, or\n\n\u2022 attract scrutiny from governmental or\nregulatory bodies.\n\nActions by the financial services\nindustry generally or individuals in\nthe industry can also affect JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s reputation. For example, the\nreputation of the industry as a whole\ncan be damaged by concerns that:\n\n\u2022 consumers have been treated unfairly\nby a financial institution,\n\n\u2022 a financial institution has acted\ninappropriately with respect to the\nmethods used to offer products to\ncustomers\n\nIf JPMorgan Chase is perceived to have\nengaged in these types of behaviors,\nthis could weaken its reputation among\nclients or customers.\n\nFailure to effectively manage potential\nconflicts of interest can result in\nlitigation and enforcement actions, as\nwell as damage JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nreputation.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to manage\npotential conflicts of interest is\nhighly complex due to the broad range\nof its business activities which\nencompass a variety of transactions,\nobligations and interests with and\namong JPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients and\ncustomers. JPMorgan Chase can become\nsubject to litigation and enforcement\nactions, and its reputation can be\ndamaged, by the failure or perceived\nfailure to:\n\n\u2022 adequately address or appropriately\ndisclose conflicts of interest,\nincluding potential conflicts of\ninterest that may arise in connection\nwith providing multiple products and\nservices in, or having one or more\ninvestments related to, the same\ntransaction\n\n\u2022 deliver appropriate standards of\nservice and quality\n      \n  30  \n      \n\u2022 treat clients and customers with the\nappropriate standard of care\n\n\u2022 use client and customer data\nresponsibly and in a manner that meets\nlegal requirements and regulatory\nexpectations\n\n\u2022 provide fiduciary products or\nservices in accordance with the\napplicable legal and regulatory\nstandards, or\n\n\u2022 handle or use confidential\ninformation of customers or clients\nappropriately or in compliance with\napplicable data protection and privacy\nlaws, rules and regulations.\n\nA failure or perceived failure to\nappropriately address conflicts of\ninterest or fiduciary obligations could\nresult in customer dissatisfaction,\nlitigation and regulatory fines,\npenalties or other sanctions, and\nheightened regulatory scrutiny and\nenforcement actions, all of which can\nlead to lost revenue and higher\noperating costs and cause serious harm\nto JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\n                                                                                  \n  Country                                                                         \n                                                                                  \nAn outbreak of hostilities between\ncountries or within a country or region\ncould have a material adverse effect on\nthe global economy and on JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s businesses within the affected\nregion or globally.\n\nAggressive actions by hostile\ngovernments or groups, including armed\nconflict or intensified cyber attacks,\ncould expand in unpredictable ways by\ndrawing in other countries or\nescalating into full-scale war with\npotentially catastrophic consequences,\nparticularly if one or more of the\ncombatants possess nuclear weapons.\nDepending on the scope of the conflict,\nthe hostilities could result in:\n\n\u2022 worldwide economic disruption\n\n\u2022 heightened volatility in financial\nmarkets\n\n\u2022 severe declines in asset values,\naccompanied by widespread sell-offs of\ninvestments\n\n\u2022 substantial depreciation of local\ncurrencies, potentially leading to\ndefaults by borrowers and\ncounterparties in the affected region\n\n\u2022 disruption of global trade, and\n\n\u2022 diminished consumer, business and\ninvestor confidence.\n\nAny of the above consequences could\nhave significant negative effects on\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations and\nearnings, both in the countries or\nregions directly affected by the\nhostilities or globally. Further, if\nthe U.S. were to become directly\ninvolved in such a conflict, this could\nlead to a curtailment of any operations\nthat JPMorgan Chase may have in the\naffected countries or region, as well\nas in any nation that is aligned\nagainst the U.S. in the hostilities.\nJPMorgan Chase could also experience\nmore numerous and aggressive cyber\nattacks launched by or under the\nsponsorship of one or more of the\nadversaries in such a conflict.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business and\noperations in certain countries can be\nadversely affected by local economic,\npolitical, regulatory and social\nfactors.\n\nSome of the countries in which JPMorgan\nChase conducts business have economies\nor markets that are less developed and\nmore volatile or may have political,\nlegal and regulatory regimes that are\nless established or predictable than\nother countries in which JPMorgan Chase\noperates. In addition, in some\njurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase\nconducts business, the local economy\nand business activity are subject to\nsubstantial government influence or\ncontrol. Some of these countries have\nin the past experienced economic\ndisruptions, including:\n\n\u2022 extreme currency fluctuations\n\n\u2022 high inflation\n\n\u2022 low or negative growth, and\n\n\u2022 defaults or reduced ability to\nservice sovereign debt.\n\nThe governments in these countries have\nsometimes reacted to these developments\nby imposing restrictive policies that\nadversely affect the local and regional\nbusiness environment, including:\n\n\u2022 price, capital or exchange controls,\nincluding imposition of punitive\ntransfer and convertibility\nrestrictions or forced currency\nexchange\n\n\u2022 expropriation or nationalization of\nassets or confiscation of property,\nincluding intellectual property, and\n\n\u2022 changes in laws, rules and\nregulations.\n\nThe impact of these actions could be\naccentuated in trading markets that are\nsmaller, less liquid and more volatile\nthan more-developed markets. These\ntypes of government actions can\nnegatively affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\noperations in the relevant country,\neither directly or by suppressing the\nbusiness activities of local clients or\nmulti-national clients that conduct\nbusiness in the jurisdiction.\n\nIn addition, emerging markets\ncountries, as well as certain more\ndeveloped countries, have been\nsusceptible to unfavorable social\ndevelopments arising from poor economic\nconditions or governmental actions,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 widespread demonstrations or civil\nunrest\n\n\u2022 general strikes and demonstrations\n\n\u2022 crime and corruption\n\n\u2022 security and personal safety issues\n\n\u2022 outbreaks of hostilities\n\n\u2022 overthrow of incumbent governments\n\n\u2022 terrorist attacks, and\n\n\u2022 other forms of internal discord.\n\nThese economic, political, regulatory\nand social developments have in the\npast resulted in, and in the future\n      \n  31  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                        \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\ncould lead to, conditions that can\nadversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\noperations in those countries and\nimpair the revenues, growth and\nprofitability of those operations. In\naddition, any of these events or\ncircumstances in one country can affect\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations and\ninvestments in another country or\ncountries, including in the U.S.\n                                                                                  \n  People                                                                          \n                                                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to attract and\nretain qualified and diverse employees\nis critical to its success.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s employees are its most\nimportant resource, and in many areas\nof the financial services industry,\ncompetition for qualified personnel is\nintense. JPMorgan Chase endeavors to\nattract talented and diverse new\nemployees and retain, develop and\nmotivate its existing employees. If\nJPMorgan Chase were unable to continue\nto attract or retain qualified and\ndiverse employees, including successors\nto the Chief Executive Officer or\nmembers of the Operating Committee,\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s performance, including\nits competitive position, could be\nmaterially and adversely affected.\n\nUnfavorable changes in immigration or\ntravel policies could adversely affect\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses and\noperations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase relies on the skills,\nknowledge and expertise of employees\nlocated throughout the world. Changes\nin immigration or travel policies in\nthe U.S. and other countries that\nunduly restrict or otherwise make it\nmore difficult for employees or their\nfamily members to work in, or travel to\nor transfer between, jurisdictions in\nwhich JPMorgan Chase has operations or\nconducts its business could inhibit\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to attract and\nretain qualified employees, and thereby\ndilute the quality of its workforce, or\ncould prompt JPMorgan Chase to make\nstructural changes to its worldwide or\nregional operating models that cause\nits operations to be less efficient or\nmore costly.\n                                                                                  \n  Legal                                                                           \n                                                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase faces significant legal\nrisks from litigation and formal and\ninformal regulatory and government\ninvestigations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant\nor is otherwise involved in many legal\nproceedings, including class actions\nand other litigation or disputes with\nthird parties. Actions currently\npending against JPMorgan Chase may\nresult in judgments, settlements,\nfines, penalties or other sanctions\nadverse to JPMorgan Chase. Any of these\nmatters could materially and adversely\naffect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business,\nfinancial condition or results of\noperations, or cause serious\nreputational harm. As a participant in\nthe financial services industry, it is\nlikely that JPMorgan Chase will\ncontinue to experience a high level of\nlitigation and regulatory and\ngovernment investigations related to\nits businesses and operations.\n\nRegulators and other government\nagencies conduct examinations of\nJPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries\nboth on a routine basis and in targeted\nexams, and JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses\nand operations are subject to\nheightened regulatory oversight. This\nheightened regulatory scrutiny, or the\nresults of such an investigation or\nexamination, may lead to additional\nregulatory investigations or\nenforcement actions. There is no\nassurance that those actions will not\nresult in resolutions or other\nenforcement actions against JPMorgan\nChase. Furthermore, a single event\ninvolving a potential violation of law\nor regulation may give rise to numerous\nand overlapping investigations and\nproceedings, either by multiple\nfederal, state or local agencies and\nofficials in the U.S. or, in some\ninstances, regulators and other\ngovernmental officials in non-U.S.\njurisdictions.\n\nIf another financial institution\nviolates a law or regulation relating\nto a particular business activity or\npractice, this will often give rise to\nan investigation by regulators and\nother governmental agencies of the same\nor similar activity or practice by\nJPMorgan Chase.\n\nThese and other initiatives by U.S. and\nnon-U.S. governmental authorities may\nsubject JPMorgan Chase to judgments,\nsettlements, fines, penalties or other\nsanctions, and may require JPMorgan\nChase to restructure its operations and\nactivities or to cease offering certain\nproducts or services. All of these\npotential outcomes could harm JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s reputation or lead to higher\noperational costs, thereby reducing\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s profitability, or\nresult in collateral consequences. In\naddition, the extent of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s exposure to legal and\nregulatory matters can be unpredictable\nand could, in some cases, exceed the\namount of reserves that JPMorgan Chase\nhas established for those matters.\n      \n  32  \n      \n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                                                                \u2502\n\u2502  Item 1B.

Refer to\n\u201cManagement\u2019s report on internal\ncontrol over financial reporting\u201d on\npage 158.\n\nAs of the end of the period covered by\nthis report, an evaluation was carried\nout under the supervision and with the\nparticipation of the Firm\u2019s management,\nincluding its Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer and its Chief\nFinancial Officer, of the effectiveness\nof its disclosure controls and\nprocedures (as defined in Rule\n13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934). Based on that evaluation,\nthe Chairman and Chief Executive\nOfficer and the Chief Financial Officer\nconcluded that these disclosure\ncontrols and procedures were effective.\nRefer to Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for the\nCertifications furnished by the\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\nand Chief Financial Officer,\nrespectively.\n\nThe Firm is committed to maintaining\nhigh standards of internal control over\nfinancial reporting. Nevertheless,\nbecause of its inherent limitations,\ninternal control over financial\nreporting may not prevent or detect all\nmisstatements.

Refer to Regulatory Developments relating\nto the COVID-19 Pandemic on pages 52-53 and Capital Risk Management on pages\n91-101 for additional information. Comparisons noted in the sections below are for\nthe full year of 2020 versus the full year of 2019, unless otherwise specified.\nFirmwide overview JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $29.1 billion for 2020, or\n$8.88 per share, on net revenue of $119.5 billion. The Firm reported ROE of 12%\nand ROTCE of 14%. The Firm's results for 2020 included net additions to the\nallowance for credit losses of $12.2 billion and Firmwide legal expense of $1.1\nbillion. \u2022 The Firm had net income of $29.1 billion, down 20%. \u2022 Total net revenue\nwas up 4%. Noninterest revenue was $65.0 billion, up 12%, driven by higher CIB\nMarkets revenue, Investment Banking fees and net production revenue in Home\nLending. Net interest income was $54.6 billion, down 5%, driven by the impact of\nlower rates,\n\npredominantly offset by higher net interest income in CIB Markets as well as\nbalance sheet growth. \u2022 Noninterest expense was $66.7 billion, up 2%, driven by\nhigher volume- and revenue-related expense, legal expense and continued\ninvestments in the businesses, partially offset by lower structural expense. \u2022 The\nprovision for credit losses was $17.5 billion, up $11.9 billion from the prior\nyear, driven by net additions to the allowance for credit losses of $12.2 billion\ndue to the deterioration and increased uncertainty in the macroeconomic\nenvironment as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2022 The total\nallowance for credit losses was $30.8 billion at December 31, 2020. The Firm had\nan allowance for loan losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 2.95%, compared\nwith 1.39% in the prior year; the increase from the prior year was driven by the\nadditions to the allowance for credit losses and the adoption of CECL. \u2022 The\nFirm\u2019s nonperforming assets totaled $10.9 billion at December 31, 2020, an\nincrease of $5.9 billion from the prior year, primarily reflecting client credit\ndeterioration across multiple industries in the wholesale portfolio; and in the\nconsumer portfolio, loans placed on nonaccrual status related to the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, as well as the adoption of CECL, as the purchased credit\ndeteriorated loans in the mortgage portfolio became subject to nonaccrual loan\ntreatment. In the fourth quarter of 2020, nonperforming assets decreased $556\nmillion from the prior quarter, reflecting some credit improvement in the\nwholesale portfolio. The consumer portfolio remained relatively flat, as the\nincrease in loans placed on nonaccrual status in Home Lending related to the\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic was predominantly offset by lower loans at fair\nvalue in CIB, largely due to sales. \u2022 Firmwide average loans of $1.0 trillion were\nup 1%, driven by higher loan balances in AWM and CIB, as well as loans originated\nunder the Small Business Administration\u2019s (\u201cSBA\u201d) Paycheck Protection Program\n(\u201cPPP\u201d), predominantly offset by lower loan balances in Home Lending and Card. \u2022\nFirmwide average deposits of $1.9 trillion were up 25%, reflecting significant\ninflows across the Firm, primarily driven by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\nand the related effect of certain government actions. \u2022 As of December 31, 2020,\nthe Firm had average eligible High Quality Liquid Assets (\u201cHQLA\u201d) of approximately\n$697 billion and unencumbered marketable securities with a fair value of\napproximately $740 billion, resulting in approximately $1.4 trillion of liquidity\nsources.

The SLR reflects the temporary\nexclusions of U.S. Treasury securities\nand deposits at Federal Reserve Banks,\nas required by the Federal Reserve\u2019s\ninterim final rule issued on April 1,\n2020. The Firm\u2019s SLR excluding the\ntemporary relief was 5.8%. \u2022 The Firm\ngrew TBVPS, ending 2020 at $66.11, up\n8% versus the prior year. Pre-provision\nprofit, ROTCE and TBVPS are non-GAAP\nfinancial measures.

The Firm also provided additional\nbenefits to employees during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSupporting communities\n\nSince March, the Firm has committed\n$250 million to help address\nhumanitarian needs and long-term\neconomic challenges posed by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic on the communities in\nwhich the Firm operates.

The\nU.K. and the EU have entered into a\nTrade and Cooperation Agreement which\ndelineates many significant aspects of\nthe future relationship between the\nU.K. and the EU. However, the agreement\ncontained very limited provisions\nrelating to cross-border financial\nservices, and the U.K. and the EU are\nexpected to engage in further\nnegotiations concerning financial\nservices.\n\nThe Firm has executed and continues to\nexecute on its Firmwide Brexit\nImplementation program, which\nencompasses a strategic implementation\nplan across all impacted businesses and\nfunctions, including an ongoing\nassessment of political, legal and\nregulatory and other implementation\nrisks. A key focus of the program has\nbeen to ensure continuity of service to\nthe Firm\u2019s EU clients in the following\nareas: regulatory and legal entities;\nclients; and business and operations.\n\nRegulatory and legal entities\n\nThe Firm\u2019s legal entities in Germany,\nLuxembourg and Ireland are now licensed\nto provide and are providing services\nto the Firm\u2019s EU clients, including\nthrough a branch network covering\nlocations such as Paris, Madrid and\nMilan. Subject to limited exceptions,\nthe Firm\u2019s U.K.-based legal entities\nare no longer permitted to transact\nbusiness from the U.K. with EU clients.\n\nClients\n\nAgreements covering substantially all\nof the Firm\u2019s EU client activity have\nbeen re-documented to EU legal entities\nto facilitate continuation of service.\nThe Firm continues to actively engage\nwith those clients that have not\ncompleted re-documentation or required\noperational changes.\n\nBusiness and operations\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic introduced\nadditional risk to the Firm\u2019s Brexit\nImplementation program, particularly in\nrelation to staff relocations. As a\nresult, the Firm has worked closely\nwith regulators and employees to ensure\nthat critical staff are relocated in a\nsafe and timely manner so that the Firm\ncan meet its regulatory commitments and\ncontinue serving its clients. Further\nrelocations are planned for 2021, and\nthe Firm\u2019s longer-term EU staffing\nstrategy will be developed over time in\ncooperation with its regulators and as\nthe post-Brexit market landscape\nevolves in order to ensure that the\nFirm maintains operational resilience\nand effective client coverage.\n                                             \n  50    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                             \n                                                                                  \n  Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cIBOR\u201d) transition                                      \n                                                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase and other market\nparticipants continue to make progress\nin preparing for the discontinuation of\nthe London Interbank Offered Rate\n(\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and other IBORs to comply\nwith the International Organization of\nSecurities Commission\u2019s standards for\ntransaction-based benchmark rates.\n\nOn November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark\nAdministration, the administrator of\nLIBOR, announced a public consultation\non its proposal to cease the\npublication of the principal tenors of\nU.S. dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight,\none-month, three-month, six-month and\n12-month LIBOR) immediately following a\nfinal publication on June 30, 2023. The\nFederal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC\nalso released guidance encouraging\nmarket participants to cease dealing in\nnew U.S. dollar LIBOR contracts from\nthe end of 2021. There has been no\nchange in the scheduled cessation of\nU.K. sterling, Japanese yen, Swiss\nfranc and Euro LIBOR, or the remaining\ntenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR, from\nDecember 31, 2021.\n\nThe Firm continues to work towards\nreducing its exposure to IBOR-\nreferencing contracts, including\nderivatives, bilateral and syndicated\nloans, securities, and debt and\npreferred stock issuances, to meet the\nindustry milestones and recommendations\npublished by National Working Groups\n(\u201cNWG\u201d), including the Alternative\nReference Rates Committee (the \u201cARRC\u201d)\nin the U.S.\n\nOn October 23, 2020, the International\nSwaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.\n(\u201cISDA\u201d) published a new supplement to\nthe ISDA 2006 definitions and the\nrelated 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol\n(the \u201cProtocol\u201d). These publications\nare intended to facilitate the\nincorporation of robust rate fallback\nprovisions into both legacy and new\nderivative contracts with effect from\nJanuary 25, 2021. The Firm\u2019s client-\nfacing legal entities have agreed to\nadhere to the Protocol, in accordance\nwith recommendations from multiple\nindustry working groups, including the\nARRC. ISDA further announced that\nbilateral templates have been made\navailable for use with counterparties\nwho choose not to adhere to the\nProtocol.\n\nAs a key objective of the ARRC\u2019s\ntransition plan to encourage adoption\nof the Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n(\u201cSOFR\u201d), counterparty clearing houses,\nclearing house members and other\nimpacted market participants\nsuccessfully executed the discounting\nand price alignment interest (\u201cPAI\u201d)\nswitch from federal funds to SOFR on\nOctober 16, 2020. The industry\ncompleted a similar switch from EONIA\nto \u20acSTR on July 27, 2020.\n\nOn March 12, 2020 and January 7, 2021,\nthe Financial Accounting Standards\nBoard (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued accounting\nstandards updates providing optional\nexpedients and exceptions for applying\ngenerally accepted accounting\nprinciples to contracts and hedge\naccounting relationships affected by\nreference rate reform. These optional\nexpedients are intended to simplify the\noperational impact of applying U.S.\nGAAP to transactions impacted by\nreference rate reform. The Firm elected\nto apply certain of these expedients\nbeginning in the third quarter of 2020.\nOn\n\nAugust 27, 2020, the International\nAccounting Standards Board (\u201cIASB\u201d)\nissued guidance that provides similar\nrelief for entities reporting under\nInternational Financial Reporting\nStandards (\"IFRS\").

On\nMarch 17, 2020, the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d),\nthe Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System (\u201cFederal Reserve\u201d), and\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d), collectively the\n\u201cfederal banking agencies,\u201d issued an\ninterim final rule (issued as final on\nAugust 26, 2020) that revised the\ndefinition of \u201celigible retained\nincome\u201d in the regulatory capital rules\nthat apply to all U.S. banking\norganizations. On March 23, 2020, the\nFederal Reserve issued an interim final\nrule (issued as final on August 26,\n2020) that revised the definition of\n\u201celigible retained income\u201d for purposes\nof the total loss-absorbing capacity\n(\u201cTLAC\u201d) buffer requirements that apply\nto global systemically important\nbanking organizations. The revised\ndefinition of eligible retained income\nmakes any automatic limitations on\npayout distributions that could apply\nunder the agencies\u2019 capital rules or\nTLAC rule take effect on a more\ngraduated basis in the event that a\nbanking organization\u2019s capital,\nleverage and TLAC ratios were to\ndecline below regulatory requirements\n(including buffers). The March 17, 2020\ninterim final rule was issued, in\nconjunction with an interagency\nstatement encouraging banking\norganizations to use their capital and\nliquidity buffers, to further support\nbanking organizations\u2019 abilities to\nlend to households and businesses\naffected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nReserve requirements . On March 24,\n2020, the Federal Reserve issued an\ninterim final rule (issued as final on\nDecember 22, 2020) reducing reserve\nrequirement ratios for all depository\ninstitutions to zero percent, effective\nMarch 26, 2020, an action intended to\nfree up liquidity in the banking system\nto support lending to households and\nbusinesses.\n\nRefer to Note 26 for additional\ninformation on the reduction to the\nreserve requirement.\n\nRegulatory Capital - Current Expected\nCredit Losses (\u201cCECL\u201d) transition delay\n. On March 31, 2020, the federal\nbanking agencies issued an interim\nfinal rule (issued as final on August\n26, 2020) that provided banking\norganizations with the option to delay\nthe effects of CECL on regulatory\ncapital for two years, followed by a\nthree-year transition period (\u201cCECL\ncapital transition provisions\u201d). The\nFirm elected to apply the CECL capital\ntransition provisions.\n\nSupplementary leverage ratio (\u201cSLR\u201d)\ntemporary revision . On April 1, 2020,\nthe Federal Reserve issued an interim\nfinal rule that requires, on a\ntemporary basis, the calculation of\ntotal leverage exposure for purposes of\ncalculating the SLR for bank holding\ncompanies (\u201cBHC\u201d), to exclude the on-\nbalance sheet amounts of U.S. Treasury\nsecurities and deposits at Federal\nReserve Banks. These exclusions became\neffective April 1, 2020, and will\nremain in effect through March 31,\n2021.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on\npages 91-101 and Note 27 for additional\ninformation on the CECL capital\ntransition provisions, the impact to\nthe Firm\u2019s capital metrics and the\nFirm\u2019s SLR.\n\nLoan modifications. On April 7, 2020,\nthe federal banking agencies along with\nthe National Credit Union\nAdministration, and the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau, in\nconsultation with the state financial\nregulators, issued an interagency\nstatement revising a March 22, 2020\ninteragency statement on loan\nmodifications and the reporting for\nfinancial institutions working with\ncustomers affected by the COVID-19\npandemic (the \u201cIA Statement\u201d). The IA\nStatement reconfirmed that efforts to\nwork with borrowers where the loans are\nprudently underwritten, and not\nconsidered past due or carried on\nnonaccrual status, should not result in\nthe loans automatically being\nconsidered modified in a troubled debt\nrestructuring (\u201cTDR\u201d) for accounting\nand financial reporting purposes, or\nfor purposes of their respective risk-\nbased capital rules, which would\notherwise require financial\ninstitutions subject to the capital\nrules to hold more capital. The IA\nStatement also clarified the\ninteraction between its previous\nguidance and Section 4013 of the CARES\nAct, as extended by Section 541 of the\nConsolidated Appropriations Act, which\nprovides certain financial institutions\nwith the option to suspend the\napplication of accounting guidance for\nTDRs for a limited period of time for\nloan modifications made to address the\neffects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Firm has granted various forms of\nassistance to customers and clients\nimpacted by the COVID-19 pandemic,\nincluding payment deferrals and\ncovenant modifications. The majority of\nthe Firm\u2019s COVID-19 related loan\nmodifications have not been considered\nTDRs because:\n\n\u2022 they represent short-term or other\ninsignificant modifications, whether\nunder the Firm\u2019s regular loan\nmodification assessments or the IA\nStatement guidance, or\n\n\u2022 the Firm has elected to apply the\noption to suspend the application of\naccounting guidance for TDRs as\nprovided by\n                                             \n  52    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                             \nthe CARES Act and extended by the\nConsolidated Appropriations Act.\n\nTo the extent that certain\nmodifications do not meet any of the\nabove criteria, the Firm accounts for\nthem as TDRs. Refer to Credit Portfolio\non pages 112-113 and Note 12 for\nadditional information on the Firm\u2019s\nloan modification activities.\n\nPPP . Beginning April 3, 2020, the PPP,\nestablished by the CARES Act and\nadministered by the SBA, authorized\neligible lenders to provide nonrecourse\nloans to eligible borrowers until\nAugust 8, 2020 to provide an incentive\nfor these businesses to keep their\nworkers on their payroll. As part of\nthe Consolidated Appropriations Act,\nadditional funding was provided for new\nPPP loans beginning in early January\n2021. This program was designed to\ntarget smaller businesses as well as to\nsimplify the loan forgiveness process\nfor loans under $150,000. As of\nFebruary 19, 2021, the Firm has funded\napproximately $5 billion under this\nextension of the program.\n\nU.S. government facilities .

The increased activity resulted in part from clients seeking liquidity in\nthe first half of the year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to CIB\nsegment results on pages 71\u201376 and Note 6 for additional information.\n\nPrincipal transactions revenue increased, predominantly in CIB, reflecting higher\nrevenue in Fixed Income Markets, driven by strong performance in Currencies &\nEmerging Markets, Rates, and Credit. The increase in principal transactions\nrevenue also reflected higher net valuations on several legacy equity investments\nin Corporate, compared with net losses in the prior year. Principal transactions\nrevenue in CIB may in certain cases have offsets across other revenue lines,\nincluding net interest income. The Firm assesses the performance of its CIB\nMarkets business on a total revenue basis. Refer to CIB and Corporate segment\nresults on pages 71\u201376 and pages 83\u201384, respectively, and Note 6 for additional\ninformation. Lending- and deposit-related fees decreased as a result of lower\ndeposit-related fees in CCB, reflecting lower transaction activity and the impact\nof fee refunds related to the COVID-19 pandemic , predominantly offset by higher\ncash management fees in CIB and CB, as well as higher lending-related fees,\nparticularly loan commitment fees in CIB. Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment results\non pages 67\u201370, pages 71\u201376 and pages 77\u201379, respectively, and Note 6 for\nadditional information. Asset management, administration and commissions revenue\nincreased driven by: \u2022 higher asset management fees in AWM as a result of net\ninflows into liquidity and long term products, and higher performance fees; and in\nCCB related to a higher level of investment assets \u2022 higher brokerage commissions\nin CIB and AWM on higher client-driven volume, partially offset by \u2022 lower volume\nof annuity sales in CCB. Refer to CCB, CIB and AWM segment results on pages 67\u201370,\npages 71\u201376 and pages 80\u201382, respectively, and Note 6 for additional information.\nInvestment securities gains/(losses) increased due to the repositioning of the\ninvestment securities portfolio, including sales of U.S. GSE and government agency\nmortgage-backed securities, particularly in the first and third quarters of 2020 .\nRefer to Corporate segment results on pages 83\u201384 and Note 10 for additional\ninformation. Mortgage fees and related income increased due to higher net mortgage\nproduction revenue reflecting higher mortgage production volumes and margins; the\nprior year included gains on sales of certain loans. Refer to CCB segment results\non pages 67\u201370, Note 6 and 15 for further information.\n                                             \n  54    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                             \nCard income decreased due to: \u2022 lower net interchange income reflecting lower\ncredit card sales volumes and debit card transactions as a result of the impact of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, largely offset by lower acquisition costs and higher annual\nfees in CCB, and \u2022 lower merchant processing fees in CIB predominantly driven by a\nreporting reclassification of certain expenses to be a reduction of revenue in\nMerchant Services. Refer to CCB and CIB seg ment results on pages 67\u201370 and pages\n71\u201376, respectively, and Note 6 for further information. Other income decreased\nreflecting: \u2022 Increased amortization on higher levels of alternative energy\ninvestments in CIB. The increased amortization was more than offset by lower\nincome tax expense from the associated tax credits \u2022 lower net valuation gains on\ncertain investments in AWM \u2022 net losses on certain equity investments in CIB,\ncompared with net gains in the prior year \u2022 higher costs associated with using\nforward contracts to hedge certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated net investment\nexposures, and \u2022 higher losses related to the early termination of certain of the\nFirm's long-term debt in Treasury and CIO, partially offset by \u2022 a net increase\nfrom a gain on an equity investment. Net interest income decreased due to the\nimpact of lower rates, predominantly offset by higher net interest income in CIB\nMarkets, as well as balance sheet growth. The Firm\u2019s average interest-earning\nassets were $2.8 trillion, up $434 billion, and the yield was 2.34%, down 127\nbasis points (\u201cbps\u201d), primarily due to lower rates. The net yield on these assets,\non an FTE basis, was 1.98%, a decrease of 48 bps. The net yield excluding CIB\nMarkets was 2.30%, down 97 bps. Net yield excluding CIB Markets is a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure.

Prior-period amounts\nhave been revised to conform with the\ncurrent presentation. Refer to Note 1\nfor further information. 2020 compared\nwith 2019 The provision for credit\nlosses increased in consumer and\nwholesale primarily driven by the\ndeterioration and uncertainty in the\nmacroeconomic environment, in\nparticular in the first half of 2020,\nas a result of the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. The increase in\nconsumer reflected: \u2022 net additions of\n$7.4 billion to the allowance for\ncredit losses, consisting of $6.6\nbillion for Card, $520 million for\nAuto, $252 million for Business\nBanking, partially offset by \u2022 lower\nnet charge-offs largely in Card,\nreflecting lower charge-offs and higher\nrecoveries, primarily benefiting from\npayment assistance and government\nstimulus. The prior year included a\n$244 million net reduction in the\nallowance for credit losses.

The Firm believes that cash flows\nfrom operations, available cash and other liquidity sources, and its capacity to\ngenerate cash through secured and unsecured sources, are sufficient to meet its\noperating liquidity needs. \u2022 In 2020, cash used primarily reflected higher trading\nassets, other assets, and securities borrowed, partially offset by higher trading\nliabilities and net income excluding noncash adjustments. \u2022 In 2019, cash provided\nprimarily reflected net income excluding noncash adjustments, lower trading\nassets, and net proceeds of sales, securitizations, and paydowns of loans held-\nfor-sale, partially offset by higher securities borrowed, an increase in other\nassets and a decrease in trading liabilities.\n\nInvesting activities The Firm\u2019s investing activities predominantly include\noriginating held-for-investment loans and investing in the investment securities\nportfolio, and other short-term instruments. \u2022 In 2020, cash used primarily\nreflected net purchases of investment securities, higher net originations of\nloans, and higher securities purchased under resale agreements. \u2022 In 2019, cash\nused reflected net purchases of investment securities, partially offset by lower\nsecurities purchased under resale agreements, and net proceeds from sales and\nsecuritizations of loans held-for-investment. Financing activities The Firm\u2019s\nfinancing activities include acquiring customer deposits and issuing long-term\ndebt, as well as preferred stock. \u2022 In 2020, cash provided reflected higher\ndeposits and an increase in securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements,\npartially offset by net payments of long-term borrowings. \u2022 In 2019, cash provided\nreflected higher deposits, partially offset by a decrease in short-term borrowings\nand net payments of long-term borrowings. \u2022 For both periods, cash was used for\nrepurchases of common stock and cash dividends on common and preferred stock. On\nMarch 15, 2020, in response to the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19\npandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended repurchases of its common stock.\nSubsequently, the Federal Reserve directed all large banks, including the Firm, to\ndiscontinue net share repurchases through the end of 2020. * * * Refer to\nConsolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 57-58, Capital Risk Management on\npages 91-101, and Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102\u2013108 for a further\ndiscussion of the activities affecting the Firm\u2019s cash flows.\n                                             \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    59  \n                                             \n                                                                                  \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                  \n  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL  \n  CASH OBLIGATIONS                                \n                                                  \nIn the normal course of business, the\nFirm enters into various off-balance\nsheet arrangements and contractual\nobligations that may require future\ncash payments.

Consistent with this\npolicy, no JPMorgan Chase employee is\npermitted to invest in SPEs with which\nthe Firm is involved where such\ninvestment would violate the Firm\u2019s\nCode of Conduct.\n\nThe table below provides an index of\nwhere in this 2020 Form 10-K\ndiscussions of the Firm\u2019s various off-\nbalance sheet arrangements can be\nfound.

The\nFirm also reviews the results of the\nLOBs on a managed basis. The Firm\u2019s\ndefinition of managed basis starts, in\neach case, with the reported U.S. GAAP\nresults and includes certain\nreclassifications to present total net\nrevenue for the Firm (and each of the\nreportable business segments) on an FTE\nbasis. Accordingly, revenue from\ninvestments that receive tax credits\nand tax-exempt securities is presented\nin the managed results on a basis\ncomparable to taxable investments and\nsecurities. These financial measures\nallow\n\nmanagement to assess the comparability\nof revenue from year-to-year arising\nfrom both taxable and tax-exempt\nsources.

Morgan Wealth Management\nbusiness unit within CCB. Prior-period\namounts have been revised to conform\nwith the current presentation,\nincluding the transfer of approximately\n1,650 technology and support staff\nduring the second and third quarters of\n2020. Ultra-high-net-worth and certain\nhigh-net-worth client relationships\nremained in AWM.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the Firm\nbegan reporting a Wholesale Payments\nbusiness unit within CIB following a\nrealignment of the Firm\u2019s wholesale\npayments businesses. The Wholesale\nPayments business comprises:\n\n\u2022 Merchant Services, which was\nrealigned from CCB to CIB\n\n\u2022 Treasury Services and Trade Finance\nin CIB. Trade Finance was previously\nreported in Lending in CIB.\n\nIn connection with the alignment of\nWholesale Payments, the assets,\nliabilities and headcount associated\nwith the Merchant Services business\nwere realigned to CIB from CCB, and the\nrevenue and expenses of the Merchant\nServices business are reported across\nCCB, CIB and CB based primarily on\nclient relationships. In the fourth\nquarter of 2020, payment processing-\nonly clients along with the associated\nrevenue and expenses were realigned to\nCIB\u2019s Wholesale Payments business from\nCCB and CB. Payment processing-only\nclients are those that only use payment\nservices offered by Merchant Services,\nand in general do not currently utilize\nother services offered by the Firm.\nPrior-period amounts have been revised\n\nto reflect this realignment and revised\nallocation methodology.\n\nDescription of business segment\nreporting methodology\n\nResults of the business segments are\nintended to present each segment as if\nit were a stand-alone business. The\nmanagement reporting process that\nderives business segment results\nincludes the allocation of certain\nincome and expense items. The Firm also\nassesses the level of capital required\nfor each LOB on at least an annual\nbasis. The Firm periodically assesses\nthe assumptions, methodologies and\nreporting classifications used for\nsegment reporting, and further\nrefinements may be implemented in\nfuture periods.\n\nRevenue sharing\n\nWhen business segments join efforts to\nsell products and services to the\nFirm\u2019s clients, the participating\nbusiness segments may agree to share\nrevenue from those transactions.\nRevenue is generally recognized in the\nsegment responsible for the related\nproduct or service, with allocations to\nthe other segment(s) involved in the\ntransaction. The segment results\nreflect these revenue-sharing\nagreements.\n\nExpense Allocation\n\nWhere business segments use services\nprovided by corporate support units, or\nanother business segment, the costs of\nthose services are allocated to the\nrespective business segments. The\nexpense is generally allocated based on\nthe actual cost and use of services\nprovided. In contrast, certain costs\nand investments related to corporate\nsupport units, technology and\noperations not currently utilized by\nany LOB, are not\n                                             \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    65  \n                                             \n                                                                                  \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                            \n                                                                                  \nallocated to the business segments and\nare retained in Corporate. Expense\nretained in Corporate generally\nincludes parent company costs that\nwould not be incurred if the segments\nwere stand-alone businesses; and other\nitems not aligned with a particular\nbusiness segment.\n\nFunds transfer pricing\n\nFunds transfer pricing is the process\nby which the Firm allocates interest\nincome and expense to each business\nsegment and transfers the primary\ninterest rate risk and liquidity risk\nexposures to Treasury and CIO within\nCorporate. The funds transfer pricing\nprocess considers the interest rate\nrisk, liquidity risk and regulatory\nrequirements on a product-by-product\nbasis within each business segment.\n\nDebt expense and preferred stock\ndividend allocation\n\nAs part of the funds transfer pricing\nprocess, almost all of the cost of the\ncredit spread component of outstanding\nunsecured long-term debt and preferred\nstock dividends is allocated to the\nreportable business segments, while the\nbalance of the cost is retained in\nCorporate. The methodology to allocate\nthe\n\ncost of unsecured long-term debt and\npreferred stock dividends to the\nbusiness segments is aligned with the\nFirm\u2019s process to allocate capital. The\nallocated cost of unsecured long-term\ndebt is included in a business\nsegment\u2019s net interest income, and net\nincome is reduced by preferred stock\ndividends to arrive at a business\nsegment\u2019s net income applicable to\ncommon equity.\n\nBusiness segment capital allocation\n\nThe amount of capital assigned to each\nbusiness is referred to as equity. As\nof January 1, 2021, the Firm has\nchanged its line of business capital\nallocations primarily as a result of\nchanges in exposures for each LOB and\nan increase in the relative risk\nweighting toward Standardized RWA. The\nassumptions and methodologies used to\nallocate capital are periodically\nassessed and as a result, the capital\nallocated to the LOBs may change from\ntime to time.\n\nRefer to Line of business equity on\npage 98 for additional information on\nbusiness segment capital allocation.\n                                                                                  \n   Segment Results \u2013 Managed Basis                                                \n                                                                                  \nThe following tables summarize the Firm\u2019s results by segment for the periods\nindicated.\n                                                                                  \n         \u2026                          \u2026                                             \n         &                          &                         \u2026                   \n         \u2026                          \u2026                         \u2026                   \n         \u2026  \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026  \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2026              \u2026    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $     \u2026  $    \u2026  $    \u2026    $  \u2026     $    \u2026  $    \u2026      \u2026    $    \u2026         \n            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026          \u2026       \u2026      \u2026         \u2026         \n            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026          \u2026       \u2026      \u2026         \u2026         \n            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026          \u2026       \u2026      \u2026         \u2026         \n            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026          \u2026       \u2026      \u2026         \u2026         \n            \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026  %       \u2026       \u2026      \u2026         \u2026         \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n         \u2026                                                                        \n         &                                                                        \n         \u2026                                                                        \n         \u2026  \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026  \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026     $    \u2026  $    \u2026    $     \u2026  $    \u2026  $    \u2026    $       $      $      \n         \u2026          \u2026       \u2026          \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                          \n         \u2026          \u2026       \u2026          \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                          \n         \u2026          \u2026       \u2026          \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                          \n         \u2026          \u2026       \u2026          \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                          \n         \u2026  %       \u2026       \u2026          \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                          \n                                                                                  \n(a) In the second quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain spend-based\ncredit card reward costs from marketing expense to be a reduction of card income,\nwith no effect on net income.

These factors are\ninterrelated and sensitive to the same\nfactors that drive inventory-related\nrevenue, which include general market\nconditions, such as interest rates,\nforeign exchange rates, credit spreads,\nand equity and commodity prices, as\nwell as other macroeconomic conditions.\n                                             \n  74    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                             \nFor the periods presented below, the predominant source of principal transactions\nrevenue was the amount recognized upon executing new transactions.\n                                                                                  \n         \u2026                          \u2026                          \u2026                  \n         \u2026                          \u2026                          \u2026                  \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026          \u2026       \u2026       \u2026          \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026          \u2026       \u2026       \u2026          \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026       $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026       $  \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026          \u2026       7       \u2026          \u2026      6      \u2026    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026          \u2026       \u2026       \u2026          \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026          \u2026       8       \u2026          \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026          \u2026       \u2026       \u2026          \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026          \u2026       \u2026       \u2026          \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026       $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026       $  \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                            4                          1                          \n                                                                                  \n(a) Loss days represent the number of days for which CIB Markets, which consists\nof Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets, posted losses to total net revenue.\nThe loss days determined under this measure differ from the measure used to\ndetermine backtesting gains and losses.

In conjunction with\nthis realignment, treasury services product revenue has been renamed wholesale\npayments. In the fourth quarter of 2020, payment processing-only clients along\nwith the associated revenue and expenses were realigned to CIB\u2019s Wholesale\nPayments business from CCB and CB. Prior-period revenue and expense amounts have\nbeen revised to conform with the current presentation. (a) In the first quarter of\n2020, the Firm reclassified certain fees from asset management, administration and\ncommissions (which are included in all other income) to lending and deposit-\nrelated fees. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current\nperiod presentation. (b) Total net revenue included tax-equivalent adjustments\nfrom income tax credits related to equity investments in designated community\ndevelopment entities and in entities established for rehabilitation of historic\nproperties, as well as tax-exempt income related to municipal financing activities\nof $351 million, $460 million and $444 million for the years ended December 31,\n2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\n2020 compared with 2019 Net income was $2.6 billion, a decrease of 35%, driven by\nan increase in the provision for credit losses. Net revenue was $9.3 billion, flat\ncompared to the prior year. Net interest income was $6.2 billion, a decrease of\n5%, driven by deposit margin compression, predominantly offset by higher deposit\nbalances and lending revenue. Noninterest revenue was $3.1 billion, an increase of\n13%, driven by higher deposit-related fees, particularly cash management fees,\nhigher investment banking revenue, and a gain on a strategic investment. The\nincrease was partially offset by a $56 million markdown of a held-for-sale\nposition and lower card income, primarily due to lower volumes as a result of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Noninterest expense was $3.8 billion, an increase of 2%, driven\nby higher compensation expense. The provision for credit losses was $2.1 billion,\ncompared to $296 million in the prior year. The increase was driven by net\nadditions to the allowance for credit losses as a result of the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic across multiple industries.\n                                             \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    77  \n                                             \n                                                                                  \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                      \n  CB product revenue consists of the following:       \n  Lendingincludes a variety of financing              \n  alternatives, which are primarily provided on a     \n  secured basis; collateral includes receivables,     \n  inventory, equipment, real estate or other assets.  \n  Products include term loans, revolving lines of     \n  credit, bridge financing, asset-based structures,   \n  leases, and standby letters of credit.              \n  Wholesale paymentsincludes revenue from a broad     \n  range of products and services that enable CB       \n  clients to manage payments and receipts, as well    \n  as invest and manage funds.                         \n  Investment bankingincludes revenue from a range of  \n  products providing CB clients with sophisticated    \n  capital-raising alternatives, as well as balance    \n  sheet and risk management tools through advisory,   \n  equity underwriting, and loan syndications.         \n  Revenue from Fixed Income and Equity Markets        \n  products used by CB clients is also included.       \n  Otherproduct revenue primarily includes             \n  tax-equivalent adjustments generated from           \n  Community Development Banking activities and        \n  certain income derived from principal               \n  transactions.                                       \n                                                      \n                                                                                  \n  Selected income statement data                                                  \n  (continued)                                                                     \n  Year ended December 31,                                                         \n  (in millions, except ratios)             2020           2019           2018     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Revenue by product                                                              \n  Lending                              $  4,396       $  4,057       $  4,049     \n  Wholesale payments                      3,715          4,200          4,351     \n  Investment banking(a)                   1,069            919            852     \n  Other                                     133             88             84     \n  Total Commercial Banking net         $  9,313       $  9,264       $  9,336     \n  revenue                                                                         \n  Investment banking revenue,          $  3,348       $  2,744       $  2,491     \n  gross(b)                                                                        \n  Revenue by client segment                                                       \n  Middle Market Banking                $  3,640       $  3,805       $  3,797     \n  Corporate Client Banking                3,203          3,119          3,119     \n  Commercial Real Estate Banking          2,313          2,169          2,251     \n  Other                                     157            171            169     \n  Total Commercial Banking net         $  9,313       $  9,264       $  9,336     \n  revenue                                                                         \n  Financial ratios                                                                \n  Return on equity                           11  %          17  %          20  %  \n  Overhead ratio                             41             40             39     \n                                                                                  \nIn the first quarter of 2020, the\nMerchant Services business was\nrealigned from CCB to CIB as part of\nthe Firm\u2019s Wholesale Payments business.\nIn conjunction with this realignment,\ntreasury services product revenue has\nbeen renamed wholesale payments.

Net\nrevenue was $14.2 billion, an increase of 5%. Net interest income was $3.4\nbillion, up 2%, driven by higher deposit and loan balances as well as loan margin\nexpansion, offset by deposit margin compression. Noninterest revenue was $10.8\nbillion, up 6%, predominantly driven by higher asset management fees as a result\nof net inflows into liquidity and long term products, higher performance fees and\nincreased brokerage commissions on higher client-driven volume, partially offset\nby lower net investment valuation gains. Revenue from Asset Management was $7.7\nbillion, up 6%, predominantly driven by higher asset management fees as a result\nof net inflows into liquidity products as well as higher performance fees,\npartially offset by lower net investment valuation gains. Revenue from Wealth\nManagement was $6.6 billion, up 4%, predominantly driven by higher deposit and\nloan balances, increased brokerage commissions and asset management fees, largely\noffset by deposit margin compression. The provision for credit losses was $263\nmillion, driven by additions to the allowance for credit losses, predominantly as\na result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Noninterest expense was $10.0\nbillion, an increase of 2%, driven by legal expense, volume- and revenue-related\nexpense as well as investments in the business, partially offset by lower\nstructural expense.\n                                             \n  80    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                             \n                                                      \n  AWM\u2019s client segments consist of the following:     \n  Private Bankingclients include high- and            \n  ultra-high-net-worth individuals, families, money   \n  managers and business owners.                       \n  Institutionalclients include both corporate and     \n  public institutions, endowments, foundations,       \n  nonprofit organizations and governments worldwide.  \n  Retailclients include financial intermediaries and  \n  individual investors.                               \n                                                      \n                                                      \n  Asset Management has two high-level measures of     \n  its overall fund performance.                       \n  \u2022Percentage of mutual fund assets under management  \n  in funds rated 4- or 5-star:                        \n  Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on     \n  their risk-adjusted performance over various        \n  periods.

Net revenue was a loss of $1.2 billion,\ncompared with revenue of $1.2 billion in the prior year, driven by lower net\ninterest income partially offset by higher noninterest revenue. The decrease in\nnet interest income was predominantly driven by lower rates, including the impact\nof faster prepayments on mortgage-backed securities, as well as limited\nopportunities to deploy funds in response to significant deposit growth across the\nLOBs. Noninterest revenue increased reflecting higher net valuations on certain\nlegacy equity investments and higher net investment securities gains due to the\nrepositioning of the investment securities portfolio. Noninterest expense of $1.4\nbillion was up $305 million driven by an impairment on a legacy investment. The\nprovision for credit losses relates to the HTM portfolio, which became subject to\nthe CECL accounting guidance beginning on January 1, 2020. Refer to Note 10 and\nNote 13 for additional information on the investment securities portfolio and the\nallowance for credit losses. The current period income tax benefit was\npredominantly driven by a lower level of pre-tax income and changes in the level\nand mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal, and state and local taxes.\nThe prior period included $1.1 billion of tax benefits related to the resolution\nof certain tax audits.\n                                             \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    83  \n                                             \n                                                                                  \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                            \n                                                                                  \nTreasury and CIO overview Treasury and CIO is predominantly responsible for\nmeasuring, monitoring, reporting and managing the Firm\u2019s liquidity, funding,\ncapital, structural interest rate and foreign exchange risks.

When the\nFirm extends a consumer or wholesale\nloan, advises customers and clients on\ntheir investment decisions, makes\nmarkets in securities, or offers other\nproducts or services, the Firm takes on\nsome degree of risk. The Firm\u2019s overall\nobjective is to manage its businesses,\nand the associated risks, in a manner\nthat balances serving the interests of\nits clients, customers and investors\nand protects the safety and soundness\nof the Firm.\n\nThe Firm believes that effective risk\nmanagement requires, among other\nthings:\n\n\u2022 Acceptance of responsibility,\nincluding identification and escalation\nof risks by all individuals within the\nFirm;\n\n\u2022 Ownership of risk identification,\nassessment, data and management within\neach of the LOBs and Corporate; and\n\n\u2022 Firmwide structures for risk\ngovernance.\n\nThe Firm follows a disciplined and\nbalanced compensation framework with\nstrong internal governance and\nindependent oversight by the Board of\nDirectors (the \u201cBoard\u201d). The impact of\nrisk and control issues is carefully\nconsidered in the Firm\u2019s performance\nevaluation and incentive compensation\nprocesses.\n                                                                                  \n  Risk governance and oversight framework                                         \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm\u2019s risk management governance\nand oversight framework involves\nunderstanding drivers of risks, types\nof risks, and impacts of risks.\n\nDrivers of Risks are factors that cause\na risk to exist. Drivers of risks\ninclude the economic environment,\nregulatory and government policy,\ncompetitor and market evolution,\nbusiness decisions, process and\njudgment error, deliberate wrongdoing,\ndysfunctional markets, and natural\ndisasters.\n\nTypes of Risks are categories by which\nrisks manifest themselves. Risks are\ngenerally categorized in the following\nfour risk types:\n\n\u2022 Strategic risk is the risk to\nearnings, capital, liquidity or\nreputation associated with poorly\ndesigned or failed business plans or\ninadequate response to changes in the\noperating environment.\n\n\u2022 Credit and investment risk is the\nrisk associated with the default or\nchange in credit profile of a client,\ncounterparty or customer; or loss of\nprincipal or a reduction in expected\nreturns on investments, including\n\nconsumer credit risk, wholesale credit\nrisk, and investment portfolio risk.\n\n\u2022 Market risk is the risk associated\nwith the effect of changes in market\nfactors, such as interest and foreign\nexchange rates, equity and commodity\nprices, credit spreads or implied\nvolatilities, on the value of assets\nand liabilities held for both the short\nand long term.\n\n\u2022 Operational risk is the risk\nassociated with an adverse outcome\nresulting from inadequate or failed\ninternal processes or systems; human\nfactors; or external events impacting\nthe Firm\u2019s processes or systems. It\nincludes compliance, conduct, legal,\nand estimations and model risk.\n\nImpacts of Risks are consequences of\nrisks, both quantitative and\nqualitative. There may be many\nconsequences of risks manifesting,\nincluding quantitative impacts such as\na reduction in earnings and capital,\nliquidity outflows, and fines or\npenalties, or qualitative impacts such\nas reputation damage, loss of clients\nand customers, and regulatory and\nenforcement actions.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s risk governance and\noversight framework is managed on a\nFirmwide basis. The Firm has an\nIndependent Risk Management (\u201cIRM\u201d)\nfunction, which consists of the Risk\nManagement and Compliance\norganizations. The Chief Executive\nOfficer (\u201cCEO\u201d) appoints, subject to\napproval by the Risk Committee of the\nBoard (\u201cBoard Risk Committee\u201d), the\nFirm\u2019s Chief Risk Officer (\u201cCRO\u201d) to\nlead the IRM organization and manage\nthe risk governance structure of the\nFirm.

These\nassessments are intended to ensure\ncompliance with the applicable\nregulatory capital rules in support of\nsenior management\u2019s responsibility for\nmanaging capital and for the Board Risk\nCommittee\u2019s oversight of management in\nexecuting that responsibility.\n                                                                                  \n  Capital management                                                              \n                                                                                  \nTreasury & CIO is responsible for\ncapital management.\n\nThe primary objectives of the Firm\u2019s\ncapital management are to:\n\n\u2022 Maintain sufficient capital in order\nto continue to build and invest in the\nFirm\u2019s businesses through the cycle and\nin stressed environments;\n\n\u2022 Retain flexibility to take advantage\nof future investment opportunities;\n\n\u2022 Promote the Firm\u2019s ability to serve\nas a source of strength to its\nsubsidiaries;\n\n\u2022 Ensure the Firm operates above the\nminimum regulatory capital ratios as\nwell as maintain \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d\nstatus for the Firm and its insured\ndepository institution (\u201cIDI\u201d)\nsubsidiaries at all times under\napplicable regulatory capital\nrequirements;\n\n\u2022 Meet capital distribution objectives;\nand\n\n\u2022 Maintain sufficient capital resources\nto operate throughout a resolution\nperiod in accordance with the Firm\u2019s\npreferred resolution strategy.\n\nThe Firm addresses these objectives\nthrough establishing internal minimum\ncapital requirements and a strong\ncapital governance framework. The\ninternal minimum capital levels\nconsider the Firm\u2019s regulatory capital\nrequirements as well as an internal\nassessment of capital adequacy, in\nnormal economic cycles and in stress\nevents, when setting its minimum\ncapital levels.\n\nCapital management is intended to be\nflexible in order to react to a range\nof potential events.\n\nThe current capital governance\nframework requires regular monitoring\nof the Firm\u2019s capital position and\nfollows prescribed escalation\nprotocols, both at the Firm and\nmaterial legal entity levels.\n                                                                                  \n  Governance                                                                      \n                                                                                  \nCommittees responsible for overseeing\nthe Firm\u2019s capital management include\nthe Capital Governance Committee, the\nTreasurer Committee and the Firmwide\nALCO.

The Federal Reserve uses\nCCAR and other stress testing processes\nto ensure that large BHCs have\nsufficient capital during periods of\neconomic and financial stress, and have\nrobust, forward-looking capital\nassessment and planning processes in\nplace that address each BHC\u2019s unique\nrisks to enable it to absorb losses\nunder certain stress scenarios. Through\nCCAR, the Federal Reserve evaluates\neach BHC\u2019s capital adequacy and\ninternal capital adequacy assessment\nprocesses (\u201cICAAP\u201d), as well as its\nplans to make capital distributions,\nsuch as dividend payments or stock\nrepurchases. The Federal Reserve uses\nresults under the severely adverse\nscenario from its supervisory stress\ntest to determine each firm\u2019s SCB\nrequirement for the coming\n                                             \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    91  \n                                             \n                                                                                  \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                            \n                                                                                  \nyear. Refer to Key Regulatory\nDevelopments on pages 93\u201394 for\nadditional information.\n\nOn June 29, 2020, the Firm announced\nthat it had completed the 2020 CCAR\nstress test process. On August 10,\n2020, the Federal Reserve affirmed the\nFirm's SCB requirement of 3.3% and the\nFirm's minimum Standardized CET1\ncapital ratio of 11.3% (up from 10.5%).\nThe SCB requirement became effective on\nOctober 1, 2020.\n\nIn June 2020, the Federal Reserve\ndetermined that changes in financial\nmarkets or the macroeconomic outlook\ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic could have\na material effect on a firm\u2019s risk\nprofile and financial condition and\ntherefore required all large bank\nholding companies, including the Firm,\nto update and resubmit their capital\nplans by November 2, 2020. On December\n18, 2020, the Federal Reserve released\nits results from the 2020 CCAR Round 2\nstress test, which showed that large\nbanks had strong levels of capital and\nannounced that it would allow all large\nbanks, including the Firm, to resume\nshare repurchases commencing in the\nfirst quarter of 2021, subject to\ncertain restrictions for at least the\nfirst quarter of 2021 given\nconsiderable economic uncertainty\nremained. The Federal Reserve has\nstated that due to uncertainty about\nfuture economic conditions and the\nultimate path of the current recovery,\nthe SCB will not be reset at this time.\nThe Federal Reserve will notify firms\nby March 31, 2021 whether a revised SCB\nrequirement based on the 2020 CCAR\nRound 2 stress test will be\nrecalculated ahead of the 2021 annual\nCCAR assessment.\n\nRefer to Capital actions on page 99 for\ninformation on actions taken by the\nFirm\u2019s Board of Directors following the\n2020 CCAR results.\n\nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment\nProcess\n\nAnnually, the Firm prepares the ICAAP,\nwhich informs the Board of Directors of\nthe ongoing assessment of the Firm\u2019s\nprocesses for managing the sources and\nuses of capital as well as compliance\nwith supervisory expectations for\ncapital planning and capital adequacy.\nThe Firm\u2019s ICAAP integrates stress\ntesting protocols with capital\nplanning.\n\nThe CCAR and other stress testing\nprocesses assess the potential impact\nof alternative economic and business\nscenarios on the Firm\u2019s earnings and\ncapital. Economic scenarios, and the\nparameters underlying those scenarios,\nare defined centrally and applied\nuniformly across the businesses. These\nscenarios are articulated in terms of\nmacroeconomic factors, which are key\ndrivers of business results; global\nmarket shocks, which generate short-\nterm but severe trading losses; and\nidiosyncratic operational risk events.\nThe scenarios are intended to capture\nand stress key vulnerabilities and\nidiosyncratic risks facing the Firm.\nHowever, when defining a broad range of\nscenarios, actual events can be worse.\nAccordingly, management considers\nadditional stresses outside these\nscenarios, as necessary. These results\nare reviewed by management and the\nBoard of Directors.\n                                                                                  \n  Contingency capital plan                                                        \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm\u2019s contingency capital plan\nestablishes the capital management\nframework for the Firm and specifies\nthe principles underlying the Firm\u2019s\napproach towards capital management in\nnormal economic conditions and during\nstress. The contingency capital plan\ndefines how the Firm calibrates its\ntargeted capital levels and meets\nminimum capital requirements, monitors\nthe ongoing appropriateness of planned\ncapital distributions, and sets out the\ncapital contingency actions that are\nexpected to be taken or considered at\nvarious levels of capital depletion\nduring a period of stress.\n                                                                                  \n  Regulatory capital                                                              \n                                                                                  \nThe Federal Reserve establishes capital\nrequirements, including well-\ncapitalized standards, for the\nconsolidated financial holding company.\nThe OCC establishes similar minimum\ncapital requirements and standards for\nthe Firm\u2019s IDI subsidiaries, including\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The U.S.\ncapital requirements generally follow\nthe Capital Accord of the Basel\nCommittee, as amended from time to\ntime.\n\nBasel III Overview\n\nThe capital rules under Basel III\nestablish minimum capital ratios and\noverall capital adequacy standards for\nlarge and internationally active U.S.\nBHCs and banks, including the Firm and\nits IDI subsidiaries, including\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum\namount of regulatory capital that must\nbe held by BHCs and banks is determined\nby calculating risk-weighted assets\n(\u201cRWA\u201d), which are on-balance sheet\nassets and off-balance sheet exposures,\nweighted according to risk. Two\ncomprehensive approaches are prescribed\nfor calculating RWA: a standardized\napproach (\u201cBasel III Standardized\u201d),\nand an advanced approach (\u201cBasel III\nAdvanced\u201d). For each of the risk-based\ncapital ratios, the capital adequacy of\nthe Firm is evaluated against the lower\nof the Standardized or Advanced\napproaches compared to their respective\nminimum capital ratios.\n\nBasel III establishes capital\nrequirements for calculating credit\nrisk RWA and market risk RWA, and in\nthe case of Basel III Advanced,\noperational risk RWA. Key differences\nin the calculation of credit risk RWA\nbetween the Standardized and Advanced\napproaches are that for Basel III\nAdvanced, credit risk RWA is based on\nrisk-sensitive approaches which largely\nrely on the use of internal credit\nmodels and parameters, whereas for\nBasel III Standardized, credit risk RWA\nis generally based on supervisory risk-\nweightings which vary primarily by\ncounterparty type and asset class.\nMarket risk RWA is calculated on a\ngenerally consistent basis between\nBasel III Standardized and Basel III\nAdvanced. In addition to the RWA\ncalculated under these approaches, the\nFirm may supplement such amounts to\nincorporate management judgment and\nfeedback from its regulators.\n\nBasel III also includes a requirement\nfor Advanced Approach banking\norganizations, including the Firm, to\n                                             \n  92    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                             \ncalculate the SLR. Refer to SLR on page\n98 for additional information.\n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\n\nThe Firm has been impacted by market\nevents as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic, but remains well-capitalized.\nHowever, the continuation or further\ndeterioration of the current\nmacroeconomic environment could result\nin impacts to the Firm\u2019s capital and\nleverage.\n\nKey Regulatory Developments\n\nCurrent Expected Credit Losses.\nEffective January 1, 2020, the Firm\nadopted the Financial Instruments \u2013\nCredit Losses guidance under U.S. GAAP.\nAs permitted under the U.S. capital\nrules issued by the federal banking\nagencies in 2019, the Firm initially\nelected to phase-in the January 1, 2020\n(\u201cday 1\u201d) CECL adoption impact to\nretained earnings of $2.7 billion to\nCET1 capital, at 25% per year in each\nof 2020 to 2023. As part of their\nresponse to the impact of the COVID-19\npandemic, on March 31, 2020, the\nfederal banking agencies issued an\ninterim final rule (issued as final on\nAugust 26, 2020) that provided the\noption to delay the effects of CECL on\nregulatory capital for two years,\nfollowed by a three-year transition\nperiod (\u201cCECL capital transition\nprovisions\u201d).\n\nThe final rule provides a uniform\napproach for estimating the effects of\nCECL compared to the legacy incurred\nloss model during the first two years\nof the transition period (the \u201cday 2\u201d\ntransition amount), whereby the Firm\nmay exclude from CET1 capital 25% of\nthe change in the allowance for credit\nlosses (excluding allowances on PCD\nloans). The cumulative day 2 transition\namount as at December 31, 2021 that is\nnot recognized in CET1 capital, as well\nas the $2.7 billion day 1 impact, will\nbe phased into CET1 capital at 25% per\nyear beginning January 1, 2022. The\nFirm has elected to apply the CECL\ncapital transition provisions, and\naccordingly, for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020, the capital metrics\nof the Firm exclude $5.7 billion, which\nis the $2.7 billion day 1 impact to\nretained earnings and 25% of the $12.2\nbillion increase in the allowance for\ncredit losses (excluding allowances on\nPCD loans).\n\nThe impacts of the CECL capital\ntransition provisions have also been\nincorporated into Tier 2 capital,\nadjusted average assets, and total\nleverage exposure. Refer to Note 1 for\nfurther information on the CECL\naccounting guidance.\n\nMoney Market Mutual Fund Liquidity\nFacility (\"MMLF\") . The Federal Reserve\nestablished the MMLF facility on March\n18, 2020, authorized through at least\nMarch 31, 2021, to enhance the\nliquidity and functioning of money\nmarkets. Under the MMLF, the Federal\nReserve Bank of Boston (\u201cFRBB\u201d) makes\nnonrecourse advances to participating\nfinancial institutions to purchase\ncertain types of assets from eligible\nmoney market mutual fund clients. These\nassets, which are reflected in other\nassets on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated\nbalance sheets, are pledged to the FRBB\nas collateral. On March 23, 2020, the\nfederal banking agencies issued an\ninterim final rule (issued as final on\n\nSeptember 29, 2020) to neutralize the\neffects of purchasing assets through\nthe program on risk-based and leverage-\nbased capital ratios. As of December\n31, 2020, the Firm excluded assets\npurchased from money market mutual fund\nclients pursuant to nonrecourse\nadvances provided under the MMLF in the\namount of $187 million from its RWA and\n$358 million from adjusted three month\naverage assets and total leverage\nexposure.\n\nSupplementary leverage ratio temporary\nrevision. On April 1, 2020, the Federal\nReserve issued an interim final rule\nthat requires, on a temporary basis,\nthe calculation of total leverage\nexposure for purposes of calculating\nthe SLR for bank holding companies, to\nexclude the on-balance sheet amounts of\nU.S. Treasury securities and deposits\nat Federal Reserve Banks. These\nexclusions became effective April 1,\n2020, and will remain in effect through\nMarch 31, 2021.\n\nOn June 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve,\nOCC and FDIC issued an interim final\nrule that provides IDI subsidiaries\nwith an option to apply this temporary\nexclusion subject to certain\nrestrictions. As of December 31, 2020,\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has not\nelected to apply this exclusion.\n\nPaycheck Protection Program. On April\n13, 2020, the federal banking agencies\nissued an interim final rule (issued as\nfinal on September 29, 2020) to\nneutralize the regulatory capital\neffects of participating in the PPP on\nrisk-based capital ratios by applying a\nzero percent risk weight to loans\noriginated under the program. Given\nthat PPP loans are guaranteed by the\nSBA, the Firm does not expect to\nrealize material credit losses on these\nloans. As of December 31, 2020, the\nFirm had approximately $27 billion of\nloans under the program.\n\nThe rule also provides that if a PPP\nloan is pledged as collateral for a\nnon-recourse loan under the Federal\nReserve\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program\nLending (\u201cPPPL\u201d) Facility, the PPP loan\ncan be excluded from leverage-based\ncapital ratios. As of December 31,\n2020, the Firm had not participated in\nthe PPPL Facility.\n\nRefer to Regulatory Developments\nRelating to the COVID-19 Pandemic on\npages 52-53 for additional information\non regulatory actions and significant\nfinancing programs that the U.S.\ngovernment and regulators have\nintroduced to address the effects of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nStress Capital Buffer. On March 4,\n2020, the Federal Reserve issued the\nfinal rule introducing the SCB\nframework for the Basel III\nStandardized approach that is designed\nto more closely integrate the results\nof the quantitative assessment in the\nannual CCAR with the ongoing minimum\ncapital requirements for BHCs under the\nU.S. Basel III rules. The final rule\nreplaces the fixed 2.5% CET1 capital\nconservation buffer in the Standardized\napproach with a dynamic institution-\nspecific SCB. The final rule does not\napply to the U.S. Basel III Advanced\napproach capital requirements. The SCB\nrequirement for BHCs will be effective\non October 1 of each year and is\nexpected to remain in effect until\nSeptember 30 of the following year.\n                                             \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    93  \n                                             \n                                                                                  \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                            \n                                                                                  \nTLAC Holdings rule. On October 20,\n2020, the federal banking agencies\nissued a final rule prescribing the\nregulatory capital treatment for\nholdings of TLAC debt instruments by\ncertain large banking organizations,\nsuch as the Firm and JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. This rule expands the scope\nof the existing capital deductions rule\naround the\n\nholdings of capital instruments of\nfinancial institutions to also include\nTLAC debt instruments issued by\nsystemically important banking\norganizations. The final rule will\nbecome effective on April 1, 2021 and\nis not expected to have a material\nimpact on the Firm\u2019s risk-based capital\nmetrics.\n\nRisk-based Capital Regulatory Minimums\n\nThe following chart presents the Firm\u2019s\nBasel III minimum CET1 capital ratio\nunder the Basel III rules currently in\neffect.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s Basel III Standardized risk-\nbased ratios are currently more binding\nthan the Basel III Advanced risk-based\nratios.\n\nAll banking institutions are currently\nrequired to have a minimum CET1 capital\nratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets.\n\nCertain banking organizations,\nincluding the Firm, are required to\nhold additional levels of capital to\nserve as a \u201ccapital conservation\nbuffer\u201d. The capital conservation\nbuffer incorporates a global\nsystemically important bank (\u201cGSIB\u201d)\nsurcharge, a discretionary\ncountercyclical capital buffer and a\nfixed capital conservation buffer of\n2.5% for Advanced regulatory capital\nrequirements and a variable SCB\nrequirement, floored at 2.5%, for\nStandardized regulatory capital\nrequirements.\n\nUnder the Federal Reserve\u2019s GSIB rule,\nthe Firm is required to assess its GSIB\nsurcharge on an annual basis under two\nseparately prescribed methods based on\ndata for the previous fiscal year-end,\nand is subject to the higher of the\ntwo. The first (\u201cMethod 1\u201d), reflects\nthe GSIB surcharge as prescribed by the\nBasel Committee\u2019s assessment\nmethodology, and is calculated across\nfive criteria: size, cross-\njurisdictional activity,\ninterconnectedness, complexity and\nsubstitutability. The second (\u201cMethod\n2\u201d), modifies the Method 1 requirements\nto include a measure of short-term\nwholesale funding in place of\nsubstitutability, and introduces a GSIB\nscore \u201cmultiplication factor\u201d.\n                                             \n  94    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                             \nThe following table presents the Firm\u2019s\neffective GSIB surcharge for the years\nended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n                                                \n                            2020          2019  \n  Fully Phased-In:                              \n  Method 1            2.50     %    2.50     %  \n  Method 2            3.50     %    3.50     %  \n                                                \nThe Firm\u2019s effective regulatory minimum GSIB surcharge calculated under Method 2\nremains unchanged at 3.5% for 2021. On November 11, 2020, the Financial Stability\nBoard (\u201cFSB\u201d) released its annual GSIB list, which published the Firm\u2019s Method 1\nGSIB surcharge of 2.0% (down from 2.5%) effective January 1, 2021, based upon data\nas of December 31, 2019. The Firm\u2019s estimated Method 2 surcharge calculated using\ndata as of December 31, 2020 is 4.0%. Accordingly, based on the GSIB rule\ncurrently in effect, the Firm\u2019s effective regulatory minimum GSIB surcharge is\nexpected to increase to 4.0% on January 1, 2023 unless the Firm\u2019s Method 2 GSIB\nsurcharge calculation based upon data as of December 31, 2021 is lower. The U.S.\nfederal regulatory capital standards include a framework for setting a\ndiscretionary countercyclical capital buffer taking into account the macro\nfinancial environment in which large, internationally active banks function. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, the U.S. countercyclical capital buffer remained at 0%. The\nFederal Reserve will continue to review the buffer at least annually. The buffer\ncan be increased if the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC determine that systemic\nrisks are meaningfully above normal and can be calibrated up to an additional 2.5%\nof RWA subject to a 12-month implementation period. Failure to maintain regulatory\ncapital equal to or in excess of the risk-based regulatory capital minimum plus\nthe capital conservation buffer (inclusive of the GSIB surcharge) and any\ncountercyclical buffer will result in limitations to the amount of capital that\nthe Firm may distribute, such as through dividends and common share repurchases,\nas well as certain executive discretionary bonus payments. The Firm has a target\nBasel III CET1 capital ratio of 12%. However, the Firm may remain above that level\nin order to satisfy leverage-based capital requirements if deposits continue to\ngrow due to actions taken by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. government in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic. Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity The Federal\nReserve\u2019s TLAC rule requires the U.S. GSIB top-tier holding companies, including\nthe Firm, to maintain minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible long-term debt\n(\u201celigible LTD\u201d). Refer to TLAC on page 100 for additional information. Leverage-\nbased Capital Regulatory Minimums Supplementary leverage ratio Banking\norganizations subject to the Basel III Advanced approach are currently required to\nhave a minimum SLR of\n\n3.0%. Certain banking organizations, including the Firm, are also required to hold\nan additional 2.0% leverage buffer. The SLR is defined as Tier 1 capital under\nBasel III divided by the Firm\u2019s total leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure\nis calculated by taking the Firm\u2019s total average on-balance sheet assets, less\namounts permitted to be deducted for Tier 1 capital, and adding certain off-\nbalance sheet exposures, such as undrawn commitments and derivatives potential\nfuture exposure. Failure to maintain an SLR equal to or greater than the\nregulatory minimum will result in limitations on the amount of capital that the\nFirm may distribute such as through dividends and common share repurchases. Other\nregulatory capital In addition to meeting the capital ratio requirements of Basel\nIII, the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries also must maintain minimum capital and\nleverage ratios in order to be \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d under the regulations issued by\nthe Federal Reserve and the Prompt Corrective Action (\u201cPCA\u201d) requirements of the\nFDIC Improvement Act (\u201cFDICIA\u201d), respectively. Refer to Note 27 for additional\ninformation. Additional information regarding the Firm\u2019s capital ratios, as well\nas the U.S. federal regulatory capital standards to which the Firm is subject, is\npresented in Note 27.

ROE is measured\nand internal targets for expected\nreturns are established as key measures\nof a business segment\u2019s performance.\nThe Firm\u2019s allocation methodology\nincorporates Basel III Standardized\nRWA, Basel III Advanced RWA, the GSIB\nsurcharge, and a simulation of capital\nin a severe stress environment.

Eligible HQLA, for purposes of\ncalculating the LCR, is the amount of\nunencumbered HQLA that satisfy certain\noperational considerations as defined\nin the LCR rule. HQLA primarily consist\nof cash and certain high-quality liquid\nsecurities as defined in the LCR rule.\nUnder the LCR rule, the amount of\neligible HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. that is in excess of its\nstand-alone 100% minimum LCR\nrequirement, and that is not\ntransferable to non-bank affiliates,\nmust be excluded from the Firm\u2019s\nreported eligible HQLA. Estimated net\ncash outflows are based on standardized\nstress outflow and inflow rates\nprescribed in the LCR rule, which are\napplied to the balances of the Firm\u2019s\nassets, sources of funds, and\nobligations. The LCR for both the Firm\nand JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is\nrequired to be a minimum of 100%.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Firm\nand JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s average\nLCR for the three months ended December\n31, 2020, September 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019 based on the Firm\u2019s\ninterpretation of the LCR framework.\n                                                                                  \n                        Three months                                              \n  Average                      ended                                              \n  amount                December 31,        September 30,        December 31,     \n  (in millions)                 2020                 2020                2019     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  JPMorgan                                                                        \n  Chase & Co.:                                                                    \n  Eligible HQLA                                                                   \n  Eligible         $         455,612     $        458,336     $       203,296     \n  cash(a)                                                                         \n  Eligible                   241,447              211,841             341,990     \n  securities(b\u2026                                                                   \n  Total                                                                           \n  eligible         $         697,059     $        670,177     $       545,286     \n  HQLA(d)                                                                         \n  Net cash         $         634,037     $        587,811     $       469,402     \n  outflows                                                                        \n  LCR                            110  %               114  %              116  %  \n  Net excess                                                                      \n  eligible         $          63,022     $         82,366     $        75,884     \n  HQLA(d)                                                                         \n  JPMorgan                                                                        \n  Chase Bank,                                                                     \n  N.A.:                                                                           \n  LCR                            160  %               157  %              116  %  \n  Net excess       $         401,903     $        366,096     $        79,483     \n  eligible HQLA                                                                   \n                                                                                  \n(a) Represents cash on deposit at\ncentral banks, primarily the Federal\nReserve Banks.

The Firm\u2019s average\nLCR decreased during the three months\nended December 31, 2020, compared with\nthe three-month period ended September\n30, 2020, predominantly driven by a\ndecrease in cash from long-term debt\nmaturities, including the early\ntermination of certain of the Firm's\ndebt at the end of the third quarter\n2020. The Firm's average LCR decreased\nduring the three months ended December\n31, 2020, compared with the prior year\nperiod primarily due to the relative\nimpact on net cash outflows from the\nsignificant increase in deposits as\nwell as elevated market activities in\nthe CIB. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s\naverage LCR increased during the three\nmonths ended December 31, 2020,\ncompared with both the three month\nperiods ended September 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019 primarily due to\ngrowth in deposits. Deposits continued\nto increase in the fourth quarter\nprimarily driven by the COVID-19\npandemic and the related effect of\ncertain government actions. The\nincrease in excess liquidity in\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is excluded\nfrom the Firm\u2019s reported LCR under the\nLCR rule. The Firm\u2019s average LCR\nfluctuates from period to period, due\nto changes in its eligible HQLA and\nestimated net cash outflows as a result\nof ongoing business activity.

The fair value increased\ncompared to December 31, 2019, due to\nan increase in excess eligible HQLA at\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. which was\nprimarily a result of increased\ndeposits.\n\nThe Firm also had available borrowing\ncapacity at FHLBs and the discount\nwindow at the Federal Reserve Bank as a\nresult of collateral pledged by the\nFirm to such banks of approximately\n$307 billion and $322 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively. This borrowing capacity\nexcludes the benefit of cash and\nsecurities reported in the Firm\u2019s\neligible HQLA or other unencumbered\nsecurities that are currently pledged\nat the Federal Reserve Bank discount\nwindow and other central banks.\nAvailable borrowing capacity decreased\nfrom December 31, 2019 primarily due to\nlower pledged credit card receivable\nbalances driven by the COVID-19\npandemic and a decrease in pledged\nmortgage collateral as a result of\npaydown and maturity activity. Although\navailable, the Firm does not view this\nborrowing capacity at the Federal\nReserve Bank discount window and the\nother central banks as a primary source\nof liquidity.\n                                                                                  \n  NSFR                                                                            \n                                                                                  \nThe net stable funding ratio (\u201cNSFR\u201d)\nis a liquidity requirement for large\nbanking organizations that is intended\nto measure the adequacy of \u201cavailable\u201d\nand \u201crequired\u201d amounts of stable\nfunding over a one-year horizon.

Prior-period amounts have\nbeen revised to conform with the\ncurrent presentation.\n\nDeposits provide a stable source of\nfunding and reduce the Firm\u2019s reliance\non the wholesale funding markets. A\nsignificant portion of the Firm\u2019s\ndeposits are consumer deposits and\nwholesale operating deposits, which are\nboth considered to be stable sources of\nliquidity.

However, during\nperiods of market disruption those trends could be affected. Average deposits\nincreased for the year ended December 31, 2020, reflecting significant inflows\nacross the LOBs primarily driven by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the\nrelated effect of certain government actions. In the wholesale businesses, while\nthe inflows principally occurred in March as clients sought to remain liquid as a\nresult of market conditions, balances continued to increase through the end of\n2020.

These\ninstruments are secured predominantly\nby high-quality securities collateral,\nincluding government-issued debt and\nU.S. GSE and government agency MBS.\nSecurities sold under agreements to\nrepurchase increased at December 31,\n2020, compared with December 31, 2019,\nreflecting higher secured financing of\nAFS investment securities in Treasury\nand CIO, as well as trading assets in\nCIB, partially offset by a decline in\nclient-driven market-making activities\nin CIB, including the Firm's non-\nparticipation in the Federal Reserve's\nopen market operations.\n\nThe balances associated with securities\nloaned or sold under agreements to\nrepurchase fluctuate over time due to\ninvestment and financing activities of\nclients, the Firm\u2019s demand for\nfinancing, the ongoing management of\nthe mix of the Firm\u2019s liabilities,\nincluding its secured and unsecured\nfinancing (for both the investment\nsecurities and market-making\nportfolios), and other market and\nportfolio factors.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Firm\nparticipated in the MMLF government\nfacility. The secured nonrecourse\nadvances under the MMLF are included in\nother borrowed funds. Refer to Capital\nRisk Management on pages 91-101 for\nadditional information on the MMLF.\n\nThe Primary Dealer Credit Facility\n(\"PDCF\") was established by the Federal\nReserve on March 20, 2020. Under the\nPDCF, the Federal Reserve Bank of New\nYork (\u201cFRBNY\u201d) provides collateralized\nfinancing on a term basis to primary\ndealers. These financing transactions\nwere reported as securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase. The Firm\nparticipated in the PDCF in the first\nquarter of 2020, and ceased its\nparticipation in May 2020 as the\nsecured financing market normalized.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s sources of short-term\nunsecured funding consist of other\nborrowed funds and issuance of\nwholesale commercial paper. The\ndecrease in short-term unsecured\nfunding at December 31, 2020, from\nDecember 31, 2019 and for the average\nyear ended December 31, 2020 compared\nto the prior year period, was due to\nlower net commercial paper issuance\nprimarily for short-term liquidity\nmanagement.\n                                              \n  106    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n  Long-term funding and issuance                                                  \n                                                                                  \nLong-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity\nfor the Firm. The Firm\u2019s long-term funding plan is driven primarily by expected\nclient activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, including\nTLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing\nmarket access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding\nmarkets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan.\n\nThe significant majority of the Firm\u2019s long-term unsecured funding is issued by\nthe Parent Company to provide flexibility in support of both bank and non-bank\nsubsidiary funding needs.

In its consumer businesses,\nthe Firm is exposed to credit risk\nprimarily through its home lending,\ncredit card, auto, and business banking\nbusinesses. In its wholesale\nbusinesses, the Firm is exposed to\ncredit risk through its underwriting,\nlending, market-making, and hedging\nactivities with and for clients and\ncounterparties, as well as through its\noperating services activities (such as\ncash management and clearing\nactivities), and securities financing\nactivities. The Firm is also exposed to\ncredit risk through its investment\nsecurities portfolio and cash placed\nwith banks.\n\nCredit Risk Management monitors,\nmeasures and manages credit risk\nthroughout the Firm and defines credit\nrisk policies and procedures. The\nFirm\u2019s credit risk management\ngovernance includes the following\nactivities:\n\n\u2022 Maintaining a credit risk policy\nframework\n\n\u2022 Monitoring, measuring and managing\ncredit risk across all portfolio\nsegments, including transaction and\nexposure approval\n\n\u2022 Setting industry and geographic\nconcentration limits, as appropriate,\nand establishing underwriting\nguidelines\n\n\u2022 Assigning and managing credit\nauthorities in connection with the\napproval of credit exposure\n\n\u2022 Managing criticized exposures and\ndelinquent loans and\n\n\u2022 Estimating credit losses and ensuring\nappropriate credit risk-based capital\nmanagement\n                                                                                  \n  Risk identification and measurement                                             \n                                                                                  \nThe Credit Risk Management function\nmonitors, measures, manages and limits\ncredit risk across the Firm\u2019s\nbusinesses. To measure credit risk, the\nFirm employs several methodologies for\nestimating the likelihood of obligor or\ncounterparty default. Methodologies for\nmeasuring credit risk vary depending on\nseveral factors, including type of\nasset (e.g., consumer versus\nwholesale), risk measurement parameters\n(e.g., delinquency status and\nborrower\u2019s credit score versus\nwholesale risk-rating) and risk\nmanagement and collection processes\n(e.g., retail collection center versus\ncentrally managed workout groups).\nCredit risk measurement is based on the\nprobability of default of an obligor or\ncounterparty, the loss severity given a\ndefault event and the exposure at\ndefault.\n\nBased on these factors and the\nmethodology and estimates described in\nNote 13 and Note 10, the Firm estimates\ncredit losses for its exposures. The\nallowance for loan losses reflects\ncredit losses related to the consumer\nand wholesale held-for-investment loan\nportfolios, the allowance for lending-\nrelated commitments reflects credit\nlosses related to the Firm\u2019s lending-\nrelated commitments and the allowance\nfor investment securities reflects the\ncredit losses related to the Firm\u2019s HTM\nand AFS securities. Refer to Note 13,\nNote 10 and Critical Accounting\nEstimates used by the Firm on pages\n152-155 for further information.\n\nIn addition, potential and unexpected\ncredit losses are reflected in the\nallocation of credit risk capital and\nrepresent the potential volatility of\nactual losses relative to the\nestablished allowances for loan losses\nand lending-related commitments. The\nanalyses for these losses include\nstress testing that considers\nalternative economic scenarios as\ndescribed in the Stress testing section\nbelow.\n                                                                                  \n  Stress testing                                                                  \n                                                                                  \nStress testing is important in\nmeasuring and managing credit risk in\nthe Firm\u2019s credit portfolio. The stress\ntesting process assesses the potential\nimpact of alternative economic and\nbusiness scenarios on estimated credit\nlosses for the Firm. Economic scenarios\nand the underlying parameters are\ndefined centrally, articulated in terms\nof macroeconomic factors and applied\nacross the businesses. The stress test\nresults may indicate credit migration,\nchanges in delinquency trends and\npotential losses in the credit\nportfolio. In addition to the periodic\nstress testing processes, management\nalso considers additional stresses\noutside these scenarios, including\nindustry and country- specific stress\nscenarios, as necessary. The Firm uses\nstress testing to inform decisions on\nsetting risk appetite both at a Firm\nand LOB level, as well as to assess the\nimpact of stress on individual\ncounterparties.\n                                              \n  110    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n  Risk monitoring and management                                                  \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm has developed policies and\npractices that are designed to preserve\nthe independence and integrity of the\napproval and decision-making process of\nextending credit to ensure credit risks\nare assessed accurately, approved\nproperly, monitored regularly and\nmanaged actively at both the\ntransaction and portfolio levels. The\npolicy framework establishes credit\napproval authorities, concentration\nlimits, risk-rating methodologies,\nportfolio review parameters and\nguidelines for management of distressed\nexposures. In addition, certain models,\nassumptions and inputs used in\nevaluating and monitoring credit risk\nare independently validated by groups\nthat are separate from the LOBs.\n\nConsumer credit risk is monitored for\ndelinquency and other trends, including\nany concentrations at the portfolio\nlevel, as certain of these trends can\nbe modified through changes in\nunderwriting policies and portfolio\nguidelines. Consumer Risk Management\nevaluates delinquency and other trends\nagainst business expectations, current\nand forecasted economic conditions, and\nindustry benchmarks. Historical and\nforecasted economic performance and\ntrends are incorporated into the\nmodeling of estimated consumer credit\nlosses and are part of the monitoring\nof the credit risk profile of the\nportfolio.\n\nWholesale credit risk is monitored\nregularly at an aggregate portfolio,\nindustry, and individual client and\ncounterparty level with established\nconcentration limits that are reviewed\nand revised periodically as deemed\nappropriate by management. Industry and\ncounterparty limits, as measured in\nterms of exposure and economic risk\nappetite, are subject to stress-based\nloss constraints. Wrong-way risk is the\nrisk that exposure to a counterparty is\npositively correlated with the impact\nof a default by the same counterparty,\nwhich could cause exposure to increase\nat the same time as the counterparty\u2019s\ncapacity to meet its obligations is\ndecreasing.\n\nManagement of the Firm\u2019s wholesale\ncredit risk exposure is accomplished\nthrough a number of means, including:\n\n\u2022 Loan underwriting and credit approval\nprocess\n\n\u2022 Loan syndications and participations\n\n\u2022 Loan sales and securitizations\n\n\u2022 Credit derivatives\n\n\u2022 Master netting agreements, and\n\n\u2022 Collateral and other risk-reduction\ntechniques\n\nIn addition to Credit Risk Management,\nan independent Credit Review function\nis responsible for:\n\n\u2022 I ndependently validating or changing\nthe risk grades assigned to exposures\nin the Firm\u2019s wholesale credit\nportfolio, and assessing the timeliness\nof risk grade changes initiated by\nresponsible business units; and\n\n\u2022 Evaluating the effectiveness of\nbusiness units\u2019 credit management\nprocesses, including the adequacy of\ncredit analyses and risk grading/LGD\nrationales, proper monitoring and\nmanagement of credit exposures, and\ncompliance with applicable grading\npolicies and underwriting guidelines.\n\nRefer to Note 12 for further discussion\nof consumer and wholesale loans.\n                                                                                  \n  Risk reporting                                                                  \n                                                                                  \nTo enable monitoring of credit risk and\neffective decision-making, aggregate\ncredit exposure, credit quality\nforecasts, concentration levels and\nrisk profile changes are reported\nregularly to senior members of Credit\nRisk Management.

The majority of\nthe Firm\u2019s COVID-19 related loan\nmodifications have not been considered\ntroubled debt restructurings (\u201cTDRs\u201d)\nbecause:\n\n\u2022 they represent short-term or other\ninsignificant modifications, whether\nunder the Firm\u2019s regular loan\nmodification assessments or the IA\nStatement guidance, or\n\n\u2022 the Firm has elected to apply the\noption to suspend the application of\naccounting guidance for TDRs provided\nby the CARES Act and extended by the\nConsolidated Appropriations Act.\n\nTo the extent that certain\nmodifications do not meet any of the\nabove criteria, the Firm accounts for\nthem as TDRs. The Firm considers\nexpected losses of principal and\naccrued interest associated with all\nCOVID-19 related loan modifications in\nits allowance for credit losses. Refer\nto Business Developments on pages 50-51\nfor more information on customer and\nclient assistance granted. Refer to\nNotes 12 and 13 for further information\non the Firm\u2019s accounting policies on\nloan modifications and the allowance\nfor credit losses.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Firm\u2019s actions\nin helping borrowers recover and in\nmitigating the Firm\u2019s credit losses\nremains uncertain in light of the\nunpredictable nature and duration of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. Assistance\nprovided in response to the COVID-19\npandemic could delay the recognition of\ndelinquencies, nonaccrual status, and\nnet charge-offs for those customers and\nclients who would have otherwise moved\ninto past due or nonaccrual status.\nRefer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on\npages 114-120 and Wholesale Credit\nPortfolio on pages 121-131 for\ninformation on loan modifications as of\nDecember 31, 2020.\n\nIn the following tables, reported loans\ninclude loans retained (i.e., held-for-\ninvestment); loans held-for-sale; and\ncertain loans accounted for at fair\nvalue.

Prior to the adoption of CECL,\nnonaccrual loans excluded PCI loans as the Firm recognized interest income on each\npool of PCI loans as each of the pools was performing.\n\nPaycheck Protection Program The PPP, established by the CARES Act and implemented\nby the SBA, provided the Firm with delegated authority to process and originate\nPPP loans. When certain criteria are met, PPP loans are subject to forgiveness and\nthe Firm will receive payment of the forgiveness amount from the SBA. PPP loans\nhave a contractual term of two or five years and provide borrowers with an\nautomatic payment deferral of principal and interest. Given that PPP loans are\nguaranteed by the SBA, the Firm does not expect to realize material credit losses\non these loans. PPP processing fees are deferred and accreted into interest income\nover the contractual life of the loans, but may be accelerated upon forgiveness or\nprepayment. The impact on interest income related to PPP loans was not material\nfor the year ended December 31, 2020. The Firm was in the early stages of the PPP\nloan forgiveness process at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, the Firm had\napproximately $27 billion of loans under the PPP, of which $19 billion are in the\nconsumer portfolio and $8 billion are in the wholesale portfolio.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    113  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                            \n                                                                                  \n                             \n  CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO  \n                             \nThe Firm\u2019s retained consumer portfolio\nconsists primarily of residential real\nestate loans, credit card loans, scored\nauto and business banking loans, as\nwell as associated lending-related\ncommitments. The Firm\u2019s focus is on\nserving primarily the prime segment of\nthe consumer credit market. Originated\nmortgage loans are retained in the\nresidential real estate portfolio,\nsecuritized or sold to U.S. government\nagencies and U.S. government-sponsored\nenterprises; other types of consumer\nloans are typically retained on the\nbalance sheet. Refer to Note 12 for\nfurther information on the consumer\nloan portfolio. Refer to Note 28 for\nfurther information on lending-related\ncommitments.\n\nIn 2020, the allowance for credit\nlosses increased, reflecting the\ndeterioration in and uncertainty around\nthe future macroeconomic environment as\na result of the impact of the COVID-19\npandemic. Net charge-offs for the year\nended December 31, 2020 decreased when\ncompared to December 31, 2019,\nbenefiting from payment assistance and\ngovernment stimulus.

The weighted average LTV ratio of\nresidential real estate loans under\npayment deferral at December 31, 2020\nwas 57%.\n\n(c) Excludes risk-rated business\nbanking and auto dealer loans held in\nCCB and auto operating lease assets\nthat were still under payment deferral\nprograms as of December 31, 2020,\nSeptember 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020.\nAuto operating lease asset payment\nassistance is currently offering one\nmonth payment deferral (initially\noffered three month payment deferral).\nDeferrals do not extend the term of the\nlease and all deferred payments are due\nat the end of the lease term.\n\n(d) Includes $3.8 billion, $3.8 billion\nand $5.7 billion of loans that were\naccounted for as TDRs prior to payment\ndeferral as of December 31, 2020,\nSeptember 30, 2020 and June 30,

of\nDecember 31, 2020, approximately $4.0\nbillion were accounted for as TDRs,\neither because they were accounted for\nas TDRs prior to payment deferral, or\nbecause they did not qualify for or the\nFirm did not elect the option to\nsuspend TDR accounting guidance\nprovided by the CARES Act and extended\nby the Consolidated Appropriations Act.\nA portion of the remaining $6.7 billion\nof loans could become TDRs in future\nperiods, depending on the nature and\ntiming of further modifications or\npayment arrangements offered to these\nborrowers. If the remaining $6.7\nbillion of loans were considered TDRs,\nthe Firm estimates that it would result\nin an increase in standardized RWA of\nas much as $2.5 billion.\n\nPredominantly all borrowers, including\nthose accounted for as TDRs, were\ncurrent upon enrollment in payment\ndeferral programs and are expected to\nexit payment deferral programs in a\ncurrent status, either because no\npayments are contractually due during\nthe deferral period or because payments\noriginally contractually due during the\ndeferral period will be due at maturity\nupon exit. For those borrowers that are\nunable to resume making payments in\naccordance with the original or\nmodified contractual terms of their\nagreements upon exit from deferral\nprograms, they will be placed on\nnonaccrual status in line with the\nFirm\u2019s nonaccrual policy, except for\ncredit cards as permitted by regulatory\nguidance, and charged off or down in\naccordance with the Firm\u2019s charge-off\npolicies.

The following\ndiscussions provide information\nconcerning individual loan products.\nRefer to Note 12 for further\ninformation about this portfolio,\nincluding information about\ndelinquencies, loan modifications and\nother credit quality indicators.\nResidential real estate: The\nresidential real estate portfolio,\nincluding loans held-for-sale and loans\nat fair value, predominantly consists\nof prime mortgage loans and home equity\nlines of credit. The portfolio\ndecreased from December 31, 2019 driven\nby paydowns largely offset by\noriginations of prime mortgage loans\nthat have been retained on the balance\nsheet. The 30+ delinquency rate\ndecreased to 0.98% at December 31,\n2020, from 1.35% at December 31, 2019,\nprimarily due to payment assistance and\ngovernment stimulus. Nonaccrual loans\nincreased from December 31, 2019 due\nprimarily to loans placed on nonaccrual\nstatus related to the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic as well as the\nadoption of CECL, as PCD loans became\nsubject to nonaccrual treatment. Net\nrecoveries for the year ended December\n31, 2020 were higher when compared with\nthe prior year as the current year\nbenefited from a recovery on a loan\nsale. The carrying value of home equity\nlines of credit outstanding was $23.7\nbillion at December 31, 2020. This\namount included $8.6 billion of HELOCs\nthat have recast from interest-only to\nfully amortizing payments or have been\nmodified and $7.7 billion of interest-\nonly balloon HELOCs, which primarily\nmature after 2030. The Firm manages the\nrisk of HELOCs during their revolving\nperiod by closing or reducing the\nundrawn line to the extent permitted by\nlaw when borrowers are exhibiting a\nmaterial deterioration in their credit\nrisk profile. At December 31, 2020 and\n2019, the carrying value of interest-\nonly residential mortgage loans were\n$25.6 billion and $22.5 billion,\nrespectively. These loans have an\ninterest-only payment period generally\nfollowed by an adjustable-rate or\nfixed-rate fully amortizing payment\nperiod to maturity and are typically\noriginated as higher-balance loans to\nhigher-income borrowers, predominantly\nin AWM. The net charge-off rate for the\nyear ended December 31, 2020 was\nconsistent with the rate of the broader\nresidential mortgage portfolio as the\nperformance of this portfolio is\ngenerally in line with the performance\nof the broader residential mortgage\nportfolio.\n\nThe following table provides a summary\nof the Firm\u2019s residential mortgage\nportfolio insured and/or guaranteed by\nU.S. government agencies, predominantly\nloans held-for-sale and loans at fair\nvalue.

A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm\u2019s\nwholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm\ndistributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the\nmarket as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio\nconcentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in\npart by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and\ntransaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry,\nproduct and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages\n123-127 for further information. The Firm\u2019s wholesale credit portfolio includes\nexposure held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated business\nbanking and auto dealer exposures held in CCB for which the wholesale methodology\nis applied when determining the allowance for credit losses. In 2020, the impacts\nof the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in broad-based credit deterioration and an\nincrease in the allowance for credit losses. As of December 31, 2020, the\ninvestment-grade percentage of the portfolio decreased from 74% to 71%, and\ncriticized exposure increased $26.5 billion from $15.1 billion to $41.6 billion.\nThe increase in criticized exposure was largely driven by downgrades in Consumer &\nRetail, Oil & Gas and Real Estate, and to a lesser extent, net portfolio activity\nin Technology, Media & Telecommunications. The continuation or worsening of the\neffects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the macroeconomic environment could result in\nfurther impacts to credit quality metrics, including investment-grade percentages,\nas well as to criticized and nonperforming exposures and charge-offs. As of\nDecember 31, 2020 retained loans were up $33.3 billion predominantly driven by AWM\nand CIB, and lending-related commitments were up $32.4 billion, predominantly\ndriven by CIB and CB.\n

(b) Receivables\nfrom customers reflect held-for-\ninvestment margin loans to brokerage\nclients in CIB, CCB and AWM; these are\nreported within accrued interest and\naccounts receivable on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets.

Refer to Credit derivatives\non page 131 and Note 5 for additional\ninformation. (e) In the fourth quarter\nof 2020, the Firm refined its approach\nfor disclosing additional collateral\nheld by the Firm that may be used as\nsecurity when the fair value of the\nclient\u2019s exposure is in the Firm\u2019s\nfavor. Prior-period amounts have been\nrevised to conform with the current\npresentation.

These types of\nassistance, both payment deferrals and\ncovenant modifications, are generally\nnot reported as TDRs, either because\nthe modifications were insignificant or\nthey qualified for the option to\nsuspend the application of accounting\nguidance for TDRs as provided by the\nCARES Act and extended by the\nConsolidated Appropriations Act. A\nportion of the $1.6 billion of loans\nunder payment deferral as December 31,\n\n2020 could become TDRs in future\nperiods, depending on the nature and\ntiming of further modifications or\npayment arrangements offered to these\nborrowers. If the $1.6 billion of loans\nunder payment deferral were considered\nTDRs, the Firm estimates that it would\nresult in an increase in standardized\nRWA of as much as $500 million. Loans\nunder assistance continue to be risk-\nrated in accordance with the Firm\u2019s\noverall credit risk management\nframework. As of December 31, 2020,\npredominantly all of these loans were\nconsidered performing.\n\nWholesale credit exposure \u2013 maturity\nand ratings profile\n\nThe following tables present the\nmaturity and internal risk ratings\nprofiles of the wholesale credit\nportfolio as of December 31, 2020 and\n2019. The Firm generally considers\ninternal ratings with qualitative\ncharacteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3\nor higher as investment grade, and\ntakes into consideration collateral and\nstructural support when determining the\ninternal risk rating for each credit\nfacility.

The\ncontractual amounts of these financial\ninstruments represent the maximum\npossible credit risk should the clients\ndraw down on these commitments or when\nthe Firm fulfills its obligations under\nthese guarantees, and the clients\nsubsequently fail to perform according\nto the terms of these contracts. Most\nof these commitments and guarantees\nhave historically been refinanced,\nextended, cancelled, or expired without\nbeing drawn upon or a default\noccurring. As a result, the Firm does\nnot believe that the total contractual\namount of these wholesale lending-\nrelated commitments is representative\nof the Firm\u2019s expected future credit\nexposure or funding requirements. Refer\nto Note 28 for further information on\nwholesale lending-related commitments.\nReceivables from Customers Receivables\nfrom customers reflect held-for-\ninvestment margin loans to brokerage\nclients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are\ncollateralized by assets maintained in\nthe clients\u2019 brokerage accounts (e.g.,\ncash on deposit, liquid and readily\nmarketable debt or equity securities).\nBecause of this collateralization, no\nallowance for credit losses is\ngenerally held against these\nreceivables. To manage its credit risk\nthe Firm establishes margin\nrequirements and monitors the required\nmargin levels on an ongoing basis, and\nrequires clients to deposit additional\ncash or other collateral, or to reduce\npositions, when appropriate. These\nreceivables are reported within accrued\ninterest and accounts receivable on the\nFirm\u2019s Consolidated balance sheets.\nClearing services The Firm provides\nclearing services for clients entering\ninto certain securities and derivative\ncontracts. Through the provision of\nthese services the Firm is exposed to\nthe risk of non-performance by its\nclients and may be required to share in\nlosses incurred by CCPs. Where\npossible, the Firm seeks to mitigate\nits credit risk to its clients through\nthe collection of adequate margin at\ninception and throughout the life of\nthe transactions and can also cease the\nprovision of clearing services if\nclients do not adhere to their\nobligations under the clearing\nagreement. Refer to Note 28 for a\nfurther discussion of clearing\nservices. Derivative contracts\nDerivatives enable clients and\ncounterparties to manage risks\nincluding credit risk and risks arising\nfrom fluctuations in interest rates,\nforeign exchange, equities, and\ncommodities. The Firm makes markets in\nderivatives in order to meet these\nneeds and uses derivatives to manage\ncertain risks associated with net open\nrisk positions from its market-making\nactivities, including the counterparty\ncredit risk arising from derivative\nreceivables. The Firm also uses\nderivative instruments to manage its\nown credit risk and other market risk\nexposure. The nature of the\ncounterparty and the settlement\nmechanism of the derivative affect the\ncredit risk to which the Firm is\nexposed. For OTC derivatives the Firm\nis exposed to\n\nthe credit risk of the derivative\ncounterparty. For exchange-traded\nderivatives (\u201cETD\u201d), such as futures\nand options, and cleared over-the-\ncounter (\u201cOTC-cleared\u201d) derivatives,\nthe Firm can also be exposed to the\ncredit risk of the relevant CCP. Where\npossible, the Firm seeks to mitigate\nits credit risk exposures arising from\nderivative contracts through the use of\nlegally enforceable master netting\narrangements and collateral agreements.\nThe percentage of the Firm\u2019s over-the-\ncounter derivative transactions subject\nto collateral agreements \u2014 excluding\nforeign exchange spot trades, which are\nnot typically covered by collateral\nagreements due to their short maturity\nand centrally cleared trades that are\nsettled daily \u2014 was approximately 88%\nand 90% at December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively. Refer to Note 5 for\nadditional information on the Firm\u2019s\nuse of collateral agreements. Refer to\nNote 5 for a further discussion of\nderivative contracts, counterparties\nand settlement types. The fair value of\nderivative receivables reported on the\nConsolidated balance sheets were $79.6\nbillion and $49.8 billion at December\n31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, with\nincreases in CIB resulting from market\nmovements. Derivative receivables\nrepresent the fair value of the\nderivative contracts after giving\neffect to legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements and the related cash\ncollateral held by the Firm. In\naddition, the Firm held liquid\nsecurities and other cash collateral\nthat the Firm believes is legally\nenforceable and may be used as security\nwhen the fair value of the client\u2019s\nexposure is in the Firm\u2019s favor. Liquid\nsecurities represents high quality\nliquid assets as defined in the LCR\nrule. In management\u2019s view, the\nappropriate measure of current credit\nrisk should also take into\nconsideration other collateral, which\ngenerally represents securities that do\nnot qualify as high quality liquid\nassets under the LCR rule, but that the\nFirm believes is legally enforceable.\nThe collateral amounts for each\ncounterparty are limited to the net\nderivative receivables for the\ncounterparty. The following tables\nsummarize the net derivative\nreceivables and the internal ratings\nprofile for the periods presented.\n                                                                      \n  Derivative receivables                                              \n  December 31, (in millions)                      2020          2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Total, net of cash collateral             $   79,630    $   49,766  \n  Liquid securities and other cash                                    \n  collateral held against derivative           -14,806       -13,052  \n  receivables(a)                                                      \n  Total, net of liquid securities and       $   64,824    $   36,714  \n  other cash collateral                                               \n  Other collateral                              -6,022        -1,837  \n  held against derivative receivables(a)                              \n  Total, net of collateral                  $   58,802    $   34,877  \n                                                                      \n(a) In the fourth quarter of 2020, the\nFirm refined its approach for\ndisclosing additional collateral held\nby the Firm that may be used as\nsecurity when the fair value of the\nclient\u2019s exposure is in the Firm\u2019s\nfavor.

Prior-period amounts have been\nrevised to conform with the current\npresentation.\n\nThe Firm also holds additional\ncollateral (primarily cash, G7\ngovernment securities, other liquid\ngovernment agency and guaranteed\nsecurities, and corporate debt and\nequity securities) delivered by clients\nat the initiation of transactions, as\nwell as collateral related to contracts\nthat have a non-daily call frequency\nand collateral that the Firm has agreed\nto return but has not yet settled as of\nthe reporting date. Although this\ncollateral does not reduce the balances\nand is not included in the table above,\nit is available as security against\npotential exposure that could arise\nshould the fair value of the client\u2019s\nderivative contracts move in the Firm\u2019s\nfavor. Refer to Note 5 for additional\ninformation on the Firm\u2019s use of\ncollateral agreements.\n\nWhile useful as a current view of\ncredit exposure, the net fair value of\nthe derivative receivables does not\ncapture the potential future\nvariability of that credit exposure. To\ncapture the potential future\nvariability of credit exposure, the\nFirm calculates, on a client-by-client\nbasis, three measures of potential\nderivatives-related credit loss: Peak,\nDerivative Risk Equivalent (\u201cDRE\u201d), and\nAverage exposure (\u201cAVG\u201d). These\nmeasures all incorporate netting and\ncollateral benefits, where applicable.\n\nPeak represents a conservative measure\nof potential derivative exposure,\nincluding the benefit of collateral, to\na counterparty calculated in a manner\nthat is broadly equivalent to a 97.5%\nconfidence level over the life of the\ntransaction. Peak is the primary\nmeasure used by the Firm for setting\ncredit limits for derivative contracts,\nsenior management reporting and\nderivatives exposure management.\n\nDRE exposure is a measure that\nexpresses the risk of derivative\nexposure, including the benefit of\ncollateral, on a basis intended to be\nequivalent to the risk of loan\nexposures. DRE is a less extreme\nmeasure of potential credit loss than\nPeak and is used as an input for\naggregating derivative credit risk\nexposures with loans and other credit\nrisk.\n\nFinally, AVG is a measure of the\nexpected fair value of the Firm\u2019s\nderivative exposure, including the\nbenefit of collateral, at future time\nperiods. AVG over the total life of the\nderivative contract is used as the\nprimary metric for pricing purposes and\nis used to calculate credit risk\ncapital and CVA, as further described\nbelow.\n\nThe fair value of the Firm\u2019s derivative\nreceivables incorporates CVA to reflect\nthe credit quality of counterparties.\nCVA is based on the Firm\u2019s AVG to a\ncounterparty and the counterparty\u2019s\ncredit spread in the credit derivatives\nmarket. The Firm believes that active\nrisk management is essential to\ncontrolling the dynamic credit risk in\nthe derivatives portfolio. In addition,\nthe Firm\u2019s risk management process\ntakes into consideration the potential\nimpact of wrong-way risk, which is\nbroadly defined as the risk that\nexposure to a counterparty is\npositively correlated with the impact\nof a default by the same counterparty,\nwhich could cause exposure to increase\nat the same time as the counterparty\u2019s\ncapacity to meet its obligations is\ndecreasing. Many factors may influence\nthe nature and magnitude of these\ncorrelations over time. To the extent\nthat these correlations are identified,\nthe Firm may adjust the CVA associated\nwith a particular counterparty\u2019s AVG.\nThe Firm risk manages exposure to\nchanges in CVA by entering into credit\nderivative contracts, as well as\ninterest rate, foreign exchange, equity\nand commodity derivative contracts.\n\nThe below graph shows exposure profiles\nto the Firm\u2019s current derivatives\nportfolio over the next 10 years as\ncalculated by the Peak, DRE and AVG\nmetrics. The three measures generally\nshow that exposure will decline after\nthe first year, if no new trades are\nadded to the portfolio.\n                                                                                  \n  Exposure profile of derivatives measures                                        \n                                                                                  \nDecember 31, 2020\n\n(in billions)\n                                              \n  130    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nCredit derivatives The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes:\nfirst, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-user, to manage\nthe Firm\u2019s own credit risk associated with various exposures. Credit portfolio\nmanagement activities Included in the Firm\u2019s end-user activities are credit\nderivatives used to mitigate the credit risk associated with traditional lending\nactivities (loans and lending-related commitments) and derivatives counterparty\nexposure in the Firm\u2019s wholesale businesses (collectively, \u201ccredit portfolio\nmanagement activities\u201d).

(b) Amounts are presented\nnet, considering the Firm\u2019s net\nprotection purchased or sold with\nrespect to each underlying reference\nentity or index. The credit derivatives\nused in credit portfolio management\nactivities do not qualify for hedge\naccounting under U.S. GAAP; these\nderivatives are reported at fair value,\nwith gains and losses recognized in\nprincipal transactions revenue. In\ncontrast, the loans and lending-related\ncommitments being risk-managed are\naccounted for on an accrual basis. This\nasymmetry in accounting treatment,\nbetween loans and lending-related\ncommitments and the credit derivatives\nused in credit portfolio management\nactivities, causes earnings volatility\nthat is not representative, in the\nFirm\u2019s view, of the true changes in\nvalue of the Firm\u2019s overall credit\nexposure. The effectiveness of credit\ndefault swaps (\u201cCDS\u201d) as a hedge\nagainst the Firm\u2019s exposures may vary\ndepending on a number of factors,\nincluding the named reference entity\n(i.e., the Firm may experience losses\non specific exposures that are\ndifferent than the named reference\nentities in the purchased CDS); the\ncontractual terms of the CDS (which may\nhave a defined credit event that does\nnot align with an actual loss realized\nby the Firm); and the maturity of the\nFirm\u2019s CDS protection (which in some\ncases may be shorter than the Firm\u2019s\nexposures). However, the Firm generally\nseeks to purchase credit protection\nwith a maturity date that is the same\nor similar to the maturity date of the\nexposure for which the protection was\npurchased, and remaining differences in\nmaturity are actively monitored and\nmanaged by the Firm.

Refer to Note 1 for further\ninformation. The Firm\u2019s allowance for\ncredit losses comprises: \u2022 the\nallowance for loan losses, which covers\nthe Firm\u2019s retained loan portfolios\n(scored and risk-rated) and is\npresented separately on the\nConsolidated balance sheets, \u2022 the\nallowance for lending-related\ncommitments, which is presented on the\nConsolidated balance sheets in accounts\npayable and other liabilities, and \u2022\nthe allowance for credit losses on\ninvestment securities, which covers the\nFirm\u2019s HTM and AFS securities and is\nrecognized within Investment Securities\non the Consolidated balance sheets. The\nallowance for credit losses increased\ncompared with December 31, 2019,\nprimarily reflecting the deterioration\nand uncertainty in the macroeconomic\nenvironment, in particular in the first\nhalf of 2020, as a result of the impact\nof the COVID-19 pandemic, consisting\nof: \u2022 a net $7.4 billion addition in\nconsumer, predominantly in the credit\ncard portfolio, and \u2022 a net $4.7\nbillion addition in wholesale, across\nthe LOBs, impacting multiple\nindustries. The adoption of CECL on\nJanuary 1, 2020, resulted in a $4.3\nbillion addition to the allowance for\ncredit losses. Discussion of changes in\nthe allowance during 2020 The increase\nin the allowance for loan losses and\nlending-related commitments was\nprimarily driven by an increase in the\nprovision for credit losses, reflecting\nthe deterioration in and uncertainty\naround the future macroeconomic\nenvironment as a result of the impact\nof the COVID-19 pandemic. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, the Firm\u2019s central\ncase reflected U.S. unemployment rates\nof approximately 7% through the second\nquarter of 2021 and remaining above 5%\nuntil the second half of 2022. This\ncompared with relatively low levels of\nunemployment of approximately 4%\nthroughout 2020 and 2021 in the Firm\u2019s\nJanuary 1, 2020 central case. Further,\nwhile the Firm\u2019s January 1, 2020\ncentral case U.S. GDP forecast\nreflected a 1.7% expansion in 2020,\nactual U.S. GDP contracted\napproximately 2.5% in 2020. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, the Firm\u2019s central\ncase assumptions reflect a return to\npre-pandemic GDP levels in the fourth\nquarter of 2021. Due to elevated\nuncertainty in the near term outlook,\ndriven by the potential for increased\ninfection rates and related lock downs\nresulting from the pandemic, as well as\nthe\n\nprospect that government and other\nconsumer relief measures set to expire\nmay not be extended, the Firm has\nplaced significant weighting on its\nadverse scenarios. These scenarios\nincorporate more punitive macroeconomic\nfactors than the central case\nassumptions, resulting in weighted\naverage U.S. unemployment rates\nremaining elevated throughout 2021 and\n2022, ending the fourth quarter of 2022\nat approximately 6%, and in U.S. GDP\nending 2022 approximately 0.9% higher\nthan fourth quarter 2019 actual pre-\npandemic levels.

The investment securities\nportfolio is predominantly held by\nTreasury and CIO in connection with the\nFirm's balance sheet or asset-liability\nmanagement objectives. Principal\ninvestments are predominantly\nprivately-held non-traded financial\ninstruments and are managed in the LOBs\nand Corporate. Investments are\ntypically intended to be held over\nextended periods and, accordingly, the\nFirm has no expectation for short-term\nrealized gains with respect to these\ninvestments.\n                                                                                  \n  Investment securities risk                                                      \n                                                                                  \nInvestment securities risk includes the\nexposure associated with a default in\nthe payment of principal and interest.\nThis risk is mitigated given that the\ninvestment securities portfolio held by\nTreasury and CIO is predominantly\ninvested in high-quality securities. At\nDecember 31, 2020, the Treasury and CIO\ninvestment securities portfolio, net of\nallowance for credit losses, was $587.9\nbillion, and the average credit rating\nof the securities comprising the\nportfolio was AA+ (based upon external\nratings where available and where not\navailable, based primarily upon\ninternal risk ratings).

These\ninvestments are made by dedicated\ninvesting businesses or as part of a\nbroader business strategy. In general,\nprincipal investments include tax-\noriented investments and investments\nmade to enhance or accelerate the\nFirm\u2019s business strategies . The Firm\u2019s\ninvestments will continue to evolve in\nline with its strategies, including the\nFirm\u2019s commitment to support\nunderserved communities and minority-\nowned businesses. The Firm\u2019s principal\ninvestments are managed by the LOBs and\nCorporate and are reflected within\ntheir respective financial results. The\naggregate carrying values of the\nprincipal investment portfolios have\nnot been significantly affected by\nrecent market events as a result of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. However, the\nduration and severity of adverse\nmacroeconomic conditions could subject\ncertain principal investments to\nimpairments, write-downs, or other\nnegative impacts.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the\naggregate carrying values of the\nprincipal investment portfolios were\n$27.5 billion and $24.2 billion,\nrespectively, which included tax-\noriented investments (e.g., alternative\nenergy and affordable housing\ninvestments) of $21.3 billion and $18.2\nbillion, respectively, and private\nequity, various debt and equity\ninstruments, and real assets of $6.2\nbillion and $6.0 billion, respectively.\n\nGovernance and oversight\n\nThe Firm\u2019s approach to managing\nprincipal risk is consistent with the\nFirm\u2019s risk governance structure. A\nFirmwide risk policy framework exists\nfor all principal investing activities\nand includes approval by executives who\nare independent from the investing\nbusinesses, as appropriate.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s independent control\nfunctions are responsible for reviewing\nthe appropriateness of the carrying\nvalue of investments in accordance with\nrelevant policies. As part of the risk\ngovernance structure, approved levels\nfor investments are established and\nmonitored for each relevant business or\nsegment in order to manage the overall\nsize of the portfolios. The Firm also\nconducts stress testing on these\nportfolios using specific scenarios\nthat estimate losses based on\nsignificant market moves and/or other\nrisk events.\n                                              \n  134    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                          \n  MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT  \n                          \nMarket risk is the risk associated with\nthe effect of changes in market\nfactors, such as interest and foreign\nexchange rates, equity and commodity\nprices, credit spreads or implied\nvolatilities, on the value of assets\nand liabilities held for both the short\nand long term.\n                                                                                  \n  Market Risk Management                                                          \n                                                                                  \nMarket Risk Management monitors market\nrisks throughout the Firm and defines\nmarket risk policies and procedures.\n\nMarket Risk Management seeks to manage\nrisk, facilitate efficient risk/return\ndecisions, reduce volatility in\noperating performance and provide\ntransparency into the Firm\u2019s market\nrisk profile for senior management, the\nBoard of Directors and regulators.\nMarket Risk Management is responsible\nfor the following functions:\n\n\u2022 Maintaining a market risk policy\nframework\n\n\u2022 Independently measuring, monitoring\nand controlling LOB, Corporate, and\nFirmwide market risk\n\n\u2022 Defining, approving and monitoring of\nlimits\n\n\u2022 Performing stress testing and\nqualitative risk assessments\n                                                                                  \n  Risk measurement                                                                \n                                                                                  \nMeasures used to capture market risk\n\nThere is no single measure to capture\nmarket risk and therefore Market Risk\nManagement uses various metrics, both\nstatistical and nonstatistical, to\nassess risk including:\n\n\u2022 Value-at-risk (VaR)\n\n\u2022 Stress testing\n\n\u2022 Profit and loss drawdowns\n\n\u2022 Earnings-at-risk\n\n\u2022 Other sensitivity-based measures\n                                                                                  \n  Risk monitoring and control                                                     \n                                                                                  \nMarket risk exposure is managed\nprimarily through a series of limits\nset in the context of the market\nenvironment and business strategy. In\nsetting limits, Market Risk Management\ntakes into consideration factors such\nas market volatility, product\nliquidity, accommodation of client\nbusiness, and management experience.\nMarket Risk Management maintains\ndifferent levels of limits. Firm level\nlimits include VaR and stress limits.\nSimilarly, LOB and Corporate limits\ninclude VaR and stress limits and may\nbe supplemented by certain\nnonstatistical risk measures such as\nprofit and loss drawdowns. Limits may\nalso be set within the LOBs and\nCorporate, as well as at the legal\nentity level.\n\nMarket Risk Management sets limits and\nregularly reviews and updates them as\nappropriate. Senior management is\nresponsible for reviewing and approving\ncertain of these risk limits on an\nongoing basis. Limits that have not\nbeen reviewed within specified time\nperiods by Market Risk Management are\nreported to senior management. The LOBs\nand Corporate are responsible for\nadhering to established limits against\nwhich exposures are monitored and\nreported.\n\nLimit breaches are required to be\nreported in a timely manner to limit\napprovers, which include Market Risk\nManagement and senior management. In\nthe event of a breach, Market Risk\nManagement consults with appropriate\nmembers of the Firm to determine the\nsuitable course of action required to\nreturn the applicable positions to\ncompliance, which may include a\nreduction in risk in order to remedy\nthe breach or granting a temporary\nincrease in limits to accommodate an\nexpected increase in client activity\nand/or market volatility. Certain Firm,\nCorporate or LOB-level limit breaches\nare escalated as appropriate.\n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\n\nMarket Risk Management continues to\nactively monitor the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic on market risk\nexposures by leveraging existing risk\nmeasures and controls.\n\nModels used to measure market risk are\ninherently imprecise and are limited in\ntheir ability to measure certain risks\nor to predict losses. This imprecision\nmay be heightened when sudden or severe\nshifts in market conditions occur, such\nas those observed at the onset of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. For additional\ndiscussion on model uncertainty refer\nto Estimations and Model Risk\nManagement on page 151.\n\nMarket Risk Management periodically\nreviews the Firm\u2019s existing market risk\nmeasures to identify opportunities for\nenhancement, and to the extent\nappropriate, will calibrate those\nmeasures accordingly over time.

                     \nJPMorgan Chase utilizes VaR, a\nstatistical risk measure, to estimate\nthe potential loss from adverse market\nmoves in the current market\nenvironment. The Firm has a single VaR\nframework used as a basis for\ncalculating Risk Management VaR and\nRegulatory VaR.\n\nThe framework is employed across the\nFirm using historical simulation based\non data for the previous 12 months. The\nframework\u2019s approach assumes that\nhistorical changes in market values are\nrepresentative of the distribution of\npotential outcomes in the immediate\nfuture. The Firm believes the use of\nRisk Management VaR provides a daily\nmeasure of risk that is closely aligned\nto risk management decisions made by\nthe LOBs and Corporate and, along with\nother market risk measures, provides\nthe appropriate information needed to\nrespond to risk events.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR is\ncalculated assuming a one-day holding\nperiod and an expected tail-loss\nmethodology which approximates a 95%\nconfidence level. Risk Management VaR\nprovides a consistent framework to\nmeasure risk profiles and levels of\ndiversification across product types\nand is used for aggregating risks and\nmonitoring limits across businesses.\nVaR results are reported to senior\nmanagement, the Board of Directors and\nregulators.\n\nUnder the Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR\nmethodology, assuming current changes\nin market values are consistent with\nthe historical changes used in the\nsimulation, the Firm would expect to\nincur VaR \u201cbacktesting exceptions,\u201d\ndefined as losses greater than that\npredicted by VaR estimates, an average\nof five times every 100 trading days.\nThe number of VaR backtesting\nexceptions observed can differ from the\nstatistically expected number of\nbacktesting exceptions if the current\nlevel of market volatility is\nmaterially different from the level of\nmarket volatility during the 12 months\nof historical data used in the VaR\ncalculation.\n\nUnderlying the overall VaR model\nframework are individual VaR models\nthat simulate historical market returns\nfor individual risk factors and/or\nproduct types. To capture material\nmarket risks as part of the Firm\u2019s risk\nmanagement framework, comprehensive VaR\nmodel calculations are performed daily\nfor businesses whose activities give\nrise to market risk. These VaR models\nare granular and incorporate numerous\nrisk factors and inputs to simulate\ndaily changes in market values over the\nhistorical period; inputs are selected\nbased on the risk profile of each\nportfolio, as sensitivities and\nhistorical time series used to generate\ndaily market values may be different\nacross product types or risk management\nsystems. The VaR model results across\nall portfolios are aggregated at the\nFirm level.\n\nAs VaR is based on historical data, it\nis an imperfect measure of market risk\nexposure and potential future losses.\nIn addition, based on their reliance on\navailable historical data, limited time\nhorizons, and other factors, VaR\nmeasures are inherently limited in\ntheir ability to measure certain risks\nand to predict losses, particularly\nthose associated with market\nilliquidity and sudden or severe shifts\nin market conditions.\n\nFor certain products, specific risk\nparameters are not captured in VaR due\nto the lack of liquidity and\navailability of appropriate historical\ndata. The Firm uses proxies to estimate\nthe VaR for these and other products\nwhen daily time series are not\navailable. It is likely that using an\nactual price-based time series for\nthese products, if available, would\naffect the VaR results presented. The\nFirm therefore considers other\nnonstatistical measures such as stress\ntesting, in addition to VaR, to capture\nand manage its market risk positions.\n\nThe daily market data used in VaR\nmodels may be different than the\nindependent third-party data collected\nfor VCG price testing in its monthly\nvaluation process. For example, in\ncases where market prices are not\nobservable, or where proxies are used\nin VaR historical time series, the data\nsources may differ. Refer to Valuation\nprocess in Note 2 for further\ninformation on the Firm\u2019s valuation\nprocess. As VaR model calculations\nrequire daily data and a consistent\nsource for valuation, it may not be\npractical to use the data collected in\nthe VCG monthly valuation process for\nVaR model calculations.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s VaR model calculations are\nperiodically evaluated and enhanced in\nresponse to changes in the composition\nof the Firm\u2019s portfolios, changes in\nmarket conditions, improvements in the\nFirm\u2019s modeling techniques and\nmeasurements, and other factors. Such\nchanges may affect historical\ncomparisons of VaR results. Refer to\nEstimations and Model Risk Management\non page 151 for information regarding\nmodel reviews and approvals.\n\nThe Firm calculates separately a daily\naggregated VaR in accordance with\nregulatory rules (\u201cRegulatory VaR\u201d),\nwhich is used to derive the Firm\u2019s\nregulatory VaR-based capital\nrequirements under Basel III. This\nRegulatory VaR model framework\ncurrently assumes a ten business-day\nholding period and an expected tail\nloss methodology which approximates a\n99% confidence level. Regulatory VaR is\napplied to \u201ccovered\u201d positions as\ndefined by Basel III, which may be\ndifferent than the positions included\nin the Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR. For\nexample, credit derivative hedges of\naccrual loans are included in the\nFirm\u2019s Risk Management VaR, while\nRegulatory VaR excludes these credit\nderivative hedges. In addition, in\ncontrast to the Firm\u2019s Risk Management\nVaR, Regulatory VaR currently excludes\nthe diversification benefit for certain\nVaR models.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    137  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                            \n                                                                                  \nRefer to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures\nreports, which are available on the Firm\u2019s website, for additional information on\nRegulatory VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory capital for the\nFirm (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and the respective\nbacktesting).\n\nThe table below shows the results of the Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR measure using\na 95% confidence level.

Additionally, effective July\n1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of\nVaR to exclude certain asset-backed\nfair value option elected loans, and\nincluded them in other sensitivity-\nbased measures to more effectively\nmeasure the risk from these loans.

These excluded components\nof total net revenue may more than offset backtesting gains and losses on a\nparticular day.

Firmwide backtesting loss days can differ from the loss days for\nwhich Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets posted losses, as disclosed in CIB\nMarkets revenue, as the population of positions which compose each metric are\ndifferent and due to the exclusion of select components of total net revenue in\nbacktesting gains and losses as described above.

The results are used\nto understand the exposures responsible\nfor those potential losses and are\nmeasured against limits.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s stress framework covers\nmarket risk sensitive positions in the\nLOBs and Corporate. The framework is\nused to calculate multiple magnitudes\nof potential stress for both market\nrallies and market sell-offs, assuming\nsignificant changes in market factors\nsuch as credit spreads, equity prices,\ninterest rates, currency rates and\ncommodity prices, and combines them in\nmultiple ways to capture an array of\nhypothetical economic and market\nscenarios.\n\nThe Firm generates a number of\nscenarios that focus on tail events in\nspecific asset classes and geographies,\nincluding how the event may impact\nmultiple market factors simultaneously.\nScenarios also incorporate specific\nidiosyncratic risks and stress basis\nrisk between different products. The\nflexibility in the stress framework\nallows the Firm to construct new\nscenarios that can test the outcomes\nagainst possible future stress events.\nStress testing results are reported on\na regular basis to senior management of\nthe Firm, as appropriate.\n\nStress scenarios are governed by an\noverall stress framework and are\nsubject to the standards outlined in\nthe Firm\u2019s policies related to model\nrisk management. Significant changes to\nthe framework are reviewed as\nappropriate.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s stress testing framework is\nutilized in calculating the Firm\u2019s CCAR\nand other stress test results, which\nare reported to the Board of Directors.\nIn addition, stress testing results are\nincorporated into the Firm\u2019s Risk\nAppetite framework, and are reported\nperiodically to the Board Risk\nCommittee.\n                                                                                  \n  Profit and loss drawdowns                                                       \n                                                                                  \nProfit and loss drawdowns are used to\nhighlight trading losses above certain\nlevels of risk tolerance. A profit and\nloss drawdown is a decline in revenue\nfrom its year-to-date peak level.\n                                                                                  \n  Earnings-at-risk                                                                \n                                                                                  \nThe effect of interest rate exposure on\nthe Firm\u2019s reported net income is\nimportant as interest rate risk\nrepresents one of the Firm\u2019s\nsignificant market risks. Interest rate\nrisk arises not only from trading\nactivities but also from the Firm\u2019s\ntraditional banking activities, which\ninclude extension of loans and credit\nfacilities, taking deposits and issuing\ndebt as well as from the investment\nsecurities portfolio. Refer to the\ntable on page 136 for a summary by\n\nLOB and Corporate, identifying\npositions included in earnings-at-risk\n.\n\nThe CTC Risk Committee establishes the\nFirm\u2019s structural interest rate risk\npolicy and related limits, which are\nsubject to approval by the Board Risk\nCommittee. Treasury and CIO, working in\npartnership with the LOBs, calculates\nthe Firm\u2019s structural interest rate\nrisk profile and reviews it with senior\nmanagement, including the CTC Risk\nCommittee. In addition, oversight of\nstructural interest rate risk is\nmanaged through a dedicated risk\nfunction reporting to the CTC CRO. This\nrisk function is responsible for\nproviding independent oversight and\ngovernance around assumptions and\nestablishing and monitoring limits for\nstructural interest rate risk. The Firm\nmanages structural interest rate risk\ngenerally through its investment\nsecurities portfolio and interest rate\nderivatives.\n\nStructural interest rate risk can occur\ndue to a variety of factors, including:\n\n\u2022 Differences in timing among the\nmaturity or repricing of assets,\nliabilities and off-balance sheet\ninstruments\n\n\u2022 Differences in the amounts of assets,\nliabilities and off-balance sheet\ninstruments that are maturing or\nrepricing at the same time\n\n\u2022 Differences in the amounts by which\nshort-term and long-term market\ninterest rates change (for example,\nchanges in the slope of the yield\ncurve)\n\n\u2022 The impact of changes in the maturity\nof various assets, liabilities or off-\nbalance sheet instruments as interest\nrates change\n\nThe Firm manages interest rate exposure\nrelated to its assets and liabilities\non a consolidated, Firmwide basis.\nBusiness units transfer their interest\nrate risk to Treasury and CIO through\nfunds transfer pricing, which takes\ninto account the elements of interest\nrate exposure that can be risk-managed\nin financial markets. These elements\ninclude asset and liability balances\nand contractual rates of interest,\ncontractual principal payment\nschedules, expected prepayment\nexperience, interest rate reset dates\nand maturities, rate indices used for\nrepricing, and any interest rate\nceilings or floors for adjustable rate\nproducts.\n\nOne way the Firm evaluates its\nstructural interest rate risk is\nthrough earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-\nrisk estimates the Firm\u2019s interest rate\nexposure for a given interest rate\nscenario. It is presented as a\nsensitivity to a baseline, which\nincludes net interest income and\ncertain interest rate sensitive fees.\nThe baseline uses market interest rates\nand in the case of deposits, pricing\nassumptions. The Firm conducts\nsimulations of changes to this baseline\nfor interest rate-sensitive assets and\nliabilities denominated in U.S. dollars\nand other currencies (\u201cnon-U.S. dollar\u201d\ncurrencies). These simulations\nprimarily include retained loans,\ndeposits, deposits with banks,\ninvestment securities, long-term debt\nand any related interest rate hedges,\nand funds transfer pricing of positions\nin risk management VaR and other\nsensitivity-based measures as described\non page 136.\n                                              \n  140    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nEarnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the\npotential change to a net interest\nincome baseline, over the following 12\nmonths utilizing multiple assumptions.\nThese scenarios include a parallel\nshift involving changes to both short-\nterm and long-term rates by an equal\namount; a steeper yield curve involving\nholding short-term rates constant and\nincreasing long-term rates; and a\nflatter yield curve involving\nincreasing short-term rates and holding\nlong-term rates constant. These\nscenarios consider many different\nfactors, including: \u2022 The impact on\nexposures as a result of instantaneous\nchanges in interest rates from baseline\nrates. \u2022 Forecasted balance sheet, as\nwell as modeled prepayment and\nreinvestment behavior, but do not\ninclude assumptions about actions that\ncould be taken by the Firm or its\nclients and customers in response to\nany such instantaneous rate changes.\nMortgage prepayment assumptions are\nbased on the interest rates used in the\nscenarios compared with underlying\ncontractual rates, the time since\norigination, and other factors which\nare updated periodically based on\nhistorical experience. \u2022 The pricing\nsensitivity of deposits, known as\ndeposit betas, represent the amount by\nwhich deposit rates paid could change\nupon a given change in market interest\nrates over the cycle. The deposit rates\npaid in these scenarios may differ from\nactual deposit rates paid, due to\nrepricing lags and other factors. The\nFirm\u2019s earnings-at-risk scenarios are\nperiodically evaluated and enhanced in\nresponse to changes in the composition\nof the Firm\u2019s balance sheet, changes in\nmarket conditions, improvements in the\nFirm\u2019s simulation and other factors.\nWhile a relevant measure of the Firm\u2019s\ninterest rate exposure, the earnings at\nrisk analysis does not represent a\nforecast of the Firm\u2019s net interest\nincome (Refer to Outlook on page 49 for\nadditional information) .\n\nThe Firm\u2019s U.S. dollar sensitivities\nare presented in the table below.\n                                                            \n  December 31,                                              \n  (in billions)                                             \n  Parallel shift:                          2020       2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  +100 bps shift in rates               $   6.9    $   0.3  \n  Steeper yield curve:                                      \n  +100 bps shift in long-term rates         2.4        1.2  \n  Flatter yield curve:                                      \n  +100 bps shift in short-term rates        4.5       -0.9  \n                                                            \nThe change in the Firm\u2019s U.S. dollar\nsensitivities as of December 31, 2020\ncompared to December 31, 2019 reflected\nupdates to the Firm\u2019s baseline for\nlower short-term and long-term rates as\nwell as the impact of changes in the\nFirm\u2019s balance sheet. In addition,\nduring the fourth quarter of 2020 as\npart of the Firm\u2019s continuous\nevaluation and periodic enhancement to\nits earnings-at-risk calculations, the\nFirm updated the deposit rates paid\nbetas for consumer deposit products\nbased upon observed pricing during the\nmost recent economic cycle. In the\nabsence of this update, the Firm\u2019s U.S.\ndollar sensitivities as of December 31,\n2020 would have been lower by $2.0\nbillion to the +100bps shift in short-\nterm and parallel rate scenarios. The\nFirm\u2019s sensitivity to rates is\nprimarily a result of assets repricing\nat a faster pace than deposits. Based\nupon current and implied market rates\nas of December 31, 2020, scenarios\nreflecting lower rates could result in\nnegative interest rates. The U.S. has\nnever experienced an interest rate\nenvironment where the Federal Reserve\nhas a negative interest rate policy.\nWhile the impact of negative interest\nrates on the Firm's earnings-at-risk\nwould vary by scenario, a parallel\nshift downward of up to 100bps would\nnegatively impact net interest income.\nIn a negative interest rate\nenvironment, the modeling assumptions\nused for certain assets and liabilities\nrequire additional management judgment\nand therefore, the actual outcomes may\ndiffer from these assumptions.

Country exposure\nincludes activity with both government\nand private-sector entities in a\ncountry.\n\nUnder the Firm\u2019s internal country risk\nmanagement approach, attribution of\nexposure to an individual country is\nbased on the country where the largest\nproportion of the assets of the\ncounterparty, issuer, obligor or\nguarantor are located or where the\nlargest proportion of its revenue is\nderived, which may be different than\nthe domicile (i.e. legal residence) or\ncountry of incorporation.\n\nIndividual country exposures reflect an\naggregation of the Firm\u2019s risk to an\nimmediate default, with zero recovery,\nof the counterparties, issuers,\nobligors or guarantors attributed to\nthat country. Activities which result\nin contingent or indirect exposure to a\ncountry are not included in the country\nexposure measure (for exa mple,\nproviding clearing services or\nsecondary exposure to collateral on\nsecurities financing receivables).\n\nAssumptions are sometimes required in\ndetermining the measurement and\nallocation of country exposure,\nparticularly in the case of certain\nnon-linear or index products, or where\nthe nature of the counterparty, issuer,\n\nobligor or guarantor is not suitable\nfor attribution to an individual\ncountry. The use of different\nmeasurement approaches or assumptions\ncould affect the amount of reported\ncountry exposure.\n\nUnder the Firm\u2019s internal country risk\nmeasurement framework:\n\n\u2022 Lending exposures are measured at the\ntotal committed amount (funded and\nunfunded), net of the allowance for\ncredit losses and eligible cash and\nmarketable securities collateral\nreceived\n\n\u2022 Deposits are measured as the cash\nbalances placed with central and\ncommercial banks\n\n\u2022 Securities financing exposures are\nmeasured at their receivable balance,\nnet of eligible collateral received\n\n\u2022 Debt and equity securities are\nmeasured at the fair value of all\npositions, including both long and\nshort positions\n\n\u2022 Counterparty exposure on derivative\nreceivables is measured at the\nderivative\u2019s fair value, net of the\nfair value of the eligible collateral\nreceived\n\n\u2022 Credit derivatives protection\npurchased and sold is reported based on\nthe underlying reference entity and is\nmeasured at the notional amount of\nprotection purchased or sold, net of\nthe fair value of the recognized\nderivative receivable or payable.\nCredit derivatives protection purchased\nand sold in the Firm\u2019s market-making\nactivities is measured on a net basis,\nas such activities often result in\nselling and purchasing protection\nrelated to the same underlying\nreference entity; this reflects the\nmanner in which the Firm manages these\nexposures\n\nThe Firm\u2019s internal country risk\nreporting differs from the reporting\nprovided under the FFIEC bank\nregulatory requirements.

These tailored stress results are used to inform\npotential risk reduction across the Firm, as necessary. COVID-19 Pandemic Country\nRisk Management continues to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,\nleveraging existing stress testing, exposure reporting and controls, as well as\ntailored analysis, to assess the extent to which individual countries may be\nadversely impacted. Risk reporting Country exposure and stress are measured and\nreported regularly, and used by Country Risk Management to identify trends, and\nmonitor high usages and breaches against limits. For country risk management\npurposes, the Firm may report exposure to jurisdictions that are not fully\nautonomous, including Special Administrative Regions (\u201cSAR\u201d) and dependent\nterritories, separately from the independent sovereign states with which they are\nassociated. The following table presents the Firm\u2019s top 20 exposures by country\n(excluding the U.S.) as of December 31, 2020, and their comparative exposures as\nof December 31, 2019. The selection of countries represents the Firm\u2019s largest\ntotal exposures by individual country, based on the Firm\u2019s internal country risk\nmanagement approach, and does not represent the Firm\u2019s view of any actual or\npotentially adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluct uate from\nperiod to period due to client activity and market flows. The overall increase in\ntop 20 exposures was largely driven by client activity and growth in client\ndeposits, relative to the period ending December 31, 2019. This resulted in an\nincrease in cash placements with the central banks of Germany and the United\nKingdom.\n                                                                                  \n  Top                                                                             \n  20                                                                              \n  cou\u2026                                                                            \n  (ex\u2026                                                                            \n  the                                                                             \n  U.S\u2026                                                                            \n  Dec\u2026                                                                            \n  31,                Lend\u2026       Tra\u2026                                             \n  (in                  and        and                   Tot\u2026                Tot\u2026  \n  bil\u2026    2020       depo\u2026       inv\u2026       Othe\u2026       exp\u2026    2019\u2026       exp\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Ger\u2026            $  120.8    $   5.8    $    0.6    $  127\u2026             $  51.6  \n  Uni\u2026                57.2        9.4         1.8       68.4                42.4  \n  Kin\u2026                                                                            \n  Jap\u2026                36.7        8.6         0.3       45.6                43.8  \n  Chi\u2026                 9.7        9.9         1.6       21.2                19.2  \n  Fra\u2026                13.4        4.6         0.8       18.8                18.1  \n  Swi\u2026                14.7        0.5         3.5       18.7                18.3  \n  Aus\u2026                 9.9        5.7         0.3       15.9                11.7  \n  Can\u2026                13.4        0.9         0.2       14.5                13.2  \n  Lux\u2026                11.1        1.3           \u2014       12.4                12.9  \n  Bra\u2026                 4.2        6.6           \u2014       10.8                 7.2  \n  Ind\u2026                 3.9        5.1         1.5       10.5                11.3  \n  Sou\u2026                 5.4        4.3         0.4       10.1                 6.4  \n  Kor\u2026                                                                            \n  Ita\u2026                 4.7        4.7         0.3        9.7                 6.8  \n  Sin\u2026                 4.0        2.7         2.0        8.7                 6.8  \n  Net\u2026                 5.4        0.1         2.2        7.7                 5.8  \n  Hong                                                                            \n  Kong                 3.7        1.9         0.6        6.2                 5.1  \n  SAR                                                                             \n  Spa\u2026                 4.1        1.6         0.1        5.8                 5.8  \n  Sau\u2026                 4.9        0.9           \u2014        5.8                 5.2  \n  Ara\u2026                                                                            \n  Mex\u2026                 3.9        1.0           \u2014        4.9                 4.7  \n  Swe\u2026                 5.4       -1.1           \u2014        4.3                 1.1  \n                                                                                  \n(a) Country exposures presented in the\ntable reflect 90% and 87% of total\nFirmwide non-U.S. exposure, where\nexposure is attributed to an individual\ncountry, at December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively.

Operational\nrisk is inherent in the Firm\u2019s\nactivities and can manifest itself in\nvarious ways, including fraudulent\nacts, business interruptions, cyber\nattacks, inappropriate employee\nbehavior, failure to comply with\napplicable laws and regulations or\nfailure of vendors to perform in\naccordance with their agreements.\nOperational Risk Management attempts to\nmanage operational risk at appropriate\nlevels in light of the Firm\u2019s financial\nposition, the characteristics of its\nbusinesses, and the markets and\nregulatory environments in which it\noperates.\n                                                                                  \n  Operational Risk Management Framework                                           \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm\u2019s Compliance, Conduct, and\nOperational Risk (\u201cCCOR\u201d) Management\nFramework is designed to enable the\nFirm to govern, identify, measure,\nmonitor and test, manage and report on\nthe Firm\u2019s operational risk.\n\nOperational Risk Governance\n\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible\nfor the management of operational risk.\nThe Control Management Organization,\nwhich consists of control managers\nwithin each LOB and Corporate, is\nresponsible for the day-to-day\nexecution of the CCOR Framework and the\nevaluation of the effectiveness of\ntheir control environments to determine\nwhere targeted remediation efforts may\nbe required.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s Global Chief Compliance\nOfficer (\u201cCCO\u201d) and FRE for Operational\nRisk is responsible for defining the\nCCOR Management Framework and\nestablishing minimum standards for its\nexecution. Operational Risk Officers\n(\u201cOROs\u201d) report to both the LOB CROs\nand to the FRE for Operational Risk,\nand are independent of the respective\nbusinesses or functions they oversee.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s CCOR Management policy\nestablishes the CCOR Management\nFramework for the Firm. The CCOR\nManagement Framework is articulated in\nthe Risk Governance and Oversight\nPolicy which is reviewed and approved\nby the Board Risk Committee\nperiodically.\n\nOperational Risk identification\n\nThe Firm utilizes a structured risk and\ncontrol self-assessment process that is\nexecuted by the LOBs and Corporate. As\npart of this process, the LOBs and\nCorporate evaluate the effectiveness of\ntheir control environment to assess\nwhere controls have failed, and to\ndetermine where remediation efforts may\nbe required. The Firm\u2019s Operational\nRisk and Compliance organization\n(\u201cOperational Risk and Compliance\u201d)\nprovides oversight of these activities\nand may also perform independent\nassessments of significant operational\nrisk events and areas of concentrated\nor emerging risk.\n\nOperational Risk Measurement\n\nOperational Risk and Compliance\nperforms independent risk assessments\nof the Firm\u2019s operational risks, which\nincludes assessing the effectiveness of\nthe control environment and reporting\nthe results to senior management.\n\nIn addition, operational risk\nmeasurement includes operational risk-\nbased capital and operational risk loss\nprojections under both baseline and\nstressed conditions.\n\nThe primary component of the\noperational risk capital estimate is\nthe Loss Distribution Approach (\u201cLDA\u201d)\nstatistical model, which simulates the\nfrequency and severity of future\noperational risk loss projections based\non historical data. The LDA model is\nused to estimate an aggregate\noperational risk loss over a one-year\ntime horizon, at a 99.9% confidence\nlevel. The LDA model incorporates\nactual internal operational risk losses\nin the quarter following the period in\nwhich those losses were realized, and\nthe calculation generally continues to\nreflect such losses even after the\nissues or business activities giving\nrise to the losses have been remediated\nor reduced.\n\nAs required under the Basel III capital\nframework, the Firm\u2019s operational risk-\nbased capital methodology, which uses\nthe Advanced Measurement Approach\n(\u201cAMA\u201d), incorporates internal and\nexternal losses as well as management\u2019s\nview of tail risk captured through\noperational risk scenario analysis, and\nevaluation of key business environment\nand internal control metrics. The Firm\ndoes not reflect the impact of\ninsurance in its AMA estimate of\noperational risk capital.\n\nThe Firm considers the impact of\nstressed economic conditions on\noperational risk losses and develops a\nforward looking view of material\noperational risk events that may occur\nin a stressed environment. The Firm\u2019s\noperational risk stress testing\nframework is utilized in calculating\nresults for the Firm\u2019s CCAR and other\nstress testing processes.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management\nsection, on pages 91-101 for\ninformation related to operational risk\nRWA, and CCAR.\n\nOperational Risk Monitoring and testing\n\nThe results of risk assessments\nperformed by Operational Risk and\nCompliance are leveraged as one of the\nkey criteria in the independent\nmonitoring and testing of the LOBs and\nCorporate\u2019s compliance with laws and\nregulation. Through monitoring and\ntesting, Operational Risk and\nCompliance independently identify areas\nof operational risk and tests the\neffectiveness of controls within the\nLOBs and Corporate.\n\nManagement of Operational Risk\n\nThe operational risk areas or issues\nidentified through monitoring and\ntesting are escalated to the LOBs and\nCorporate to be remediated through\naction plans, as needed, to mitigate\noperational risk.

Operational Risk\nand Compliance has established\nstandards to ensure that consistent\noperational risk reporting and\noperational risk reports are produced\non a Firmwide basis as well as by the\nLOBs and Corporate. Reporting includes\nthe evaluation of key risk indicators\nand key performance indicators against\nestablished thresholds as well as the\nassessment of different types of\noperational risk against stated risk\nappetite. The standards reinforce\nescalation protocols to senior\nmanagement and to the Board of\nDirectors.\n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\n\nUnder the CCOR Management Framework,\nOperational Risk and Compliance\nmonitors and assesses COVID-19 related\nlegal and regulatory developments\nassociated with the Firm\u2019s financial\nproducts and services offered to\nclients and customers as part of the\nexisting change management process. The\nFirm will continue to review and assess\nthe impact of the pandemic on\noperational risk and implement adequate\nmeasures as needed.\n                                                                                  \n  Subcategories and examples of operational risks                                 \n                                                                                  \nOperational risk can manifest itself in\nvarious ways. Operational risk\nsubcategories such as Compliance risk,\nConduct risk, Legal risk, and\nEstimations and Model risk as well as\nother operational risks, can lead to\nlosses which are captured through the\nFirm\u2019s operational risk measurement\nprocesses. Refer to pages 148, 149, 150\nand 151, respectively for more\ninformation on Compliance, Conduct,\nLegal, and Estimations and Model risk.\nDetails on other select examples of\noperational risks are provided below.\n\nCybersecurity risk\n\nCybersecurity risk is the risk of the\nFirm\u2019s exposure to harm or loss\nresulting from misuse or abuse of\ntechnology by malicious actors.\nCybersecurity risk is an important and\ncontinuously evolving focus for the\nFirm. Significant resources are devoted\nto protecting and enhancing the\nsecurity of computer systems, software,\nnetworks and other technology assets.\nThe Firm\u2019s security efforts are\ndesigned to protect against, among\nother things, cybersecurity attacks by\nunauthorized parties attempting to\nobtain access to confidential\ninformation, destroy data, disrupt or\ndegrade service, sabotage systems or\ncause other damage.\n\nOngoing business expansions may expose\nthe Firm to potential new threats as\nwell as expanded regulatory scrutiny\nincluding the introduction of new\ncybersecurity requirements. The Firm\ncontinues to make significant\ninvestments in enhancing its cyber\ndefense capabilities and to strengthen\nits partnerships with the appropriate\ngovernment and law enforcement agencies\nand other businesses in order to\nunderstand the full spectrum of\ncybersecurity risks in the operating\nenvironment, enhance defenses and\nimprove resiliency against\ncybersecurity\n\nthreats. The Firm actively participates\nin discussions of cybersecurity risks\nwith law enforcement, government\nofficials, peer and industry groups,\nand has significantly increased efforts\nto educate employees and certain\nclients on the topic of cybersecurity\nrisks.\n\nThird parties with which the Firm does\nbusiness or that facilitate the Firm\u2019s\nbusiness activities (e.g., vendors,\nsupply chain, exchanges, clearing\nhouses, central depositories, and\nfinancial intermediaries) are also\nsources of cybersecurity risk to the\nFirm. Third party cybersecurity\nincidents such as system breakdowns or\nfailures, misconduct by the employees\nof such parties, or cyberattacks could\naffect their ability to deliver a\nproduct or service to the Firm or\nresult in lost or compromised\ninformation of the Firm or its clients.\nClients are also sources of\ncybersecurity risk to the Firm,\nparticularly when their activities and\nsystems are beyond the Firm\u2019s own\nsecurity and control systems. As a\nresult, the Firm engages in regular and\nongoing discussions with certain\nvendors and clients regarding\ncybersecurity risks and opportunities\nto improve security. However, where\ncybersecurity incidents occur as a\nresult of client failures to maintain\nthe security of their own systems and\nprocesses, clients are responsible for\nlosses incurred.\n\nTo protect the confidentiality,\nintegrity and availability of the\nFirm\u2019s infrastructure, resources and\ninformation, the Firm maintains a\ncybersecurity program designed to\nprevent, detect, and respond to\ncyberattacks. The Audit Committee is\nupdated periodically on the Firm\u2019s\nInformation Security Program,\nrecommended changes, cybersecurity\npolicies and practices, ongoing efforts\nto improve security, as well as its\nefforts regarding significant\ncybersecurity events. In addition, the\nFirm has a cybersecurity incident\nresponse plan (\u201cIRP\u201d) designed to\nenable the Firm to respond to attempted\ncybersecurity incidents, coordinate\nsuch responses with law enforcement and\nother government agencies, and notify\nclients and customers, as applicable.\nAmong other key focus areas, the IRP is\ndesigned to mitigate the risk of\ninsider trading connected to a\ncybersecurity incident, and includes\nvarious escalation points. Due to the\nimpact of COVID-19, the Firm increased\nthe use of remote access and also video\nconferencing solutions provided by\nthird parties to facilitate remote\nwork. As a result the Firm took\nadditional precautionary measures to\nmitigate cybersecurity risks.\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Technology\nControl functions are responsible for\ngovernance and oversight of the Firm\u2019s\nInformation Security Program. In\npartnership with the Firm\u2019s LOBs and\nCorporate, the Cybersecurity and\nTechnology Control organization\nidentifies information security risk\nissues and oversees programs for the\ntechnological protection of the Firm\u2019s\ninformation resources including\napplications, infrastructure as well as\nconfidential and personal information\nrelated to the Firm\u2019s customers. The\nCybersecurity and Technology\norganization consists of business\naligned information security managers\nthat are supported within the\norganization by the following products\nthat execute the Information Security\nProgram for the Firm:\n\n\u2022 Cyber Defense & Fraud\n                                              \n  146    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n\u2022 Data Management, Protection & Privacy\n\n\u2022 Identity & Access Management\n\n\u2022 Governance & Controls\n\n\u2022 Production Management & Resiliency\n\n\u2022 Software & Platform Enablement\n\nThe Global Cybersecurity and Technology\nControl governance structure is\ndesigned to identify, escalate, and\nmitigate information security risks.\nThis structure uses key governance\nforums to disseminate information and\nmonitor technology efforts. These\nforums are established at multiple\nlevels throughout the Firm and include\nrepresentatives from each LOB and\nCorporate. Reports containing overviews\nof key technology risks and efforts to\nenhance related controls are produced\nfor these forums, and are reviewed by\nmanagement at multiple levels. The\nforums are used to escalate information\nsecurity risks or other matters as\nappropriate.\n\nThe IRM function provides oversight of\nthe activities designed to identify,\nassess, measure, and mitigate\ncybersecurity risk.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s Security Awareness Program\nincludes training that reinforces the\nFirm's Information Technology Risk and\nSecurity Management policies, standards\nand practices, as well as the\nexpectation that employees comply with\nthese policies. The Security Awareness\nProgram engages personnel through\ntraining on how to identify potential\ncybersecurity risks and protect the\nFirm\u2019s resources and information. This\ntraining is mandatory for all employees\nglobally on a periodic basis, and it is\nsupplemented by Firmwide testing\ninitiatives, including periodic\nphishing tests. Finally, the Firm\u2019s\nGlobal Privacy Program requires all\nemployees to take periodic awareness\ntraining on data privacy. This privacy-\nfocused training includes information\nabout confidentiality and security, as\nwell as responding to unauthorized\naccess to or use of information.\n\nBusiness and technology resiliency risk\n\nBusiness disruptions can occur due to\nforces beyond the Firm\u2019s control such\nas the spread of infectious diseases or\npandemics, severe weather, power or\ntelecommunications loss, accidents,\nfailure of a third party to provide\nexpected services, cyberattack,\nflooding, transit strikes, terrorism,\nhealth emergencies. The safety of the\nFirm\u2019s employees and customers is of\nthe highest priority. The Firmwide\nresiliency program is intended to\nenable the Firm to recover its critical\nbusiness functions and supporting\nassets (i.e., staff, technology and\nfacilities) in the event of a business\ninterruption. The program includes\ngovernance, awareness training, and\ntesting of recovery strategies, as well\nas strategic and tactical initiatives\nto identify, assess, and manage\nbusiness interruption and public safety\nrisks. The strength and proficiency of\nthe Firmwide resiliency program has\nplayed an integral role in maintaining\nthe Firm\u2019s business operations during\nand after various events.\n\nPayment fraud risk\n\nPayment fraud risk is the risk of\nexternal and internal parties\nunlawfully obtaining personal monetary\nbenefit through misdirected or\notherwise improper payment. The risk of\npayment fraud remains at a heightened\nlevel across the industry, particularly\nduring the current COVID-19 pandemic\ndue to the use of contingent forms of\npayment authentication methods, scams\ninvolving the pandemic being\nperpetrated including an increase in\nthe level of fraud attempts against\nconsumers. The complexities of these\nincidents and the strategies used by\nperpetrators continue to evolve. The\nFirm employs various controls for\nmanaging payment fraud risk as well as\nproviding employee and client education\nand awareness trainings. The Firm\u2019s\nmonitoring of customer behavior to\ndetect new fraud strategies is\nperiodically evaluated and enhanced in\nan effort to mitigate these fraud\nrisks.\n\nThird-party outsourcing risk\n\nThe Firm\u2018s Third-Party Oversight\n(\u201cTPO\u201d) and Inter-affiliates Oversight\n(\u201cIAO\u201d) framework assist the LOBs and\nCorporate in selecting, documenting,\nonboarding, monitoring and managing\ntheir supplier relationships including\nservices provided by affiliates. The\nobjectives of the TPO framework are to\nhold suppliers to a high level of\noperational performance and to mitigate\nkey risks including data loss and\nbusiness disruption. The Corporate\nThird-Party Oversight group is\nresponsible for Firmwide training,\nmonitoring, reporting and standards.\n                                                                                  \n  Insurance                                                                       \n                                                                                  \nOne of the ways in which operational\nrisk may be mitigated is through\ninsurance maintained by the Firm.

For example, compliance\nrisks include those associated with\nanti-money laundering compliance,\ntrading activities, market conduct, and\ncomplying with the laws, rules, and\nregulations related to the offering of\nproducts and services across\njurisdictional borders. Compliance risk\nis also inherent in the Firm\u2019s\nfiduciary activities, including the\nfailure to exercise the applicable\nstandard of care (such as the duties of\nloyalty or care), to act in the best\ninterest of clients and customers or to\ntreat clients and customers fairly.\n\nOther functions provide oversight of\nsignificant regulatory obligations that\nare specific to their respective areas\nof responsibility.\n\nOperational Risk and Compliance\nimplements policies and standards\ndesigned to govern, identify, measure,\nmonitor and test, manage, and report on\ncompliance risk.\n                                                                                  \n  Governance and oversight                                                        \n                                                                                  \nOperational Risk and Compliance is led\nby the Firm\u2019s Global CCO and FRE for\nOperational Risk.\n\nThe Firm maintains oversight and\ncoordination of its compliance risk\nthrough the implementation of the CCOR\nRisk Management Framework.

The estimation methods\nare of varying levels of sophistication\nand are used for many purposes, such as\nthe valuation of positions and\nmeasurement of risk, assessing\nregulatory capital requirements,\nconducting stress testing, and making\nbusiness decisions. A dedicated\nindependent function, Model Risk\nGovernance and Review (\u201cMRGR\u201d), defines\nand governs the Firm\u2019s policies\nrelating to the management of model\nrisk and risks associated with certain\nanalytical and judgment-based\nestimations, such as those used in risk\nmanagement, budget forecasting and\ncapital planning and analysis.\n\nThe governance of analytical and\njudgment-based estimations within\nMRGR\u2019s scope follows a consistent\napproach to the approach used for\nmodels, which is described in detail\nbelow.\n\nModel risks are owned by the users of\nthe models within the Firm based on the\nspecific purposes of such models. Users\nand developers of models are\nresponsible for developing,\nimplementing and testing their models,\nas well as referring models to the MRGR\nfor review and approval. Once models\nhave been approved, model users and\ndevelopers are responsible for\nmaintaining a robust operating\nenvironment, and must monitor and\nevaluate the performance of the models\non an ongoing basis. Model users and\ndevelopers may seek to enhance models\nin response to changes in the\nportfolios and in product and market\ndevelopments, as well as to capture\nimprovements in available modeling\ntechniques and systems capabilities.\n\nModels are tiered based on an internal\nstandard according to their complexity,\nthe exposure associated with the model\nand the Firm\u2019s reliance on the model.\nThis tiering is subject to the approval\nof the MRGR. In its review of a model,\nthe MRGR considers whether the model is\nsuitable for the specific purposes for\nwhich it will be used. When reviewing a\nmodel, the MRGR analyzes and challenges\nthe model methodology and the\nreasonableness of model assumptions,\nand may perform or require additional\ntesting, including back-testing of\nmodel outcomes. Model reviews are\napproved by the appropriate level of\nmanagement within the MRGR based on the\nrelevant model tier.\n\nUnder the Firm\u2019s Estimations and Model\nRisk Management Policy, the MRGR\nreviews and approves new models, as\nwell as material changes to existing\nmodels, prior to implementation in the\noperating environment. In certain\ncircumstances exceptions may be granted\nto the Firm\u2019s policy to allow a model\nto be used prior to review or approval.\nThe MRGR may also require the user to\ntake appropriate actions to mitigate\nthe model risk if it is to be used in\nthe interim. These actions will depend\non the model and may include, for\nexample, limitation of trading\nactivity.\n\nWhile models are inherently imprecise,\nthe degree of imprecision or\nuncertainty can be heightened by the\nmarket or economic environment. This is\nparticularly true when the current and\nforecasted environment is significantly\ndifferent from the historical\nmacroeconomic environments upon which\nthe models were trained, as the Firm\nhas experienced during the COVID-19\npandemic. This uncertainty may\nnecessitate a greater degree of\njudgment and analytics to inform\nadjustments to model outputs than in\ntypical periods.\n\nRefer to Critical Accounting Estimates\nUsed by the Firm on pages 152-155 and\nNote 2 for a summary of model-based\nvaluations and other valuation\ntechniques.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    151  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                  \n  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM  \n                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s accounting policies\nand use of estimates are integral to\nunderstanding its reported results.

The following is a brief\ndescription of the Firm\u2019s critical\naccounting estimates involving\nsignificant judgments.\n                                                                                  \n  Allowance for credit losses                                                     \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses\nrepresents management\u2019s estimate of\nexpected credit losses over the\nremaining expected life of the Firm\u2019s\nfinancial assets measured at amortized\ncost and certain off-balance sheet\nlending-related commitments. The\nallowance for credit losses comprises:\n\n\u2022 The allowance for loan losses, which\ncovers the Firm\u2019s retained loan\nportfolios (scored and risk-rated),\n\n\u2022 The allowance for lending-related\ncommitments, and\n\n\u2022 The allowance for credit losses on\ninvestment securities, which covers the\nFirm\u2019s HTM and AFS securities.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses\ninvolves significant judgment on a\nnumber of matters including development\nand weighting of macroeconomic\nforecasts, incorporation of historical\nloss experience, assessment of risk\ncharacteristics, assignment of risk\nratings, valuation of collateral, and\nthe determination of remaining expected\nlife. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for\nfurther information on these judgments\nas well as the Firm\u2019s policies and\nmethodologies used to determine the\nFirm\u2019s allowance for credit losses.\n\nOne of the most significant judgments\ninvolved in estimating the Firm\u2019s\nallowance for credit losses relates to\nthe macroeconomic forecasts used to\nestimate credit losses over the eight-\nquarter forecast period within the\nFirm\u2019s methodology. The eight-quarter\nforecast incorporates hundreds of\nmacroeconomic variables (\u201cMEVs\u201d) that\nare relevant for exposures across the\nFirm, with modeled credit losses being\ndriven primarily by a subset of less\nthan twenty variables. The specific\nvariables that have the greatest effect\non the modeled losses of each portfolio\nvary by portfolio and geography.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio\ninclude U.S. unemployment, house price\nindex (\u201cHPI\u201d) and U.S. real gross\ndomestic product (\u201cGDP\u201d).\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio\ninclude U.S. real GDP, U.S.\nunemployment, U.S. equity prices,\ncorporate credit spreads, oil prices,\ncommercial real estate prices and HPI.\n\nChanges in the Firm\u2019s assumptions and\nforecasts of economic conditions could\nsignificantly affect its estimate of\nexpected credit losses in the portfolio\nat the balance sheet date or lead to\nsignificant changes in the estimate\nfrom one reporting period to the next.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a\nweak labor market and weak overall\neconomic conditions that will continue\nto affect borrowers across the Firm\u2019s\nconsumer and wholesale lending\nportfolios. Significant judgment is\nrequired to estimate the severity and\nduration of the current economic\ndownturn, as well as its potential\nimpact on borrower defaults and loss\nseverities. In particular,\nmacroeconomic conditions and forecasts\nregarding the duration and severity of\nthe economic downturn caused by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic have been rapidly\nchanging and remain highly uncertain.\nIt is difficult to predict exactly how\nborrower behavior will be impacted by\nthese changes in economic conditions.\nThe effectiveness of government\nsupport, customer assistance and\nenhanced unemployment benefits should\nact as mitigants to credit losses, but\nthe extent of the mitigation impact\nremains uncertain.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate how\npotential changes in any one factor or\ninput might affect the overall\nallowance for credit losses because\nmanagement considers a wide variety of\nfactors and inputs in estimating the\nallowance for credit losses. Changes in\nthe factors and inputs considered may\nnot occur at the same rate and may not\nbe consistent across all geographies or\nproduct types, and changes in factors\nand inputs may be directionally\ninconsistent, such that improvement in\none factor or input may offset\ndeterioration in others.\n\nTo consider the impact of a\nhypothetical alternate macroeconomic\nforecast, the Firm compared the modeled\ncredit losses determined using its\ncentral and relative adverse\nmacroeconomic scenarios, which are two\nof the five scenarios considered in\nestimating the allowances for loan\nlosses and lending-related commitments.\nThe central and relative adverse\nscenarios each included a full suite of\nMEVs, but differed in the levels, paths\nand peaks/troughs of those variables\nover the eight-quarter forecast period.\n\nFor example, compared to the Firm\u2019s\ncentral scenario described on page 132\nand in Note 13, the Firm\u2019s relative\nadverse scenario assumes a\nsignificantly elevated U.S.\nunemployment rate throughout 2021,\naveraging 3.0% higher over the eight-\nquarter forecast, with a peak\ndifference of approximately 4.0% in the\nsecond quarter of 2021; lower U.S. real\nGDP with a slower recovery,\n                                              \n  152    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nremaining nearly 2.6% lower at the end\nof the eight-quarter forecast, with a\npeak difference of nearly 4.1% in the\nthird quarter of 2021; and a 10.1%\nfurther deterioration in the national\nHPI with a trough in the first quarter\nof 2022. This analysis is not intended\nto estimate expected future changes in\nthe allowance for credit losses, for a\nnumber of reasons, including: \u2022 the\nFirm has placed significant weight on\nits adverse scenarios in estimating its\nallowance for credit losses as of\nDecember 31, 2020 , and accordingly,\nthe existing allowance already reflects\ncredit losses beyond those estimated\nunder the central scenario \u2022 the\nimpacts of changes in many MEVs are\nboth interrelated and nonlinear, so the\nresults of this analysis cannot be\nsimply extrapolated for more severe\nchanges in macroeconomic variables \u2022\nthe COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many\nMEVs at a speed and to degrees not seen\nin recent history, adding significantly\nhigher degrees of uncertainty around\nmodeled credit loss estimations \u2022\nsignificant changes in the expected\nseverity and duration of the economic\ndownturn caused by the COVID-19\npandemic, the effects of government\nsupport and customer assistance, and\nthe speed of the subsequent recovery\ncould significantly affect the Firm\u2019s\nestimate of expected credit losses\nirrespective of the estimated\nsensitivities described below. Without\nconsidering the additional weight the\nFirm has placed on its adverse\nscenarios or any other offsetting or\ncorrelated effects in other qualitative\ncomponents of the Firm\u2019s allowance for\ncredit losses for the lending exposures\nnoted below, the difference between the\nmodeled estimates under the Firm\u2019s\nrelative adverse and central scenarios\nat December 31, 2020 would result in\nthe following: \u2022 An increase of\napproximately $700 million for\nresidential real estate loans and\nlending-related commitments \u2022 An\nincrease of approximately $5.1 billion\nfor credit card loans \u2022 An increase of\napproximately $2.8 billion for\nwholesale loans and lending-related\ncommitments This analysis relates only\nto the modeled credit loss estimates\nand is not intended to estimate changes\nin the overall allowance for credit\nlosses as it does not reflect any\npotential changes in other adjustments\nto the quantitative calculation, which\nwould also be influenced by the\njudgment management applies to the\nmodeled lifetime loss estimates to\nreflect the uncertainty and imprecision\nof these modeled lifetime loss\nestimates based on then-current\ncircumstances and conditions.\nRecognizing that forecasts of\nmacroeconomic conditions are inherently\nuncertain, particularly in light of the\nrecent economic conditions, the Firm\nbelieves that its process to consider\nthe available information and\nassociated risks and\n\nuncertainties is appropriately governed\nand that its estimates of expected\ncredit losses were reasonable and\nappropriate for the period ended\nDecember 31, 2020 .

The level 3 balances would\nbe reduced if netting were applied,\nincluding the netting benefit\nassociated with cash collateral.\nValuation Details of the Firm\u2019s\nprocesses for determining fair value\nare set out in Note 2. Estimating fair\nvalue requires the application of\njudgment. The type and level of\njudgment required is largely dependent\non the amount of observable market\ninformation available to the Firm. For\ninstruments valued using internally\ndeveloped valuation models and other\nvaluation techniques that use\nsignificant unobservable inputs and are\ntherefore classified within level 3 of\nthe valuation hierarchy, judgments used\nto estimate fair value are more\nsignificant than those required when\nestimating the fair value of\ninstruments classified within levels 1\nand 2.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    153  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                            \n                                                                                  \nIn arriving at an estimate of fair\nvalue for an instrument within level 3,\nmanagement must first determine the\nappropriate valuation model or other\nvaluation technique to use. Second, the\nlack of observability of certain\nsignificant inputs requires management\nto assess all relevant empirical data\nin deriving valuation inputs including,\nfor example, transaction details, yield\ncurves, interest rates, prepayment\nspeed, default rates, volatilities,\ncorrelations, prices (such as\ncommodity, equity or debt prices),\nvaluations of comparable instruments,\nforeign exchange rates and credit\ncurves. Refer to Note 2 for a further\ndiscussion of the valuation of level 3\ninstruments, including unobservable\ninputs used.\n\nFor instruments classified in levels 2\nand 3, management judgment must be\napplied to assess the appropriate level\nof valuation adjustments to reflect\ncounterparty credit quality, the Firm\u2019s\ncreditworthiness, market funding rates,\nliquidity considerations, unobservable\nparameters, and for portfolios that\nmeet specified criteria, the size of\nthe net open risk position. The\njudgments made are typically affected\nby the type of product and its specific\ncontractual terms, and the level of\nliquidity for the product or within the\nmarket as a whole. In periods of\nheightened market volatility and\nuncertainty judgments are further\naffected by the wider variation of\nreasonable valuation estimates,\nparticularly for positions that are\nless liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a\nfurther discussion of valuation\nadjustments applied by the Firm.\n\nImprecision in estimating unobservable\nmarket inputs or other factors can\naffect the amount of gain or loss\nrecorded for a particular position.\nFurthermore, while the Firm believes\nits valuation methods are appropriate\nand consistent with those of other\nmarket participants, the methods and\nassumptions used reflect management\njudgment and may vary across the Firm\u2019s\nbusinesses and portfolios.\n\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and\nassumptions in the determination of\nfair value. The use of methodologies or\nassumptions different than those used\nby the Firm could result in a different\nestimate of fair value at the reporting\ndate. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed\ndiscussion of the Firm\u2019s valuation\nprocess and hierarchy, and its\ndetermination of fair value for\nindividual financial instruments.\n                                                                                  \n  Goodwill impairment                                                             \n                                                                                  \nUnder U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be\nallocated to reporting units and tested\nfor impairment at least annually. The\nFirm\u2019s process and methodology used to\nconduct goodwill impairment testing is\ndescribed in Note 15.\n\nManagement applies significant judgment\nwhen testing goodwill for impairment.\nThe goodwill associated with each\nbusiness combination is allocated to\nthe related reporting units for\ngoodwill impairment testing.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020,\nthe Firm reviewed current economic\nconditions, including the potential\nimpacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on\nbusiness performance, estimated market\ncost of equity, as well as actual\nbusiness results and projections of\nbusiness\n\nperformance for all its reporting\nunits. The Firm has concluded that the\ngoodwill allocated to its reporting\nunits was not impaired as of December\n31, 2020. The fair values of these\nreporting units exceeded their carrying\nvalues by at least 15% and did not\nindicate a significant risk of goodwill\nimpairment based on current projections\nand valuations.\n\nThe projections for all of the Firm\u2019s\nreporting units are consistent with\nmanagement\u2019s current business outlook\nassumptions in the short term, and the\nFirm\u2019s best estimates of long-term\ngrowth and return on equity in the\nlonger term. Where possible, the Firm\nuses third-party and peer data to\nbenchmark its assumptions and\nestimates.\n\nRefer to Note 15 for additional\ninformation on goodwill, including the\ngoodwill impairment assessment as of\nDecember 31, 2020.\n                                                                                  \n  Credit card rewards liability                                                   \n                                                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase offers credit cards with\nvarious rewards programs which allow\ncardholders to earn rewards points\nbased on their account activity and the\nterms and conditions of the rewards\nprogram. Generally, there are no limits\non the points that an eligible\ncardholder can earn, nor do the points\nexpire, and the points can be redeemed\nfor a variety of rewards, including\ncash (predominantly in the form of\naccount credits), gift cards and\ntravel. The Firm maintains a rewards\nliability which represents the\nestimated cost of rewards points earned\nand expected to be redeemed by\ncardholders. The liability is accrued\nas the cardholder earns the benefit and\nis reduced when the cardholder redeems\npoints. This liability was $7.7 billion\nand $6.4 billion at December 31, 2020\nand 2019, respectively, and is recorded\nin accounts payable and other\nliabilities on the Consolidated balance\nsheets.\n\nThe rewards liability is sensitive to\nredemption rate (\u201cRR\u201d) and cost per\npoint (\u201cCPP\u201d) assumptions. The RR\nassumption is used to estimate the\nnumber of points earned by customers\nthat will be redeemed over the life of\nthe account. The CPP assumption is used\nto estimate the cost of future point\nredemptions. These assumptions are\nevaluated periodically considering\nhistorical actuals and cardholder\nredemption behavior and updates to them\nwill impact the rewards liability. As\nof December 31, 2020, a combined\nincrease of 25 basis points in RR and 1\nbasis point in CPP would increase the\nrewards liability by approximately $215\nmillion.\n                                                                                  \n  Income taxes                                                                    \n                                                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase is subject to the income\ntax laws of the various jurisdictions\nin which it operates, including U.S.\nfederal, state and local, and non-U.S.\njurisdictions. These laws are often\ncomplex and may be subject to different\ninterpretations. To determine the\nfinancial statement impact of\naccounting for income taxes, including\nthe provision for income tax expense\nand unrecognized tax benefits, JPMorgan\nChase must make assumptions and\njudgments about how to interpret and\napply these complex tax laws to\nnumerous transactions and business\nevents, as well as make judgments\nregarding the timing of when\n                                              \n  154    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \ncertain items may affect taxable income\nin the U.S. and non-U.S. tax\njurisdictions.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s interpretations of tax\nlaws around the world are subject to\nreview and examination by the various\ntaxing authorities in the jurisdictions\nwhere the Firm operates, and disputes\nmay occur regarding its view on a tax\nposition. These disputes over\ninterpretations with the various taxing\nauthorities may be settled by audit,\nadministrative appeals or adjudication\nin the court systems of the tax\njurisdictions in which the Firm\noperates. JPMorgan Chase regularly\nreviews whether it may be assessed\nadditional income taxes as a result of\nthe resolution of these matters, and\nthe Firm records additional reserves as\nappropriate. In addition, the Firm may\nrevise its estimate of income taxes due\nto changes in income tax laws, legal\ninterpretations, and business\nstrategies. It is possible that\nrevisions in the Firm\u2019s estimate of\nincome taxes may materially affect the\nFirm\u2019s results of operations in any\nreporting period.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s provision for income taxes\nis composed of current and deferred\ntaxes. Deferred taxes arise from\ndifferences between assets and\nliabilities measured for financial\nreporting versus income tax return\npurposes. Deferred tax assets are\nrecognized if, in management\u2019s\njudgment, their realizability is\ndetermined to be more likely than not.\nThe Firm has also recognized deferred\ntax assets in connection with certain\ntax attributes, including net operating\nloss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards and foreign\ntax credit (\u201cFTC\u201d) carryforwards. The\nFirm performs regular reviews to\nascertain whether its deferred tax\nassets are realizable. These reviews\ninclude management\u2019s estimates and\nassumptions regarding future taxable\nincome, which also incorporates various\ntax planning strategies, including\nstrategies that may be available to\nutilize NOLs before they expire. In\nconnection with these reviews, if it is\ndetermined that a deferred tax asset is\nnot realizable, a valuation allowance\nis established. The valuation allowance\nmay be reversed in a subsequent\nreporting period if the Firm determines\nthat, based on revised estimates of\nfuture taxable income or changes in tax\nplanning strategies, it is more likely\nthan not that all or part of the\ndeferred tax asset will become\nrealizable. As of December 31, 2020,\nmanagement has determined it is more\nlikely than not that the Firm will\nrealize its deferred tax assets, net of\nthe existing valuation allowance.\n\nThe Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax\nbenefits as necessary when additional\ninformation becomes available.\nUncertain tax positions that meet the\nmore-likely-than-not recognition\nthreshold are measured to determine the\namount of benefit to recognize. An\nuncertain tax position is measured at\nthe largest amount of benefit that\nmanagement believes is more likely than\nnot to be realized upon settlement. It\nis possible that the reassessment of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s unrecognized tax\nbenefits may have a material impact on\nits effective income tax rate in the\nperiod in which the reassessment\noccurs.\n\nRefer to Note 25 for additional\ninformation on income taxes.\n                                                                                  \n  Litigation reserves                                                             \n                                                                                  \nRefer to Note 30 for a description of\nthe significant estimates and judgments\nassociated with establishing litigation\nreserves.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    155  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                            \n                                                                                  \n                                         \n  ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS  \n                                         \n                                                                                  \n  Financial Accounting                                                            \n  Standards Board                                                                 \n  (\u201cFASB\u201d) Standards                                                              \n  Adopted since January                                                           \n  1, 2020                                                                         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Standard                   Summary of guidance        Effects on financial      \n                                                        statements                \n                             \u2022Establishes a single                                \n                             allowance framework for                              \n                             all financial assets                                 \n                             measured at amortized                                \n                             cost and certain                                     \n                             off-balance sheet                                    \n                             credit exposures.

Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because\nof changes in conditions, or that the\ndegree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement has completed an assessment\nof the effectiveness of the Firm\u2019s\ninternal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2020. In\nmaking the assessment, management used\nthe \u201cInternal Control \u2014 Integrated\nFramework\u201d (\u201cCOSO 2013\u201d) promulgated by\nthe Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway\nCommission (\u201cCOSO\u201d).\n\nBased upon the assessment performed,\nmanagement concluded that as of\nDecember 31, 2020, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\ninternal control over financial\nreporting was effective based upon the\nCOSO 2013 framework.

Such procedures included\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures\nin the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles\nused and significant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the\noverall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements.

Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because\nof changes in conditions, or that the\ndegree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n                                                   \n  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP300 Madison AvenueNew  \n  York, NY 10017                                   \n                                                   \n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    159  \n                                              \nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n                                                                                  \n  Critical Audit Matters                                                          \n                                                                                  \nThe critical audit matters communicated\nbelow are matters arising from the\ncurrent period audit of the\nconsolidated financial statements that\nwere communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and\nthat: (i) relate to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the\nconsolidated financial statements and\n(ii) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex\njudgments.

The portfolio-based\ncomponent of the Firm\u2019s allowance for\nloan losses for the wholesale and\ncredit card retained loan portfolios\nbegins with a quantitative calculation\nof expected credit losses over the\nexpected life of the loan by applying\ncredit loss factors to the estimated\nexposure at default. The credit loss\nfactors applied are determined based on\nthe weighted average of five internally\ndeveloped macroeconomic scenarios that\ntake into consideration the Firm's\neconomic outlook as derived through\nforecast macroeconomic variables, the\nmost significant of which are U.S.\nunemployment and U.S. real gross\ndomestic product. This quantitative\ncalculation is further adjusted to take\ninto consideration model imprecision,\nemerging risk assessments, trends and\nother subjective factors that are not\nyet otherwise reflected in the credit\nloss estimate.\n\nThe principal considerations for our\ndetermination that performing\nprocedures relating to the allowance\nfor loan losses for the portfolio-based\ncomponent of the wholesale and credit\ncard loan portfolios is a critical\naudit matter are (i) the significant\njudgment and estimation by management\nin the forecast of macroeconomic\nvariables, specifically U.S.\nunemployment and U.S. real gross\ndomestic product, as the Firm\u2019s\nforecasts of economic conditions\nsignificantly affect its estimate of\nexpected credit losses at the balance\nsheet date, (ii) the significant\njudgment and estimation by management\nin determining the quantitative\ncalculation utilized in their credit\nloss estimates and the adjustments to\ntake into consideration model\nimprecision, emerging risk assessments,\ntrends and other subjective factors\nthat are not yet otherwise reflected in\nthe credit loss estimate, which both in\nturn led to a high degree of auditor\njudgment, subjectivity and effort in\nperforming procedures and in evaluating\naudit evidence obtained relating to the\ncredit\n\nloss estimates and the appropriateness\nof the adjustments to the credit loss\nestimates, and (iii) the audit effort\ninvolved professionals with specialized\nskill and knowledge to assist in\nevaluating the audit evidence.\n\nAddressing the matter involved\nperforming procedures and evaluating\naudit evidence in connection with\nforming our overall opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nThese procedures included testing the\neffectiveness of controls relating to\nthe Firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses,\nincluding controls over model\nvalidation and generation of\nmacroeconomic scenarios. These\nprocedures also included, among others,\ntesting management\u2019s process for\nestimating the allowance for loan\nlosses, which involved (i) evaluating\nthe appropriateness of the models and\nmethodologies used in quantitative\ncalculations; (ii) evaluating the\nreasonableness of forecasts of U.S.\nunemployment and U.S. real gross\ndomestic product; (iii) testing the\ncompleteness and accuracy of data used\nin the estimate; and (iv) evaluating\nthe reasonableness of management\u2019s\nadjustments to the quantitative output\nfor the impacts of model imprecision,\nemerging risk assessments, trends and\nother subjective factors that are not\nyet otherwise reflected in the credit\nloss estimate. These procedures also\nincluded the use of professionals with\nspecialized skill and knowledge to\nassist in evaluating the\nappropriateness of certain models,\nmethodologies and macroeconomic\nvariables .\n\nFair Value of Certain Level 3 Financial\nInstruments\n\nAs described in Notes 2 and 3 to the\nconsolidated financial statements, the\nFirm carries $1.2 trillion of its\nassets and $437.6 billion of its\nliabilities at fair value on a\nrecurring basis. Included in these\nbalances are $10.3 billion of trading\nassets and $41.5 billion of liabilities\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring\nbasis, collectively financial\ninstruments, which are classified as\nlevel 3 as they contain one or more\ninputs to valuation which are\nunobservable and significant to their\nfair value measurement. The Firm\nutilized internally developed valuation\nmodels and unobservable inputs to\nestimate fair value of the level 3\nfinancial instruments. The unobservable\ninputs used by management to estimate\nthe fair value of certain of these\nfinancial instruments include forward\nequity prices, volatility relating to\ninterest rates and equity prices and\ncorrelation relating to interest rates,\nequity prices, credit and foreign\nexchange rates.\n\nThe principal considerations for our\ndetermination that performing\nprocedures relating to the fair value\nof certain level 3 financial\ninstruments is a critical audit matter\nare (i) the significant judgment and\nestimation by management in determining\nthe inputs to estimate fair value,\nwhich in turn led to a high degree of\nauditor judgment, subjectivity, and\neffort in performing procedures related\nto the fair value of these financial\ninstruments, and (ii) the audit effort\ninvolved professionals with specialized\nskill and knowledge to assist in\nevaluating the audit evidence obtained\nfrom these procedures.\n                                              \n  160    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nReport of Independent Registered Public\nAccounting Firm\n\nAddressing the matter involved\nperforming procedures and evaluating\naudit evidence in connection with\nforming our overall opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nThese procedures included testing the\neffectiveness of controls relating to\nthe Firm\u2019s processes for determining\nfair value which include controls over\nmodels, inputs, and data. These\nprocedures also included, among others,\nthe involvement of professionals with\nspecialized skill and knowledge to\nassist in developing an independent\nestimate of fair value for a sample of\nthese financial instruments. Developing\nthe independent estimate involved\ntesting the completeness and accuracy\nof data provided by management,\ndeveloping independent inputs and, as\nappropriate, evaluating and utilizing\nmanagement\u2019s aforementioned\nunobservable inputs; and comparing\nmanagement\u2019s estimate to the\nindependently developed estimate of\nfair value.\n\nFebruary 23, 2021\n\nWe have

(\u201cJPMorgan Chase\u201d or the \u201cFirm\u201d), a financial holding company\nincorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services\nfirm in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment\nbanking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial\nbanking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 32\nfor a further discussion of the Firm\u2019s business segments. The accounting and\nfinancial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to\nU.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting\nand reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. Certain amounts\nreported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current\npresentation. Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the\naccounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling\nfinancial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been\neliminated. Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm\nare not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance\nsheets. The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an\nentity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a\nvariable interest entity. Voting interest entities Voting interest entities are\nentities that have sufficient equity and provide the equity investors voting\nrights that enable them to make significant decisions relating to the entity\u2019s\noperations. For these types of entities, the Firm\u2019s determination of whether it\nhas a controlling interest is primarily based on the amount of voting equity\ninterests held. Entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest,\nthrough ownership of the majority of the entities\u2019 voting equity interests, or\nthrough other contractual rights that give the Firm control, are consolidated by\nthe Firm. Investments in companies in which the Firm has significant influence\nover operating and financing decisions (but does not own a majority of the voting\nequity interests) are accounted for (i) in accordance with the equity method of\naccounting (which requires the Firm to recognize its proportionate share of the\nentity\u2019s net earnings), or (ii) at fair value if the fair value option was\nelected. These investments are generally included in other assets, with income or\nloss included in noninterest revenue. Certain Firm-sponsored asset management\nfunds are structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies. For\nmany of these entities, the Firm is the general partner or managing member, but\nthe non-affiliated partners or members have the ability to remove the Firm as the\ngeneral partner or managing member without cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on\na simple majority vote, or the non-affiliated partners or members have rights to\nparticipate in important decisions. Accordingly, the Firm does not consolidate\nthese voting interest entities. However, in the limited cases where the non-\nmanaging partners or members do not have substantive kick-out or participating\nrights, the Firm evaluates the funds as VIEs and consolidates the funds if the\nFirm is t h e general partner or managing member and has a potentially significant\ninterest. The Firm\u2019s investment companies and asset management funds have\ninvestments in both publicly-held and privately-held entities, including\ninvestments in buyouts, growth equity and venture opportunities. These investments\nare accounted for under investment company guidelines and, accordingly,\nirrespective of the percentage of equity ownership interests held, are carried on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets at fair value, and are recorded in other assets,\nwith income or loss included in noninterest revenue. If consolidated, the Firm\nretains the accounting under such specialized investment company guidelines.\nVariable interest entities VIEs are entities that, by design, either (1) lack\nsufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without\nadditional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) have equity\ninvestors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to\nthe entity\u2019s operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation to\nabsorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual\nreturns of the entity. The most common type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are commonly\nused in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and\ndistribute the cash flows from those assets to investors. The basic SPE structure\ninvolves a company selling assets to the SPE; the SPE funds the purchase of those\nassets by issuing securities to investors. The legal documents that govern the\ntransaction specify how the cash earned on the assets must be allocated to the\nSPE\u2019s investors and other parties that have rights to those cash flows. SPEs are\ngenerally structured to insulate investors from claims on the SPE\u2019s assets by\ncreditors of other entities, including the creditors of the seller of the assets.\nThe primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has a controlling financial\ninterest) is required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. The\nprimary beneficiary is the party that has both (1) the power to direct the\nactivities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic\nperformance; and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the obligation to absorb\nlosses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be\nsignificant to the VIE. To assess whether the Firm has the power to direct the\nactivities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance,\nthe Firm considers all the facts and\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    167  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \ncircumstances, including its role in establishing the VIE and its ongoing rights\nand responsibilities. This assessment includes, first, identifying the activities\nthat most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance; and second,\nidentifying which party, if any, has power over those activities. In general, the\nparties that make the most significant decisions affecting the VIE (such as asset\nmanagers, collateral managers, servicers, or owners of call options or liquidation\nrights over the VIE\u2019s assets) or have the right to unilaterally remove those\ndecision-makers are deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE. To\nassess whether the Firm has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the\nright to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to\nthe VIE, the Firm considers all of its economic interests, including debt and\nequity investments, servicing fees, and derivatives or other arrangements deemed\nto be variable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires that the Firm apply\njudgment in determining whether these interests, in the aggregate, are considered\npotentially significant to the VIE. Factors considered in assessing significance\ninclude: the design of the VIE, including its capitalization structure;\nsubordination of interests; payment priority; relative share of interests held\nacross various classes within the VIE\u2019s capital structure; and the reasons why the\ninterests are held by the Firm. The Firm performs on-going reassessments of: (1)\nwhether entities previously evaluated under the majority voting-interest framework\nhave become VIEs, based on certain events, and are therefore subject to the VIE\nconsolidation framework; and (2) whether changes in the facts and circumstances\nregarding the Firm\u2019s involvement with a VIE cause the Firm\u2019s consolidation\nconclusion to change. Refer to Note 14 for further discussion of the Firm\u2019s VIEs.\nRevenue recognition Interest income The Firm recognizes interest income on loans,\ndebt securities, and other debt instruments, generally on a level-yield basis,\nbased on the underlying contractual rate. Refer to Note 7 for further discussion\nof interest income. Revenue from contracts with customers JPMorgan Chase\nrecognizes noninterest revenue from certain contracts with customers , in\ninvestment banking fees, deposit-related fees, asset management administration and\ncommissions, and components of card income, when the Firm\u2019s related performance\nobligations are satisfied. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion of the Firm\u2019s\nrevenue from contracts with customers. Principal transactions revenue JPMorgan\nChase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. Changes in\nfair value are reported primarily in principal transactions revenue. Refer to\nNotes 2 and 3 for further discussion of fair value measurement. Refer to Note 6\nfor further discussion of principal transactions revenue. Use of estimates in the\npreparation of consolidated financial statements The preparation of the\nConsolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue\nand expense, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results\ncould be different from these estimates. Foreign currency translation JPMorgan\nChase revalues assets, liabilities, revenue and expense denominated in non-U.S.\ncurrencies into U.S. dollars using applicable exchange rates. Gains and losses\nrelating to translating functional currency financial statements for U.S.\nreporting are included in the Consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nGains and losses relating to nonfunctional currency transactions, including\nnon-U.S. operations where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, are reported\nin the Consolidated statements of income. Offsetting assets and liabilities U.S.\nGAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables\nwith the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and\npayables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally\nenforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities\nsold and purchased under repurchase agreements and securities borrowed or loaned\nunder securities loan agreements to be presented net when specified conditions are\nmet, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement.\nThe Firm has elected to net such balances when the specified conditions are met.\nThe Firm uses master netting agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk in\ncertain transactions, including derivative contracts, resale, repurchase,\nsecurities borrowed and securities loaned agreements. A master netting agreement\nis a single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions\ngoverned by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a\nsingle payment in a single currency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy,\nfailure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or\nmargin when due). Upon the exercise of derivatives termination rights by the non-\ndefaulting party (i) all transactions are terminated, (ii) all transactions are\nvalued and the positive values of \u201cin the money\u201d transactions are netted against\nthe negative values of \u201cout of the money\u201d transactions and (iii) the only\nremaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted\ntermination amount. Upon exercise of default rights under repurchase agreements\nand securities loan agreements in general (i) all transactions are terminated and\naccelerated, (ii) all values of securities or cash held or to be delivered are\ncalculated, and all such sums are netted against each other and (iii) the only\nremaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted\ntermination amount.\n                                              \n  168    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nTypical master netting agreements for\nthese types of transactions also often\ncontain a collateral/margin agreement\nthat provides for a security interest\nin, or title transfer of, securities or\ncash collateral/margin to the party\nthat has the right to demand margin\n(the \u201cdemanding party\u201d). The\ncollateral/margin agreement typically\nrequires a party to transfer\ncollateral/margin to the demanding\nparty with a value equal to the amount\nof the margin deficit on a net basis\nacross all transactions governed by the\nmaster netting agreement, less any\nthreshold. The collateral/margin\nagreement grants to the demanding\nparty, upon default by the\ncounterparty, the right to set-off any\namounts payable by the counterparty\nagainst any posted collateral or the\ncash equivalent of any posted\ncollateral/margin. It also grants to\nthe demanding party the right to\nliquidate collateral/margin and to\napply the proceeds to an amount payable\nby the counterparty.

Refer to Note\n11 for further discussion of the Firm\u2019s\nsecurities financing agreements.\nStatements of cash flows For JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s Consolidated statements of cash\nflows, cash is defined as those amounts\nincluded in cash and due from banks and\ndeposits with banks. Accounting\nstandard adopted January 1, 2020\nFinancial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses\n(\u201cCECL\u201d) The adoption of this guidance\nestablished a single allowance\nframework for all financial assets\nmeasured at amortized cost and certain\noff-balance sheet credit exposures.\nThis framework requires that\nmanagement\u2019s estimate reflects credit\nlosses over the instrument\u2019s remaining\nexpected life and considers expected\nfuture changes in macroeconomic\nconditions. Refer to Note 13 for\nfurther information. Prior to the\nadoption of the CECL accounting\nguidance, the Firm\u2019s allowance for\ncredit losses represented management\u2019s\nestimate of probable credit losses\ninherent in the Firm\u2019s retained loan\nportfolios and certain lending-related\ncommitments.\nThe following table presents the impacts to the allowance for credit losses and\nretained earnings upon adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2020:\n                                                                                  \n                         December 31,         CECL adoption           January 1,  \n  (in billions)                  2019                impact                 2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Allowance for                                                                   \n  credit losses                                                                   \n  Consumer,                                                                       \n  excluding         $             2.6    $              0.4    $             3.0  \n  credit card(a)                                                                  \n  Credit card                     5.7                   5.5                 11.2  \n  Wholesale(a)                    6.0                  -1.6                  4.4  \n  Firmwide          $            14.3    $              4.3    $            18.6  \n  Retained                                                                        \n  earnings                                                                        \n  Firmwide                                                                        \n  allowance                              $              4.3                       \n  increase                                                                        \n  Balance sheet                                        -0.8                       \n  reclassificat\u2026                                                                  \n  Total pre-tax                                         3.5                       \n  impact                                                                          \n  Tax effect                                           -0.8                       \n  Decrease to                                                                     \n  retained                               $              2.7                       \n  earnings                                                                        \n                                                                                  \n(a) In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated\nbusiness banking and auto dealer loans and lending-related commitments held in CCB\nfrom the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale\nportfolio segment, to align with the methodology applied when determining the\nallowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current\npresentation. Accordingly, $ 0.6billion of the allowance for credit losses at\nDecember 31, 2019 and $( 0.2) billion of the CECL adoption impact were\nreclassified.\n(b) Represents the recognition of the nonaccretable difference on purchased credit\ndeteriorated loans and the Firm's election to recognize the reserve for\nuncollectible accrued interest on credit card loans in the allowance, both of\nwhich resulted in a corresponding increase to loans.\nSecurities Financing Agreements\n\nAs permitted by the guidance, the Firm elected the fair value option for certain\nsecurities financing agreements. The difference between their carrying amount and\nfair value was immaterial and was recorded as part of the Firm\u2019s cumulative-effect\nadjustment. Refer to Note 11 for further information.\n\nInvestment securities\n\nUpon adoption, HTM securities are presented net of an\n\nallowance for credit losses. The guidance also amended the\n\nprevious other-than-temporary impairment (\u201cOTTI\u201d) model\n\nfor AFS securities to incorporate an allowance. Refer to\n\nNote 10 for further information.\n\nCredit quality disclosures\n\nAs a result of the adoption of this guidance, the Firm\n\nexpanded credit quality disclosures for financial assets\n\nmeasured at amortized cost particularly within the retained\n\nloan portfolios. Refer to Note 12 for further information.\n\nPCD loans\n\nThe adoption resulted in a change in the accounting for PCI\n\nloans, which are considered purchased credit deteriorated\n\n(\u201cPCD\u201d) loans under CECL. Upon adoption, the Firm\n\nrecognized the nonaccretable difference on PCD loans in\n\nthe allowance, which resulted in a corresponding increase\n\nto loans. PCD loans are subject to the Firm\u2019s nonaccrual and\n\ncharge-off policies and are now reported in the consumer,\n\nexcluding credit card portfolio\u2019s residential real estate loan\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    169  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \nclass. Refer to Note 12 for further\ninformation. Changes in credit\nportfolio segments and classes In\nconjunction with the adoption of CECL,\nthe Firm reclassified risk-rated loans\nand lending-related commitments from\nthe consumer excluding credit card\nportfolio segment to the wholesale\nportfolio segment, to align with the\nmethodology applied when determining\nthe allowance. The Firm also revised\nits loan classes. Prior- period amounts\nhave been revised to conform with the\ncurrent presentation. Refer to Note 12\nfor further information. Accrued\ninterest receivables As permitted by\nthe guidance, the Firm elected to\ncontinue classifying accrued interest\non loans, including accrued but\nunbilled interest on credit card loans,\nand investment securities in accrued\ninterest and accounts receivables on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets. For\ncredit card loans, accrued interest\nonce billed is then recognized in the\nloan balances, with the related\nallowance recorded in the allowance for\ncredit losses. Changes in the allowance\nfor credit losses on accrued interest\non credit card loans are recognized in\nthe provision for credit losses and\ncharge-offs are recognized by reversing\ninterest income. For other loans and\nsecurities, the Firm generally does not\nrecognize an allowance for credit\nlosses on accrued interest receivables,\nconsistent with its policy to write\nthem off no later than 90 days past due\nby reversing interest income. Capital\ntransition provisions As permitted\nunder the U.S. capital rules issued by\nthe federal banking agencies in 2019,\nthe Firm initially elected to phase-in\nthe January 1, 2020 (\u201cday 1\u201d) CECL\nadoption impact to retained earnings of\n$2.7 billion to CET1 capital, at 25%\nper year in each of 2020 to 2023. As\npart of their response to the impact of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, on March 31,\n2020, the federal banking agencies\nissued an interim final rule (issued as\nfinal on August 26, 2020) that provided\nthe option to delay the effects of CECL\non regulatory capital for two years,\nfollowed by a three-year transition\nperiod (\u201cCECL capital transition\nprovisions\u201d). Refer to Note 27 for\nfurther information. Accounting\nstandards adopted January 1, 2018\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Firm\nadopted several accounting standards\nresulting in a net decrease of $\n183million to retained earnings and a\nnet increase of $ 88million to AOCI.\nThe adoption of the recognition and\nmeasurement guidance resulted in $\n505million of fair value gains in the\nfirst quarter of 2018, recorded in\ntotal net revenue, on certain equity\ninvestments that were previously held\nat cost.\n\nSignificant accounting policies\nThe following table identifies JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s other significant accounting\npolicies and the Note and page where a\ndetailed description of each policy can\nbe found.\n                                                                 \n  Fair value measurement                    Note 2     page 171  \n  Fair value option                         Note 3     page 192  \n  Derivative instruments                    Note 5     page 198  \n  Noninterest revenue and noninterest       Note 6     page 212  \n  expense                                                        \n  Interest income and Interest expense      Note 7     page 215  \n  Pension and other postretirement          Note 8     page 216  \n  employee benefit plans                                         \n  Employee share-based incentives           Note 9     page 221  \n  Investment securities                     Note 10    page 223  \n  Securities financing activities           Note 11    page 229  \n  Loans                                     Note 12    page 232  \n  Allowance for credit losses               Note 13    page 248  \n  Variable interest entities                Note 14    page 253  \n  Goodwill and Mortgage servicing rights    Note 15    page 261  \n  Premises and equipment                    Note 16    page 265  \n  Leases                                    Note 18    page 266  \n  Long-term debt                            Note 20    page 269  \n  Earnings per share                        Note 23    page 274  \n  Income taxes                              Note 25    page 277  \n  Off\u2013balance sheet lending-related                              \n  financial instruments, guarantees and     Note 28    page 283  \n  other commitments                                              \n  Litigation                                Note 30    page 290  \n                                                                 \n                                              \n  170    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n  Note 2 \u2013 Fair value measurement                                                 \n                                                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its\nassets and liabilities at fair value.\nThese assets and liabilities are\npredominantly carried at fair value on\na recurring basis (i.e., assets and\nliabilities that are measured and\nreported at fair value on the Firm\u2019s\nConsolidated balance sheets). Certain\nassets, liabilities and unfunded\nlending-related commitments are\nmeasured at fair value on a\nnonrecurring basis; that is, they are\nnot measured at fair value on an\nongoing basis but are subject to fair\nvalue adjustments only in certain\ncircumstances (for example, when there\nis evidence of impairment). Fair value\nis defined as the price that would be\nreceived to sell an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants\nat the measurement date. Fair value is\nbased on quoted market prices or\ninputs, where available. If prices or\nquotes are not available, fair value is\nbased on valuation models and other\nvaluation techniques that consider\nrelevant transaction characteristics\n(such as maturity) and use, as inputs,\nobservable or unobservable market\nparameters, including yield curves,\ninterest rates, volatilities, prices\n(such as commodity, equity or debt\nprices), correlations, foreign exchange\nrates and credit curves. Valuation\nadjustments may be made to ensure that\nfinancial instruments are recorded at\nfair value, as described below. The\nlevel of precision in estimating\nunobservable market inputs or other\nfactors can affect the amount of gain\nor loss recorded for a particular\nposition. Furthermore, while the Firm\nbelieves its valuation methods are\nappropriate and consistent with those\nof other market participants, the\nmethods and assumptions used reflect\nmanagement judgment and may vary across\nthe Firm\u2019s businesses and portfolios.\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and\nassumptions in the determination of\nfair value. The use of different\nmethodologies or assumptions by other\nmarket participants compared with those\nused by the Firm could result in the\nFirm deriving a different estimate of\nfair value at the reporting date.\nValuation process Risk-taking functions\nare responsible for providing fair\nvalue estimates for assets and\nliabilities carried on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets at fair value. The\nFirm\u2019s VCG, which is part of the Firm\u2019s\nFinance function and independent of the\nrisk-taking functions, is responsible\nfor verifying these estimates and\ndetermining any fair value adjustments\nthat may be required to ensure that the\nFirm\u2019s positions are recorded at fair\nvalue. The VGF is composed of senior\nfinance and risk executives and is\nresponsible for overseeing the\nmanagement of risks arising from\nvaluation activities conducted across\nthe Firm. The Firmwide VGF is chaired\nby the Firmwide head of the VCG (under\nthe direction of the Firm\u2019s\nController), and includes sub-forums\ncovering the CIB, CCB, CB, AWM and\ncertain corporate functions including\nTreasury and CIO.\n\nPrice verification process The VCG\nverifies fair value estimates provided\nby the risk-taking functions by\nleveraging independently derived\nprices, valuation inputs and other\nmarket data, where available. Where\nindependent prices or inputs are not\navailable, the VCG performs additional\nreview to ensure the reasonableness of\nthe estimates. The additional review\nmay include evaluating the limited\nmarket activity including client\nunwinds, benchmarking valuation inputs\nto those used for similar instruments,\ndecomposing the valuation of structured\ninstruments into individual components,\ncomparing expected to actual cash\nflows, reviewing profit and loss\ntrends, and reviewing trends in\ncollateral valuation. There are also\nadditional levels of management review\nfor more significant or complex\npositions. The VCG determines any\nvaluation adjustments that may be\nrequired to the estimates provided by\nthe risk-taking functions. No\nadjustments to quoted prices are\napplied for instruments classified\nwithin level 1 of the fair value\nhierarchy (refer to the discussion\nbelow for further information on the\nfair value hierarchy). For other\npositions, judgment is required to\nassess the need for valuation\nadjustments to appropriately reflect\nliquidity considerations, unobservable\nparameters, and, for certain portfolios\nthat meet specified criteria, the size\nof the net open risk position. The\ndetermination of such adjustments\nfollows a consistent framework across\nthe Firm: \u2022 Liquidity valuation\nadjustments are considered where an\nobservable external price or valuation\nparameter exists but is of lower\nreliability, potentially due to lower\nmarket activity. Liquidity valuation\nadjustments are made based on current\nmarket conditions. Factors that may be\nconsidered in determining the liquidity\nadjustment include analysis of: (1) the\nestimated bid-offer spread for the\ninstrument being traded; (2)\nalternative pricing points for similar\ninstruments in active markets; and (3)\nthe range of reasonable values that the\nprice or parameter could take. \u2022 The\nFirm manages certain portfolios of\nfinancial instruments on the basis of\nnet open risk exposure and, as\npermitted by U.S. GAAP, has elected to\nestimate the fair value of such\nportfolios on the basis of a transfer\nof the entire net open risk position in\nan orderly transaction. Where this is\nthe case, valuation adjustments may be\nnecessary to reflect the cost of\nexiting a larger-than-normal market-\nsize net open risk position. Where\napplied, such adjustments are based on\nfactors that a relevant market\nparticipant would consider in the\ntransfer of the net open risk position,\nincluding the size of the adverse\nmarket move that is likely to occur\nduring the period required to reduce\nthe net open risk position to a normal\nmarket-size. \u2022 Uncertainty adjustments\nrelated to unobservable parameters may\nbe made when positions are valued using\nprices or input parameters to valuation\nmodels\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    171  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \nthat are unobservable due to a lack of\nmarket activity or because they cannot\nbe implied from observable market data.\nSuch prices or parameters must be\nestimated and are, therefore, subject\nto management judgment. Adjustments are\nmade to reflect the uncertainty\ninherent in the resulting valuation\nestimate. \u2022 Where appropriate, the Firm\nalso applies adjustments to its\nestimates of fair value in order to\nappropriately reflect counterparty\ncredit quality (CVA), the Firm\u2019s own\ncreditworthiness (DVA) and the impact\nof funding (FVA), using a consistent\nframework across the Firm. Refer to\nCredit and funding adjustments on page\n188 of this Note for more information\non such adjustments. Valuation model\nreview and approval If prices or quotes\nare not available for an instrument or\na similar instrument, fair value is\ngenerally determined using valuation\nmodels that consider relevant\ntransaction terms such as maturity and\nuse as inputs market-based or\nindependently sourced parameters. Where\nthis is the case the price verification\nprocess described above is applied to\nthe inputs in those models. Under the\nFirm\u2019s Estimations and Model Risk\nManagement Policy, the MRGR reviews and\napproves new models, as well as\nmaterial changes to existing models,\nprior to implementation in the\noperating environment. In certain\ncircumstances exceptions may be granted\nto the Firm\u2019s policy to allow a model\nto be used prior to review or approval.\nThe MRGR may also require the user to\ntake appropriate actions to mitigate\nthe model risk if it is to be used in\nthe interim. These actions will depend\non the model and may include, for\nexample, limitation of trading\nactivity. Valuation hierarchy A three-\nlevel valuation hierarchy has been\nestablished under U.S. GAAP for\ndisclosure of fair value measurements.\nThe valuation hierarchy is based on the\nobservability of inputs to the\nvaluation of an asset or liability as\nof the measurement date. The three\nlevels are defined as follows. \u2022 Level\n1 \u2013 inputs to the valuation methodology\nare quoted prices (unadjusted) for\nidentical assets or liabilities in\nactive markets. \u2022 Level 2 \u2013 inputs to\nthe valuation methodology include\nquoted prices for similar assets and\nliabilities in active markets, and\ninputs that are observable for the\nasset or liability, either directly or\nindirectly, for substantially the full\nterm of the financial instrument. \u2022\nLevel 3 \u2013 one or more inputs to the\nvaluation methodology are unobservable\nand significant to the fair value\nmeasurement. A financial instrument\u2019s\ncategorization within the valuation\nhierarchy is based on the lowest level\nof input that is significant to the\nfair value measurement.\n

mortgage-related.\n\n(b) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option\nelected lending-related positions from trading assets to loans and other assets.\nPrior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.\n\n(c) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of\ncost or net realizable value. \u201cNet realizable value\u201d is a term defined in U.S.\nGAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (\u201ctransaction costs\u201d).\nTransaction costs for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories are either not\napplicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable\nvalue approximates fair value for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories.\nWhen fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below\ncost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because\nunder fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair\nvalue.

To provide consistent\nfair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been\nincluded in each period presented.\n\n(d) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the\namount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).\n\n(e) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value\nper share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be\nclassified in the fair value hierarchy. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair\nvalues of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity\nfunds, real estate and other funds, were $ 670million and $ 684million,\nrespectively. Included in these balances at December 31, 2020 and 2019, were\ntrading assets of $ 52million and $ 54million, respectively, and other assets of $\n618million and $ 630million, respectively.\n\n(f) At December 31, 2020 and 2019, included within loans were $ 15.1billion and $\n19.8billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $ 6.3billion\nand $ 8.2billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential\nmortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to\nsell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $ 8.4billion and $ 13.6billion,\nrespectively.\n\n(g) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative\nreceivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and\npaid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3\nbalances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit\nassociated with cash collateral.\n                                              \n  178    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nLevel 3 valuations\n\nThe Firm has established well-structured processes for determining fair value,\nincluding for instruments where fair value is estimated using significant\nunobservable inputs (level 3). Refer to pages 171-175 of this Note for further\ninformation on the Firm\u2019s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the\ndetermination of fair value for individual financial instruments. Estimating fair\nvalue requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment\nrequired is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information\navailable to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation\nmodels and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and\nare therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments\nused to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when\nestimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2. In\narriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management\nmust first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique\nto use. Second, due to the lack of observability of significant inputs, management\nmust assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including\ntransaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default\nrates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt\nprices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit\ncurves. The following table presents the Firm\u2019s primary level 3 financial\ninstruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those\nfinancial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values\nfor those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the\ndetermination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the\nsignificance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement,\nlevel 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is,\ncomponents that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in\naddition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not\nincluded in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable\ncomponents of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative\npositions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nThe range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and\nlowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a\nproduct/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the\ninput values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the\ninstruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm\u2019s view, the input\nrange, weighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of input\nuncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm\u2019s estimates and\nassumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments\nheld by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of\ncharacteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of\nmarket risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly\ndifferent implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different\nunderlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted average values\nwill therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the\ncharacteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    179  \n                                              \n

The impact of changes in inputs may not be\nindependent, as a change in one unobservable input may give rise to a change in\nanother unobservable input. Where relationships do exist between two unobservable\ninputs, those relationships are discussed below. Relationships may also exist\nbetween observable and unobservable inputs (for example, as observable interest\nrates rise, unobservable prepayment rates decline); such relationships have not\nbeen included in the discussion below. In addition, for each of the individual\nrelationships described below, the inverse relationship would also generally\napply. The following discussion also provides a description of attributes of the\nunderlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs\nused in the valuation of the Firm\u2019s positions. Yield \u2013 The yield of an asset is\nthe interest rate used to discount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow\ncalculation. An increase in the yield, in isolation, would result in a decrease in\na fair value measurement. Credit spread \u2013 The credit spread is the amount of\nadditional annualized return over the market interest rate that a market\nparticipant would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument.\nThe credit spread for an instrument forms part of the discount rate used in a\ndiscounted cash flow calculation. Generally, an increase in the credit spread\nwould result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The yield and the credit\nspread of a particular mortgage-backed security primarily reflect the risk\ninherent in the instrument. The yield is also impacted by the absolute level of\nthe coupon paid by the instrument (which may not correspond directly to the level\nof inherent risk). Therefore, the range of yield and credit spreads reflects the\nrange of risk inherent in various instruments owned by the Firm. The risk inherent\nin mortgage-backed securities is driven by the subordination of the security being\nvalued and the characteristics of the underlying mortgages within the\ncollateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores, LTV ratios for residential\nmortgages and the nature of the property and/or any tenants for commercial\nmortgages. For corporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and\nmunicipalities and other similar instruments, credit spreads reflect the credit\nquality of the obligor and the tenor of the obligation. Prepayment speed \u2013 The\nprepayment speed is a measure of the voluntary unscheduled principal repayments of\na prepayable obligation in a collateralized pool. Prepayment speeds generally\ndecline as borrower delinquencies rise. An increase in prepayment speeds, in\nisolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued\nat a premium to par and an increase in a fair value measurement of assets valued\nat a discount to par. Prepayment speeds may vary from collateral pool to\ncollateral pool, and are driven by the type and location of the underlying\nborrower, and the remaining tenor of the obligation as well as the level and type\n(e.g., fixed or floating) of interest rate being paid by the borrower. Typically\ncollateral pools with higher borrower credit quality have a higher prepayment rate\nthan those with lower borrower credit quality, all other factors being equal.\nConditional default rate \u2013 The conditional default rate is a measure of the\nreduction in the outstanding collateral balance underlying a collateralized\nobligation as a result of defaults. While there is typically no direct\nrelationship between conditional default rates and prepayment speeds,\ncollateralized obligations for which the underlying collateral has high prepayment\nspeeds will tend to have lower conditional default rates. An increase in\nconditional default rates would generally be accompanied by an increase in loss\nseverity and an increase in credit spreads. An increase in the conditional default\nrate, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.\nConditional default rates reflect the quality of the collateral underlying a\nsecuritization and the structure of the securitization itself. Based on the types\nof securities owned in the Firm\u2019s market-making portfolios, conditional default\nrates are most typically at the lower end of the range presented. Loss severity \u2013\nThe loss severity (the inverse concept is the recovery rate) is the expected\namount of future realized losses resulting from the ultimate liquidation of a\nparticular loan, expressed as the net amount of loss relative to the outstanding\nloan balance. An increase in loss severity is generally accompanied by an increase\nin conditional default rates. An increase in the loss severity, in isolation,\nwould result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The loss severity applied\nin valuing a mortgage-backed security investment depends on factors relating to\nthe underlying mortgages, including the LTV ratio, the nature of the lender\u2019s lien\non the property and other instrument-specific factors.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    181  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \nCorrelation \u2013 Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements\nof two variables. Correlation is a pricing input for a derivative product where\nthe payoff is driven by one or more underlying risks. Correlation inputs are\nrelated to the type of derivative (e.g., interest rate, credit, equity, foreign\nexchange and commodity) due to the nature of the underlying risks. When parameters\nare positively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in an increase\nin the other parameter. When parameters are negatively correlated, an increase in\none parameter will result in a decrease in the other parameter. An increase in\ncorrelation can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement.\nGiven a short correlation position, an increase in correlation, in isolation,\nwould generally result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The level of\ncorrelation used in the valuation of derivatives with multiple underlying risks\ndepends on a number of factors including the nature of those risks. For example,\nthe correlation between two credit risk exposures would be different than that\nbetween two interest rate risk exposures. Similarly, the tenor of the transaction\nmay also impact the correlation input, as the relationship between the underlying\nrisks may be different over different time periods. Furthermore, correlation\nlevels are very much dependent on market conditions and could have a relatively\nwide range of levels within or across asset classes over time, particularly in\nvolatile market conditions. Volatility \u2013 Volatility is a measure of the\nvariability in possible returns for an instrument, parameter or market index given\nhow much the particular instrument, parameter or index changes in value over time.\nVolatility is a pricing input for options, including equity options, commodity\noptions, and interest rate options. Generally, the higher the volatility of the\nunderlying, the riskier the instrument. Given a long position in an option, an\nincrease in volatility, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a\nfair value measurement. The level of volatility used in the valuation of a\nparticular option-based derivative depends on a number of factors, including the\nnature of the risk underlying the option (e.g., the volatility of a particular\nequity security may be significantly different from that of a particular commodity\nindex), the tenor of the derivative as well as the strike price of the option.\nForward price - Forward price is the price at which the buyer agrees to purchase\nthe asset underlying a forward contract on the predetermined future delivery date,\nand is such that the value of the contract is zero at inception. The forward price\nis used as an input in the valuation of certain derivatives and depends on a\nnumber of factors including interest rates, the current price of the underlying\nasset, and the expected income to be received and costs to be incurred by the\nseller as a result of holding that asset until the delivery date. An increase in\nthe forward can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement.\nChanges in level 3 recurring fair value measurements The following tables include\na rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in\nfair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the\nfair value hierarchy for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. When a\ndetermination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the\ndetermination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the\noverall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically\ninclude, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable\ncomponents (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to\nexternal sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include\nchanges in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the\nvaluation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable components of\nlevel 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are\nclassified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and\nlevel 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in\nthe following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm\u2019s risk management\nactivities related to such level 3 instruments.\n                                              \n  182    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n

Therefore, it is generally\nnecessary to make adjustments to the\nbase estimate of fair value to reflect\nthese factors. CVA represents the\nadjustment, relative to the relevant\nbenchmark interest rate, necessary to\nreflect counterparty nonperformance\nrisk. The Firm estimates CVA using a\nscenario analysis to estimate the\nexpected positive credit exposure\nacross all of the Firm\u2019s existing\npositions with each counterparty, and\nthen estimates losses based on the\nprobability of default and estimated\nrecovery rate as a result of a\ncounterparty credit event considering\ncontractual factors designed to\nmitigate the Firm\u2019s credit exposure,\nsuch as collateral and legal rights of\noffset. The key inputs to this\nmethodology are (i) the probability of\na default event occurring for each\ncounterparty, as derived from observed\nor estimated CDS spreads; and (ii)\nestimated recovery rates implied by CDS\nspreads, adjusted to consider the\ndifferences in recovery rates as a\nderivative creditor relative to those\nreflected in CDS spreads, which\ngenerally reflect senior unsecured\ncreditor risk. FVA represents the\nadjustment to reflect the impact of\nfunding and is recognized where there\nis evidence that a market participant\nin the principal market would\nincorporate it in a transfer of the\ninstrument. The Firm\u2019s FVA framework,\napplied to uncollateralized (including\npartially collateralized) over-the-\ncounter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives\nincorporates key inputs such as: (i)\nthe expected funding requirements\narising from the Firm\u2019s positions with\n\neach counterparty and collateral\narrangements; and (ii) the estimated\nmarket funding cost in the principal\nmarket which, for derivative\nliabilities, considers the Firm\u2019s\ncredit risk (DVA). For collateralized\nderivatives, the fair value is\nestimated by discounting expected\nfuture cash flows at the relevant\novernight indexed swap rate given the\nunderlying collateral agreement with\nthe counterparty, and therefore a\nseparate FVA is not necessary.\nThe following table provides the impact\nof credit and funding adjustments on\nprincipal transactions revenue in the\nrespective periods, excluding the\neffect of any associated hedging\nactivities. The FVA presented below\nincludes the impact of the Firm\u2019s own\ncredit quality on the inception value\nof liabilities as well as the impact of\nchanges in the Firm\u2019s own credit\nquality over time.\n                                                                    \n  Year ended December 31,                                           \n  (in millions)                         2020       2019       2018  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Credit and funding adjustments:                                   \n  Derivatives CVA                    $  -337    $   241    $   193  \n  Derivatives FVA                        -64        199        -74  \n                                                                    \nValuation adjustments on fair value\noption elected liabilities\n\nThe valuation of the Firm\u2019s liabilities\nfor which the fair value option has\nbeen elected requires consideration of\nthe Firm\u2019s own credit risk.

In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that\nthe fair value of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., demand,\nsavings and certain money market deposits) be equal to their carrying value;\nrecognition of the inherent funding value of these instruments is not permitted.\n                                              \n  190    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nThe following table presents by fair value hierarchy classification the carrying\nvalues and estimated fair values at December 31, 2020 and 2019, of financial\nassets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments that are carried at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis, and their classification within the fair value\nhierarchy.\n                                                                                  \n         \u2026                                       \u2026                                \n         \u2026                                       \u2026                                \n         \u2026                                       \u2026                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                 \u2026                                       \u2026                        \n                 \u2026                                       \u2026                        \n                 \u2026                                       \u2026                        \n                 \u2026                                       \u2026                        \n                                         \u2026                                        \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                \n         \u2026       1       2       3       \u2026       \u2026       1       2                \n                                         \u2026                                        \n                                                                                  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014                \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026                \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026                \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026                \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026                \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026                \n                                                                                  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026                \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026                \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026                \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026                \n                                                                                  \n(a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that\nincorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal,\ncontractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including\nexpected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary\norigination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is\nmeasured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the\nloan takes into account the loan\u2019s allowance for loan losses, which represents the\nloan\u2019s expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference\nbetween the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally\nattributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market\nliquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do\nnot affect its carrying value.\nThe majority of the Firm\u2019s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis on the Consolidated balance sheets.

The Firm has elected to measure\ncertain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income\nstatement volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of\nelected instruments (e.g., certain instruments that otherwise would be accounted\nfor on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements that are\naccounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those\ninstruments that are managed on a fair value basis.

Refer to Note 7 for further information regarding interest\nincome and interest expense.\nDetermination of instrument-specific credit risk for items for which the fair\nvalue option was elected The following describes how the gains and losses that are\nattributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, were determined. \u2022\nLoans and lending-related commitments: For floating-rate instruments, all changes\nin value are attributed to instrument-specific credit risk. For fixed-rate\ninstruments, an allocation of the changes in value for the period is made between\nthose changes in value that are interest rate-related and changes in value that\nare credit-related. Allocations are generally based on an analysis of borrower-\nspecific credit spread and recovery information, where available, or benchmarking\nto similar entities or industries. \u2022 Long-term debt: Changes in value attributable\nto instrument-specific credit risk were derived principally from observable\nchanges in the Firm\u2019s credit spread as observed in the bond market. \u2022 Securities\nfinancing agreements: Generally, for these types of agreements, there is a\nrequirement that collateral be maintained with a market value equal to or in\nexcess of the principal amount loaned; as a result, there would be no adjustment\nor an immaterial adjustment for instrument-specific credit risk related to these\nagreements.\n                                              \n

Unlike principal-protected\nstructured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is\nobligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-\nprotected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the\nFirm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for structured notes\nto return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or\nderivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the\ncredit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-\nprotected notes.\n(e) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the\nbalance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if applicable,\nthe contractual principal payment at the Firm\u2019s next call date.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the contractual amount of lending-related\ncommitments for which the fair value option was elected was $ 18.1billion and $\n8.6billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $( 39) million and $(\n120) million, respectively.

JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its\ncredit portfolios to assess potential credit risk concentrations and to obtain\nadditional collateral when deemed necessary and permitted under the Firm\u2019s\nagreements. Senior management is significantly involved in the credit approval and\nreview process, and risk levels are adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm\u2019s risk\nappetite. In the Firm\u2019s consumer portfolio, concentrations are managed primarily\nby product and by U.S. geographic region, with a key focus on trends and\nconcentrations at the portfolio level, where potential credit risk concentrations\ncan be remedied through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines.\nRefer to Note 12 for additional information on the geographic composition of the\nFirm\u2019s consumer loan portfolios. In the wholesale portfolio, credit risk\nconcentrations are evaluated primarily by industry and monitored regularly on both\nan aggregate portfolio level and on an individual client or counterparty basis.\nThe Firm\u2019s wholesale exposure is managed through loan syndications and\nparticipations, loan sales, securitizations, credit derivatives, master netting\nagreements, collateral and other risk-reduction techniques. Refer to Note 12 for\nadditional information on loans. The Firm does not believe that its exposure to\nany particular loan product or industry segment (e.g., real estate), or its\nexposure to residential real estate loans with high LTV ratios, results in a\nsignificant concentration of credit risk. Terms of loan products and collateral\ncoverage are included in the Firm\u2019s assessment when extending credit and\nestablishing its allowance for loan losses.\n                                              \n  196    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nThe table below presents both on\u2013balance sheet and off\u2013balance sheet consumer and\nwholesale credit exposure by the Firm\u2019s three credit portfolio segments as of\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019. The wholesale industry of risk category is generally\nbased on the client or counterparty\u2019s primary business activity.\nIn conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans\nand lending-related commitments from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio\nsegment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the methodology applied\nwhen determining the allowance.

Because of this collateralization, no\nallowance for credit losses is generally held against these receivables. To manage\nits credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required\nmargin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash\nor other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables\nare reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm\u2019s\nConsolidated balance sheets.\n(g) Excludes cash placed with banks of $ 516.9billion and $ 254.0billion, at\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which is predominantly placed with\nvarious central banks, primarily Federal Reserve Banks.\n(h) Credit exposure is net of risk participations and excludes the benefit of\ncredit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities held against\nderivative receivables or loans and liquid securities and other cash collateral\nheld against derivative receivables.\n(i) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option\nelected lending-related positions from trading assets to loans, which resulted in\na corresponding reclassification of certain off-balance sheet commitments.

JPMorgan\nChase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge\nor manage its own risk exposures. Predominantly all of the Firm\u2019s derivatives are\nentered into for market-making or risk management purposes. Market-making\nderivatives The majority of the Firm\u2019s derivatives are entered into for market-\nmaking purposes. Clients use derivatives to mitigate or modify interest rate,\ncredit, foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks. The Firm actively manages\nthe risks from its exposure to these derivatives by entering into other derivative\ncontracts or by purchasing or selling other financial instruments that partially\nor fully offset the exposure from client derivatives. Risk management derivatives\nThe Firm manages certain market and credit risk exposures using derivative\ninstruments, including derivatives in hedge accounting relationships and other\nderivatives that are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and\nliabilities. The Firm generally uses interest rate derivatives to manage the risk\nassociated with changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate assets and liabilities\nappreciate or depreciate in market value as interest rates change. Similarly,\ninterest income and expense increase or decrease as a result of variable-rate\nassets and liabilities resetting to current market rates, and as a result of the\nrepayment and subsequent origination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and\nliabilities at current market rates. Gains and losses on the derivative\ninstruments related to these assets and liabilities are expected to substantially\noffset this variability. Foreign currency derivatives are used to manage the\nforeign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency\u2013denominated (i.e.,\nnon-U.S. dollar) assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as\nthe Firm\u2019s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose\nfunctional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. As a result of fluctuations in\nforeign currencies, the U.S. dollar\u2013equivalent values of the foreign\ncurrency\u2013denominated assets and liabilities or the forecasted revenues or expenses\nincrease or decrease. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments related to\nthese foreign currency\u2013denominated assets or liabilities, or forecasted\ntransactions, are expected to substantially offset this variability. Commodities\nderivatives are used to manage the price risk of certain commodities inventories.\nGains or losses on these derivative instruments are expected to substantially\noffset the depreciation or appreciation of the related inventory. Credit\nderivatives are used to manage the counterparty credit risk associated with loans\nand lending-related commitments. Credit derivatives compensate the purchaser when\nthe entity referenced in the contract experiences a credit event, such as\nbankruptcy or a failure to pay an obligation when due. Credit derivatives\nprimarily consist of CDS. Refer to the Credit derivatives section on pages 209-211\nof this Note for a further discussion of credit derivatives. Refer to the risk\nmanagement derivatives gains and losses table on page 209 of this Note, and the\nhedge accounting gains and losses tables on pages 206-208 of this Note for more\ninformation about risk management derivatives. Derivative counterparties and\nsettlement types The Firm enters into OTC derivatives, which are negotiated and\nsettled bilaterally with the derivative counterparty. The Firm also enters into,\nas principal, certain ETD such as futures and options, and OTC-cleared derivative\ncontracts with CCPs. ETD contracts are generally standardized contracts traded on\nan exchange and cleared by the CCP, which is the Firm\u2019s counterparty from the\ninception of the transactions. OTC-cleared derivatives are traded on a bilateral\nbasis and then novated to the CCP for clearing. Derivative clearing services The\nFirm provides clearing services for clients in which the Firm acts as a clearing\nmember at certain exchanges and clearing houses. The Firm does not reflect the\nclients\u2019 derivative contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to\nNote 28 for further information on the Firm\u2019s clearing services. Accounting for\nderivatives All free-standing derivatives that the Firm executes for its own\naccount are required to be recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair\nvalue. As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets derivative assets and\nliabilities, and the related cash collateral receivables and payables, when a\nlegally enforceable master netting agreement exists between the Firm and the\nderivative counterparty. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting\nof assets and liabilities. The accounting for changes in value of a derivative\ndepends on whether or not the transaction has been designated and qualifies for\nhedge accounting. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are reported and\nmeasured at fair value through earnings. The tabular disclosures on pages 202-209\nof this Note provide additional information on the amount of, and reporting for,\nderivative assets, liabilities, gains and losses. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for a\nfurther discussion of derivatives embedded in structured notes.\n                                              \n  198    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nDerivatives designated as hedges The Firm applies hedge accounting to certain\nderivatives executed for risk management purposes \u2013 generally interest rate,\nforeign exchange and commodity derivatives. However, JPMorgan Chase does not seek\nto apply hedge accounting to all of the derivatives involved in the Firm\u2019s risk\nmanagement activities. For example, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to\npurchased CDS used to manage the credit risk of loans and lending-related\ncommitments, because of the difficulties in qualifying such contracts as hedges.\nFor the same reason, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to certain interest\nrate, foreign exchange, and commodity derivatives used for risk management\npurposes. To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly effective\nat reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. In addition, for a\nderivative to be designated as a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy\nmust be documented. Hedge documentation must identify the derivative hedging\ninstrument, the asset or liability or forecasted transaction and type of risk to\nbe hedged, and how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed prospectively\nand retrospectively. To assess effectiveness, the Firm uses statistical methods\nsuch as regression analysis, nonstatistical methods such as dollar-value\ncomparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative to the change in the\nfair value or cash flows of the hedged item, and qualitative comparisons of\ncritical terms and the evaluation of any changes in those terms. The extent to\nwhich a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective\nat offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item must be\nassessed and documented at least quarterly. If it is determined that a derivative\nis not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is\ndiscontinued. There are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair value\nhedges, cash flow hedges and net investment hedges. JPMorgan Chase uses fair value\nhedges primarily to hedge fixed-rate long-term debt, AFS securities and certain\ncommodities inventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, the changes in the fair\nvalue of the derivative, and in the value of the hedged item for the risk being\nhedged, are recognized in earnings. Certain amounts excluded from the assessment\nof effectiveness are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings over the life of\nthe derivative. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the adjustment to\nthe hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the hedged item,\nand for benchmark interest rate hedges, is amortized to earnings as a yield\nadjustment. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with\nthe classification of the hedged item \u2013 primarily net interest income and\nprincipal transactions revenue. JPMorgan Chase uses cash flow hedges primarily to\nhedge the exposure to variability in forecasted cash flows from floating-rate\nassets and liabilities and foreign currency\u2013denominated revenue and expense. For\nqualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are\nrecorded in OCI and recognized in earnings as the hedged item affects earnings.\nDerivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the\nclassification of the hedged item \u2013 primarily noninterest revenue, net interest\nincome and compensation expense. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the\nchange in value of the derivative recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when\nthe cash flows that were hedged affect earnings. For hedge relationships that are\ndiscontinued because a forecasted transaction is expected to not occur according\nto the original hedge forecast, any related derivative values recorded in AOCI are\nimmediately recognized in earnings. JPMorgan Chase uses net investment hedges to\nprotect the value of the Firm\u2019s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries\nor branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar.

It is the policy of JPMorgan\nChase to actively pursue, where possible, the use of legally enforceable master\nnetting arrangements and collateral agreements to mitigate derivative counterparty\ncredit risk inherent in derivative receivables.\n\nWhile derivative receivables expose the Firm to credit risk, derivative payables\nexpose the Firm to liquidity risk, as the derivative contracts typically require\nthe Firm to post cash or securities collateral with counterparties as the fair\nvalue of the contracts moves in the counterparties\u2019 favor or upon specified\ndowngrades in the Firm\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 respective credit ratings.

The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon\na downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in\nthe derivative contract.\n                                                                                  \n  Liquidity                                                                       \n  impact of                                                                       \n  downgrade                                                                       \n  triggers                                                                        \n  on OTC                                                                          \n  and                                                                             \n  OTC-clea\u2026                                                                       \n  derivati\u2026                                                                       \n  December              2020                               2019                   \n  31, (in         Single-no\u2026        Two-notch       Single-not\u2026        Two-notch  \n  millions)        downgrade        downgrade         downgrade        downgrade  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Amount of                                                                       \n  addition\u2026                                                                       \n  collater\u2026                                                                       \n  to be        $         119    $       1,243    $          189    $       1,467  \n  posted                                                                          \n  upon                                                                            \n  downgrad\u2026                                                                       \n  Amount                                                                          \n  required                                                                        \n  to settle                                                                       \n  contracts                                                                       \n  with                   153            2,449               104            1,398  \n  terminat\u2026                                                                       \n  triggers                                                                        \n  upon                                                                            \n  downgrad\u2026                                                                       \n                                                                                  \n(a) Includes the additional collateral to be posted for initial margin.\n\n(b) Amounts represent fair values of derivative payables, and do not reflect\ncollateral posted.\n\nDerivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset\n\nIn certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers\nfinancial assets but maintains the economic exposure to the transferred assets by\nentering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the\ninitial transfer.

All derivatives not included in\nthe hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above are included in\nthis category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in\nprincipal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 6 for information on principal\ntransactions revenue.\n\nCredit derivatives Credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is\nderived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the\nreference entity) and which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer\nthat risk to another party (the protection seller). Credit derivatives expose the\nprotection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller, as the\nprotection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the\nreference entity experiences a credit event, such as a bankruptcy, a failure to\npay its obligation or a restructuring. The seller of credit protection receives a\npremium for providing protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument\nreferenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event. The Firm is both a\npurchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these\nderivatives for two primary purposes. First, in its capacity as a market-maker,\nthe Firm actively manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and\nselling credit protection, predominantly on corporate debt obligations, to meet\nthe needs of customers. Second, as an end-user, the Firm uses credit derivatives\nto manage credit risk associated with lending exposures (loans and unfunded\ncommitments) and derivatives counterparty exposures in the Firm\u2019s wholesale\nbusinesses, and to manage the credit risk arising from certain financial\ninstruments in the Firm\u2019s market-making businesses. Following is a summary of\nvarious types of credit derivatives.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    209  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \nCredit default swaps Credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a\nsingle reference entity (\u201csingle-name\u201d) or a broad-based index. The Firm purchases\nand sells protection on both single- name and index-reference obligations. Single-\nname CDS and index CDS contracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared derivative\ncontracts. Single-name CDS are used to manage the default risk of a single\nreference entity, while index CDS contracts are used to manage the credit risk\nassociated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments. Like the S&P\n500 and other market indices, a CDS index consists of a portfolio of CDS across\nmany reference entities. New series of CDS indices are periodically established\nwith a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in the\ncredit markets. If one of the reference entities in the index experiences a credit\nevent, then the reference entity that defaulted is removed from the index. CDS can\nalso be referenced against specific portfolios of reference names or against\ncustomized exposure levels based on specific client demands: for example, to\nprovide protection against the first $ 1million of realized credit losses in a $\n10million portfolio of exposure. Such structures are commonly known as tranche\nCDS. For both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS contracts, upon the\noccurrence of a credit event, under the terms of a CDS contract neither party to\nthe CDS contract has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser\nhas recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of\nthe CDS contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at settlement of\nthe credit derivative contract, also known as the recovery value. The protection\npurchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying reference\nentity in order to receive amounts due under the CDS contract when a credit event\noccurs. Credit-related notes A credit-related note is a funded credit derivative\nwhere the issuer of the credit-related note purchases from the note investor\ncredit protection on a reference entity or an index. Under the contract, the\ninvestor pays the issuer the par value of the note at the inception of the\ntransaction, and in return, the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor,\nbased on the credit risk of the referenced entity. The issuer also repays the\ninvestor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity (or one\nof the entities that makes up a reference index) experiences a specified credit\nevent. If a credit event occurs, the issuer is not obligated to repay the par\nvalue of the note, but rather, the issuer pays the investor the difference between\nthe par value of the note and the fair value of the defaulted reference obligation\nat the time of settlement. Neither party to the credit-related note has recourse\nto the defaulting reference entity. The following tables present a summary of the\nnotional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and\npurchased as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Upon a credit event, the Firm as a\nseller of protection would typically pay out only a percentage of the full\nnotional amount of net protection sold, as the amount actually required to be paid\non the contracts takes into account the recovery value of the reference obligation\nat the time of settlement. The Firm manages the credit risk on contracts to sell\nprotection by purchasing protection with identical or similar underlying reference\nentities. Other purchased protection referenced in the following tables includes\ncredit derivatives bought on related, but not identical, reference positions\n(including indices, portfolio coverage and other reference points) as well as\nprotection purchased through credit-related notes.\n                                              \n  210    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nThe Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary\nmeasure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does\nnot take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the\nrecovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and\neconomic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm\u2019s view, the risks associated\nwith such derivatives.\n                                                                                  \n  Total

customers in investment\nbanking fees, deposit-related fees,\nasset management, administration, and\ncommissions, and components of card\nincome. The related contracts are often\nterminable on demand and the Firm has\nno remaining obligation to deliver\nfuture services. For arrangements with\na fixed term, the Firm may commit to\ndeliver services in the future. Revenue\nassociated with these remaining\nperformance obligations typically\ndepends on the occurrence of future\nevents or underlying asset values, and\nis not recognized until the outcome of\nthose events or values are known.\nInvestment banking fees This revenue\ncategory includes debt and equity\nunderwriting and advisory fees. As an\nunderwriter, the Firm helps clients\nraise capital via public offering and\nprivate placement of various types of\ndebt and equity instruments.\nUnderwriting fees are primarily based\non the issuance price and quantity of\nthe underlying instruments, and are\nrecognized as revenue typically upon\nexecution of the client\u2019s transaction.\nThe Firm also manages and syndicates\nloan arrangements. Credit arrangement\nand syndication fees, included within\ndebt underwriting fees, are recorded as\nrevenue after satisfying certain\nretention, timing and yield criteria.\nThe Firm also provides advisory\nservices, by assisting its clients with\nmergers and acquisitions, divestitures,\nrestructuring and other complex\ntransactions.

In\nconnection with its client-driven\nmarket-making activities, the Firm\ntransacts in debt and equity\ninstruments, derivatives and\ncommodities, including physical\ncommodities inventories and financial\ninstruments that reference commodities.\nPrincipal transactions revenue also\nincludes realized and unrealized gains\nand losses related to: \u2022 derivatives\ndesignated in qualifying hedge\naccounting relationships, primarily\nfair value hedges of commodity and\nforeign exchange risk; \u2022 derivatives\nused for specific risk management\npurposes, primarily to mitigate credit\nrisk and foreign exchange risk. Refer\nto Note 5 for further information on\nthe income statement classification of\ngains and losses from derivatives\nactivities. In the financial commodity\nmarkets, the Firm transacts in OTC\nderivatives (e.g., swaps, forwards,\noptions) and ETD that reference a wide\nrange of underlying commodities. In the\nphysical commodity markets, the Firm\nprimarily purchases and sells precious\nand base metals and may hold other\ncommodities inventories under financing\nand other arrangements with clients.\nThe following table presents all\nrealized and unrealized gains and\nlosses recorded in principal\ntransactions revenue.

The Firm also provides a\nqualified defined contribution plan in\nthe U.S. and maintains other similar\narrangements in certain non-U.S.\nlocations. The principal defined\nbenefit pension plan in the U.S. is a\nqualified noncontributory plan that\nprovides benefits to substantially all\nU.S. employees who were hired prior to\nDecember 2, 2017. The Firm has frozen\nthe U.S. defined benefit pension plan\n(the \u201cPlan Freeze\u201d). Effective as of\nJanuary 1, 2020 (and January 1, 2019\nfor new hires), new pay credits have\nbeen directed to the U.S. defined\ncontribution plan. Interest credits\nwill continue to accrue on the U.S.\ndefined benefit pension plan. As a\nresult of the Plan Freeze, a\ncurtailment was triggered and a\nremeasurement of the U.S. defined\nbenefit pension obligation and plan\nassets occurred as of November 30,\n2018. The plan design change did not\nhave a material impact on the U.S.\ndefined benefit pension plan or the\nFirm\u2019s Consolidated Financial\nStatements. The Firm also has defined\nbenefit pension plans that are offered\nin certain non-U.S. locations based on\nfactors such as eligible compensation,\nage and/or years of service. It is the\nFirm\u2019s policy to fund the pension plans\nin amounts sufficient to meet the\nrequirements under applicable laws. The\nFirm does not anticipate at this time\nmaking any contribution to the U.S.\ndefined benefit pension plan in 2021.\nThe 2021 contributions to the non-U.S.\ndefined benefit pension plans are\nexpected to be $ 50million, of which $\n35million are contractually required.\nThe Firm also has a number of\nnonqualified noncontributory defined\nbenefit pension plans that are\nunfunded. These plans provide\nsupplemental defined pension benefits\nto certain employees.\n\nThe Firm offers postretirement medical\nand life insurance benefits to certain\nU.S. retirees and postretirement\nmedical benefits to certain qualifying\nU.S. and U.K. employees. The Firm\npartially defrays the cost of its U.S.\nOPEB obligation through corporate-owned\nlife insurance (\u201cCOLI\u201d) purchased on\nthe lives of eligible employees and\nretirees. While the Firm owns the COLI\npolicies, certain COLI proceeds (death\nbenefits, withdrawals and other\ndistributions) may be used only to\nreimburse the Firm for its net\npostretirement benefit claim payments\nand related administrative expense. The\nFirm has prefunded its U.S.\npostretirement benefit obligations. The\nU.K. OPEB plan is unfunded. Pension and\nOPEB accounting guidance generally\nrequires that the difference between\nplan assets at fair value and the\nbenefit obligation be measured and\nrecorded on the balance sheet. Plans\nthat are overfunded (excess of plan\nassets over benefit obligation) are\nrecorded in other assets and plans that\nare underfunded (excess benefit\nobligation over plan assets) are\nrecorded in other liabilities. Gains or\nlosses resulting from changes in the\nbenefit obligation and the fair value\nof plan assets are recorded in OCI and\nrecognized as part of the net periodic\nbenefit cost over subsequent periods as\ndiscussed in the Gains and losses\nsection of this Note. Additionally,\nbenefits earned during the year are\nreported in compensation expense; all\nother components of net periodic\ndefined benefit costs are reported in\nother expense in the Consolidated\nstatements of income.\n                                              \n  216    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nThe following table

on plan assets. Amortization of net gains and losses is included\nin annual net periodic benefit cost if, as of the beginning of the year, the net\ngain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the\nfair value of the plan assets. Any excess is amortized over the average expected\nremaining lifetime of plan participants, which for the U.S. defined benefit\npension plans is currently 37years and for the non-U.S. defined benefit pension\nplans is the period appropriate for the affected plan. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, the net gain was primarily attributable to a market-\ndriven increase in the fair value of plan assets, predominantly offset by a\ndecrease in the discount rate.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    217  \n                                              \n

defined\nbenefit pension plan assets is a\nblended weighted average, by asset\nallocation of the projected long-term\nreturns for the various asset classes,\ntaking into consideration local market\nconditions and the specific allocation\nof plan assets. Returns on asset\nclasses are developed using a forward-\nlooking approach and are not strictly\nbased on historical returns.\nConsideration is also given to current\nmarket conditions and the portfolio mix\nof each plan. The discount rate used in\ndetermining the benefit obligation\nunder the U.S. defined benefit pension\nplan was provided by the Firm\u2019s\nactuaries. This rate was selected by\nreference to the yields on portfolios\nof bonds with maturity dates and\ncoupons that closely match each of the\nplan\u2019s projected cash flows.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the Firm\ndecreased the discount rates used to\ndetermine its benefit obligations for\nthe U.S. defined benefit pension plans\nin light of current market interest\nrates, which is expected to decrease\nexpense by approximately $ 64million in\n2021. The 2021 expected long-term rate\nof return on U.S. defined benefit\npension plan assets is 3.00%.\nThe following table represents the effect of a 25-basis point decline in the\nexpected long-term rate of return of 3.00% and discount rate of 2.50%.\n                                                                                  \n  Effect on U.S. defined benefit                                                  \n  pension plans                                                                   \n  (in millions)                        Pension expense    Benefit obligation      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Expected long-term rate of        $               43                        NA  \n  return                                                                          \n  Discount rate                                    -20                   404      \n                                                                                  \n                                              \n  218    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nInvestment strategy and asset allocation The assets of the Firm\u2019s defined benefit\npension plans are held in various trusts and are invested in well-diversified\nportfolios of equity and fixed income securities, cash and cash equivalents, and\nalternative investments. The trust-owned assets of the Firm\u2019s U.S. OPEB plan are\ninvested primarily in fixed income securities. COLI policies used to partially\ndefray the cost of the Firm\u2019s U.S. OPEB plan are invested in separate accounts of\nan insurance company and are allocated to investments intended to replicate equity\nand fixed income indices. The investment policies for the assets of the Firm\u2019s\ndefined benefit pension plans are to optimize the risk-return relationship as\nappropriate to the needs and goals of each plan. Assets are managed by a\ncombination of internal and external investment managers. The Firm regularly\nreviews the asset allocations and asset managers, as well as other factors that\ncould impact the portfolios, which are rebalanced when deemed necessary.\nInvestments held by the Firm\u2019s defined benefit pension and OPEB plans include\nfinancial instruments which are exposed to various risks such as interest rate,\nmarket and credit risks. Exposure to a concentration of credit risk is mitigated\nby the broad diversification of both U.S. and non-U.S. investments. Additionally,\nthe investments in each of the collective investment funds and/or registered\ninvestment companies are further diversified into various financial instruments.\nAs of December 31, 2020, assets held by the Firm\u2019s defined benefit pension and\nOPEB plans do not include securities issued by JPMorgan Chase or its affiliates,\nexcept through indirect exposures through investments in ETFs, mutual funds and\ncollective investment funds managed by third-parties. The defined benefit pension\nand OPEB plans hold investments that are sponsored or managed by affiliates of\nJPMorgan Chase in the amount of $ 2.7billion and $ 3.1billion, as of December 31,\n2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe following table presents the weighted-average asset allocation of the fair\nvalues of total plan assets at December 31 for the years indicated, as well as the\nrespective approved asset allocation ranges by asset class.\n                                                                                  \n                               U.S. defined                                       \n                            benefit pension                                       \n                                    plan(c)                                       \n                                      Asset       % of plan assets                \n  December 31,                   Allocation                   2020       2019     \n  Asset class                                                                     \n  Debt securities(a)                42-100%                     77  %      74  %  \n  Equity securities                    0-40                     15         16     \n  Real estate                           0-4                      1          1     \n  Alternatives(b)                      0-15                      7          9     \n  Total                                 100  %                 100  %     100  %  \n                                                                                  \n(a) Debt securities primarily includes cash and cash equivalents, corporate debt,\nU.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. government, asset-backed and mortgage-\nbacked securities.\n(b) Alternatives primarily include limited partnerships.\n(c) Represents the U.S. defined benefit pension plan only as it is the most\nsignificant plan.

Under the terms of the LTIP, as of December 31,\n2020, 67million shares of common stock were available for issuance through May\n2022. The LTIP is the only active plan under which the Firm is currently granting\nshare-based incentive awards. In the following discussion, the LTIP, plus prior\nFirm plans and plans assumed as the result of acquisitions, are referred to\ncollectively as the \u201cLTI Plans,\u201d and such plans constitute the Firm\u2019s share-based\nincentive plans. RSUs are awarded at no cost to the recipient upon their grant.\nGenerally, RSUs are granted annually and vest at a rate of 50% after two yearsand\n50% after three yearsand are converted into shares of common stock as of the\nvesting date. In addition, RSUs typically include full-career eligibility\nprovisions, which allow employees to continue to vest upon voluntary termination\nbased on age or service-related requirements, subject to post-employment and other\nrestrictions. All RSU awards are subject to forfeiture until vested and contain\nclawback provisions that may result in cancellation under certain specified\ncircumstances. Predominantly all RSUs entitle the recipient to receive cash\npayments equivalent to any dividends paid on the underlying common stock during\nthe period the RSUs are outstanding. Performance share units (\u201cPSUs\u201d) are granted\nannually, and approved by the Firm\u2019s Board of Directors, to members of the Firm\u2019s\nOperating Committee under the variable compensation program. PSUs are subject to\nthe Firm\u2019s achievement of specified performance criteria over a three-year period.\nThe number of awards that vest can range from zeroto 150% of the grant amount. In\naddition, dividends that accrue during the vesting period are reinvested in\ndividend equivalent share units. PSUs and the related dividend equivalent share\nunits are converted into shares of common stock after vesting. Once the PSUs and\ndividend equivalent share units have vested, the shares of common stock that are\ndelivered, after applicable tax withholding, must be held for an additional two-\nyear period, for a total combined vesting and holding period of approximately\nfiveto eightyears from the grant date depending on regulations in certain\ncountries. Under the LTI Plans, stock appreciation rights (\u201cSARs\u201d) and stock\noptions have generally been granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value\nof JPMorgan Chase\u2019s common stock on the grant date. SARs and stock options\ngenerally expire ten yearsafter the grant date. There were no material grants of\nSARs or stock options in 2020, 2019 and 2018. The Firm separately recognizes\ncompensation expense for each tranche of each award, net of estimated forfeitures,\nas if it were a separate award with its own vesting date. Generally, for each\ntranche granted, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from\nthe grant date until the vesting date of the respective tranche, provided that the\nemployees will not become full-career eligible during the vesting period. For\nawards with full-career eligibility provisions and awards granted with no future\nsubstantive service requirement, the Firm accrues the estimated value of awards\nexpected to be awarded to employees as of the grant date without giving\nconsideration to the impact of post-employment restrictions. For each tranche\ngranted to employees who will become full-career eligible during the vesting\nperiod, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant\ndate until the earlier of the employee\u2019s full-career eligibility date or the\nvesting date of the respective tranche. The Firm\u2019s policy for issuing shares upon\nsettlement of employee share-based incentive awards is to issue either new shares\nof common stock or treasury shares. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Firm settled\nall of its employee share-based awards by issuing treasury shares.

Debt securities classified as trading assets are discussed in Note 2.\nPredominantly all of the Firm\u2019s AFS and HTM securities are held by Treasury and\nCIO in connection with its asset-liability management activities. AFS securities\nare carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and\nlosses, after any applicable hedge accounting adjustments or allowance for credit\nlosses, are reported in AOCI. The specific identification method is used to\ndetermine realized gains and losses on AFS securities, which are included in\ninvestment securities gains/(losses) on the Consolidated statements of income. HTM\nsecurities, which the Firm has the intent and ability to hold until maturity, are\ncarried at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses, on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets. For both AFS and HTM securities, purchase discounts or premiums\nare generally amortized into interest income on a level-yield basis over the\ncontractual life of the security. However, premiums on certain callable debt\nsecurities are amortized to the earliest call date. Effective January 1, 2020, the\nFirm adopted the CECL accounting guidance, which also amended the AFS securities\nimpairment guidance. Refer to Note 1 for further information. During 2020, the\nFirm transferred $ 164.2billion of investment securities from AFS to HTM for\ncapital management purposes. AOCI included pretax unrealized gains of $ 5.0billion\non the securities at the dates of transfer. Unrealized gains or losses at the date\nof transfer of these securities continue to be reported in AOCI and are amortized\ninto interest income on a level-yield basis over the remaining life of the\nsecurities. This amortization will offset the effect on interest income of the\namortization of the premium or discount resulting from the transfer recorded at\nfair value. Transfers of securities from AFS to HTM are non-cash transactions and\nare recorded at fair value.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    223  \n

The Firm did not reverse through\ninterest income any accrued interest receivables for the years ended December 31,\n2020 and 2019.\nAt December 31, 2020 , the investment securities portfolio consisted of debt\nsecurities with an average credit rating of AA+ (based upon external ratings where\navailable, and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings).\nRisk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of securities and\ndifferentiate risk within the portfolio. The Firm\u2019s internal risk ratings\ngenerally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to\nmeet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic\nenvironment) defined by S&P and Moody\u2019s, however the quantitative characteristics\n(e.g., probability of default (\u201cPD\u201d) and loss given default (\u201cLGD\u201d)) may differ as\nthey reflect internal historical experiences and assumptions. Risk ratings are\nassigned at acquisition, are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit\nRisk Management and are adjusted as necessary over the life of the investment for\nupdated information affecting the issuer\u2019s ability to fulfill its obligations.\n                                              \n  224    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nAFS securities impairment\nThe following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses by aging\ncategory for AFS securities at December 31, 2020 and 2019.

required\nfor impaired securities if a credit\nloss exists. AFS securities are\nconsidered impaired if the fair value\nis less than the amortized cost. The\nFirm recognizes impairment losses in\nearnings if the Firm has the intent to\nsell the debt security, or if it is\nmore likely than not that the Firm will\nbe required to sell the debt security\nbefore recovery of its amortized cost.\nIn these circumstances the impairment\nloss recognized in investment\nsecurities gains/(losses) is equal to\nthe full difference between the\namortized cost (net of allowance if\napplicable) and the fair value of the\nsecurities. For impaired debt\nsecurities that the Firm has the intent\nand ability to hold, the securities are\nevaluated to determine if a credit loss\nexists. If it is determined that a\ncredit loss exists, that loss is\nrecognized as an allowance for credit\nlosses through the provision for credit\nlosses in the Consolidated Statements\nof Income, limited by the amount of\nimpairment. Any impairment not due to\ncredit losses is recorded in OCI.\nFactors considered in evaluating credit\nlosses include adverse conditions\nspecifically related to the industry,\ngeographic area or financial condition\nof the issuer or underlying collateral\nof a security; and payment structure of\nthe security. When assessing securities\nissued in a securitization for credit\nlosses, the Firm estimates cash flows\nconsidering relevant market and\neconomic data, underlying loan-level\ndata, and structural features of the\nsecuritization, such as subordination,\nexcess spread, overcollateralization or\nother forms of credit enhancement, and\ncompares the losses projected for the\nunderlying collateral (\u201cpool losses\u201d)\nagainst the level of credit enhancement\nin the securitization structure to\ndetermine whether these features are\nsufficient to absorb the pool losses,\nor whether a credit loss exists. For\nbeneficial interests in securitizations\nthat are rated below \u201cAA\u201d at their\nacquisition, or that can be\ncontractually prepaid or otherwise\nsettled in such a way that the Firm\nwould not recover substantially all of\nits recorded investment, the Firm\nevaluates impairment for credit losses\nwhen there is an adverse change in\nexpected cash flows. Allowance for\ncredit losses Based on its assessment,\nthe Firm did not recognize an allowance\nfor credit losses on impaired AFS\nsecurities as of January 1, 2020 or\nDecember 31, 2020.\n                                              \n  226    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nHTM securities \u2013 credit risk The\nadoption of the CECL accounting\nguidance requires management to\nestimate expected credit losses on HTM\nsecurities over the remaining expected\nlife and recognize this estimate as an\nallowance for credit losses. As a\nresult of the adoption of this\nguidance, the Firm recognized an\nallowance for credit losses on HTM\nobligations of U.S. states and\nmunicipalities of $ 10million as a\ncumulative-effect adjustment to\nretained earnings as of January 1,\n2020. Credit quality indicator The\nprimary credit quality indicator for\nHTM securities is the risk rating\nassigned to each security. At December\n31, 2020, all HTM securities were rated\ninvestment grade and were current and\naccruing, with approximately 98% rated\nat least AA+. Allowance for credit\nlosses The allowance for credit losses\non HTM obligations of U.S. states and\nmunicipalities and commercial mortgage-\nbacked securities is calculated by\napplying statistical credit loss\nfactors (estimated PD and LGD) to the\namortized cost. The credit loss factors\nare derived using a weighted average of\nfive internally developed eight-quarter\nmacroeconomic scenarios, followed by a\nsingle year straight-line interpolation\nto revert to long run historical\ninformation for periods beyond the\nforecast period. Refer to Note 13 for\nfurther information on the eight-\nquarter macroeconomic forecast. The\nallowance for credit losses on HTM\ncollateralized loan obligations and\nU.S. residential mortgage-backed\nsecurities is calculated as the\ndifference between the amortized cost\nand the present value of the cash flows\nexpected to be collected, discounted at\nthe security\u2019s effective interest rate.\nThese cash flow estimates are developed\nbased on expectations of underlying\ncollateral performance derived using\nthe eight-quarter macroeconomic\nforecast and the single year straight-\nline interpolation, as well as\nconsidering the structural features of\nthe security. The application of\ndifferent inputs and assumptions into\nthe calculation of the allowance for\ncredit losses is subject to significant\nmanagement judgment, and emphasizing\none input or assumption over another,\nor considering other inputs or\nassumptions, could affect the estimate\nof the allowance for credit losses on\nHTM securities. The allowance for\ncredit losses on HTM securities was $\n78million as of December 31, 2020,\nreflecting $ 68million recognized in\nthe provision for credit losses for the\nyear ended December 31, 2020.\n\nSelected impacts of investment\nsecurities on the Consolidated\nstatements of income\n                                                                                  \n  Year ended December

of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security. The\neffective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and\naccretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-\nequivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes\nunscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of\nsecurities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain\nsecurities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the\naverage yield is calculated to the earliest call date.\n(b) Substantially all of the Firm\u2019s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized\nmortgage obligations are due in 10years or more, based on contractual maturity.\nThe estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future\nprepayments, is approximately 5years for agency residential MBS, 4years for agency\nresidential collateralized mortgage obligations and 3years for nonagency\nresidential collateralized mortgage obligations.\n                                              \n  228    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n  Note 11 \u2013 Securities financing activities                                       \n                                                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase enters into resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities\nloaned agreements (collectively, \u201csecurities financing agreements\u201d) primarily to\nfinance the Firm\u2019s inventory positions, acquire securities to cover short sales,\naccommodate customers\u2019 financing needs, settle other securities obligations and to\ndeploy the Firm\u2019s excess cash. Securities financing agreements are treated as\ncollateralized financings on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated balance sheets. Where\nappropriate under applicable accounting guidance, securities financing agreements\nwith the same counterparty are reported on a net basis. Refer to Note 1 for\nfurther discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. Fees received and\npaid in connection with securities financing agreements are recorded over the life\nof the agreement in interest income and interest expense on the Consolidated\nstatements of income. The Firm has elected the fair value option for certain\nsecurities financing agreements. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding\nthe fair value option. The securities financing agreements for which the fair\nvalue option has been elected are reported within securities purchased under\nresale agreements, securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, and\nsecurities borrowed on the Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements\ncarried at fair value, current-period interest accruals are recorded within\ninterest income and interest expense, with changes in fair value reported in\nprincipal transactions revenue. However, for financial instruments containing\nembedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with\naccounting guidance for hybrid instruments, all changes in fair value, including\nany interest elements, are reported in principal transactions revenue. Securities\nfinancing agreements not elected under the fair value option are measured at\namortized cost. As a result of the Firm\u2019s credit risk mitigation practices\ndescribed below, the Firm did not hold any allowance for credit losses with\nrespect to resale and securities borrowed arrangements as of December 31, 2020 and\n2019. Credit risk mitigation practices Securities financing agreements expose the\nFirm primarily to credit and liquidity risk. To manage these risks, the Firm\nmonitors the value of the underlying securities (predominantly high-quality\nsecurities collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. GSEs and\ngovernment agencies MBS) that it has received from or provided to its\ncounterparties compared to the value of cash proceeds and exchanged collateral,\nand either requests additional collateral or returns securities or collateral when\nappropriate. Margin levels are initially established based upon the counterparty,\nthe type of underlying securities, and the permissible collateral, and are\nmonitored on an ongoing basis. In resale and securities borrowed agreements, the\nFirm is exposed to credit risk to the extent that the value of the securities\nreceived is less than initial cash principal advanced and any collateral amounts\nexchanged. In repurchase and securities loaned agreements, credit risk exposure\narises to the extent that the value of underlying securities advanced exceeds the\nvalue of the initial cash principal received, and any collateral amounts\nexchanged. Additionally, the Firm typically enters into master netting agreements\nand other similar arrangements with its counterparties, which provide for the\nright to liquidate the underlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged\nin the event of a counterparty default. It is also the Firm\u2019s policy to take\npossession, where possible, of the securities underlying resale and securities\nborrowed agreements. Refer to Note 29 for further information regarding assets\npledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    229  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \nThe table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm\u2019s securities\nfinancing agreements, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. When the Firm has obtained\nan appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a\ncounterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met,\nthe Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under\nits securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the\nFirm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce\nthe economic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible\nfor net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an\nappropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master netting\nagreement, such collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not\nmeet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the\ntable below as \u201cAmounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,\u201d and\nreduces the \u201cNet amounts\u201d presented.

The Firm accounts for loans based on the following\ncategories: \u2022 Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., \u201cretained\u201d)\n\u2022 Loans held-for-sale \u2022 Loans at fair value Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm\nadopted the CECL accounting guidance. Refer to Note 1 for further information. The\nfollowing provides a detailed accounting discussion of the Firm\u2019s loans by\ncategory: Loans held-for-investment Originated or purchased loans held-for-\ninvestment are recorded at the principal amount outstanding, net of the following:\ncharge-offs; interest applied to principal (for loans accounted for on the cost\nrecovery method); unamortized discounts and premiums; and net deferred loan fees\nor costs. Credit card loans also include billed finance charges and fees. Interest\nincome Interest income on performing loans held-for-investment is accrued and\nrecognized as interest income at the contractual rate of interest. Purchase price\ndiscounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are amortized\ninto interest income over the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment of\nyield. The Firm classifies accrued interest on loans, including accrued but\nunbilled interest on credit card loans, in accrued interest and accounts\nreceivables on the Consolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans, accrued\ninterest once billed is then recognized in the loan balances, with the related\nallowance recorded in the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the allowance\nfor credit losses on accrued interest on credit card loans are recognized in the\nprovision for credit losses and charge-offs are recognized by reversing interest\nincome. Expected losses related to accrued interest on certain performing,\nmodified loans to borrowers impacted by COVID-19 are considered in the Firm\u2019s\nallowance for loan losses. For other loans, the Firm generally does not recognize\nan allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivables, consistent with\nits policy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest\nincome. Nonaccrual loans Nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of\ninterest has been suspended. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain\nconsumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual\nstatus and considered nonperforming when full payment of principal and interest is\nnot expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has\nbeen in default for a period of 90 days or more, unless the loan is both well-\nsecured and in the process of collection. A loan is determined to be past due when\nthe minimum payment is not received from the borrower by the contractually\nspecified due date or for certain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans),\nwhen a monthly payment is due and unpaid for 30days or more. Finally, collateral-\ndependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status. On the date a loan\nis placed on nonaccrual status, all interest accrued but not collected is reversed\nagainst interest income. In addition, the amortization of deferred amounts is\nsuspended. Interest income on nonaccrual loans may be recognized as cash interest\npayments are received (i.e., on a cash basis) if the recorded loan balance is\ndeemed fully collectible; however, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate\ncollectibility of the recorded loan balance, all interest cash receipts are\napplied to reduce the carrying value of the loan (the cost recovery method). For\nconsumer loans, application of this policy typically results in the Firm\nrecognizing interest income on nonaccrual consumer loans on a cash basis. A loan\nmay be returned to accrual status when repayment is reasonably assured and there\nhas been demonstrated performance under the terms of the loan or, if applicable,\nthe terms of the restructured loan. As permitted by regulatory guidance, credit\ncard loans are generally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual status;\naccordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans continue to accrue\nuntil the loan is charged off or paid in full. Allowance for loan losses The\nallowance for loan losses represents the estimated expected credit losses in the\nheld-for-investment loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and is recognized on\nthe balance sheet as a contra asset, which brings the amortized cost to the net\ncarrying value. Changes in the allowance for loan losses are recorded in the\nprovision for credit losses on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated statements of income. Refer\nto Note 13 for further information on the Firm\u2019s accounting policies for the\nallowance for loan losses. Charge-offs Consumer loans are generally charged off or\ncharged down to the lower of the amortized cost or the net realizable value of the\nunderlying collateral (i.e., fair value less estimated costs to sell), with an\noffset to the allowance for loan losses, upon reaching specified stages of\ndelinquency in accordance with standards established by the FFIEC. Residential\nreal estate loans, unmodified credit card loans and scored business banking loans\nare generally charged off no later than 180days past due. Scored auto and modified\ncredit card loans are charged off no later than 120days past due.\n                                              \n  232    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nCertain consumer loans are charged off or charged down to their net realizable\nvalue earlier than the FFIEC charge-off standards in certain circumstances as\nfollows: \u2022 Loans modified in a TDR that are determined to be collateral-dependent.\n\u2022 Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event that suggests a loss is either\nknown or highly certain are subject to accelerated charge-off standards (e.g.,\nresidential real estate and auto loans are charged off or charged down within\n60days of receiving notification of a bankruptcy filing). \u2022 Auto loans upon\nrepossession of the automobile. Other than in certain limited circumstances, the\nFirm typically does not recognize charge-offs on the government-guaranteed portion\nof loans. Wholesale loans are charged off when it is highly certain that a loss\nhas been realized. The determination of whether to recognize a charge-off includes\nmany factors, including the prioritization of the Firm\u2019s claim in bankruptcy,\nexpectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and valuation of the\nborrower\u2019s equity or the loan collateral. When a loan is charged down to the lower\nof its amortized cost or the estimated net realizable value of the underlying\ncollateral, the determination of the fair value of the collateral depends on the\ntype of collateral (e.g., securities, real estate). In cases where the collateral\nis in the form of liquid securities, the fair value is based on quoted market\nprices or broker quotes. For illiquid securities or other financial assets, the\nfair value of the collateral is generally estimated using a discounted cash flow\nmodel. For residential real estate loans, collateral values are based upon\nexternal valuation sources. When it becomes likely that a borrower is either\nunable or unwilling to pay, the Firm utilizes a broker\u2019s price opinion, appraisal\nand/or an automated valuation model of the home based on an exterior-only\nvaluation (\u201cexterior opinions\u201d), which is then updated at least every twelve\nmonths, or more frequently depending on various market factors. As soon as\npracticable after the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt (e.g.,\nby taking legal title or physical possession), the Firm generally obtains an\nappraisal based on an inspection that includes the interior of the home (\u201cinterior\nappraisals\u201d). Exterior opinions and interior appraisals are discounted based upon\nthe Firm\u2019s experience with actual liquidation values as compared with the\nestimated values provided by exterior opinions and interior appraisals,\nconsidering state-specific factors. For commercial real estate loans, collateral\nvalues are generally based on appraisals from internal and external valuation\nsources. Collateral values are typically updated every sixto twelve months, either\nby obtaining a new appraisal or by performing an internal analysis, in accordance\nwith the Firm\u2019s policies. The Firm also considers both borrower- and market-\nspecific factors, which may result in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price\nopinions at more frequent intervals. Loans held-for-sale Loans held-for-sale are\nmeasured at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in\nnoninterest revenue. For consumer loans, the valuation is performed on a portfolio\nbasis. For wholesale loans, the valuation is performed on an individual loan\nbasis. Interest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and recognized based on\nthe contractual rate of interest. Loan origination fees or costs and purchase\nprice discounts or premiums are deferred in a contra loan account until the\nrelated loan is sold. The deferred fees or costs and discounts or premiums are an\nadjustment to the basis of the loan and therefore are included in the periodic\ndetermination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments and/or the gain or\nloss recognized at the time of sale. Because these loans are recognized at the\nlower of cost or fair value, the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses and charge-off\npolicies do not apply to these loans. However, loans held-for-sale are subject to\nthe nonaccrual policies described above. Loans at fair value Loans for which the\nfair value option has been elected are measured at fair value, with changes in\nfair value recorded in noninterest revenue. Interest income on these loans is\naccrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Changes in fair\nvalue are recognized in noninterest revenue. Loan origination fees are recognized\nupfront in noninterest revenue. Loan origination costs are recognized in the\nassociated expense category as incurred. Because these loans are recognized at\nfair value, the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not\napply to these loans. However, loans at fair value are subject to the nonaccrual\npolicies described above. Refer to Note 3 for further information on the Firm\u2019s\nelections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2\nand Note 3 for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified\nas trading assets.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    233  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \nLoan classification changes Loans in the held-for-investment portfolio that\nmanagement decides to sell are transferred to the held-for-sale portfolio at the\nlower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer. Credit-related losses are\ncharged against the allowance for loan losses; non-credit related losses such as\nthose due to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are\nrecognized in noninterest revenue. In the event that management decides to retain\na loan in the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to the held-for-\ninvestment portfolio at amortized cost on the date of transfer. These loans are\nsubsequently assessed for impairment based on the Firm\u2019s allowance methodology.\nRefer to Note 13 for a further discussion of the methodologies used in\nestablishing the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses. Loan modifications The Firm\nseeks to modify certain loans in conjunction with its loss mitigation activities.\nThrough the modification, JPMorgan Chase grants one or more concessions to a\nborrower who is experiencing financial difficulty in order to minimize the Firm\u2019s\neconomic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral, and to\nultimately maximize payments received by the Firm from the borrower. The\nconcessions granted vary by program and by borrower-specific characteristics, and\nmay include interest rate reductions, term extensions, payment delays, principal\nforgiveness, or the acceptance of equity or other assets in lieu of payments. Such\nmodifications are accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term and\nother insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not\nTDRs. Loans, except for credit card loans, modified in a TDR are generally placed\non nonaccrual status, although in many cases such loans were already on nonaccrual\nstatus prior to modification. These loans may be returned to performing status\n(the accrual of interest is resumed) if the following criteria are met: (i) the\nborrower has performed under the modified terms for a minimum of six monthsand/or\nsixpayments, and (ii) the Firm has an expectation that repayment of the modified\nloan is reasonably assured based on, for example, the borrower\u2019s debt capacity and\nlevel of future earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other current market\nconsiderations. In certain limited and well-defined circumstances in which the\nloan is current at the modification date, such loans are not placed on nonaccrual\nstatus at the time of modification. Loans modified in TDRs are generally measured\nfor impairment using the Firm\u2019s established asset-specific allowance methodology,\nwhich considers the expected re-default rates for the modified loans. A loan\nmodified in a TDR generally remains subject to the asset-specific component of the\nallowance throughout its remaining life, regardless of whether the loan is\nperforming and has been returned to accrual status. Refer to Note 13 for further\ndiscussion of the methodology used to estimate the Firm\u2019s asset-specific\nallowance. The Firm has granted various forms of assistance to customers and\nclients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including payment deferrals and\ncovenant modifications. The majority of the Firm\u2019s COVID-19 related loan\nmodifications have not been considered TDRs because: \u2022 they represent short-term\nor other insignificant modifications, whether under the Firm\u2019s regular loan\nmodification assessments or as permitted by regulatory guidance, or \u2022 the Firm has\nelected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for\nTDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations\nAct. To the extent that certain modifications do not meet any of the above\ncriteria, the Firm accounts for them as TDRs. As permitted by regulatory guidance,\nthe Firm does not place loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 on nonaccrual\nstatus where such loans are not otherwise reportable as nonaccrual. The Firm\nconsiders expected losses of principal and accrued interest associated with all\nCOVID-19 related loan modifications in its allowance for credit losses. Assistance\nprovided in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could delay the recognition of\ndelinquencies, nonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for those customers who\nwould have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status. Foreclosed property\nThe Firm acquires property from borrowers through loan restructurings, workouts,\nand foreclosures. Property acquired may include real property (e.g., residential\nreal estate, land, and buildings) and commercial and personal property (e.g.,\nautomobiles, aircraft, railcars, and ships). The Firm recognizes foreclosed\nproperty upon receiving assets in satisfaction of a loan (e.g., by taking legal\ntitle or physical possession). For loans collateralized by real property, the Firm\ngenerally recognizes the asset received at foreclosure sale or upon the execution\nof a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction with the borrower. Foreclosed assets\nare reported in other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets and initially\nrecognized at fair value less estimated costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value\nof the acquired property is reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to the lower of\ncost or fair value. Subsequent adjustments to fair value are charged/credited to\nnoninterest revenue. Operating expense, such as real estate taxes and maintenance,\nare charged to other expense. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm has\ntemporarily suspended certain foreclosure activities. This could delay recognition\nof foreclosed properties until the foreclosure moratoriums are lifted.\n                                              \n  234    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nLoan portfolio\nThe Firm\u2019s loan portfolio is divided into threeportfolio segments, which are the\nsame segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses:\nConsumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio\nsegment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of\nloans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class.\nIn conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm revised its loan classes.\nPrior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation:\n\u2022 The consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment\u2019s residential mortgage and\nhome equity loans and lending-related commitments have been combined into a\nresidential real estate class.\n\u2022 Upon adoption of CECL, the Firm elected to discontinue the pool-level accounting\nfor PCI loans and to account for these loans on an individual loan basis. PCI\nloans are considered PCD loans under CECL and are subject to the Firm\u2019s nonaccrual\nand charge-off policies. PCD loans are now reported in the consumer, excluding\ncredit card portfolio segment\u2019s residential real estate class.\n\u2022 Risk-rated business banking and auto dealer loans and lending-related\ncommitments held in CCB were reclassified from the consumer, excluding credit card\nportfolio segment, to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the\nmethodology applied when determining the allowance. The remaining scored auto and\nbusiness banking loans and lending-related commitments have been combined into an\nauto and other class.\n\u2022 The wholesale portfolio segment\u2019s classes, previously based on the borrower\u2019s\nprimary business activity, have been revised to align with the loan\nclassifications as defined by the bank regulatory agencies, based on the loan\u2019s\ncollateral, purpose, and type of borrower.\n                                                                                  \n  Consumer, excluding          Credit card            Wholesale(c)                \n  credit card                                                                     \n  \u2022 Residential real                                  \u2022 Secured by real estate    \n  estate(a)                    \u2022 Credit card loans    \u2022 Commercial and            \n  \u2022 Auto and other(b)                                 industrial                  \n                                                      \u2022 Other(d)                  \n                                                                                  \n(a) Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored\nmortgage loans held in CIB and Corporate.\n(b) Includes scored auto and business banking loans and overdrafts.\n(c) Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM, Corporate as well as risk-rated business\nbanking and auto dealer loans held in CCB for which the wholesale methodology is\napplied when determining the allowance for loan losses.\n(d) Includes loans to financial institutions, states and political subdivisions,\nSPEs, nonprofits, personal investment companies and trusts, as well as loans to\nindividuals and individual entities (predominantly Wealth Management clients\nwithin AWM).

As the loan continues to age, it becomes more clear\nwhether the borrower is likely to be unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of\nresidential real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater than 150 days\npast due) are a strong indicator of loans that will ultimately result in a\nforeclosure or similar liquidation transaction. In addition to delinquency rates,\nother credit quality indicators for consumer loans vary based on the class of\nloan, as follows: \u2022 For residential real estate loans, the current estimated LTV\nratio, or the combined LTV ratio in the case of junior lien loans, is an indicator\nof the potential loss severity in the event of default. Additionally, LTV or\ncombined LTV ratios can provide insight into a borrower\u2019s continued willingness to\npay, as the delinquency rate of high-LTV loans tends to be greater than that for\nloans where the borrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic distribution\nof the loan collateral also provides insight as to the credit quality of the\nportfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, home price changes and\nspecific events such as natural disasters, will affect credit quality. The\nborrower\u2019s current or \u201crefreshed\u201d FICO score is a secondary credit quality\nindicator for certain loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower\u2019s\ncredit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a low FICO score (less\nthan 660) is considered to be of higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a\nhigher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high LTV ratio and a low\nFICO score is at greater risk of default than a loan to a borrower that has both a\nhigh LTV ratio and a high FICO score. \u2022 For scored auto and business banking\nloans, geographic distribution is an indicator of the credit performance of the\nportfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, geographic distribution\nprovides insights into the portfolio performance based on regional economic\nactivity and events.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    237  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \nResidential real estate\nThe following table provides information on delinquency, which is the primary\ncredit quality indicator for retained residential real estate loans.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n(a) Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S.\ngovernment agencies as follows: current included $ 36million and $ 17million;\n30\u2013149 days past due included $ 16million and $ 20million; and 150 or more days\npast due included $ 24million and $ 26million at December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively.\n(b) At December 31, 2020, loans under payment deferral programs offered in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic which are still within their deferral period and\nperforming according to their modified terms are generally not considered\ndelinquent.\n(c) At December 31, 2020 and 2019, residential real estate loans excluded mortgage\nloans insured by U.S. government agencies of $ 40million and $ 46million,\nrespectively, that are 30 or more days past due.

The lien position the Firm holds is\nconsidered in the Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have\nbeen converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are\nstill within the revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing\npayment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum\npayment options available for revolving loans within the revolving

residential real estate loans that are charged\ndown to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of the underlying collateral\nless costs to sell. The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance,\nresidential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy\nand not reaffirmed by the borrower (\u201cChapter 7 loans\u201d) as collateral-dependent\nnonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. At December 31, 2020,\napproximately 7% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more\npast due, respectively.\n\n(b) At December 31, 2020, nonaccrual loans included $ 1.6billion of PCD loans.\nPrior to the adoption of CECL, nonaccrual loans excluded PCI loans as the Firm\nrecognized interest income on each pool of PCI loans as each of the pools was\nperforming.\n\n(c) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with\nregulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-\ndependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value\nof their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying\ncollateral improves subsequent to the charge down, the related allowance may be\nnegative.\n\n(d) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $\n161million and $ 166million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively.\n\n(e) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response\nto the COVID-19 pandemic. Includes loans to customers that have exited COVID-19\npayment deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly all of\nwhich were also at least 150 days past due and therefore considered collateral-\ndependent. Collateral-dependent loans are charged down to the lower of amortized\ncost or fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell.\n\n(f) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed\nby U.S government agencies. Typically the principal balance of the loans is\ninsured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to\nmeeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, these\nbalances included $ 33million and $ 34million, respectively, of loans that are no\nlonger accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing guidelines. For the\nremaining balance, interest is being accrued at the guaranteed reimbursement rate.\nThere were noloans that were not guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that are\n90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at December 31, 2020 and\n2019.\n\n(g) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the\nestimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a\nminimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized\nhome price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent\navailable and forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current\nestimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available\nlien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.\n\n(h) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower\u2019s most recent credit score,\nwhich is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.\n\n(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.\n\n(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the\nmagnitude of the corresponding loan balances at December 31, 2020.\n\n(k) At December 31, 2020 and 2019, included mortgage loans insured by U.S.\ngovernment agencies of $ 76million and $ 63million, respectively.

Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications\nthat are not considered concessions are not TDRs nor are loans for which the Firm\nhas elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance\nfor TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated\nAppropriations Act. The carrying value of new TDRs was $ 819million, $ 490million\nand $ 736million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 ,\nrespectively. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose\nresidential real estate loans have been modified in TDRs. Nature and extent of\nmodifications The Firm\u2019s proprietary modification programs as well as government\nprograms, including U.S. GSE programs, generally provide various concessions to\nfinancially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate\nreductions, term or payment extensions and delays of principal and/or interest\npayments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original\nagreement.\nThe following table provides information about how residential real estate loans\nwere modified in TDRs under the Firm\u2019s loss mitigation programs described above\nduring the periods presented.

For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is\ndeemed to occur when the loan becomes twocontractual payments past due.

Redefaults of\nloans modified within the last twelve monthsmay not be representative of ultimate\nredefault levels.\nAt December 31, 2020, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of\nresidential real estate loans permanently modified in TDRs were 6years. The\nestimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both\nvoluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).\n\nActive and suspended foreclosure\n\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Firm had residential real estate loans,\nexcluding those insured by U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of $\n846million and $ 1.2billion, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were\nin the process of active or suspended foreclosure.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    241  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \nAuto and other\n\nThe following table provides information on delinquency, which is the primary\ncredit quality indicator for retained auto and other consumer loans.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n(a) At December 31, 2020 , loans under payment deferral programs offered in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic which are still within their deferral period and\nperforming according to their modified terms are generally not considered\ndelinquent.\n\n(b) At December 31, 2020 , included $ 19.2billion of loans in Business Banking\nunder the PPP.

Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are\nnot considered concessions are not TDRs.\n\nThe impact of these modifications, as well as new TDRs, were not material to the\nFirm for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Additional commitments\nto lend to borrowers whose loans have been modified in TDRs as of December 31,\n2020 and 2019 were not material.\n                                              \n  242    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nCredit card loan portfolio\n\nThe credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans originated and\npurchased by the Firm. Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator\nfor credit card loans as they provide an early warning that borrowers may be\nexperiencing difficulties (30 days past due); information on those borrowers that\nhave been delinquent for a longer period of time (90 days past due) is also\nconsidered. In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of the\nloans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on the\nregional economy. While the borrower\u2019s credit score is another general indicator\nof credit quality, the Firm does not view credit scores as a primary indicator of\ncredit quality because the borrower\u2019s credit score tends to be a lagging\nindicator. The distribution of such scores provides a general indicator of credit\nquality trends within the portfolio; however, the score does not capture all\nfactors that would be predictive of future credit performance. Refreshed FICO\nscore information, which is obtained at least quarterly, for a statistically\nsignificant random sample of the credit card portfolio is indicated in the\nfollowing table. FICO is considered to be the industry benchmark for credit\nscores. The Firm generally originates new card accounts to prime consumer\nborrowers. However, certain cardholders\u2019 FICO scores may decrease over time,\ndepending on the performance of the cardholder and changes in the credit score\ncalculation.\n\nThe following table provides

modifications\n\nThe Firm may offer one of a number of\nloan modification programs granting\nconcessions to credit card borrowers\nwho are experiencing financial\ndifficulty. The Firm grants concessions\nfor most of the credit card loans under\nlong-term programs. These modifications\ninvolve placing the customer on a fixed\npayment plan, generally for 60months,\nand typically include reducing the\ninterest rate on the credit card.\nSubstantially all modifications under\nthe Firm\u2019s long-term programs are\nconsidered to be TDRs. Loans with\nshort-term or other insignificant\nmodifications that are not considered\nconcessions are not TDRs.

The primary\ncredit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the internal risk rating assigned\nto each loan. Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of loans and\ndifferentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings on loans consider the PD and\nthe LGD. The PD is the likelihood that a loan will default. The LGD is the\nestimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon the default of the borrower\nand takes into consideration collateral and structural support for each credit\nfacility. Management considers several factors to determine an appropriate\ninternal risk rating, including the obligor\u2019s debt capacity and financial\nflexibility, the level of the obligor\u2019s earnings, the amount and sources for\nrepayment, the level and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the\nindustry and geography in which the obligor operates. The Firm\u2019s internal risk\nratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower\ncapacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the\neconomic environment) defined by S&P and Moody\u2019s, however the quantitative\ncharacteristics (e.g., PD and LGD) may differ as they reflect internal historical\nexperiences and assumptions. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with\nqualitative characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade,\nand these ratings have a lower PD and/or lower LGD than non-investment grade\nratings. Noninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as noncriticized and\ncriticized, and the criticized portion is further subdivided into performing and\nnonaccrual loans, representing management\u2019s assessment of the collectibility of\nprincipal and interest. Criticized loans have a higher PD than noncriticized\nloans. The Firm\u2019s definition of criticized aligns with the U.S. banking regulatory\ndefinition of criticized exposures, which consist of special mention, substandard\nand doubtful categories. Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis\nby Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary for updated information\naffecting the obligor\u2019s ability to fulfill its obligations. As noted above, the\nrisk rating of a loan considers the industry in which the obligor conducts its\noperations. As part of the overall credit risk management framework, the Firm\nfocuses on the management and diversification of its industry and client\nexposures, with particular attention paid to industries with actual or potential\ncredit concern.

The carrying\nvalue of TDRs was $ 954million and $ 501million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively. The carrying value of new TDRs was $ 734million, $ 407million and $\n718million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

The\nadoption of this guidance established a single allowance framework for all\nfinancial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet credit\nexposures. This framework requires that management\u2019s estimate reflects credit\nlosses over the instrument\u2019s remaining expected life and considers expected future\nchanges in macroeconomic conditions. Refer to Note 1 for further information.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s allowance for credit losses comprises: \u2022 the allowance for loan\nlosses, which covers the Firm\u2019s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated)\nand is presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets, \u2022 the allowance\nfor lending-related commitments, which is presented on the Consolidated balance\nsheets in accounts payable and other liabilities, and \u2022 the allowance for credit\nlosses on investment securities, which covers the Firm\u2019s HTM and AFS securities\nand is recognized within Investment Securities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\nThe income statement effect of all changes in the allowance for credit losses is\nrecognized in the provision for credit losses. Determining the appropriateness of\nthe allowance for credit losses is complex and requires significant judgment by\nmanagement about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. At least\nquarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the\nController of the Firm. Subsequent evaluations of credit exposures, considering\nthe macroeconomic conditions, forecasts and other factors then prevailing, may\nresult in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in future\nperiods. The Firm\u2019s policies used to determine its allowance for loan losses and\nits allowance for lending-related commitments are described in the following\nparagraphs. Refer to Note 10 for a description of the policies used to determine\nthe allowance for credit losses on investment securities. Methodology for\nallowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments The allowance for loan\nlosses and allowance for lending-related commitments represents expected credit\nlosses over the remaining expected life of retained loans and lending-related\ncommitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. The Firm does not record an\nallowance for future draws on unconditionally cancellable lending-related\ncommitments (e.g., credit cards). Expected losses related to accrued interest on\ncredit card loans and certain performing, modified loans to borrowers impacted by\nCOVID-19 are considered in the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses. However, the Firm\ndoes not record an allowance on other accrued interest receivables, due to its\npolicy to write these receivables off no later than 90 days past due by reversing\ninterest income. The expected life of each instrument is determined by considering\nits contractual term, expected prepayments, cancellation features, and certain\nextension and call options. The expected life of funded credit card loans is\ngenerally estimated by considering expected future payments on the credit card\naccount, and determining how much of those amounts should be allocated to\nrepayments of the funded loan balance (as of the balance sheet date) versus other\naccount activity. This allocation is made using an approach that incorporates the\npayment application requirements of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility\nand Disclosure Act of 2009, generally paying down the highest interest rate\nbalances first. The estimate of expected credit losses includes expected\nrecoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off, even\nif such recoveries result in a negative allowance. Collective and Individual\nAssessments When calculating the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for\nlending-related commitments, the Firm assesses whether exposures share similar\nrisk characteristics. If similar risk characteristics exist, the Firm estimates\nexpected credit losses collectively, considering the risk associated with a\nparticular pool and the probability that the exposures within the pool will\ndeteriorate or default. The assessment of risk characteristics is subject to\nsignificant management judgment. Emphasizing one characteristic over another or\nconsidering additional characteristics could affect the allowance. \u2022 Relevant risk\ncharacteristics for the consumer portfolio include product type, delinquency\nstatus, current FICO scores, geographic distribution, and, for collateralized\nloans, current LTV ratios. \u2022 Relevant risk characteristics for the wholesale\nportfolio include LOB, geography, risk rating, delinquency status, level and type\nof collateral, industry, credit enhancement, product type, facility purpose,\ntenor, and payment terms. The majority of the Firm\u2019s credit exposures share risk\ncharacteristics with other similar exposures, and as a result are collectively\nassessed for impairment (\u201cportfolio-based component\u201d). The portfolio-based\ncomponent covers consumer loans, performing risk-rated loans and certain lending-\nrelated commitments. If an exposure does not share risk characteristics with other\nexposures, the Firm generally estimates expected credit losses on an individual\nbasis, considering expected repayment and conditions impacting that individual\nexposure (\u201casset-specific component\u201d). The asset-specific component covers\nmodified PCD loans, loans modified or reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR,\ncollateral-dependent loans, as well as, risk-rated loans that have been placed on\nnonaccrual status. Portfolio-based component The portfolio-based component begins\nwith a quantitative calculation that considers the likelihood of the borrower\nchanging delinquency status or moving from one risk rating to another. The\nquantitative calculation covers expected credit losses over an instrument\u2019s\nexpected life and is estimated by applying credit loss factors to the Firm\u2019s\n                                              \n  248    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nestimated exposure at default. The credit loss factors incorporate the probability\nof borrower default as well as loss severity in the event of default. They are\nderived using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic\nscenarios over an eight-quarter forecast period, followed by a single year\nstraight-line interpolation to revert to long run historical information for\nperiods beyond the eight-quarter forecast period. The five macroeconomic scenarios\nconsist of a central, relative adverse, extreme adverse, relative upside and\nextreme upside scenario, and are updated by the Firm\u2019s central forecasting team.\nThe scenarios take into consideration the Firm\u2019s overarching economic outlook,\ninternal perspectives from subject matter experts across the Firm, and market\nconsensus and involve a governed process that incorporates feedback from senior\nmanagement across LOBs, Corporate Finance and Risk Management. The COVID-19\npandemic has stressed many MEVs to degrees not experienced in recent history,\nwhich has created additional challenges in the use of modeled credit loss\nestimates and increased the reliance on management judgment. In periods where\ncertain MEVs are outside the range of historical experience on which the Firm\u2019s\nmodels have been trained, the Firm makes adjustments to appropriately address\nthese economic circumstances. The Firm also considers the impact of other events,\nsuch as government unemployment benefits or other stimulus programs, when\ndetermining whether adjustments are necessary. The quantitative calculation is\nadjusted to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments,\ntrends and other subjective factors that are not yet reflected in the calculation.\nThese adjustments are accomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss\nexperience, including during stressed periods, for each major product or model.\nManagement applies judgment in making this adjustment, including taking into\naccount uncertainties associated with the economic and political conditions,\nquality of underwriting standards, borrower behavior, credit concentrations or\ndeterioration within an industry, product or portfolio, as well as other relevant\ninternal and external factors affecting the credit quality of the portfolio. In\ncertain instances, the interrelationships between these factors create further\nuncertainties. Throughout 2020, the Firm made adjustments to its quantitative\ncalculation which placed significant weighting on its adverse scenarios, as a\nresult of continued uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The application\nof different inputs into the quantitative calculation, and the assumptions used by\nmanagement to adjust the quantitative calculation, are subject to significant\nmanagement judgment, and emphasizing one input or assumption over another, or\nconsidering other inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the\nallowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments.\nAsset-specific component To determine the asset-specific component of the\nallowance, collateral-dependent loans (including those loans for which foreclosure\nis probable) and larger, nonaccrual risk-rated loans in the wholesale portfolio\nsegment are generally evaluated individually, while smaller loans (both scored and\nrisk-rated) are aggregated for evaluation using factors relevant for the\nrespective class of assets. The Firm generally measures the asset-specific\nallowance as the difference between the amortized cost of the loan and the present\nvalue of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the loan\u2019s\noriginal effective interest rate. Subsequent changes in impairment are generally\nrecognized as an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses. For collateral-\ndependent loans, the fair value of collateral less estimated costs to sell is used\nto determine the charge-off amount for declines in value (to reduce the amortized\ncost of the loan to the fair value of collateral) or the amount of negative\nallowance that should be recognized (for recoveries of prior charge-offs\nassociated with improvements in the fair value of collateral). The asset-specific\ncomponent of the allowance for loan losses for loans that have been or are\nexpected to be modified in TDRs incorporates the effect of the modification on the\nloan\u2019s expected cash flows (including forgone interest, principal forgiveness, as\nwell as other concessions), and also the potential for redefault. For residential\nreal estate loans modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs, the Firm\ndevelops product-specific probability of default estimates, which are applied at a\nloan level to compute expected losses. In developing these probabilities of\ndefault, the Firm considers the relationship between the credit quality\ncharacteristics of the underlying loans and certain assumptions about housing\nprices and unemployment, based upon industry-wide data. The Firm also considers\nits own historical loss experience to-date based on actual redefaulted modified\nloans. For credit card loans modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs,\nexpected losses incorporate projected delinquencies and charge-offs based on the\nFirm\u2019s historical experience by type of modification program. For wholesale loans\nmodified or expected to be modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate\nmanagement\u2019s expectation of the borrower\u2019s ability to repay under the modified\nterms. Estimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows is highly judgmental\nas these cash flow projections rely upon estimates such as loss severities, asset\nvaluations, default rates (including redefault rates on modified loans), the\namounts and timing of interest or principal payments (including any expected\nprepayments) or other factors that are reflective of current and expected market\nconditions. These estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as the\nduration of current overall economic conditions, industry-, portfolio-, or\nborrower-specific factors, the expected outcome of insolvency proceedings as well\nas, in certain circumstances, other economic factors. All of these estimates and\nassumptions require significant management judgment and certain assumptions are\nhighly subjective.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    249  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \nAllowance for credit losses and related information\nThe table below summarizes information about the allowances for loan losses and\nlending-related commitments, and includes a breakdown of loans and lending-related\ncommitments by impairment methodology.

Prior to the adoption of CECL, write-offs of PCI loans were recorded against\nthe allowance for loan losses when actual losses for a pool exceeded estimated\nlosses that were recorded as purchase accounting adjustments at the time of\nacquisition. A write-off of a PCI loan was recognized when the underlying loan was\nremoved from a pool.\n\n(b) Includes modified PCD loans and loans that have been modified or are\nreasonably expected to be modified in a TDR. Also includes risk-rated loans that\nhave been placed on nonaccrual status for the wholesale portfolio segment. The\nasset-specific credit card allowance for loans modified, or reasonably expected to\nbe modified, in a TDR is calculated based on the loans\u2019 original contractual\ninterest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty rates.\n\n(c) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable\nand other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n\n(d) At December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, lending-related commitments excluded $\n19.5billion, $ 9.8billion and $ 8.7billion, respectively, for the consumer,\nexcluding credit card portfolio segment; $ 658.5billion, $ 650.7billion and $\n605.4billion, respectively, for the credit card portfolio segment; and $\n22.4billion, $ 24.1billion and $ 24.8billion, respectively, for the wholesale\nportfolio segment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-related\ncommitments.\n\n(e) Excludes HTM securities, which had an allowance for credit losses of $\n78million and a provision for credit losses of $ 68million as of and for the year\nended December 31, 2020.\n                                                                                  \n    \u2026

allowance\nduring 2020 The increase in the\nallowance for loan losses and lending-\nrelated commitments was primarily\ndriven by an increase in the provision\nfor credit losses, reflecting the\ndeterioration in and uncertainty around\nthe future macroeconomic environment as\na result of the impact of the COVID-19\npandemic. As of December 31, 2020, the\nFirm\u2019s central case reflected U.S.\nunemployment rates of approximately 7%\nthrough the second quarter of 2021 and\nremaining above 5% until the second\nhalf of 2022. This compared with\nrelatively low levels of unemployment\nof approximately 4% throughout 2020 and\n2021 in the Firm\u2019s January 1, 2020\ncentral case. Further, while the Firm\u2019s\nJanuary 1, 2020 central case U.S. GDP\nforecast reflected a 1.7% expansion in\n2020, actual U.S. GDP contracted\napproximately 2.5% in 2020. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, the Firm\u2019s central\ncase assumptions reflect a return to\npre-pandemic GDP levels in the fourth\nquarter of 2021. Due to elevated\nuncertainty in the near term outlook,\ndriven by the potential for increased\ninfection rates and related lock downs\nresulting from the pandemic, as well as\nthe prospect that government and other\nconsumer relief measures set to expire\nmay not be extended, the Firm has\nplaced significant weighting on its\nadverse scenarios. These scenarios\nincorporate more punitive macroeconomic\nfactors than the central case\nassumptions, resulting in weighted\naverage U.S. unemployment rates\nremaining elevated throughout 2021 and\n2022, ending the fourth quarter of 2022\nat approximately 6%, and in U.S. GDP\nending 2022 approximately 0.9% higher\nthan fourth quarter 2019 actual pre-\npandemic levels.\nThe Firm\u2019s central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and U.S.\nreal GDP as follows:\n                                                                                  \n                                 Assumptions at January 1,                        \n                                 2020                                             \n                                 2Q20                            4Q20(b)    2Q21  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. unemployment rate(a)      3.7%                            3.8%       4.0%  \n  Cumulative change in U.S.                                                       \n  real GDP from                  0.9%                            1.7%       2.4%  \n  12/31/2019                                                                      \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                   Assumptions at December 31,                    \n                                   2020                                           \n                                   2Q21                             4Q21    2Q22  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. unemployment rate(a)        6.8%                             5.7%    5.1%  \n  Cumulative change in U.S.                                                       \n  real GDP from                    (1.9)%                           0.6%    2.0%  \n  12/31/2019                                                                      \n                                                                                  \n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate.\n(b) 4Q20 actual U.S. unemployment rate (quarterly average) was 6.8%. 4Q20 actual\ncumulative change in U.S. real GDP from 4Q19 was (2.5%).\nSubsequent changes to this forecast and\nrelated estimates will be reflected in\nthe provision for credit losses in\nfuture periods.\n                                              \n  252    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n  Note 14 \u2013 Variable interest entities                                            \n                                                                                  \nRefer to Note 1 on page 167 for a further description of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\naccounting policies regarding consolidation of VIEs.\nThe following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored VIEs\nby business segment.

As asset manager of the funds, AWM earns a fee based on assets\nmanaged; the fee varies with each fund\u2019s investment objective and is competitively\npriced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AWM\u2019s interests are, in certain\ncases, considered to be significant variable interests that result in\nconsolidation of the financial results of these entities.\n\n\u2022 Commercial Banking: CB provides financing and lending-related services to a wide\nspectrum of clients, including certain third-party-sponsored entities that may\nmeet the definition of a VIE. CB does not control the activities of these entities\nand does not consolidate these entities. CB\u2019s maximum loss exposure, regardless of\nwhether the entity is a VIE, is generally limited to loans and lending-related\ncommitments which are reported and disclosed in the same manner as any other\nthird-party transaction.\n\n\u2022 Corporate : Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of\nVIEs; however these entities are generally subject to specialized investment\ncompany accounting, which does not require the consolidation of investments,\nincluding VIEs. In addition, Treasury and CIO invest in securities generally\nissued by third parties which may meet the definition of VIEs (e.g., issuers of\nasset-backed securities). In general, the Firm does not have the power to direct\nthe significant activities of these entities and therefore does not consolidate\nthese entities. Refer to Note 10 for further information on the Firm\u2019s investment\nsecurities portfolio.\n\nIn addition, CIB also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs\nsponsored by third parties.

The Firm\u2019s\ncontinuing involvement in credit card securitizations includes servicing the\nreceivables, retaining an undivided seller\u2019s interest in the receivables,\nretaining certain senior and subordinated securities and maintaining escrow\naccounts. The Firm consolidates the assets and liabilities of its sponsored credit\ncard trusts as it is considered to be the primary beneficiary of these\nsecuritization trusts based on the Firm\u2019s ability to direct the activities of\nthese VIEs through its servicing responsibilities and other duties, including\nmaking decisions as to the receivables that are transferred into those trusts and\nas to any related modifications and workouts. Additionally, the nature and extent\nof the Firm\u2019s other continuing involvement with the trusts, as indicated above,\nobligates the Firm to absorb losses and gives the Firm the right to receive\ncertain benefits from these VIEs that could potentially be significant. The\nunderlying securitized credit card receivables and other assets of the\nsecuritization trusts are available only for payment of the beneficial interests\nissued by the securitization trusts; they are not available to pay the Firm\u2019s\nother obligations or the claims of the Firm\u2019s creditors. The agreements with the\ncredit card securitization trusts require the Firm to maintain a minimum undivided\ninterest in the credit card trusts (generally 5%). As of December 31, 2020 and\n2019, the Firm held undivided interests in Firm-sponsored credit card\nsecuritization trusts of $ 5.4billion and $ 5.3billion, respectively. The Firm\nmaintained an average undivided interest in principal receivables owned by those\ntrusts of approximately 39% and 50% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    253  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \n2019. The Firm did not retain any senior securities and retained $ 1.5billion and\n$ 3.0billion of subordinated securities in certain of its credit card\nsecuritization trusts as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Firm\u2019s\nundivided interests in the credit card trusts and securities retained are\neliminated in consolidation. Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization\ntrusts The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased\nresidential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans primarily in\nits CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as\nthe respective business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans\nand/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts.\nThe following table presents the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in\nFirm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in which the\nFirm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by the Firm.\nContinuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or\nsubordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit\nrisk retention rules), recourse or guarantee arrangements, and derivative\ncontracts. In certain instances, the Firm\u2019s only continuing involvement is\nservicing the loans. The Firm\u2019s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased\ninterests is the carrying value of these interests.

CCB generally retains servicing\nfor all residential mortgage loans it\noriginated or purchased, and for\ncertain mortgage loans purchased by\nCIB. For securitizations of loans\nserviced by CCB, the Firm has the power\nto direct the significant activities of\nthe VIE because it is responsible for\ndecisions related to loan modifications\nand workouts. CCB may also retain an\ninterest upon securitization. In\naddition, CIB engages in underwriting\nand trading activities involving\nsecurities issued by Firm-sponsored\nsecuritization trusts. As a result, CIB\nat times retains senior and/or\nsubordinated interests (including\nresidual interests and amounts required\nto be held pursuant to credit risk\nretention rules) in residential\nmortgage securitizations at the time of\nsecuritization, and/or reacquires\npositions in the secondary market in\nthe normal course of business. In\ncertain instances, as a result of the\npositions retained or reacquired by CIB\nor held by Treasury and CIO or CCB,\nwhen considered together with the\nservicing arrangements entered into by\nCCB, the Firm is deemed to be the\nprimary beneficiary of certain\nsecuritization trusts. Refer to the\ntable on page 257 of this Note for more\ninformation on consolidated residential\nmortgage securitizations. The Firm does\nnot consolidate residential mortgage\nsecuritizations (Firm-sponsored or\nthird-party-sponsored) when it is not\nthe servicer (and therefore does not\nhave the power to direct the most\nsignificant activities of the trust) or\ndoes not hold a beneficial interest in\nthe trust that could potentially be\nsignificant to the trust. Refer to the\ntable on page 257 of this Note for more\ninformation on the consolidated\nresidential mortgage securitizations,\nand the table on the previous page of\nthis Note for further information on\ninterests held in nonconsolidated\nresidential mortgage securitizations.\nCommercial mortgages and other consumer\nsecuritizations CIB originates and\nsecuritizes commercial mortgage loans,\nand engages in underwriting and trading\nactivities involving the securities\nissued by securitization trusts. CIB\nmay retain unsold senior and/or\nsubordinated interests (including\namounts required to be held pursuant to\ncredit risk retention rules) in\ncommercial mortgage securitizations at\nthe time of securitization but,\ngenerally, the Firm does not service\ncommercial loan securitizations.\nTreasury and CIO may choose to invest\nin these securitizations as well. For\ncommercial mortgage securitizations the\npower to direct the significant\nactivities of the VIE generally is held\nby the servicer or investors in a\nspecified class of securities\n(\u201ccontrolling class\u201d). The Firm\ngenerally does not retain an interest\nin the controlling class in its\nsponsored commercial mortgage\nsecuritization transactions. Refer to\nthe table on page 257 of this Note for\nmore information on the consolidated\ncommercial mortgage securitizations,\nand the table on the previous page of\nthis Note for further\n\ninformation on interests held in\nnonconsolidated securitizations. Re-\nsecuritizations The Firm engages in\ncertain re-securitization transactions\nin which debt securities are\ntransferred to a VIE in exchange for\nnew beneficial interests. These\ntransfers occur in connection with both\nU.S. GSEs and government agency\nsponsored VIEs, which are backed by\nresidential mortgages. The Firm\u2019s\nconsolidation analysis is largely\ndependent on the Firm\u2019s role and\ninterest in the re-securitization\ntrusts.\nThe following table presents the principal amount of securities transferred to re-\nsecuritization VIEs.\n                                                                            \n  Year ended December 31,                                                   \n  (in millions)                             2020         2019         2018  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Transfers of securities to VIEs                                           \n  U.S. GSEs and government agencies    $  46,123    $  25,852    $  15,532  \n                                                                            \nMost re-securitizations with which the\nFirm is involved are client-driven\ntransactions in which a specific client\nor group of clients is seeking a\nspecific return or risk profile. For\nthese transactions, the Firm has\nconcluded that the decision-making\npower of the entity is shared between\nthe Firm and its clients, considering\nthe joint effort and decisions in\nestablishing the re-securitization\ntrust and its assets, as well as the\nsignificant economic interest the\nclient holds in the re-securitization\ntrust; therefore the Firm does not\nconsolidate the re-securitization VIE.\nThe Firm did not transfer any private\nlabel securities to re-securitization\nVIEs during 2020, 2019 and 2018,\nrespectively, and retained interests in\nany such Firm-sponsored VIEs as of\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019 were\nimmaterial. Additionally, the Firm may\ninvest in beneficial interests of\nthird-party-sponsored re-\nsecuritizations and generally purchases\nthese interests in the secondary\nmarket. In these circumstances, the\nFirm does not have the unilateral\nability to direct the most significant\nactivities of the re-securitization\ntrust, either because it was not\ninvolved in the initial design of the\ntrust, or the Firm is involved with an\nindependent third-party sponsor and\ndemonstrates shared power over the\ncreation of the trust; therefore, the\nFirm does not consolidate the re-\nsecuritization VIE.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    255  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \nThe following table presents information on the Firm's interests in\nnonconsolidated re-securitization VIEs.\n                                                                              \n  December 31,                                   Nonconsolidated              \n  (in millions)                           re-securitization VIEs              \n  U.S. GSEs and government agencies                         2020        2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Interest in VIEs                     $                   2,631    $  2,928  \n                                                                              \nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the\nFirm did not consolidate any U.S. GSE\nand government agency re-securitization\nVIEs or any Firm-sponsored private-\nlabel re-securitization VIEs. Multi-\nseller conduits Multi-seller conduit\nentities are separate bankruptcy remote\nentities that provide secured\nfinancing, collateralized by pools of\nreceivables and other financial assets,\nto customers of the Firm. The conduits\nfund their financing facilities through\nthe issuance of highly rated commercial\npaper. The primary source of repayment\nof the commercial paper is the cash\nflows from the pools of assets. In most\ninstances, the assets are structured\nwith deal-specific credit enhancements\nprovided to the conduits by the\ncustomers (i.e., sellers) or other\nthird parties. Deal-specific credit\nenhancements are generally structured\nto cover a multiple of historical\nlosses expected on the pool of assets,\nand are typically in the form of\novercollateralization provided by the\nseller. The deal-specific credit\nenhancements mitigate the Firm\u2019s\npotential losses on its agreements with\nthe conduits. To ensure timely\nrepayment of the commercial paper, and\nto provide the conduits with funding to\nprovide financing to customers in the\nevent that the conduits do not obtain\nfunding in the commercial paper market,\neach asset pool financed by the\nconduits has a minimum 100% deal-\nspecific liquidity facility associated\nwith it provided by JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nalso provides the multi-seller conduit\nvehicles with uncommitted program-wide\nliquidity facilities and program-wide\ncredit enhancement in the form of\nstandby letters of credit. The amount\nof program-wide credit enhancement\nrequired is based upon commercial paper\nissuance and approximates 10% of the\noutstanding balance of commercial\npaper. The Firm consolidates its Firm-\nadministered multi-seller conduits, as\nthe Firm has both the power to direct\nthe significant activities of the\nconduits and a potentially significant\neconomic interest in the conduits. As\nadministrative agent and in its role in\nstructuring transactions, the Firm\nmakes decisions regarding asset types\nand credit quality, and manages the\ncommercial paper funding needs of the\nconduits. The Firm\u2019s interests that\ncould potentially be significant to the\nVIEs include the fees received as\nadministrative agent and liquidity and\nprogram-wide credit enhancement\nprovider, as well as the potential\nexposure created by the liquidity and\ncredit enhancement facilities provided\nto the conduits. Refer to page 257 of\nthis Note for further information on\nconsolidated VIE assets and\nliabilities.\n\nIn the normal course of business,\nJPMorgan Chase makes markets in and\ninvests in commercial paper issued by\nthe Firm-administered multi-seller\nconduits. The Firm held $ 13.5billion\nand $ 16.3billion of the commercial\npaper issued by the Firm-administered\nmulti-seller conduits at December 31,\n2020 and 2019, respectively, which have\nbeen eliminated in consolidation. The\nFirm\u2019s investments reflect the Firm\u2019s\nfunding needs and capacity and were not\ndriven by market illiquidity. Other\nthan the amounts required to be held\npursuant to credit risk retention\nrules, the Firm is not obligated under\nany agreement to purchase the\ncommercial paper issued by the Firm-\nadministered multi-seller conduits.\nDeal-specific liquidity facilities,\nprogram-wide liquidity and credit\nenhancement provided by the Firm have\nbeen eliminated in consolidation. The\nFirm or the Firm-administered multi-\nseller conduits provide lending-related\ncommitments to certain clients of the\nFirm-administered multi-seller\nconduits. The unfunded commitments were\n$ 12.2billion and $ 8.9billion at\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively, and are reported as off-\nbalance sheet lending-related\ncommitments in other unfunded\ncommitments to extend credit. Refer to\nNote 28 for more information on off-\nbalance sheet lending-related\ncommitments. Municipal bond vehicles\nMunicipal bond vehicles or tender\noption bond (\u201cTOB\u201d) trusts allow\ninstitutions to finance their municipal\nbond investments at short-term rates.\nIn a typical TOB transaction, the trust\npurchases highly rated municipal\nbond(s) of a single issuer and funds\nthe purchase by issuing two types of\nsecurities: (1) puttable floating-rate\ncertificates (\u201cfloaters\u201d) and (2)\ninverse floating-rate residual\ninterests (\u201cresiduals\u201d). The floaters\nare typically purchased by money market\nfunds or other short-term investors and\nmay be tendered, with requisite notice,\nto the TOB trust. The residuals are\nretained by the investor seeking to\nfinance its municipal bond investment.\nTOB transactions where the residual is\nheld by a third-party investor are\ntypically known as customer TOB trusts,\nand non-customer TOB trusts are\ntransactions where the Residual is\nretained by the Firm. Customer TOB\ntrusts are sponsored by a third party;\nrefer to page 258 of this Note for\nfurther information. The Firm serves as\nsponsor for all non-customer TOB\ntransactions. The Firm may provide\nvarious services to a TOB trust,\nincluding remarketing agent, liquidity\nor tender option provider, and/or\nsponsor. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC may\nserve as a remarketing agent on the\nfloaters for TOB trusts. The\nremarketing agent is responsible for\nestablishing the periodic variable rate\non the floaters, conducting the initial\nplacement and remarketing tendered\nfloaters. The remarketing agent may,\nbut is not obligated to, make markets\nin floaters. Floaters held by the Firm\nwere not material during 2020 and 2019.\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or J.P.\nMorgan Securities LLC often serves as\nthe sole liquidity or tender option\nprovider for the TOB trusts. The\nliquidity provider\u2019s obligation to\n                                              \n  256    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nperform is conditional and is limited by certain events (\u201cTermination Events\u201d),\nwhich include bankruptcy or failure to pay by the municipal bond issuer or credit\nenhancement provider, an event of taxability on the municipal bonds or the\nimmediate downgrade of the municipal bond to below investment grade. In addition,\nthe liquidity provider\u2019s exposure is typically further limited by the high credit\nquality of the underlying municipal bonds, the excess collateralization in the\nvehicle, or, in certain transactions, the reimbursement agreements with the\nResidual holders. Holders of the floaters may \u201cput,\u201d or tender, their floaters to\nthe TOB trust. If the remarketing agent cannot successfully remarket the floaters\nto another investor, the liquidity provider either provides a loan to the TOB\ntrust for the TOB trust\u2019s purchase of the floaters, or it directly purchases the\ntendered floaters. TOB trusts are considered to be variable interest entities. The\nFirm consolidates non-customer TOB trusts because as the Residual holder, the Firm\nhas the right to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance\nof the municipal bond vehicle, and it has the right to receive benefits and bear\nlosses that could potentially be significant to the municipal bond vehicle.\n\nConsolidated VIE assets and liabilities\nThe following table

These include, for example, acting as a derivative\ncounterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent,\nremarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at\narm\u2019s-length, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the\nspecific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets.\nWhere the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that\nmost significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance, or a variable interest\nthat could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the\nVIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets\nin the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other\nthird-party transaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds investments in\nunconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar\nentities that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other projects.\nThese entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the\ngeneral partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities\nof the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax\ncredit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited\npartner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated\nto the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and\nfunding commitments, was $ 24.9billion and $ 19.1billion, of which $ 8.7billion\nand $ 5.5billion was unfunded at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In\norder to reduce the risk of loss, the Firm assesses each project and withholds\nvarying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax\ncredits. Refer to Note 25 for further information on affordable housing tax\ncredits. Refer to Note 28 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-\nrelated commitments. Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm may\nprovide various services to customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent,\nliquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the\nFirm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the\nResidual holder. In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the\nFirm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm\ndoes not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any\nof the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB\ntrusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that\nsignificantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The\nFirm\u2019s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at December\n31, 2020 and 2019, was $ 6.7billion and $ 5.5billion, respectively. The fair value\nof assets held by such VIEs at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $ 10.5billion and $\n8.6billion, respectively. Refer to Note 28 for more information on off-balance\nsheet lending-related commitments. Loan securitizations The Firm has securitized\nand sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, and\ncommercial mortgage. The purposes of these securitization transactions were to\nsatisfy investor demand and to generate liquidity for the Firm. For loan\nsecuritizations in which the Firm is not required to consolidate the trust, the\nFirm records the transfer of the loan receivable to the trust as a sale when all\nof the following accounting criteria for a sale are met: (1) the transferred\nfinancial assets are legally isolated from the Firm\u2019s creditors; (2) the\ntransferee or beneficial interest holder can pledge or exchange the transferred\nfinancial assets; and (3) the Firm does not maintain effective control over the\ntransferred financial assets (e.g., the Firm cannot repurchase the transferred\nassets before their maturity and it does not have the ability to unilaterally\ncause the holder to return the transferred assets). For loan securitizations\naccounted for as a sale, the Firm recognizes a gain or loss based on the\ndifference between the value of proceeds received (including cash, beneficial\ninterests, or servicing assets received) and the carrying value of the assets\nsold. Gains and losses on securitizations are reported in noninterest revenue.\n                                              \n  258    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nSecuritization activity\nThe following table provides information related to the Firm\u2019s securitization\nactivities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, related to assets\nheld in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the\nFirm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization.\n                                                                                  \n  Year                                                                            \n  end\u2026                                                                            \n  Dec\u2026                                                                            \n  31,         2020       Comm\u2026        2019       Comme\u2026        2018       Comme\u2026  \n  (in        Resi\u2026         and       Resi\u2026          and       Resi\u2026          and  \n  mil\u2026       mort\u2026       othe\u2026       mort\u2026       other\u2026       mort\u2026       other\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Pri\u2026    $  7,103    $  6,624    $  9,957    $   9,390    $  6,431    $  10,159  \n  sec\u2026                                                                            \n  All                                                                             \n  cash                                                                            \n  flo\u2026                                                                            \n  dur\u2026                                                                            \n  the                                                                             \n  per\u2026                                                                            \n  Pro\u2026                                                                            \n  rec\u2026                                                                            \n  from                                                                            \n  loan    $  7,321    $  6,865    $  10,2\u2026    $   9,544    $  6,449    $  10,218  \n  sal\u2026                                                                            \n  as                                                                              \n  fin\u2026                                                                            \n  ins\u2026                                                                            \n  Ser\u2026                                                                            \n  fees         211           1         287            2         319            2  \n  col\u2026                                                                            \n  Cash                                                                            \n  flo\u2026                                                                            \n  rec\u2026         801         239         507          237         411          301  \n  on                                                                              \n  int\u2026                                                                            \n                                                                                  \n(a) Excludes re-securitization transactions.\n(b) Predominantly includes Level 2 assets.\n(c) The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the\nproceeds received upon loan sale.\n(d) Represents prime mortgages.

For 2019, represents\ngoodwill associated with the\nacquisition of InstaMed. This goodwill\nwas allocated to CIB, CB and CCB.\n\n(b) Primarily relates to foreign\ncurrency adjustments.\n\nGoodwill impairment testing The Firm\u2019s\ngoodwill was not impaired at December\n31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Effective\nJanuary 1, 2020, the Firm adopted new\naccounting guidance related to goodwill\nimpairment testing. The adoption of the\nguidance requires recognition of an\nimpairment loss when the estimated fair\nvalue of a reporting unit falls below\nits carrying value. It eliminated the\nrequirement that an impairment loss be\nrecognized only if the estimated\nimplied fair value of the goodwill is\nbelow its carrying value. The goodwill\nimpairment test is performed by\ncomparing the current fair value of\neach reporting unit with its\n\ncarrying value. If the fair value is in\nexcess of the carrying value, then the\nreporting unit\u2019s goodwill is considered\nnot to be impaired. If the fair value\nis less than the carrying value, then\nan impairment charge is recognized for\nthe amount by which the reporting\nunit\u2019s carrying value exceeds its fair\nvalue, up to the amount of goodwill\nallocated to that reporting unit. The\nFirm uses the reporting units\u2019\nallocated capital plus goodwill and\nother intangible assets as a proxy for\nthe carrying values of equity for the\nreporting units in the goodwill\nimpairment testing. Reporting unit\nequity is determined on a similar basis\nas the allocation of capital to the\nLOBs which takes into consideration a\nvariety of factors including capital\nlevels of similarly rated peers and\napplicable regulatory capital\nrequirements. Proposed LOB capital\nlevels are incorporated into the Firm\u2019s\nannual budget process, which is\nreviewed by the Firm\u2019s Board of\nDirectors. Allocated capital is further\nreviewed periodically and updated as\nneeded. The primary method the Firm\nuses to estimate the fair value of its\nreporting units is the income approach.\nThis approach projects cash flows for\nthe forecast period and uses the\nperpetuity growth method to calculate\nterminal values. These cash flows and\nterminal values are then discounted\nusing an appropriate discount rate.\nProjections of cash flows are based on\nthe reporting units\u2019 earnings forecasts\nwhich are reviewed with senior\nmanagement of the Firm. The discount\nrate used for each reporting unit\nrepresents an estimate of the cost of\nequity for that reporting unit and is\ndetermined considering the Firm\u2019s\noverall estimated cost of equity\n(estimated using the Capital Asset\nPricing Model), as adjusted for the\nrisk characteristics specific to each\nreporting unit (for example, for higher\nlevels of risk or uncertainty\nassociated with the business or\nmanagement\u2019s forecasts and\nassumptions). To assess the\nreasonableness of the discount rates\nused for each reporting unit,\nmanagement compares the discount rate\nto the estimated cost of equity for\npublicly traded institutions with\nsimilar businesses and risk\ncharacteristics. In addition, the\nweighted average cost of equity\n(aggregating the various reporting\nunits) is compared with the Firm\u2019s\noverall estimated cost of equity to\nensure reasonableness. The valuations\nderived from the discounted cash flow\nanalysis are then compared with market-\nbased trading and transaction multiples\nfor relevant competitors. Trading and\ntransaction comparables are used as\ngeneral indicators to assess the\noverall reasonableness of the estimated\nfair values, although precise\nconclusions generally cannot be drawn\ndue to the differences that naturally\nexist between the Firm\u2019s businesses and\ncompetitor institutions. Management\nalso takes into consideration a\ncomparison between the aggregate fair\nvalues of the Firm\u2019s reporting units\nand JPMorgan Chase\u2019s market\ncapitalization. In evaluating this\ncomparison, management considers\nseveral factors, including (i) a\ncontrol premium that would exist in a\nmarket transaction, (ii) factors\nrelated to the level of\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    261  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \nexecution risk that would exist at the Firmwide level that do not exist at the\nreporting unit level and (iii) short-term market volatility and other factors that\ndo not directly affect the value of individual reporting units. Unanticipated\ndeclines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital\nrequirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse\nregulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of\nequity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm\u2019s reporting units to\ndecline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to\nearnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.\nMortgage servicing rights MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash\nflows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers\nestimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs\nto service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows\nare received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing\nand ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or\nrecognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained.\nAs permitted by U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to account for its MSRs at fair\nvalue. The Firm treats its MSRs as a single class of servicing assets based on the\navailability of market inputs used to measure the fair value of its MSR asset and\nits treatment of MSRs as one aggregate pool for risk management purposes. The Firm\nestimates the fair value of MSRs using an option-adjusted spread (\u201cOAS\u201d) model,\nwhich projects MSR cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios in conjunction\nwith the Firm\u2019s prepayment model, and then discounts these cash flows at risk-\nadjusted rates. The model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually\nspecified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, costs to\nservice, late charges and other ancillary revenue, and other economic factors. The\nFirm compares fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where\navailable, and also considers recent market activity and actual portfolio\nexperience.\n                                              \n  262    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nThe fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest rates, including their\neffect on prepayment speeds. MSRs typically decrease in value when interest rates\ndecline because declining interest rates tend to increase prepayments and\ntherefore reduce the expected life of the net servicing cash flows that comprise\nthe MSR asset. Conversely, securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities), and\ncertain derivatives (e.g., those for which the Firm receives fixed-rate interest\npayments) increase in value when interest rates decline. JPMorgan Chase uses\ncombinations of derivatives and securities to manage the risk of changes in the\nfair value of MSRs. The intent is to offset any interest-rate related changes in\nthe fair value of MSRs with changes in the fair value of the related risk\nmanagement instruments.\nThe following table summarizes MSR

31, 2020, JPMorgan Chase and its\nsubsidiaries were obligated under a number of noncancelable leases, predominantly\noperating leases for premises and equipment used primarily for business purposes.\nThese leases generally have terms of 20years or less, determined based on the\ncontractual maturity of the lease, and include periods covered by options to\nextend or terminate the lease when the Firm is reasonably certain that it will\nexercise those options. All leases with lease terms greater than twelve months are\nreported as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) asset.\nNone of these lease agreements impose restrictions on the Firm\u2019s ability to pay\ndividends, engage in debt or equity financing transactions or enter into further\nlease agreements. Certain of these leases contain escalation clauses that will\nincrease rental payments based on maintenance, utility and tax increases, which\nare non-lease components. The Firm elected not to separate lease and non-lease\ncomponents of a contract for its real estate leases. As such, real estate lease\npayments represent payments on both lease and non-lease components. Operating\nlease liabilities and ROU assets are recognized at the lease commencement date\nbased on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease\nterm. The future lease payments are discounted at a rate that represents the\nFirm\u2019s collateralized borrowing rate for financing instruments of a similar term\nand are included in accounts payable and other liabilities. The operating lease\nROU asset, included in premises and equipment, also includes any lease prepayments\nmade, plus initial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received.\nRental expense associated with operating leases is recognized on a straight-line\nbasis over the lease term, and generally included in occupancy expense in the\nConsolidated statements of income.\nThe following tables provide\ninformation related to the Firm\u2019s\noperating leases:\n                                                                               \n  December 31,                                                                 \n  (in millions, except where otherwise noted)                                  \n  2020                                               2019                      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Right-of-use assets                            $  8,006       $  8,190       \n  Lease liabilities                                 8,508          8,505       \n  Weighted average remaining lease term                    8.7            8.8  \n  (in years)                                                                   \n  Weighted average discount rate                     3.48    %      3.68    %  \n  Supplemental cash flow information                                           \n  Cash paid for amounts included in the                                        \n  measurement of lease liabilities -             $  1,626       $  1,572       \n  operating cash flows                                                         \n  Supplemental non-cash information                                            \n  Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange       $  1,350       $  1,413       \n  for operating lease obligations                                              \n                                                                               \n                                                   \n  Year ended December 31,                          \n  (in millions)                  2020        2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Rental expense                                   \n  Gross rental expense       $  2,094    $  2,057  \n  Sublease rental income         -166        -184  \n  Net rental expense         $  1,928    $  1,873  \n                                                   \nThe following table presents future\npayments under operating leases as of\nDecember 31, 2020:\n                                                      \n  Year ended December 31, (in millions)               \n  2021                                         1,606  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  2022                                         1,435  \n  2023                                         1,270  \n  2024                                         1,123  \n  2025                                           947  \n  After 2025                                   3,602  \n  Total future minimum lease payments          9,983  \n  Less: Imputed interest                      -1,475  \n  Total                                    $   8,508  \n                                                      \nIn addition to the table above, as of\nDecember 31, 2020, the Firm had\nadditional future operating lease\ncommitments of $ 1.2billion that were\nsigned but had not yet commenced.

JPMorgan\nChase uses the asset and liability\nmethod to provide income taxes on all\ntransactions recorded in the\nConsolidated Financial Statements. This\nmethod requires that income taxes\nreflect the expected future tax\nconsequences of temporary differences\nbetween the carrying amounts of assets\nor liabilities for book and tax\npurposes. Accordingly, a deferred tax\nasset or liability for each temporary\ndifference is determined based on the\ntax rates that the Firm expects to be\nin effect when the underlying items of\nincome and expense are realized.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s expense for income\ntaxes includes the current and deferred\nportions of that expense. A valuation\nallowance is established to reduce\ndeferred tax assets to the amount the\nFirm expects to realize. Due to the\ninherent complexities arising from the\nnature of the Firm\u2019s businesses, and\nfrom conducting business and being\ntaxed in a substantial number of\njurisdictions, significant judgments\nand estimates are required to be made.\nAgreement of tax liabilities between\nJPMorgan Chase and the many tax\njurisdictions in which the Firm files\ntax returns may not be finalized for\nseveral years.

At December\n31, 2020, total U.S. federal NOL\ncarryforwards were $ 799million,\nnon-U.S. NOL carryforwards were $\n139million, FTC carryforwards were $\n444million, state and local capital\nloss carryforwards were $ 1.1billion,\nand other federal tax attributes were $\n393million. If not utilized, a portion\nof the U.S. federal NOL carryforwards\nand other U.S. federal tax attributes\nwill expire between 2022 and 2037\nwhereas others have an unlimited\ncarryforward period.\n\nSimilarly, certain non-U.S. NOL\ncarryforwards will expire between 2026\nand 2036 whereas others have an\nunlimited carryforward period. The FTC\ncarryforwards will expire between 2029\nand 2030, and the state and local\ncapital loss carryforwards will expire\nbetween 2021 and 2022. The valuation\nallowance at December 31, 2020, was due\nto the state and local capital loss\ncarryforwards, FTC carryforwards, and\ncertain non-U.S. deferred tax assets,\nincluding NOL carryforwards.\n\nUnrecognized tax benefits\n\nAt December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018,\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s unrecognized tax\nbenefits, excluding related interest\nexpense and penalties, were $\n4.3billion, $ 4.0billion and $\n4.9billion, respectively, of which $\n3.1billion, $ 2.8billion and $\n3.8billion, respectively, if\nrecognized, would reduce the annual\neffective tax rate. Included in the\namount of unrecognized tax benefits are\ncertain items that would not affect the\neffective tax rate if they were\nrecognized in the Consolidated\nstatements of income. These\nunrecognized items include the tax\neffect of certain temporary\ndifferences, the portion of gross state\nand local unrecognized tax benefits\nthat would be offset by the benefit\nfrom associated U.S. federal income tax\ndeductions, and the portion of gross\nnon-U.S. unrecognized tax benefits that\nwould have offsets in other\njurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase is\npresently under audit by a number of\ntaxing authorities, most notably by the\nInternal Revenue Service as summarized\nin the Tax examination status table\nbelow. As JPMorgan Chase is presently\nunder audit by a number of taxing\nauthorities, it is reasonably possible\nthat over the next 12 months the\nresolution of these examinations may\nincrease or decrease the gross balance\nof unrecognized tax benefits by as much\nas approximately $ 300million.

(\u201cParent Company\u201d) and certain of its affiliates from\nborrowing from banking subsidiaries unless the loans are secured in specified\namounts. Such secured loans provided by any banking subsidiary to the Parent\nCompany or to any particular affiliate, together with certain other transactions\nwith such affiliate (collectively referred to as \u201ccovered transactions\u201d), are\ngenerally limited to 10% of the banking subsidiary\u2019s total capital, as determined\nby the risk-based capital guidelines; the aggregate amount of covered transactions\nbetween any banking subsidiary and all of its affiliates is limited to 20% of the\nbanking subsidiary\u2019s total capital. The Parent Company\u2019s two principal\nsubsidiaries are JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC, an\nintermediate holding company (the \u201cIHC\u201d). The IHC holds the stock of substantially\nall of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its\nsubsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and owes intercompany indebtedness to\nthe holding company. The Parent Company is obligated to contribute to the IHC\nsubstantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances (including\nissuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common\nstock). The principal sources of income and funding for the Parent Company are\ndividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and extensions of credit\nfrom the IHC. In addition to dividend restrictions set forth in statutes and\nregulations, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have authority under the\nFinancial Institutions Supervisory Act to prohibit or to limit the payment of\ndividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including the Parent\nCompany and its subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies, if, in the\nbanking regulator\u2019s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or\nunsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization.\nThe IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the Parent\nCompany if certain capital or liquidity \u201cthresholds\u201d are breached or if limits are\notherwise imposed by the Parent Company\u2019s management or Board of Directors. At\nJanuary 1, 2021, the Parent Company\u2019s banking subsidiaries could pay, in the\naggregate, approximately $ 13billion in dividends to their respective bank holding\ncompanies without the prior approval of their relevant banking regulators. The\ncapacity to pay dividends in 2021 will be supplemented by the banking\nsubsidiaries\u2019 earnings during the year.\n                                              \n  280    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n  Note 27 \u2013 Regulatory capital                                                    \n                                                                                  \nThe Federal Reserve establishes capital\nrequirements, including well-\ncapitalized standards, for the\nconsolidated financial holding company.\nThe OCC establishes similar minimum\ncapital requirements and standards for\nthe Firm\u2019s principal IDI subsidiary,\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The capital\nrules under Basel III establish minimum\ncapital ratios and overall capital\nadequacy standards for large and\ninternationally active U.S. bank\nholding companies and banks, including\nthe Firm and its IDI subsidiaries,\nincluding JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Two\ncomprehensive approaches are prescribed\nfor calculating RWA: a standardized\napproach (\u201cBasel III Standardized\u201d),\nand an advanced approach (\u201cBasel III\nAdvanced\u201d). For each of the risk-based\ncapital ratios, the capital adequacy of\nthe Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nis evaluated against the lower of the\nStandardized or Advanced approaches\ncompared to their respective minimum\ncapital ratios. The three components of\nregulatory capital under the Basel III\nrules are as illustrated below: Under\nthe risk-based capital and leverage-\nbased guidelines of the Federal\nReserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to\nmaintain minimum ratios for CET1\ncapital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital,\nTier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to\nmeet these minimum requirements could\ncause the Federal Reserve to take\naction. IDI subsidiaries are also\nsubject to these capital requirements\nestablished by their respective primary\nregulators .\nThe following table presents the minimum and well-capitalized ratios to which the\nFirm and its IDI subsidiaries were subject as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n                                                                                  \n          Stan\u2026                     Adva\u2026                                         \n          capi\u2026                     Mini\u2026                   Wel\u2026                  \n          rati\u2026                     capi\u2026                   rat\u2026                  \n                                    rati\u2026                                         \n          BHC(\u2026        IDI(\u2026        BHC(\u2026       IDI(\u2026       BHC\u2026        IDI(\u2026     \n  Cap\u2026                                                                            \n  rat\u2026                                                                            \n  CET1     11.3  %       7.0  %      10.5  %      7.0  %          NA      6.5  %  \n  cap\u2026                                                                            \n  Tier                                                                            \n  1        12.8          8.5         12.0         8.5        6.0          8.0     \n  cap\u2026                                                                            \n  Tot\u2026     14.8         10.5         14.0        10.5       10.0         10.0     \n  cap\u2026                                                                            \n  Tier                                                                            \n  1         4.0          4.0          4.0         4.0             NA      5.0     \n  lev\u2026                                                                            \n  SLR            NA           NA      5.0         6.0             NA      6.0     \n                                                                                  \nNote: The table above is as defined by the regulations issued by the Federal\nReserve, OCC and FDIC and to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries are subject.\n(a) Represents the minimum capital ratios applicable to the Firm.

The countercyclical buffer is currently set\nto 0% by the federal banking agencies.\n(b) For the period ended December 31, 2019, the CET1, Tier 1, Total, Tier 1\nleverage and SLR minimum capital ratios under Basel III Standardized applicable to\nthe Firm were 10.5%, 12.0%, 14.0%, 4.0%, and 5.0%, respectively.\n(c) Represents minimum SLR requirement of 3.0%, as well as supplementary leverage\nbuffer requirements of 2.0% and 3.0% for BHC and IDI, respectively.\n(d) Represents requirements for JPMorgan Chase\u2019s IDI subsidiaries. The CET1, Tier\n1 and Total capital minimum capital ratios include a fixed capital conservation\nbuffer requirement of 2.5% that is applicable to the IDI subsidiaries. The IDI\nsubsidiaries are not subject to the GSIB surcharge.\n(e) Represents requirements for bank holding companies pursuant to regulations\nissued by the Federal Reserve.\n(f) Represents requirements for IDI subsidiaries pursuant to regulations issued\nunder the FDIC Improvement Act.\nCurrent Expected Credit Losses\nEffective January 1, 2020, the Firm\nadopted the Financial Instruments \u2013\nCredit Losses guidance under U.S. GAAP.\nAs permitted under the U.S. capital\nrules issued by the federal banking\nagencies in 2019, the Firm initially\nelected to phase-in the January 1, 2020\n(\u201cday 1\u201d) CECL adoption impact to\nretained earnings of $2.7 billion to\nCET1 capital, at 25% per year in each\nof 2020 to 2023. As part of their\nresponse to the impact of the COVID-19\npandemic, on March 31, 2020, the\nfederal banking agencies issued an\ninterim final rule (issued as final on\nAugust 26, 2020) that provided the\noption to delay the effects of CECL on\nregulatory capital for two years,\nfollowed by a three-year transition\nperiod . The final rule provides a\nuniform approach for estimating the\neffects of CECL compared to the legacy\nincurred loss model during the first\ntwo years of the transition period (the\n\u201cday 2\u201d transition amount), whereby the\nFirm may exclude from CET1 capital 25%\nof the change in the\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    281  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \nallowance for credit losses (excluding allowances on PCD loans). The cumulative\nday 2 transition amount as at December 31, 2021 that is not recognized in CET1\ncapital, as well as the $ 2.7billion day 1 impact, will be phased into CET1\ncapital at 25% per year beginning January 1, 2022. The Firm has elected to apply\nthe CECL capital transition provisions, and accordingly, for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020, the capital metrics of the Firm exclude $ 5.7billion , which is\nthe $ 2.7billion day 1 impact to retained earnings and 25% of the $ 12.2billion\nincrease in the allowance for credit losses (excluding allowances on PCD loans).\nThe impacts of the CECL capital transition provisions have also been incorporated\ninto Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, and total leverage exposure. Refer\nto Note 1 for further information on the CECL accounting guidance.\n\nThe following tables present the risk-based and leverage-based capital metrics for\nJPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. under both the Basel III Standardized\nand Basel III Advanced Approaches. As of December 31, 2020, the capital metrics\nare presented applying the CECL capital transition provisions.

The\ncontractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible\ncredit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or\nthe Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the\ncustomer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the\ncontract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been\nrefinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default\noccurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not,\nin the Firm\u2019s view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or\nfunding requirements. To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and\ncertain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on\nlending-related commitments is maintained.Refer to Note 13 for further information\nregarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments,\nincluding the impact of the Firm\u2019s adoption of CECL accounting guidance on January\n1, 2020. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying\nvalues of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and\nother commitments at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The amounts in the table below\nfor credit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total\navailable credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not\nanticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized\nat the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by\nproviding the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without\nnotice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower\nis 60days or more past due.

U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a contract\nthat contingently requires the guarantor to pay a guaranteed party based upon: (a)\nchanges in an underlying asset, liability or equity security of the guaranteed\nparty; or (b) a third party\u2019s failure to perform under a specified agreement. The\nFirm considers the following off\u2013balance sheet arrangements to be guarantees under\nU.S. GAAP: standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees, securities\nlending indemnifications, certain indemnification agreements included within\nthird-party contractual arrangements, certain derivative contracts and the\nguarantees under the sponsored member repo program. As required by U.S. GAAP, the\nFirm initially records guarantees at the inception date fair value of the non-\ncontingent obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of consideration received or the\nnet present value of the premium receivable). For these obligations, the Firm\nrecords this fair value amount in other liabilities with an offsetting entry\nrecorded in cash (for premiums received), or other assets (for premiums\nreceivable). Any premium receivable recorded in other assets is reduced as cash is\nreceived under the contract, and the fair value of the liability recorded at\ninception is amortized into income as lending and deposit-related fees over the\nlife of the guarantee contract. The lending-related contingent obligation is\nrecognized based on expected credit losses in addition to, and separate from, any\nnon-contingent obligation. Non-lending-related contingent obligations are\nrecognized when the liability becomes probable and reasonably estimable. These\nobligations are not recognized if the estimated amount is less than the carrying\namount of any non-contingent liability recognized at inception (adjusted for any\namortization). Examples of non-lending-related contingent obligations include\nindemnifications provided in sales agreements, where a portion of the sale\nproceeds is allocated to the guarantee, which adjusts the gain or loss that would\notherwise result from the transaction. For these indemnifications, the initial\nliability is amortized to income as the Firm\u2019s risk is reduced (i.e., over time or\nwhen the indemnification expires). The contractual amount and carrying value of\nguarantees and indemnifications are included in the table on page 284. For\nadditional information on the guarantees, see below. Standby letters of credit and\nother financial guarantees Standby letters of credit and other financial\nguarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the\nperformance of a client or customer to a third party under certain arrangements,\nsuch as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings,\ntrade and similar transactions.\nThe following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of\nstandby letters of credit and other financial guarantees and other letters of\ncredit arrangements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nStandby letters of credit, other financial guarantees and other letters of credit\n                                                                                  \n           2020                                2019                               \n           Stand\u2026                              Standby                            \n           lette\u2026                              letters                            \n           of                                  of                                 \n           credit                              credit                             \n  Dece\u2026    and                        Other    and                         Other  \n  31,      other                     lette\u2026    other                      lette\u2026  \n  (in      finan\u2026                        of    financ\u2026                        of  \n  mill\u2026    guara\u2026                    credit    guaran\u2026                    credit  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Inve\u2026              $  22,850    $   2,263               $  26,880    $   2,137  \n  Noni\u2026                  8,132          790                   7,362          824  \n  Total                                                                           \n  cont\u2026              $  30,982    $   3,053               $  34,242    $   2,961  \n  amou\u2026                                                                           \n  Allo\u2026                                                                           \n  for                $      80    $      14               $     216    $       4  \n  lend\u2026                                                                           \n  comm\u2026                                                                           \n  Guar\u2026                    363            \u2014                     402            \u2014  \n  liab\u2026                                                                           \n  Total                                                                           \n  carr\u2026              $     443    $      14               $     618    $       4  \n  value                                                                           \n  Comm\u2026                                                                           \n  with               $  17,238    $     498               $  17,853    $     728  \n  coll\u2026                                                                           \n                                                                                  \n(a) The ratings scale is based on the Firm\u2019s internal risk ratings.

As part of this program, the\nFirm provides an indemnification in the\nlending agreements which protects the\nlender against the failure of the\nborrower to return the lent securities.\nTo minimize its liability under these\nindemnification agreements, the Firm\nobtains cash or other highly liquid\ncollateral with a market value\nexceeding 100% of the value of the\nsecurities on loan from the borrower.\nCollateral is marked to market daily to\nhelp assure that collateralization is\nadequate. Additional collateral is\ncalled from the borrower if a shortfall\nexists, or collateral may be released\nto the borrower in the event of\novercollateralization. If a borrower\ndefaults, the Firm would use the\ncollateral held to purchase replacement\nsecurities in the market or to credit\nthe lending client or counterparty with\nthe cash equivalent thereof. The cash\ncollateral held by the Firm may be\ninvested on behalf of the client in\nindemnified resale agreements, whereby\nthe Firm indemnifies the client against\nthe loss of principal invested. To\nminimize its liability under these\nagreements, the Firm obtains collateral\nwith a market value exceeding 100% of\nthe principal invested. Derivatives\nqualifying as guarantees The Firm\ntransacts in certain derivative\ncontracts that have the characteristics\nof a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. These\ncontracts include written put options\nthat require the Firm to purchase\nassets upon exercise by the option\nholder at a specified price by a\nspecified date in the future. The Firm\nmay enter into written put option\ncontracts in order to meet client\nneeds, or for other trading purposes.\nThe terms of written put options are\ntypically five yearsor less.\nDerivatives deemed to be guarantees\nalso includes stable value contracts,\ncommonly referred to as \u201cstable value\nproducts\u201d, that require the Firm to\nmake a payment of the difference\nbetween the market value and the book\nvalue of a counterparty\u2019s reference\nportfolio of assets in the event that\nmarket value is less than book value\nand certain other conditions have been\nmet. Stable value products are\ntransacted in order to allow investors\nto realize investment returns with less\nvolatility than an unprotected\nportfolio. These contracts are\ntypically longer-term or may have no\nstated maturity, but allow the Firm to\nelect to terminate the contract under\ncertain conditions. The notional value\nof derivatives guarantees generally\nrepresents the Firm\u2019s maximum exposure.\nHowever, exposure to certain stable\nvalue products is contractually limited\nto a substantially lower percentage of\nthe notional amount. The fair value of\nderivative guarantees reflects the\nprobability, in the Firm\u2019s view, of\nwhether the Firm will be required to\nperform under the contract. The Firm\nreduces exposures to these contracts by\nentering into offsetting transactions,\nor by entering into contracts that\nhedge the market risk related to the\nderivative guarantees.\nThe following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying as guarantees as of\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                December 31,      \n  (in millions)                 December 31, 2020               2019              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Notional                                                                        \n  amounts                                                                         \n  Derivative         $  54,415                       $  53,089                    \n  guarantees                                                                      \n  Stable value                                                                    \n  contracts with                                                                  \n  contractually         27,752                          28,877                    \n  limited                                                                         \n  exposure                                                                        \n  Maximum                                                                         \n  exposure of                                                                     \n  stable value                                                                    \n  contracts with         2,803                           2,967                    \n  contractually                                                                   \n  limited                                                                         \n  exposure                                                                        \n  Fair value                                                                      \n  Derivative               322                             159                    \n  payables                                                                        \n                                                                                  \nIn addition to derivative contracts\nthat meet the characteristics of a\nguarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser\nand seller of credit protection in the\ncredit derivatives market. Refer to\nNote 5 for a further discussion of\ncredit derivatives. Unsettled\nsecurities financing agreements In the\nnormal course of business, the Firm\nenters into resale and securities\nborrowed agreements. At settlement,\nthese commitments result in the Firm\nadvancing cash to and receiving\nsecurities collateral from the\ncounterparty. The Firm also enters into\nrepurchase and securities loaned\nagreements. At settlement, these\ncommitments result in the Firm\nreceiving cash from and providing\nsecurities collateral to the\ncounterparty. Such agreements settle at\na future date. These agreements\ngenerally do not meet the definition of\na derivative, and therefore, are not\nrecorded on the Consolidated balance\nsheets until settlement date. These\nagreements predominantly have regular-\nway settlement terms. Refer to Note 11\nfor a further discussion of securities\nfinancing agreements. Loan sales- and\nsecuritization-related indemnifications\nMortgage repurchase liability In\nconnection with the Firm\u2019s mortgage\nloan sale and securitization activities\nwith U.S. GSEs the Firm has made\nrepresentations and warranties that the\nloans sold meet certain requirements,\nand that may require the Firm to\nrepurchase mortgage loans and/or\nindemnify the loan purchaser if such\nrepresentations and warranties are\nbreached by the Firm. Private label\nsecuritizations The liability related\nto repurchase demands associated with\nprivate label securitizations is\nseparately evaluated by the Firm in\nestablishing its litigation reserves.\nRefer to Note 30 for additional\ninformation regarding litigation. Loans\nsold with recourse The Firm provides\nservicing for mortgages and certain\ncommercial lending products on both a\nrecourse and nonrecourse basis. In\nnonrecourse servicing, the principal\ncredit risk to the Firm is the cost of\ntemporary servicing advances of funds\n(i.e., normal servicing advances). In\nrecourse servicing, the servicer agrees\nto share credit risk\n                                              \n  286    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nwith the owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or a\nprivate investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing predominantly\noccur when foreclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan\nare less than the sum of the outstanding principal balance, plus accrued interest\non the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property. The\nFirm\u2019s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, thereby effectively\ntransferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-\nbacked securities issued by the trust. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the unpaid\nprincipal balance of loans sold with recourse totaled $ 889million and $\n944million, respectively. The carrying value of the related liability that the\nFirm has recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets, which is representative of the Firm\u2019s view of the likelihood it\nwill have to perform under its recourse obligations, was $ 23million and $\n27million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Other off-balance sheet\narrangements Indemnification agreements \u2013 general In connection with issuing\nsecurities to investors outside the U.S., the Firm may agree to pay additional\namounts to the holders of the securities in the event that, due to a change in tax\nlaw, certain types of withholding taxes are imposed on payments on the securities.\nThe terms of the securities may also give the Firm the right to redeem the\nsecurities if such additional amounts are payable. The Firm may also enter into\nindemnification clauses in connection with the licensing of software to clients\n(\u201csoftware licensees\u201d) or when it sells a business or assets to a third party\n(\u201cthird-party purchasers\u201d), pursuant to which it indemnifies software licensees\nfor claims of liability or damages that may occur subsequent to the licensing of\nthe software, or third-party purchasers for losses they may incur due to actions\ntaken by the Firm prior to the sale of the business or assets. It is difficult to\nestimate the Firm\u2019s maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements,\nsince this would require an assessment of future changes in tax law and future\nclaims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However,\nbased on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to be remote.\nMerchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment networks, the Firm, in its role\nas a merchant acquirer, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed\ncredit and debit card transactions that result in a charge-back to the merchant.\nIf a dispute is resolved in the cardholder\u2019s favor, Merchant Services will\n(through the cardholder\u2019s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the\ncardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If Merchant\nServices is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, Merchant Services will\nbear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. Merchant\nServices mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash\nreserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, Merchant Services\nrecognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk to\nthe Firm related to charge-backs. The carrying value of the valuation allowance\nwas $ 12million and $ 11million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For\nthe years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, Merchant Services processed an\naggregate volume of $ 1,597.3billion, $ 1,511.5billion, and $ 1,366.1billion,\nrespectively. Clearing Services \u2013 Client Credit Risk The Firm provides clearing\nservices for clients by entering into securities purchases and sales and\nderivative contracts with CCPs, including ETDs such as futures and options, as\nwell as OTC-cleared derivative contracts. As a clearing member, the Firm stands\nbehind the performance of its clients, collects cash and securities collateral\n(margin) as well as any settlement amounts due from or to clients, and remits them\nto the relevant CCP or client in whole or part. There are two types of margin:\nvariation margin is posted on a daily basis based on the value of clients\u2019\nderivative contracts and initial margin is posted at inception of a derivative\ncontract, generally on the basis of the potential changes in the variation margin\nrequirement for the contract. As a clearing member, the Firm is exposed to the\nrisk of nonperformance by its clients, but is not liable to clients for the\nperformance of the CCPs. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its risk to\nthe client through the collection of appropriate amounts of margin at inception\nand throughout the life of the transactions. The Firm can also cease providing\nclearing services if clients do not adhere to their obligations under the clearing\nagreement. In the event of nonperformance by a client, the Firm would close out\nthe client\u2019s positions and access available margin. The CCP would utilize any\nmargin it holds to make itself whole, with any remaining shortfalls required to be\npaid by the Firm as a clearing member. The Firm reflects its exposure to\nnonperformance risk of the client through the recognition of margin receivables\nfrom clients and margin payables to CCPs; the clients\u2019 underlying securities or\nderivative contracts are not reflected in the Firm\u2019s Consolidated Financial\nStatements. It is difficult to estimate the Firm\u2019s maximum possible exposure\nthrough its role as a clearing member, as this would require an assessment of\ntransactions that clients may execute in the future. However, based upon\nhistorical experience, and the credit risk mitigants available to the Firm,\nmanagement believes it is unlikely that the Firm will have to make any material\npayments under these arrangements and the risk of loss is expected to be remote.\nRefer to Note 5 for information on the derivatives that the Firm executes for its\nown account and records in its Consolidated Financial Statements.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    287  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \nExchange & Clearing House Memberships The Firm is a member of several securities\nand derivative exchanges and clearing houses, both in the U.S. and other\ncountries, and it provides clearing services to its clients. Membership in some of\nthese organizations requires the Firm to pay a pro rata share of the losses\nincurred by the organization as a result of the default of another member. Such\nobligations vary with different organizations. These obligations may be limited to\nthe amount (or a multiple of the amount) of the Firm\u2019s contribution to the\nguarantee fund maintained by a clearing house or exchange as part of the resources\navailable to cover any losses in the event of a member default. Alternatively,\nthese obligations may also include a pro rata share of the residual losses after\napplying the guarantee fund. Additionally, certain clearing houses require the\nFirm as a member to pay a pro rata share of losses that may result from the\nclearing house\u2019s investment of guarantee fund contributions and initial margin,\nunrelated to and independent of the default of another member. Generally a payment\nwould only be required should such losses exceed the resources of the clearing\nhouse or exchange that are contractually required to absorb the losses in the\nfirst instance. In certain cases, it is difficult to estimate the Firm\u2019s maximum\npossible exposure under these membership agreements, since this would require an\nassessment of future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet\noccurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the risk of\nloss to the Firm to be remote. Where the Firm\u2019s maximum possible exposure can be\nestimated, the amount is disclosed in the table on page 284, in the Exchange &\nclearing house guarantees and commitments line. Sponsored member repo program The\nFirm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight resale and repurchase\nagreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation (\u201cFICC\u201d) on behalf of clients that become sponsored members under the\nFICC\u2019s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment and\nperformance of its sponsored member clients\u2019 respective obligations under the\nFICC\u2019s rules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these overnight guarantees by\nobtaining a security interest in the cash or high-quality securities collateral\nthat the clients place with the clearing house; therefore, the Firm expects the\nrisk of loss to be remote. The Firm\u2019s maximum possible exposure, without taking\ninto consideration the associated collateral, is included in the Exchange &\nclearing house guarantees and commitments line on page 284. Refer to Note 11 for\nadditional information on credit risk mitigation practices on resale agreements\nand the types of collateral pledged under repurchase agreements. Guarantees of\nsubsidiaries In the normal course of business, the Parent Company may provide\ncounterparties with guarantees of certain of the trading and other obligations of\nits subsidiaries on a contract-by-contract basis, as negotiated with the Firm\u2019s\ncounterparties. The obligations of the subsidiaries are included on the Firm\u2019s\nConsolidated balance sheets or are reflected as off-balance sheet commitments;\ntherefore, the Parent Company has not recognized a separate liability for these\nguarantees. The Firm believes that the occurrence of any event that would trigger\npayments by the Parent Company under these guarantees is remote. The Parent\nCompany has guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes of its\nsubsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (\u201cJPMFC\u201d), a\n100%-owned and consolidated finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are\nfully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and no other subsidiary\nof the parent company guarantees these securities. These guarantees, which rank on\na parity with the Firm\u2019s unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, are not\nincluded in the table on page 284 of this Note.

The\nlitigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class\naction lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve\nboth formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-\nregulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of\nadjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm\u2019s lines\nof business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common\nlaw tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer\nprotection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm believes\nthe estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of\nreserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $ 0to approximately $\n1.5billion at December 31, 2020. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably\npossible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those\nproceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible\nloss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an\nestimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm\u2019s estimate of the aggregate range\nof reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: \u2022 the number,\nvariety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in\npreliminary stages, \u2022 the existence in many such proceedings of multiple\ndefendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be\ndetermined, \u2022 the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings,\nincluding issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the\nclaims, and \u2022 the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such\nproceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future\nrulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of\nadverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be\nincorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result\nwhich the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had\ndeemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm\u2019s\nestimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from\ntime to time, and actual losses may vary significantly. Set forth below are\ndescriptions of the Firm\u2019s material legal proceedings. Advisory and Other\nActivities . In November 2020, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. entered into a resolution\nwith the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d) regarding historical\ndeficiencies in internal controls and internal audit for certain fiduciary\nactivities. In connection with the resolution, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid a $\n250million Civil Money Penalty. The OCC found that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has\nremediated the deficiencies that led to the penalty. Amrapali . India\u2019s\nEnforcement Directorate (\u201cED\u201d) is investigating JPMorgan India Private Limited in\nconnection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by twooffshore funds formerly\nmanaged by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects developed by\nthe Amrapali Group (\u201cAmrapali\u201d). In 2017, numerous creditors filed civil claims\nagainst Amrapali including petitions brought by home buyers relating to delays in\ndelivering or failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers\u2019 petitions\nhave been overseen by the Supreme Court of India since 2017 pursuant to its\njurisdiction over public interest litigation. In July 2019, the Supreme Court of\nIndia issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties,\nincluding unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had\ninvested in the projects, violated certain currency control and money laundering\nprovisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry under India\u2019s\nPrevention of Money Laundering Act (\u201cPMLA\u201d) and Foreign Exchange Management Act\n(\u201cFEMA\u201d). In May 2020, the Enforcement Directorate issued a provisional attachment\norder as part of the criminal PMLA proceedings freezing approximately $ 25million\nheld by JPMorgan India Private Limited. In June 2020, the funds were transferred\nto an account held by the Supreme Court of India. A separate civil proceeding\nrelating to alleged FEMA violations is ongoing. The Firm is responding to and\ncooperating with the investigation. Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation.\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the\nFederal Government of Nigeria (\u201cFGN\u201d) and two major international oil companies.\nThe account held approximately $ 1.1billion in connection with a dispute among the\nclients over rights to an oil field. Following the settlement of the dispute,\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in\naccordance with directions received from its clients. In November 2017, the\nFederal Republic of Nigeria (\u201cFRN\u201d) commenced a claim in the English High Court\nfor approximately $ 875million in payments made out of the accounts. The FRN,\nclaiming to be the same entity as the FGN, alleges that the payments were\ninstructed as part of a complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but\nthat JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or should have been on\n                                              \n  290    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nnotice that the payments may be fraudulent. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. applied for\nsummary judgment and was unsuccessful. The claim is ongoing and a trial has been\nscheduled to commence in February 2022. Foreign Exchange Investigations and\nLitigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government\nauthorities relating to its foreign exchange (\u201cFX\u201d) sales and trading activities\nand controls related to those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015,\nthe Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. In January\n2017, the Firm was sentenced, with judgment entered thereafter and a term of\nprobation ending in January 2020. The term of probation has concluded, with the\nFirm remaining in good standing throughout the probation period. The Department of\nLabor granted the Firm a five-yearexemption of disqualification that allows the\nFirm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset\nManager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d)\nuntil January 2023. The Firm will need to reapply in due course for a further\nexemption to cover the remainder of the ten-yeardisqualification period. A South\nAfrica Competition Commission matter is the remaining FX-related governmental\ninquiry, and is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal. In\nAugust 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New\nYork granted final approval to the Firm\u2019s settlement of a consolidated class\naction brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of\nfederal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign\nexchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX\nfutures and options on futures. Certain members of the settlement class filed\nrequests to the Court to be excluded from the class, and certain of them filed a\ncomplaint against the Firm and a number of other foreign exchange dealers in\nNovember 2018. A number of these actions remain pending. Further, putative class\nactions have been filed against the Firm and a number of other foreign exchange\ndealers on behalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at\nallegedly inflated rates and purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments;\nthese actions also remain pending in the District Court. In 2020, the Court\napproved a settlement by the Firm and 11other defendants of a class action filed\nby purported indirect purchasers for a total of $ 10million. In addition, some FX-\nrelated individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying\nconduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel and\nAustralia. Interchange Litigation. G roups of merchants and retail associations\nfiled a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as\nwell as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card\ninterchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In\n2012, the parties initially settled the cases for a cash payment, a temporary\nreduction of credit card interchange, and modifications to certain credit card\nnetwork rules. In 2017, after the approval of that settlement was reversed on\nappeal, the case was remanded to the United States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of New York for further proceedings consistent with the appellate\ndecision. The original class action was divided into twoseparate actions, one\nseeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive\nrelief. In September 2018, the parties to the class action seeking monetary relief\nfinalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement.\nPursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an additional\n$ 900million to the approximately $ 5.3billion previously held in escrow from the\noriginal settlement. In December 2019, the amended agreement was approved by the\nDistrict Court. Certain merchants appealed the District Court\u2019s approval order,\nand those appeals are pending. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out\nof the amended class settlement, $ 700million has been returned to the defendants\nfrom the settlement escrow in accordance with the settlement agreement. The class\naction seeking primarily injunctive relief continues separately. In addition,\ncertain merchants have filed individual actions raising similar allegations\nagainst Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks, and some\nof those actions remain pending. LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and\nLitigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various governmental\nagencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers\nAssociation\u2019s London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) for various currencies and\nthe European Banking Federation\u2019s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cEURIBOR\u201d). The\nSwiss Competition Commission\u2019s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the\nFirm and other banks are subject, continues. In December 2016, the European\nCommission issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an\ninfringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed\nan appeal of that decision with the European General Court, and that appeal is\npending. In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other\nbanks in a series of individual and putative class actions related to benchmarks,\nincluding U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA\nand, in a separate consolidated putative class action, during the period that it\nwas administered by ICE Benchmark Administration. These actions have been filed,\nor consolidated for pre-trial purposes, in the United States District Court for\nthe Southern District of New York. In these actions, plaintiffs make varying\nallegations that in various periods, starting in 2000 or later, defendants either\nindividually or collectively manipulated various benchmark rates by submitting\nrates that were artificially low or high. Plaintiffs allege that they transacted\nin loans, derivatives or other financial instruments whose values are affected by\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    291  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \nchanges in these rates and assert a variety of claims including antitrust claims\nseeking treble damages. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period\nthat it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has resolved certain of these\nactions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The District Court\ndismissed certain claims, including antitrust claims brought by some plaintiffs\nwhom the District Court found did not have standing to assert such claims, and\npermitted certain claims to proceed, including antitrust, Commodity Exchange Act,\nSection 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and common law claims. The plaintiffs\nwhose antitrust claims were dismissed for lack of standing have filed an appeal.\nThe District Court granted class certification of antitrust claims related to\nbonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants and denied class\ncertification motions filed by other plaintiffs. In the consolidated putative\nclass action related to the time period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was administered by\nICE Benchmark Administration, the District Court granted defendants\u2019 motion to\ndismiss plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, and the plaintiffs have appealed. The Firm\u2019s\nsettlements of putative class actions related to Swiss franc LIBOR, the Singapore\nInterbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate (\u201cSIBOR\u201d), and the\nAustralian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate, and one of the putative class actions\nrelated to U.S. dollar LIBOR remain subject to court approval. In the class\nactions related to SIBOR and Swiss franc LIBOR, the District Court concluded that\nthe Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, and plaintiffs\u2019 appeals of those\ndecisions are pending. In addition to the actions pending or consolidated in the\nSouthern District of New York, in August 2020, a group of individual plaintiffs\nfiled a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims in the United States District Court for\nthe Northern District of California, alleging that the Firm and other defendants\nwere engaged in an unlawful agreement to set LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the\nmarket for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards. The complaint seeks\ninjunctive relief and monetary damages. Metals and U.S. Treasuries Investigations\nand Litigation and Related Inquiries. The Firm previously reported that it and/or\ncertain of its subsidiaries had entered into resolutions with the U.S. Department\nof Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d), the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) and the\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), which, collectively, resolved\nthose agencies\u2019 respective investigations relating to historical trading practices\nby former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related\nconduct from 2008 to 2016. The Firm entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement\n(\u201cDPA\u201d) with the DOJ in which it agreed to the filing of a criminal information\ncharging JPMorgan Chase & Co. with twocounts of wire fraud and agreed, along with\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to certain terms and\nobligations as set forth therein. Under the terms of the DPA, the criminal\ninformation will be dismissed after three years, provided that JPMorgan Chase &\nCo., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC fully comply with\nall of their obligations. Across the threeresolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC,\nJPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC\nagreed to pay a total monetary amount of approximately $ 920million. A portion of\nthe total monetary amount includes victim compensation payments. Several putative\nclass action complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for\nthe Southern District of New York against the Firm and certain former employees,\nalleging a precious metals futures and options price manipulation scheme in\nviolation of the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust\nenrichment and deceptive acts or practices under the General Business Law of the\nState of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class actions in February\n2019, and the consolidated action is stayed through May 2021. In addition, several\nputative class actions have been filed in the United States District Courts for\nthe Northern District of Illinois and Southern District of New York against the\nFirm, alleging manipulation of U.S. Treasury futures and options, and bringing\nclaims under the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust\nenrichment. The actions in the Northern District of Illinois have been transferred\nto the Southern District of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class\nactions in October 2020 and set a deadline of February 2021 for the filing of a\nconsolidated complaint. Twoputative class action complaints have also been filed\nunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the United States District Court for\nthe Eastern District of New York against the Firm and certain individual\ndefendants on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares during the putative class\nperiod alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially false or\nmisleading in that they did not disclose certain information relating to the\nabove-referenced investigations. Plaintiffs have filed a stipulation seeking\nconsolidation of the actions and the appointment of co-lead plaintiffs and\ncounsel, which is pending Court approval. Wendel. Since 2012, the French criminal\nauthorities have been investigating a series of transactions entered into by\nsenior managers of Wendel Investissement (\u201cWendel\u201d) during the period from 2004\nthrough 2007 to restructure their shareholdings in Wendel. JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A., Paris branch provided financing for the transactions to a number of managers\nof Wendel in 2007. JPMorgan Chase has cooperated with the investigation. The\ninvestigating judges issued an ordonnance de renvoi in November 2016, referring\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel for alleged\ncomplicity in tax fraud. In January 2018, the Paris Court of Appeal issued a\ndecision cancelling the mise en examen of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Court of\nCassation, France\u2019s highest court, ruled in September 2018 that a mise en examen\nis a prerequisite for an\n                                              \n  292    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nordonnance de renvoi and in January 2020 ordered the annulment of the ordonnance\nde renvoi referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel\n. The Court of Appeal found in January 2021 that it had no power to take further\naction against JPMorgan Chase following the Court of Cassation\u2019s ruling. At the\nopening of a trial of the managers of Wendel in January 2021, the tribunal\ncorrectionnel directed the criminal authorities to clarify whether a further\ninvestigation should be opened against JPMorgan Chase, pending which the trial was\npostponed. In addition, a number of the managers have commenced civil proceedings\nagainst JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The claims are separate, involve different\nallegations and are at various stages of proceedings. * * * In addition to the\nvarious legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are\nnamed as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other\nlegal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims\nasserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends\nto defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from\ntime to time in the future. The Firm has established reserves for several hundred\nof its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions\nof U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related\nliability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the\namount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding\nlegal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes\nadjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on\nmanagement\u2019s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm\u2019s legal\nexpense was $ 1.1billion, $ 239million and $ 72million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. There is no assurance that the\nFirm\u2019s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future. In view of\nthe inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings,\nparticularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or\nwhere the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties\nor are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what\nwill be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of\ntheir ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences\nrelated to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current\nknowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal\nproceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation\nreserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other\nlegal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse\neffect on the Firm\u2019s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however,\nthat in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no\nassurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly\nexceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have\nmaterial reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular\nmatter may be material to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operating results for a particular\nperiod, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability\nimposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s income for that period.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    293  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Note 31 \u2013 International operations                                              \n                                                                                  \nThe following table presents income statement and balance sheet-related\ninformation for JPMorgan Chase by major international geographic area.

However, many of the Firm\u2019s U.S. operations\nserve international businesses.

The Firm\u2019s\ndefinition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and\nincludes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and\neach of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue\nfrom investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented\nin the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and\nsecurities. This allows management to assess the comparability of revenue from\nyear-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding\nincome tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax\nexpense/(benefit). These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by\nthe Firm as a whole or by the LOBs. Business segment capital allocation Each\nbusiness segment is allocated capital by taking into consideration a variety of\nfactors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable\nregulatory capital requirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for expected\nreturns are established as key measures of a business segment\u2019s performance. The\nFirm\u2019s allocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized RWA, Basel III\nAdvanced RWA, the GSIB surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe stress\nenvironment. The assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are\nperiodically assessed and as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may\nchange from time to time. Business segment changes In the fourth quarter of 2020,\nthe Firm transferred certain assets, liabilities, revenue, expense and headcount\nassociated with certain wealth management clients from AWM to the J.P. Morgan\nWealth Management business unit within CCB. Prior-period amounts have been revised\nto conform with the current presentation, including the transfer of approximately\n1,650technology and support staff during the second and third quarters of 2020.\nUltra-high-net-worth and certain high-net-worth client relationships remained in\nAWM. In the first quarter of 2020, the Firm began reporting a Wholesale Payments\nbusiness unit within CIB following a realignment of the Firm\u2019s wholesale payments\nbusinesses. The Wholesale Payments business comprises: \u2022 Merchant Services, which\nwas realigned from CCB to CIB \u2022 Treasury Services and Trade Finance in CIB. Trade\nFinance was previously reported in Lending in CIB. In connection with the\nalignment of Wholesale Payments, the assets, liabilities and headcount associated\nwith the Merchant Services business were realigned to CIB from CCB, and the\nrevenue and expenses of the Merchant Services business are reported across CCB,\nCIB and CB based primarily on client relationships. In the fourth quarter of 2020,\npayment processing-only clients along with the associated revenue and expenses\nwere realigned to CIB\u2019s Wholesale Payments business from CCB and CB. Payment\nprocessing-only clients are those that only use payment services offered by\nMerchant Services, and in general do not currently utilize other services offered\nby the Firm. Prior-period amounts have been revised to reflect this realignment\nand revised allocation methodology.\nSegment results and reconciliation (a)\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                              \n  296    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                             \u2026    \n                                                                             \u2026    \n                                                                             \u2026    \n                                                                             \u2026    \n                                                                             \u2026    \n                                                                             \u2026    \n                                                                             \u2026    \n                                                                             \u2026    \n                                                                             \u2026    \n                                                                             \u2026    \n                                                                             \u2026    \n                                                                             \u2026    \n                                                                                  \n(a) Segment results on a managed basis reflect revenue on a FTE basis with the\ncorresponding income tax impact recorded within income tax expense/(benefit).\nThese adjustments are eliminated in reconciling items to arrive at the Firm\u2019s\nreported U.S. GAAP results.\n\n(b) In the second quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain spend-based\ncredit card reward costs from marketing expense to be a reduction of card income,\nwith no effect on net income.

The attribution between volume and rate is calculated using annual average\nbalances for each category of assets and liabilities shown in the table and the\ncorresponding annual rates (refer to pages 300\u2013304 for more information on average\nbalances and rates). In this analysis, when the change cannot be isolated to\neither volume or rate, it has been allocated to volume. The annual rates include\nthe impact of changes in market rates, as well as the impact of any change in\ncomposition of the various products within each category of asset or liability.\nThis analysis is calculated separately for each category without consideration of\nthe relationship between categories (for example, the net spread between the rates\nearned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities that fund those assets). As a\nresult, changes in the granularity or groupings considered in this analysis would\nproduce a different attribution result, and due to the complexities involved,\nprecise allocation of changes in interest rates between volume and rates is\ninherently complex and judgmental.\n                                                                                  \n  (Un\u2026

The current estimated LTV ratios\nare calculated using estimated\ncollateral values derived from a\nnationally recognized home price index\nmeasured at the metropolitan\nstatistical area (\u201cMSA\u201d) level. These\nMSA-level home price indices consist of\nactual data to the extent available and\nforecasted data where actual data is\nnot available. As a result, the\nestimated collateral values used to\ncalculate these ratios do not represent\nactual appraised loan-level collateral\nvalues; as such, the resulting LTV\nratios are necessarily imprecise and\nshould therefore be viewed as\nestimates.\n\nCombined LTV ratio\n\nThe LTV ratio considering all available\nlien positions, as well as unused\nlines, related to the property.\nCombined LTV ratios are used for junior\nlien home equity products.\n\nManaged basis: A non-GAAP presentation\nof Firmwide financial results that\nincludes reclassifications to present\nrevenue on a fully taxable-equivalent\nbasis.

The minimum payment on an\noption ARM loan is based on the\ninterest rate charged during the\nintroductory period. This introductory\nrate is usually significantly below the\nfully indexed rate. The fully indexed\nrate is calculated using an index rate\nplus a margin. Once the introductory\nperiod ends, the contractual interest\nrate charged on the loan increases to\nthe fully indexed rate and adjusts\nmonthly to reflect movements in the\nindex. The minimum payment is typically\ninsufficient to cover interest accrued\nin the prior month, and any unpaid\ninterest is deferred and added to the\nprincipal balance of the loan. Option\nARM loans are subject to payment\nrecast, which converts the loan to a\nvariable-rate fully amortizing loan\nupon meeting specified loan balance and\nanniversary date\n\ntriggers.\n\nPrime\n\nPrime mortgage loans are made to\nborrowers with good credit records who\nmeet specific underwriting\nrequirements, including prescriptive\nrequirements related to income and\noverall debt levels.

Prior to the adoption\nof CECL, excluded PCI loans which were accounted for on a pool basis. Since each\npool was accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and\nan aggregate expectation of cash flows, the past-due status of the pools, or that\nof individual loans within the pools, was not meaningful. The Firm recognized\ninterest income on each pool of loans as each of the pools was performing.\n\n(b) At December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016, excluded mortgage loans 90 or\nmore days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of $364 million, $193\nmillion, $1.6 billion, $2.7 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. At December\n31, 2016, student loans insured by U.S. government agencies under the Federal\nFamily Education Loan Program of $263 million were also excluded prior to sale of\nthe student loan portfolio in 2017. These amounts have been excluded from\nnonaccrual loans based upon the government guarantee.\n                                                                                  \n  (\u2026

The\nfollowing table sets forth this data for the years specified. The change in\nforgone interest income from 2018 through 2020 was primarily driven by the change\nin the levels of nonaccrual loans.\n
