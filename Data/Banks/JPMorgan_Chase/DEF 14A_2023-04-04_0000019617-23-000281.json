Burke, Our Lead Independent Director\n                                                                                               April 4, 2023\nDear fellow shareholders:\n\nIn connection with the 2023 Annual Meeting, we\nwant to share with you some of the highlights of\nthe work of the Board. The Firm continued to\ndemonstrate strong financial performance in 2022,\nbuilding upon its momentum from prior years. We\ngained market share, maintained strong expense\ndiscipline while continuing to invest in our\nbusinesses, continued to achieve high customer\nsatisfaction scores and continued to fortify our\nfortress balance sheet. The Firm achieved a 5th\nconsecutive year of record managed revenue of\n$132.3 billion, as well as strong net income and\nROTCE of $37.7 billion and 18% respectively, which\nhas consistently been among the highest returns of\nour peers.\n\nThat said, our clients and customers, employees\nand communities continue to face headwinds coming\nfrom geopolitical tensions including the war in\nUkraine, the vulnerable state of energy and food\nsupplies, persistent inflation that is eroding\npurchasing power and has pushed interest rates\nhigher, and unprecedented quantitative tightening.\nWe have also seen a small number of bank failures\nand instability in pockets of our industry. While\nwe are committed to doing our part in times of\nstress, we strongly believe that America\u2019s\nfinancial system is among the best in the world,\nand America\u2019s banks \u2013 large, midsize and community\nbanks \u2013 do an extraordinary job serving the\nbanking needs of their unique customers and\ncommunities. And the global banking system has\nstrong credit, plenty of liquidity, and capital.\nNonetheless, we remain vigilant and are prepared\nfor whatever happens so we can work with our\ncustomers, clients and communities around the\nworld across a broad range of economic\nenvironments, while remaining true to our\nfundamental business principles and commitment to\nbuilding long-term value for our shareholders.\n\nThe Board is focused on the many factors that\ncontribute to long-term strong performance,\nincluding continued investment in products,\ntechnology and people. Highlights of our work in\nthe past year include:\n\n\u2022 Executive succession planning\n\nOne of the Board\u2019s top priorities is to plan for\nan orderly CEO transition in the medium term. As\ndiscussed in more detail in this proxy statement,\nthe Board has developed, and will continue to\ndevelop, several Operating Committee members who\nare well-known to shareholders as strong potential\nCEO candidates. In addition, the Board is\nfortunate to have Mr. Pinto as a key executive who\nis immediately ready to step into the role of sole\nCEO, should the need arise in the near-term. Mr.\nPinto\u2019s exceptional leadership capabilities are\nwell known\n\nto our shareholders and he has previously served\nas co-CEO of the Firm during Jamie\u2019s unplanned\nabsence in 2020 due to a medical emergency.\n\nThe Board also recognizes that long-term strong\nperformance depends on a broader winning team. We\nare fortunate to have a highly talented and deeply\ncommitted senior leadership team and a deep bench\nof potential leaders who can execute the Firm\u2019s\nstrategy and enhance our strong culture. We\nencourage you to read the letters from several of\nthese leaders, which are included with our Annual\nReport.\n\n\u2022 Executive compensation and shareholder\nengagement\n\nTo attract and retain top and diverse talent, we\ntake a fair and well-governed, long-term approach\nto compensation, including pay-for-performance\npractices that are responsive to and aligned with\nshareholders and encourage a culture that supports\nour Business Principles and strategic framework.\n\nWe also have a demonstrable history of being\nresponsive to shareholder feedback, so we\u2019ve been\nvery focused on the level of support the Firm\nreceived for last year\u2019s Say on Pay proposal. In\nresponse, we expanded our shareholder outreach and\nengagement. Generally, while shareholders were\ndeeply supportive of management, the Firm\u2019s\nstrategy and its long-term performance, they were\nalso direct in their feedback about the one-time\nspecial awards granted in 2021. We have committed\nto not granting any future special awards to Jamie\nor Mr. Pinto. The full details of the resulting\nactions we have taken can be found in the\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis in this proxy\nstatement.\n\n\u2022 Strategic oversight\n\nThrough our oversight of the strategic planning\nprocess, the Board holds management accountable to\nnavigate change and drive innovation while\nmaintaining a strong risk and control environment.\nWe are particularly focused on keeping pace with\ninvestments in our business offerings and\ntechnology, including digital, cloud, AI and\nmodernization. We constantly evaluate the\ncompetitive landscape, working to ensure we are\noffering best-in-class products and services to\nour customers and communities. We are also being\ndeliberate and thoughtful about investment\nopportunities as well as opportunities to attract,\nsupport and retain a diverse team of outstanding\ntop talent across the Firm.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\u2022 Board refreshment\n\nWe are committed to maintaining a vital Board in\nthe future. We were pleased to welcome two new\ndirectors to our Board this year: Alex Gorsky,\nRetired Chairman and CEO of Johnson & Johnson, and\nAlicia Boler Davis, CEO of Alto Pharmacy, LLC.\nThey each bring extensive experience in managing\nlarge, complex organizations, technology and\ninternational business to the Board\u2019s\ndeliberations, and we look forward to the\ncontributions they will make. Through our ongoing\nrecruitment process, we continue to identify a\n\nrobust pipeline of potential candidates who will\nreflect the right mix of experience, skills and\ndiversity to provide independent oversight for the\nfuture.\n\nAs we look to the future, we are optimistic and\nlook forward to continuing to deliver value to our\ncustomers, shareholders and stakeholders. On\nbehalf of the entire Board, we are grateful for\nyour investment and your support.\n                                        \n  James Dimon                           \n  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  \n  Stephen B.

The decision to\nretain an independent accountant was made following engagement with shareholders and was informed through\nthe Firm\u2019s ongoing engagement with external civil rights and economic justice advisors. The Public\nResponsibility Committee of the JPMC Board of Directors provided oversight of the attestation engagement.\nThe attestation examination was performed in accordance with the standards established by the American\nInstitute of Certified Public Accountants. The independent accountant's report is included in the Racial\nEquity Commitment Audit Report, available on our website. The independent accountant's report includes an\nunqualified opinion that management\u2019s assertion regarding progress in disbursed and/or committed dollars and\nprogress in units toward the Firm's REC is fairly stated in all material respects.\n                               \n  Advancing climate solutions  \n                               \nJPMC continues to work to help our clients navigate the challenges and realize the economic opportunities of\nthe transition to a low-carbon economy. We believe helping our clients finance and accelerate their\ntransition objectives creates positive environmental benefits while generating long-term financial return\nfor our shareholders.\n\n\u2022 We published the Firm\u2019s 2022 Climate Report, informed by recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-\nrelated Financial Disclosures, which outlines the measures we are taking to address the climate challenge\nacross our business. The report provides updates on how we are measuring and making progress towards\npreviously established emission intensity reduction targets for the Oil & Gas, Electric Power and Automotive\nManufacturing sectors and announces 2030 emissions intensity reduction targets for three new sectors \u2013 Iron\n& Steel, Cement and Aviation.\n\n\u2022 We launched our Carbon Assessment Framework (\u201cCAF\u201d) to bring a climate lens to the way we make financing\ndecisions in the sectors covered by our climate targets. We created the CAF process to assess clients on\ntheir carbon performance as one consideration as part of our decision-making for new transactions within in-\nscope sectors and have set up governance frameworks to monitor and guide our progress. By considering CAF as\none element of our transaction-level decision-making for in-scope clients, we are able to assess how an in-\nscope transaction may affect progress toward our portfolio-level targets.\n\n\u2022 We also reported on progress towards the target we set in 2021 to finance and facilitate more than $2.5\ntrillion over 10 years to advance long-term solutions that address climate change and contribute to\nsustainable development. As part of this target, we aim to finance and facilitate $1 trillion to support\nclimate action and other green initiatives. In 2022, our Firm financed and facilitated $70 billion in\nsupport of the $1 trillion green objective. Collectively, through 2022, we have financed and facilitated\n$482 billion toward our Sustainable Development Target, including $176 billion toward our $1 trillion green\ntarget. This encompassed a range of activities, including underwriting of green bonds, lending to support\nconstruction of sustainable infrastructure and raising capital for innovative clean technology, renewable\nenergy and sustainable transportation companies.\n                                                                                                            \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.42023 PROXY STATEMENT                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                                                                                            \n  PROXY SUMMARY                                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \n                                              \n  Proposal 1: Election of Directors \u2013 page 9  \n                                              \nThe Board of Directors has nominated the 12 individuals listed below.

How we think about pay decisions\n\nThe Firm\u2019s How We Do Business Principles (\"Business Principles\") and strategic framework form the basis of\nour OC members\u2019 strategic priorities. The CMDC references those strategic priorities and the Firm\u2019s\ncompensation philosophy to assess OC members\u2019 performance and to determine their respective total\ncompensation levels and pay mix. The CMDC also considers shareholder feedback and has responded to the\nfeedback by making changes to how we pay and by enhancing our disclosures.\n\n2. How we performed against our business strategy\n\nWe continued to deliver strong multi-year financial performance, invest in our future, strengthen our risk\nand control environment, and reinforce our culture and values, including our long-standing commitment to\nserve our customers, employees and communities, and conduct business in a responsible way to drive inclusive\ngrowth.\n\n3. How performance determined pay in 2022\n\nIn determining OC member pay, the CMDC took into account performance across four broad performance\ndimensions: Business Results; Risk, Controls & Conduct; Client/Customer/Stakeholder; and Teamwork &\nLeadership. CEO pay is strongly aligned to the Firm\u2019s short-, medium- and long-term performance, with\napproximately 85% of the CEO\u2019s variable pay deferred into equity, of which 100% is in at-risk PSUs for both\nour CEO and our President & COO. Other NEO pay is also strongly aligned to Firm and line of business (\"LOB\")\nperformance, with a majority of variable pay deferred into equity, of which 50% is in at-risk PSUs.\n                                                 \n  Disciplined performance assessment process to  \n  determine pay                                  \n                                                 \nThe CMDC uses a balanced holistic approach to determine annual compensation, which includes a disciplined\nassessment of performance against the aforementioned four broad dimensions over a sustained period of time.\n\nThe table below summarizes the salary and incentive compensation awarded to our NEOs for 2022 performance.\n

Board members are\nindependent, under both the New York Stock Exchange\n(\"NYSE\") corporate governance listing standards and\nthe Firm\u2019s independence standards as set forth in\nits Governance Principles.\n\nTo be considered independent, a director must have\nno disqualifying relationships, as defined by the\nNYSE, and the Board must have affirmatively\ndetermined that he or she has no material\nrelationships with JPMorgan Chase, either directly\nor as a partner, shareholder or officer of another\norganization that has a relationship with the Firm.\n\nIn assessing the materiality of relationships with\nthe Firm, the Board considers relevant facts and\ncircumstances. Given the nature and broad scope of\nthe products and services provided by the Firm,\nthere are from time to time ordinary course of\nbusiness transactions between the Firm and a\ndirector, his or her immediate family members, or\nprincipal business affiliations. These may include,\namong other relationships: extensions of credit;\nprovision of other financial and financial advisory\nproducts and services; business transactions for\nproperty or services; and charitable contributions\nmade by the JPMorgan Chase Foundation or the Firm to\na nonprofit organization of which a director is an\nofficer. The Board reviews these relationships to\nassess their materiality and determine if any such\nrelationship would impair the independence and\njudgment of the relevant director. The Board\nconsidered:\n\n\u2022 Consumer credit: credit cards issued to directors\nBammann, Combs, Crown, Flynn, Hobson, Neal,\nNovakovic and/or their immediate family members\n\n\u2022 Wholesale credit: extensions of credit and other\nfinancial and financial advisory products and\nservices provided to: Berkshire Hathaway Inc., for\nwhich Mr. Combs is an Investment Officer, and its\nsubsidiaries; Henry Crown and Company, for which Mr.\nCrown is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and\nother Crown family-owned entities; Ariel\nInvestments, LLC, for which Ms. Hobson is Co-Chief\nExecutive Officer and President, and its\nsubsidiaries and funds; certain entities wholly-\nowned by Ms. Hobson\u2019s spouse; General Dynamics\nCorporation, for which Ms. Novakovic is Chairman and\nChief Executive Officer, and its subsidiaries; and\nLouis Dreyfus Company B.V., for which Mrs. Rometty's\nsibling serves as the Trading Operations Officer and\na member of its Executive Group\n\n\u2022 Goods and services: commercial office space leased\nby the Firm from subsidiaries of companies in which\nMr. Crown and members of his immediate family have\nindirect ownership interests; purchases from\nBerkshire Hathaway and subsidiaries of private\naviation services and professional services related\nto the Firm\u2019s corporate-owned aircraft; and\nmaintenance services and parts for corporate\naircraft provided by General Dynamics subsidiaries\n\nThe Board, having reviewed the relevant\nrelationships between the Firm and each director,\ndetermined, in accordance with the NYSE\u2019s listing\nstandards and the Firm\u2019s independence standards,\nthat each non-management director (Linda B. Bammann,\nStephen B. Burke, Todd A. Combs, James S. Crown,\nAlicia Boler Davis, Timothy P. Flynn, Alex Gorsky,\nMellody Hobson, Michael A. Neal, Phebe N. Novakovic\nand Virginia M. Rometty) had only immaterial\nrelationships with JPMorgan Chase and accordingly is\nindependent.\n\nAll directors who served on the Audit and\nCompensation & Management Development Committees of\nthe Board were also determined to meet the\nadditional independence and qualitative criteria of\nthe NYSE listing standards applicable to directors\nserving on those committees.

This includes candidates who are not available for board\nmembership immediately but may become available in the future, such as candidates whose current professional\ncommitments preclude board service and emerging leaders who require more experience. Often the Board works\nto develop a relationship with prospective candidates, becoming familiar with their skills and\neffectiveness, before the candidate is formally considered. The Board looks to recruit those who will\ncontribute individually and it seeks to balance skills, experience, personal attributes and tenure. All\ncandidates recommended to the Governance Committee are evaluated based on the same standards outlined above.\n\nOur By-laws also permit a shareholder group of up to 20 shareholders who have continuously owned at least 3%\nof the Firm\u2019s outstanding shares for at least three years to nominate up to 20% of the Board (but in any\nevent at least two directors). For further information, see page 112.\n\nRecent board refreshment\n\nSince our last annual shareholder meeting, the Board elected Alex Gorsky and Alicia Boler Davis to the Board\neffective July 2022 and March 2023, respectively. The Board used the process described above and took into\naccount the considerations outlined on pages 11-12 and shareholder interest in board refreshment. Mr. Gorsky\nand Ms. Davis have been among a select group of individuals considered as part of the Governance Committee\u2019s\nevaluation of prospective Board members in recent years.\n\nMr. Gorsky was familiar to a number of directors based on his leadership roles at Johnson & Johnson and his\nmembership on the J.P. Morgan International Council. When Mr. Dimon learned of his availability for service\non the Board this year, he suggested the Governance Committee consider Mr. Gorsky as a prospective\ncandidate. Members of the Governance Committee met with Mr. Gorsky and reviewed his qualifications, as well\nas his constructive personal attributes and independence, and recommended his election by the Board.\n\nMs. Davis was also familiar to a number of directors based on her leadership role at Alto Pharmacy, LLC and\nher prior experience at Amazon.com, Inc. and General Motors Company. Members of the Governance Committee\nsuggested that she be considered as a prospective candidate. Each member of the Governance Committee met\nwith her, as did Mr. Dimon and other Board members. Upon review of her qualifications, including her\nexpertise in technology and customer service operations, her strong personal attributes and independence,\nthe Governance Committee recommended her election by the Board.\n\nFor information on Mr. Gorsky\u2019s and Ms. Davis\u2019 qualifications, see pages 16 and 15, respectively.\n                                                                                                            \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.202023 PROXY STATEMENT                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                               \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE |ELECTION OF DIRECTORS  \n                                               \n                                                                                \n  Director nominees    Board governance    Board oversight    Board engagement  \n                                                                                \nDirector re-nomination\n\nThe Governance Committee also oversees the re-nomination process. In determining whether to re-nominate a\ndirector for election at our annual meeting, the Governance Committee reviews each director, considering:\n\nRetirement policy\n\nOur Governance Principles require a non-management director to offer not to stand for re-election in each\ncalendar year following a year in which the director will be 72 or older. The Board (other than the affected\ndirector) then determines whether to accept the offer. The Board believes that the appropriate mix of\nexperience and fresh perspectives is an important consideration in assessing Board composition, and the best\ninterests of the Firm are served by taking advantage of all available talent, and evaluations as to director\ncandidacy should not be determined solely on age.\n\nNone of our director nominees will be 72 or older this year.\n\nFor a description of the annual Board and committee self-assessment process, see page 27.\n                                                                                                            \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT21JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                               \n  ELECTION OF DIRECTORS| CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                                               \n                                                                                \n  Director nominees    Board governance    Board oversight    Board engagement  \n                                                                                \n2.

The\nBoard believes the present structure provides the\nFirm and the Board with strong leadership,\nappropriate independent oversight of management,\ncontinuity of experience that complements ongoing\nBoard refreshment, and the ability to communicate\nthe Firm's business and strategy to shareholders,\nclients, employees, regulators and the public in a\nsingle voice.\n\nAs required by the Firm\u2019s Governance Principles,\nwhen the role of the Chair is combined with that of\nthe CEO, the independent directors appoint a Lead\nIndependent Director. Our Lead Independent Director\nprovides a strong counterbalance to the Chair,\nincluding by facilitating independent oversight of\nmanagement, promoting open dialogue among the\nindependent directors during and in between Board\nmeetings, leading executive sessions at each regular\nBoard meeting without the presence of the CEO, and\nfocusing on the Board's priorities and processes.\n\nIn March 2023, the independent directors conducted\ntheir annual review of the Board\u2019s leadership\nstructure. This review was conducted first by the\nGovernance Committee, which considered the factors\non page 23, the Firm\u2019s governance\n\npractices, which include executive sessions of\nindependent directors as part of each regularly\nscheduled Board meeting and the directors\u2019 frequent\nand open interactions with senior management, and\nthe effectiveness of the Lead Independent Director\nrole. Following its review, the committee\nrecommended that the Board continue its current\nleadership structure and that Stephen B. Burke be\nre-appointed as Lead Independent Director. The\nindependent directors of the Board then conducted\ntheir own review, again taking into account the\nfactors on page 23, the committee\u2019s recommendation\nand Mr. Burke\u2019s strong performance in the Lead\nIndependent Director role over the course of the\nprior year, and determined to maintain the current\nleadership structure with Mr. Burke serving as Lead\nIndependent Director.\n\nLast year, as part of the Board's annual review of\nits leadership structure the Board considered the\npotential separation of the Chair and CEO positions\nin the context of succession planning.

In 2022, directors\nparticipated in programs on a number of subjects, including: \u2022 deep dive sessions from each LOB covering\ntopics such as products, services, strategy and control environment; \u2022 diversity, equity and inclusion\n(\"DEI\"); \u2022 ESG-related matters, including sustainability updates, our climate risk management framework and\nESG-related disclosure; \u2022 key laws, regulations and supervisory requirements applicable to the Firm; \u2022\nsignificant and emerging risks; \u2022 talent management including senior leader highlights; and \u2022 technology and\ncybersecurity updates.\n                                                                                                            \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT27JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                               \n  ELECTION OF DIRECTORS| CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                                               \n                                                                                \n  Director nominees    Board governance    Board oversight    Board engagement  \n                                                                                \n3. Board oversight\n\nThe Board is responsible for oversight of the\nbusiness and affairs of the Firm on behalf of\nshareholders. It is also responsible for setting the\ncultural \u201ctone at the top.\u201d Among its core\nresponsibilities, the Board oversees:\n\nStrategy\n\nThe Board of Directors oversees the formulation and\nimplementation of the Firm's strategic initiatives\nand reviews and approves the Firm\u2019s annual strategic\nplan. Annual strategic plans include evaluation of\nperformance against the prior year\u2019s initiatives,\nassessment of the current operating environment,\nrefinement of existing strategies and development of\nnew strategic initiatives. Throughout the year, the\nCEO and senior management provide updates on the\nFirm\u2019s overall strategic direction, including\nupdates on the opportunities and performance,\npriorities and implementation of strategies in their\nrespective LOBs and Corporate Functions. These\nmanagement presentations are the foundation of\nactive dialogue with, and feedback from, the Board\nabout the strategic risks and opportunities facing\nthe Firm and its businesses.\n\nExecutive performance, talent management and\nsuccession planning\n\nThe CMDC reviews the Firm\u2019s performance periodically\nduring the course of the year, and formally, at\nleast annually. The CMDC\u2019s review of the CEO\u2019s\nperformance is presented to the Board in connection\nwith the Board\u2019s review of executive officer annual\ncompensation. In addition, the CMDC provides\nindividual OC members with opportunities to discuss\ntop talent within their respective LOBs and\nCorporate Functions, including progress on\nattracting and retaining top diverse talent.\n\nIn accordance with our Governance Principles,\nsuccession planning is considered at least annually\nby the non-management directors with the CEO. The\nCMDC reviews the succession plan for the CEO in\npreparation for discussion by the Board, with such\ndiscussion guided by the Lead Independent Director.\nThese discussions consider recommendations,\nevaluations and development plans for potential CEO\nsuccessors and occur with and without the CEO. In\nplanning an orderly CEO transition that will take\nplace in the medium-term, the Board has developed\nand will continue to develop a list of OC members as\nstrong internal candidates to potentially succeed\nMr. Dimon. The CMDC also periodically reviews the\nsuccession plan for members of the OC other than the\nCEO to build a robust talent pipeline for specific\ncritical roles.\n\nThe Board has numerous opportunities to meet with,\nand assess development plans for, members of the OC\nand other high-potential senior management leaders.\nThis occurs through various means, including\ninformal meetings, presentations to the Board and\nits committees, and Board dinners.

The Firm\u2019s annual Comprehensive\nCapital Analysis and Review (\u201cCCAR\u201d) submission,\nwhich contains the Firm\u2019s proposed plans to make\ncapital distributions, such as dividend payments,\nstock repurchases and other capital actions, is\nreviewed and approved prior to its submission to the\nFederal Reserve. In addition, the Audit Committee\nassists the Board in the oversight of the Firm\u2019s\nfinancial statements and internal control framework.\nThe Audit Committee also assists the Board in the\nappointment, retention, compensation, evaluation and\noversight of the Firm\u2019s independent registered\npublic accounting firm. For further information, see\n\u201cRisk management and internal control framework\"\nbelow.\n                                                                                                            \n   Risk management and internal control framework                                                           \n                                                                                                            \nRisk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbusiness activities. When the Firm extends a\nconsumer or wholesale loan, advises customers and\nclients on their investment decisions, makes markets\nin securities or offers other products or services,\nthe Firm takes on some degree of risk. The Firm\u2019s\noverall objective is to manage its business, and the\nassociated risks, in a manner that balances serving\nthe interests of its clients, customers and\ninvestors, and protecting the safety and soundness\nof the Firm.\n\nThe Firm's risk governance framework is managed on a\nfirmwide basis. The Board of Directors oversees\nmanagement\u2019s strategic decisions, and the Board Risk\nCommittee oversees Independent Risk Management\n(\u201cIRM\u201d) and the Firm\u2019s risk governance framework.\nCybersecurity risk is overseen by the full Board,\nwith additional oversight of the relevant risk\nframework and controls provided by the Audit and\nRisk Committees. Board committees support the\nBoard\u2019s oversight responsibility by overseeing the\nrisk categories related to such committee\u2019s specific\narea of focus.\n                                                                                                            \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.282023 PROXY STATEMENT                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                               \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE |ELECTION OF DIRECTORS  \n                                               \n                                                                                \n  Director nominees    Board governance    Board oversight    Board engagement  \n                                                                                \nCommittee chairs report significant matters\ndiscussed at committee meetings to the full Board.\nIssues escalated to the full Board may be dealt with\nin several ways, as appropriate, for example:\noversight of risk may remain with the particular\nprincipal standing committee of the Board, the Board\nmay establish or direct a Specific Purpose Committee\nto oversee such matters, or the Board may ask\nmanagement to present more frequently to the full\nBoard on the issue.\n\nEnvironmental, social and\ngovernance matters\n\nAs noted throughout this proxy statement, oversight\nof ESG-related matters is an important part of the\nBoard's work in setting the policies and principles\nthat govern our business, including:\n\n\u2022 the Firm\u2019s governance-related policies and\npractices;\n\n\u2022 our systems of risk management and controls;\n\n\u2022 our investment in our employees;\n\n\u2022 the manner in which we serve our customers and\nsupport our communities; and\n\n\u2022 how we advance sustainability in our business and\noperations.\n\nIn particular, the PRC provides oversight of the\nFirm\u2019s positions and practices on public\nresponsibility matters such as community investment,\nfair lending, consumer practices, sustainability and\nother public policy issues that reflect the Firm\u2019s\nvalues and character, and impact its reputation\namong all of its stakeholders. Other Board\ncommittees consider ESG-related matters within their\nscope of responsibility. For instance, the CMDC\noversees the Firm's culture, including reviewing\nemployee DEI programs; the Risk Committee considers\nclimate risk; the Governance Committee reviews board\ndiversity; and the Audit Committee provides\noversight of compliance with the Firm's ethical\nstandards, policies, plans and procedures, and with\nlaws and regulations. In the past year, in addition\nto the work of the committees, all directors\nparticipated in full Board discussions regarding\nDEI, including an audit of the Firm's Racial Equity\nCommitment, sustainability, climate risk management\nand ESG-related disclosures.\n\nThe Firm is committed to being transparent about our\napproach to and performance on ESG topics. One way\nwe do this is by publishing an annual ESG Report,\nwhich provides information on how we are addressing\nthe ESG-related matters that we and our stakeholders\nview as important to our business. In 2022, we also\npublished a Climate Report, which included extensive\ndisclosure about the Firm's approach to climate risk\nmanagement. We monitor the evolving disclosure\nlandscape and evaluate which frameworks address our\nstakeholders' interest. In 2022, our ESG disclosures\nwere informed by the Global Reporting Initiative,\n\nSustainability Accounting Standards Board and the\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n(\"TCFD\").

of the Firm\u2019s employees.\n\nIn addition to discussions at Board meetings with\nsenior management about these efforts, our directors\nparticipate in events outside of the Boardroom\nincluding meetings with employees that emphasize\nthis commitment. These meetings include employee\ntown halls, LOB and leadership team events such as\nour annual senior leaders\u2019 meetings and informal\nsessions with members of the OC and other senior\nleaders. In 2022, members of our Board participated\nin branch visits and Business Resource Groups'\n(\"BRG\") events including for the Veteran BRG and\nAdvancing Black Pathways initiative.\n\nRegulators\n\nOur Board and senior leaders commit significant time\nto meeting with regulators. These interactions help\nus learn first-hand from regulators about matters of\nimportance to them and their expectations of us. It\nalso gives the Board and management a forum for\nkeeping our regulators well- informed about the\nFirm\u2019s performance and business practices.\n\nStakeholders\n\nAs we strive to deliver value, management engages\nwith our stakeholders, including our customers,\nsuppliers and communities in which we work, on a\nrange of issues and in a variety of ways. These may\ninclude participation in consumer advisory panels,\ntown halls and meetings with policy advocacy groups\nand nonprofit organizations. We actively seek\nfeedback on key topics to help us better understand\nwhat is important to our stakeholders and find ways\nto deliver value while also navigating financial,\nlegal and regulatory considerations. In recent\nyears, we have engaged in extensive stakeholder\noutreach pertaining to, among other topics,\nexecutive compensation, management succession\nplanning, Board composition and refreshment,\nshareholder rights, and ESG-related matters such as\nDEI and climate.\n\nManagement shares insights and feedback from these\nrelationships and engagements with the Board,\nproviding the Board with valuable insights. Board\nmembers also participate in engagements with\nstakeholders through client events, town halls, BRG\nevents, and shareholder discussions as appropriate.\n                                                                                                            \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT31JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                               \n  DIRECTOR COMPENSATION| CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                                               \nDirector compensation\n\nThe Governance Committee is responsible for\nreviewing director compensation and making\nrecommendations to the Board. In making its\nrecommendations, the Governance Committee annually\nreviews the Board\u2019s responsibilities and the\ncompensation practices of peer firms, which include\nthe same group of peer firms referenced with respect\nto the compensation of our NEOs. For more\ninformation see \u201cEvaluating market practices\u201d on\npage 48. The Board believes a best practice is to\nlink director compensation to the Firm\u2019s\nperformance; therefore, a significant portion of\ndirector compensation is paid in common stock.\nAnnual compensation For each calendar year of\nservice on the Board, each non-employee director\nreceives an annual cash retainer of $100,000 and if\nthe non-employee director is on the Board at the\ntime when annual performance year equity awards are\ngranted, an annual grant of deferred stock units\nvalued at $250,000. Compensation paid during 2022,\nincluding additional cash compensation paid for\ncertain committee and other service, is described in\nthe following tables. Each deferred stock unit\nincluded in the annual grant to directors represents\nthe right to receive one share of the Firm\u2019s common\nstock and dividend equivalents payable in deferred\nstock units for any dividends paid. Deferred stock\nunits have no voting rights. In January of the year\nimmediately following a director\u2019s retirement from\nthe Board, deferred stock units are distributed in\nshares of the Firm\u2019s common stock in either a lump\nsum or in annual installments for up to 15 years as\nelected by the director.\n\nThe following table summarizes the 2022 annual\ncompensation for non-employee directors for service\non the Boards of the Firm, the Bank and J.P. Morgan\nSecurities plc (\"JPMS plc\"). There is no additional\ncompensation paid for service on the Board of IHC.\n                                                                       \n  Compensation                                             Amount ($)  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Board retainer                              $   100,000              \n  Lead Independent Director retainer               30,000              \n  Audit and Risk Committee chair retainer          25,000              \n  Audit and Risk Committee member retainer         15,000              \n  All other committees chair retainer              15,000              \n  Deferred stock unit grant                       250,000              \n  Bank Board retainer                              15,000              \n  Bank Board\u2019s chair retainer                      25,000              \n  JPMS plc chair retainer                        511,1471              \n                                                                       \n1 Compensation for service on the Board of JPMS plc\nprior to December 2022 was $110,000.

Mr. Flynn's annual fee for his services on the\nJPMS plc board has been increased to $511,147 which\nis comprised of $440,644 on account of his\nappointment as chair of the JPMS plc board, $23,501\non account of his appointment as chair of its\nNomination Committee and $47,002 on account of his\nappointment as chair of its UK Remuneration\nCommittee. Each of these appointments were effective\nDecember 2022 and payments commenced in 2023. The\nadditional amount earned by Mr. Flynn during 2022 as\na result of these appointments was $32,702.\n\nStock ownership: no sales, no hedging, no pledging\n\nAs stated in the Governance Principles and further\ndescribed in \u201cAnti-hedging/anti-pledging provisions\u201d\non page 52, each director agrees to retain all\nshares of the Firm\u2019s common stock he or she\npurchased on the open market or received pursuant to\nhis or her service as a Board member for as long as\nhe or she serves on our Board.\n\nShares held personally by a director may not be held\nin margin accounts or otherwise pledged as\ncollateral, nor may the economic risk of such shares\nbe hedged.\n\nAs detailed on page 79 under \u201cSecurity ownership of\ndirectors and executive officers,\u201d Mr. Crown has\nownership of certain shares attributed to him that\narise from the business of Henry Crown and Company,\nan investment company where Mr. Crown serves as\nChairman and CEO, and trusts of which Mr. Crown\nserves as trustee (the \u201cAttributed Shares\u201d). Mr.\nCrown disclaims beneficial ownership of such\nAttributed Shares, except to the extent of his\npecuniary interest. The Attributed Shares are\ndistinct from shares Mr. Crown or his spouse own\nindividually, or shares held in trusts for the\nbenefit of his children (the \u201cCrown Personally Held\nShares\u201d). The Firm has reviewed the potential\npledging of the Attributed Shares with Mr. Crown,\nrecognizes Mr. Crown\u2019s distinct obligations with\nrespect to Henry Crown and Company and the trusts,\nand believes such Attributed Shares may be prudently\npledged or held in margin loan accounts.\n\nCrown Personally Held Shares are not and may not be\nheld in margin accounts or otherwise pledged as\ncollateral, nor may the economic risk of such shares\nbe hedged.\n\nDeferred compensation\n\nEach year, non-employee directors may elect to defer\nall or part of their cash compensation. A director\u2019s\nright to receive future payments under any deferred\ncompensation arrangement is an unsecured claim\nagainst JPMorgan Chase\u2019s general assets. Cash\namounts may be deferred into various investment\nequivalents, including deferred stock units. Upon\nretirement from the Board, compensation deferred\ninto stock units will be distributed in stock; all\nother deferred cash compensation will be distributed\nin cash. Deferred compensation will be distributed\nin either a lump sum or in annual installments for\nup to 15 years as elected by the director commencing\nin January of the year following the director\u2019s\nretirement from the Board.\n\nReimbursements and insurance\n\nThe Firm reimburses directors for their expenses in\nconnection with their Board service or pays such\nexpenses directly.

They must also provide us with copies of\nthese reports. These reports are required by Section\n16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We\nhave reviewed the copies of the reports that we have\nreceived and written representations from the\nindividuals required to file the reports. Based on\nthis review, we believe that during 2022 each of our\ndirectors and executive officers has complied with\napplicable reporting requirements for transactions\nin our equity securities, except for one late filing\ndue to administrative error to report one\ntransaction of RSUs being granted to Ms. Elena\nKorablina.\n\nPolicies and procedures for approval of related\nparty transactions\n\nThe Firm has adopted a written Transactions with\nRelated Persons Policy (\u201cPolicy\u201d), which sets forth\nthe Firm\u2019s policies and procedures for reviewing and\napproving transactions with related persons \u2013 our\ndirectors, executive officers, their respective\nimmediate family members and 5% shareholders.

The transaction is then\nreviewed by the disinterested members of the\nGovernance Committee, who determine whether approval\nor ratification of the transaction shall be granted.\nIn reviewing a transaction, the Governance Committee\nconsiders facts and circumstances that it deems\nrelevant to its determination, such as: management\u2019s\nassessment of the commercial reasonableness of the\ntransaction; the materiality of the related person\u2019s\ndirect or indirect interest in the transaction;\nwhether the transaction may involve an actual, or\nthe appearance of, a conflict of interest; and, if\nthe transaction involves a director, the impact of\nthe transaction on the director\u2019s independence.\n\nCertain types of transactions are pre-approved in\naccordance with the terms of the Policy. These\ninclude transactions in the ordinary course of\nbusiness involving financial products and services\nprovided by, or to, the Firm, including loans,\nprovided such transactions are in compliance with\nthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Federal Reserve\nBoard Regulation O and other applicable laws and\nregulations.\n\nTransactions with directors, executive officers and\n5% shareholders\n\nOur directors and executive officers, and some of\ntheir immediate family members and affiliated\nentities, and BlackRock, Inc. and affiliated\nentities (\"BlackRock\"), The Vanguard Group and\naffiliated entities (\"Vanguard\") and beneficial\nowners of more than 5% of our outstanding common\nstock, were customers of, or had transactions with\nor involving, JPMorgan Chase or our banking or other\nsubsidiaries in the ordinary course of business\nduring 2022.

It\nalso addresses the reporting of actual or apparent\nconflicts of interest and actual or potential\nviolations or other matters that would compromise\nthe integrity of the Firm\u2019s External Financial\nReporting.\n\nSupplier code of conduct\n\nThe Supplier Code of Conduct outlines the Firm\u2019s\nexpectation that suppliers demonstrate the highest\nstandards of business conduct, integrity, and\nadherence to the law. The Supplier Code of Conduct\napplies to our suppliers, vendors, consultants,\ncontractors and other third parties working on\nbehalf of the Firm, as well as to the owners,\nofficers, directors, employees and contractors of\nthese supplier organizations and entities. The\nSupplier Code of Conduct provides specific guidance\nregarding suppliers\u2019 responsibility to comply with\nall applicable laws and regulations and to have\npolicies ensuring such compliance, their duty to\nescalate concerns, handle information properly and\nmaintain accurate records, address potential\nconflicts of interest, and operate responsibly with\nrespect to laws governing competition, corruption,\npolitical activities, as well as environmental,\nhuman rights, and other matters.\n\nHow to contact our board\n\nThe Board actively manages its information flow\nthrough a variety of means and requires management\nto provide the Board with the appropriate\ninformation to assist the Board in meeting its core\nresponsibilities, as described in this Corporate\nGovernance section.\n\nTo contact our Board of Directors, any Board member,\nincluding the Lead Independent Director, any\ncommittee chair, or the independent directors as a\ngroup, email correspondence to the Office of the\nSecretary at corporate.secretary@jpmchase.com, or\nmail to: JPMorgan Chase & Co., Attention (name of\nBoard member(s)), Office of the Secretary, 383\nMadison Avenue, 39th Floor, New York, New York\n10179.\n                                                                                                            \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.362023 PROXY STATEMENT                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n\nExecutive Compensation\n\nProposal 2: Advisory resolution to approve executive compensation\n                                                                                                            \n  Approve the Firm\u2019s compensation                                                                           \n  practices and principles and their                                                                        \n  implementation for 2022 for the                                                                           \n  compensation of the Firm\u2019s Named                                                                          \n  Executive Officers as discussed and                                                                       \n  disclosed in the Compensation Discussion                                                                  \n  and Analysis, the compensation tables,                                                                    \n  and any related material contained in                                                                     \n  this proxy statement.                                                                                     \n                                              RECOMMENDATION:                                               \n                                              VoteFORapproval of this advisory resolution to approve        \n                                              executive compensation                                        \n                                                                                                            \nPROPOSAL 2 \u2013 ADVISORY RESOLUTION TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\n\nAs required by Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we currently provide our\nshareholders with an annual advisory vote to approve the compensation of our Named Executive Officers. This\nproposal seeks a shareholder advisory vote to approve the compensation of our Named Executive Officers as\ndisclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K through the following resolution:\n\n\u201cResolved, that shareholders approve the Firm\u2019s compensation practices and principles and their\nimplementation for 2022 for the compensation of the Firm\u2019s Named Executive Officers as discussed and\ndisclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and any related material\ncontained in this proxy statement.\u201d\n\nThis advisory vote will not be binding upon the Board of Directors. However, the Compensation & Management\nDevelopment Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive\ncompensation arrangements.\n                                                                                                            \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT37JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                \n  Introduction  \n                \nOur compensation philosophy promotes a fair and well-governed, long-term approach to compensation, including\npay-for-performance practices that are designed to attract and retain top and diverse talent, responsive to\nand aligned with shareholders, and encourage a culture that supports our Business Principles and strategic\nframework\n\nThe Firm\u2019s Board of Directors believes that JPMorgan Chase\u2019s long-term success as a premier financial\nservices firm depends in large measure on the talents of our employees and a proper alignment of their\ncompensation with performance and sustained shareholder value. The Firm\u2019s compensation programs play a\nsignificant role in our ability to attract, retain and properly motivate the highest quality workforce.\n\nIn assessing OC members' performance in the context of the Firm's 2022 business results, the CMDC recognized\nthat the Firm continued to build upon its strong momentum from prior years amid challenging market\nconditions, reflecting the diversity and durability of our products and services, as well as long-term\nstrategic investments made in our businesses. We gained market share, maintained strong expense discipline\nwhile continuing to invest in our businesses, continued to achieve high customer satisfaction scores, and\ncontinued to fortify our fortress balance sheet.\n\nThe Firm achieved managed revenue of $132.3 billion, which was a record for the fifth consecutive year, as\nwell as strong net income of $37.7 billion, ROTCE of 18% and ROE of 14%. Our ROTCE has consistently been\namong the highest returns of our peers. The CMDC also considered the Firm's operating performance during the\nthree years marked by the pandemic and subsequent reopening of the global economy, which introduced\nvolatility to the Firm's reported financial performance primarily as a function of large reserve builds in\n2020, followed by releases in 2021.\n\nIn determining annual compensation for 2022, the CMDC recognized that the Firm is in a uniquely fortunate\nposition to be led by such a highly talented and experienced executive in Mr. Dimon. In light of the\ncontinued absolute and relative strength of the Firm\u2019s performance, the CMDC determined to keep Mr. Dimon's\nannual pay of $34.5 million unchanged from 2021.\n\nOne of the Board\u2019s top priorities is succession planning for Mr. Dimon, which entails enabling an orderly\nCEO transition to take place in the medium-term. As part of this succession plan, the Board has developed,\nand will continue to develop, several Operating Committee members who are well-known to shareholders as\nstrong potential candidates to succeed Mr. Dimon. Should the need arise in the near-term, the Board views\nMr. Pinto as a key executive who is immediately ready to step into the role of sole CEO. Mr. Pinto's\nexceptional leadership capabilities are well-known to our shareholders and he has previously served as co-\nCEO of the Firm during Mr. Dimon's unplanned absence in 2020 due to prior unforeseen circumstances. The\nBoard has well-developed processes in place to support proper governance. This includes the CMDC regularly\nreviewing the succession plan for the CEO and the Lead Independent Director regularly leading succession\ndiscussions with the non-executive directors of the Board. The CMDC also reviews the succession plan for\nmembers of the Operating Committee other than the CEO, which is also discussed by the full Board of\nDirectors. This is in addition to Board discussions of talent management, which occur frequently throughout\nthe year.\n\nWe highly value engaging with our shareholders and have a demonstrable history of being responsive to their\nfeedback. In response to the low support the Firm received for last year\u2019s Say on Pay proposal, we expanded\nour shareholder outreach and engagement. Our engagements primarily focused on listening to shareholders to\nunderstand why they had voted against the resolution last year, and to confirm their expectations of an\nappropriate response to regain their support.\n\nShareholders emphasized their deep support for the management team, the Firm\u2019s strategy and its long-term\nperformance. They were also direct in their feedback about the one-time special award granted to Mr. Dimon\nin 2021, with two clear points made about their expectation for a response: first, to commit to not granting\nany future special awards to Mr. Dimon; and second, to commit that if any future one-time special awards\nwere granted under rare and appropriate circumstances to other NEOs, that they must include direct\nperformance conditions. The CMDC and the Board has responded by committing unequivocally to both points.\n\nIn addition to the expanded engagement described above, the CMDC retained the services of Semler Brossy, an\nindependent compensation consultant, to advise the CMDC on potential actions for a comprehensive and\nresponsive strategy going forward.\n\nThe full details of our outreach, what we heard, and the resulting actions we have taken can be found in the\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis that follows.\n                                                                                                            \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.382023 PROXY STATEMENT                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nT a b l e o f C o n t e n t s\n                                                  \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION |SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT  \n                                                  \nShareholder engagement\n\nWe value the views and feedback of our shareholders. We regularly engage with shareholders on a wide variety\nof topics, such as strategy, financial and operating performance, competitive environment, regulatory\nlandscape, and ESG-related matters.\n\nSince the beginning of 2022, we have had 172 meetings with 118 shareholders representing 49% of the Firm's\noutstanding common stock. Our Lead Independent Director (\"LID\") & Chair of the CMDC participated in a number\nof discussions with our top shareholders that voted against our say-on-pay resolution at our 2022 Annual\nMeeting, representing 20% of the Firm's outstanding common stock, as well as with the two leading proxy\nadvisory firms that recommended shareholders vote against last year's say-on-pay resolution. Feedback from\nthese discussions provided valuable insights for our CMDC, which also increased the number of meetings it\nheld as a committee during the year. We did this to determine an appropriate response to the 31% support we\nreceived for last year's say-on-pay resolution, which was in contrast to the strong historical support we've\ngenerally received since 2009.\n                                                                                                            \n  Key Shareholder Engagement                                                                                \n  Highlights                                                                                                \n  128                                                 172    49%                          20%1              \n  shareholders contacted             shareholder meetings    common shares outstanding    engaged with LID  \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Executive Compensation Engagements                                                                        \n  In meetings with shareholders prior to the 2022 Annual Meeting, a third of the time was spent engaging    \n  on executive compensation matters, with more than 80% of that time spent discussing the one-time special  \n  awards granted to Messrs. Dimon and Pinto in 2021.The decision to grant special awards and their          \n  quantitative impact on shareholders' pay-for-performance assessment models was the key focus for          \n  shareholders in advance of our 2022 Annual Meeting, and why they reported that they ultimately voted      \n  against the say-on-pay proposal. Shareholders otherwise expressed broad support for the Board,            \n  management and our existing executive compensation plan, excluding the one-time special awards.           \n  In meetings with shareholders following the 2022 Annual Meeting, slightly more than a third of the time   \n  was spent engaging on executive compensation matters, with 75% of that time spent discussing potential    \n  and appropriate responses to address concerns with the special awards.

The performance assessment process starts with\nstrategic plans, budgets and priorities being established at those same levels, with the Board and CMDC\nengaging in regular discussions with the CEO and the Head of Human Resources (\"HR\") about individual OC\nmembers\u2019 performance throughout the year, as appropriate.\n\nThis approach (rather than determining pay levels during a single year-end process) enables the CMDC to make\nbalanced and informed OC member pay decisions that are aligned with long-term performance against four broad\ndimensions, which consider short-, medium- and long-term priorities that drive sustained shareholder value.\n\nBALANCED AND HOLISTIC APPROACH FOR ASSESSING PERFORMANCE\n\nIn determining OC compensation, the CMDC considers both progress made against long-term strategic\nobjectives, and how that progress has been achieved. For example, consistently strong revenue, net income\nand ROTCE performance over the long-term are more important than any short-term fluctuations in business\nresults.\n\nThe CMDC applies an approximately 50% weighting to its consideration of absolute and relative business\nresults against the Firm's strategic objectives over multiple years, i.e. \"the what\" , and an approximately\n50% weighting to its qualitative consideration of risk, controls & conduct, customers/clients/stakeholders,\nand teamwork & leadership, i.e. \"the how\" .\n\nNo single performance dimension in isolation determines total compensation; however, it is possible for a\nsingle significant shortcoming in any performance dimension to have a downward impact on variable\ncompensation without limitation. The CMDC has historically exercised this kind of downward discretion by\nmaking significant reductions to OC member compensation related to risk & control matters \u2014 and it will\ncontinue to do so in the future if appropriate. For example, in 2012, the CMDC reduced Mr. Dimon's pay by\n50% due to the \"London Whale\" trading incident despite the Firm achieving record earnings that year.\n\nThis assessment of performance includes considerations of ESG-related factors that comprise responsible\nleadership, thoughtful governance and sustainability, as illustrated in the chart below:\n

attract, properly motivate\nand retain our senior executives, the CMDC\nperiodically reviews market data relating to pay\nlevels, pay mix and pay practices.\n\nIn evaluating market data for OC members, the CMDC\nbenchmarks against our primary financial services\npeer group, which consists of large financial\nservices companies with which the Firm directly\ncompetes for both talent and business. The following\ncompanies comprise our primary financial services\npeer group, which remains unchanged from last year:\n\n\u2022 American Express\n\n\u2022 Bank of America\n\n\u2022 Citigroup\n\n\u2022 Goldman Sachs\n\n\u2022 Morgan Stanley\n\n\u2022 Wells Fargo\n\nGiven the diversity of the Firm\u2019s businesses, the\nCMDC may also periodically reference the pay plans\nand practices of other financial services companies\nas well as leading large, global firms across\nmultiple industries. The CMDC considers the size,\npresence, brand and reputation of the companies, and\nthe nature and mix of their businesses in using this\ndata. These companies include some or all of the\nfollowing: 3M, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, AT&T,\nBarclays, BlackRock, BNY Mellon, Boeing, Capital One\nFinancial, Chevron, Coca-Cola, Comcast, Credit\nSuisse, CVS Health, Deutsche Bank, ExxonMobil,\nGeneral Electric, HSBC, IBM, Johnson & Johnson,\nMerck, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, PayPal, PepsiCo,\nPfizer, Procter & Gamble, Raytheon, UBS, Verizon,\nWalmart and Walt Disney. Although these reference\ncompanies are not part of our primary financial\nservices peer group, we believe that their practices\ncan provide a relevant point of reference for\nmaintaining a competitive talent and compensation\nprogram.\n\nDISCIPLINED PROCESS TO DETERMINE TOTAL COMPENSATION\n\nPay level\n\nIn determining total compensation levels for\nindividual OC members, the CMDC evaluates various\npay scenarios in light of the following\nconsiderations to inform their judgment:\n\n\u2022 Performance, based on the four broad assessment\ndimensions and discussed on pages 55-59\n\n\u2022 Value of the position to the organization and\nshareholders over time (i.e., \u201cvalue of seat\u201d)\n\n\u2022 The example they set for others by acting with\nintegrity and strengthening the Firm\u2019s culture\n\n\u2022 External talent market (i.e., market data)\n\nWhile market data provides the CMDC with useful\ninformation regarding our competitors, the CMDC does\nnot target specific positioning (e.g., 50th\npercentile), nor does it use a formulaic approach in\ndetermining competitive pay levels. Instead, the\nCMDC uses a range of data as a reference, which is\nconsidered in the context of each executive\u2019s\nperformance over a multi-year period, and the CMDC\u2019s\nassessment of the value the individual delivers to\nthe Firm.\n\nFor 2022 compensation awarded to OC members, the\nCMDC recognized the Firm's strong, stable operating\nperformance during\n\nthe three years marked by the COVID-19 pandemic and\nsubsequent reopening of the global economy, which\nintroduced volatility\n\nto the Firm's reported financial performance\nprimarily as a function of large reserve builds in\n2020, followed by subsequent\n\nreleases in 2021.\n\nPay mix\n\nOnce the CMDC determines OC members\u2019 total incentive\ncompensation, it then establishes the appropriate\npay mix between an annual cash award and long-term\nequity, including PSUs and RSUs.\n\nFor OC members other than the current CEO and\nPresident & COO, or any OC members based in the\nU.K., the CMDC continued to apply the Firm\u2019s\nstandard cash/equity incentive mix formula to each\nof their 2022 incentive compensation awards. For\nsuch OC members, the CMDC determined that a 50%/50%\nmix of time-based RSUs and at-risk PSUs would\ncontinue to provide an appropriate balance to their\nequity exposure. Per the Firm\u2019s formula, the OC\nmembers were awarded 60% of their incentive\ncompensation in long-term equity (30% in PSUs and\n30% in RSUs), with the remaining 40% paid in cash. 1\n\nThe CMDC believes that this significant weighting of\npay mix to equity is aligned with the interests of\nshareholders by encouraging OC members to focus on\nthe long-term success of the Firm while mitigating\nexcessive risk-taking, and provides a competitive\nannual cash incentive opportunity.\n\n1 The CMDC has established a different pay mix for\nOC members in the U.K. due to local regulations for\nIdentified Staff.\n                                                                                                            \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.482023 PROXY STATEMENT                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                                   \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION |COMPENSATION DISCUSSION  \n  AND ANALYSIS                                     \n                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n  Overview    How we think about pay          How we performed against our    How performance determined    \n              decisions                       business strategy               pay in 2022                   \n                                                                                                            \nNew in 2022\n\nIn response to feedback received from shareholders, no special awards were granted to Messrs. Dimon and\nPinto in 2022 and the CMDC reaffirms its commitment to shareholders that special awards will not be granted\nto them in the future. There are also no special awards currently under consideration for any of the Firm's\nother Named Executive Officers.\n\nIn addition, after considering feedback from shareholders requesting that the Board implement a limitation\non the CMDC's discretion for determining the cash portion of Mr. Dimon's incentive compensation, effective\nfor 2022 and going forward, the CMDC has introduced a policy that caps Mr. Dimon's annual cash award to not\nexceed 25% of his total compensation.\n\nIn light of Mr. Pinto's move to the U.S. in 2022 after being promoted to the Firm's sole President & COO,\nthe CMDC determined to change his compensation structure to emulate that of Mr. Dimon's. Mr. Pinto's annual\ncash award is therefore also subject to a cap of 25% of his total compensation, with PSUs comprising 100% of\nthe equity portion of his incentive compensation.\n\nThe cash award caps for Messrs. Dimon and Pinto provided maximum cash award opportunities of $8.6 million\nand $7.1 million for each respectively. These amounts are well below those that would apply under the Firm's\nstandard cash/equity mix formula. Furthermore, despite the introduction of this new policy, the CMDC\ndetermined to not award the maximum amount allowed by their respective caps in 2022, but to maintain a lower\ncash award of $5 million for both Messrs. Dimon and Pinto.\n\nThe total cash compensation amount of $6.5 million awarded to each of Messrs. Dimon and Pinto in 2022\n(comprised of $1.5 million salary and $5 million cash award) is significantly below the total cash amounts\npaid to their peers, with a larger majority of our CEO's and President & COO's compensation being awarded in\nat-risk PSUs vs. those of our primary peer firms.\n\nSummary of pay elements\n\nOur compensation program provides for an appropriate mix between base salary, cash and equity incentives\nthat vest over time.

Due to local U.K. regulations,  \n                                 PSUs are subject to an extended seven-year vesting period commencing       \n                                 ratably on the third anniversary of the grant for OC members in the U.K.   \n                                 \u2022The CMDC selected ROTCE, a comprehensive performance metric that          \n                                 measures the Firm\u2019s net income applicable to common equity as a            \n  Performance Measure            percentage of average tangible common equity. ROTCE is used by the Firm,   \n                                 as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the earnings power of      \n                                 common shareholders\u2019 equity capital and is a useful metric for comparing   \n                                 the profitability of the Firm with that of competitors.                    \n                                 \u2022Payout under the PSU plan is calculated at the end of the three-year      \n                                 performance period based on absolute and relative average ROTCE1, per the  \n                                 payout scale below.

For   \n                                 the 2022 PSU award, the CMDC set the absolute ROTCE thresholds as          \n                                 follows: (1) maximum payout at 18% or greater; and (2) zero payout at      \n                                 less than 6%.                                                              \n                                 \u2022In determining companies to include in the relative ROTCE scale, the      \n                                 CMDC selected competitors with business activities that overlap with at    \n  PSU Peers                      least 30% of the Firm\u2019s revenue mix.

Similar to RSUs, the value upon vesting of PSUs is also directly tied to the\nFirm\u2019s performance through its stock price. The CMDC believes that the PSU design continues to appropriately\nincentivize strong performance by our OC members, does not encourage excessive risk-taking and is aligned\nwith long-term shareholder interests. Since PSUs were first introduced in 2015, we have received positive\nshareholder support for this aspect of our executive compensation program.\n\nDETERMINING ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE PSU PERFORMANCE GOALS\n\n\u2022 Each year, in determining the absolute ROTCE goal and minimum ROTCE threshold for that year\u2019s PSU awards,\nthe CMDC reviews the Firm\u2019s historical performance and a reasonable range of possible net income and capital\noutcomes over the next three years. For the 2022 PSU awards granted in January 2023, these outcomes were\nconsidered in the context of (among other things) the expected impacts of : the future state of markets,\nvolatility of earnings levels, Federal Reserve tightening policies and higher inflation impact on the U.S.\nand global economies, global regulatory requirements and the lingering impact of COVID-19 on macroeconomic\nconditions, all of which affect the range of ROTCE outcomes in the medium-term .\n\n\u2022 The CMDC calibrated the upper ROTCE goal of the 2022 PSUs, representing exceptional financial performance\nover the 3-year performance period, at 18% or more; and the lower ROTCE threshold, representing weak\nfinancial performance over the same period, at below 6%. To this end, the CMDC believes that it has set\nupper and lower absolute performance thresholds that are sufficiently rigorous compared to the Firm\u2019s\ncurrent ROTCE outlook over the next 3 years.\n\n\u2022 In setting the relative ROTCE performance goals for the 2022 PSU awards, the CMDC limited above-target\npayout to instances in which the Firm outperforms the majority of its competitors on a relative basis, with\nbelow-target payout occurring in instances of underperformance. Median relative performance results in 80%\npayout, outstanding relative performance results in a payout of 150% and requires a top ranking, and bottom\nrelative performance pays out at 0%.\n                                                                                                            \n  \u2022As reflected by the chart to the right, the                                                              \n  Firm's consistent relative outperformance of our                                                          \n  eleven PSU peers is demonstrated in particular by                                                         \n  the strength of our 3-year average ROTCE                                                                  \n  outperformance over the last 10 years.                                                                    \n  \u2022Of the 3-year performance periods for the Firm      3-year average ROTCE of the Firm relative to PSU     \n  and our PSU peers in the last 10 years, only once    peers over the past 10 years                         \n  have our PSU peers achieved ROTCE of >18%,                                                                \n  demonstrating the rigor of our upper PSU goal.                                                            \n  \u2022Our PSU peers have collectively reported 3-year                                                          \n  average ROTCE of <6% for 35% of the time during                                                           \n  that period, demonstrating the rigor of our lower                                                         \n  absolute PSU threshold.                                                                                   \n  ROTCE Range                                                                                               \n  USE OF ROTCE COMPARED TO TSR AS OUR                                                                       \n  COMPREHENSIVE PSU PERFORMANCE METRIC                                                                      \n  \u2022The chart on the right demonstrates that there                                                           \n  is a strong correlation between long-term                                                                 \n  operating performance, as represented by ROTCE,                                                           \n  and shareholder returns, as represented by TSR.                                                           \n  \u2022After considering the merits of ROTCE, TSR and      Firm and PSU Peers Combined 5-year Average TSR       \n  other performance measures, the CMDC chose to        Performance by ROTCE Quartile (2017-2021)            \n  maintain ROTCE as the most appropriate and                                                                \n  comprehensive metric for the 2022 PSU award, as                                                           \n  it believes the PSUs should incentivize strong,                                                           \n  long-term operating performance, which is more                                                            \n  directly influenced by management.                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \nPSUS AWARDED FOR PERFORMANCE YEARS 2019, 2020, AND 2021\n\n\u2022 The Firm reported ROTCE of 14%, 23%, and 18% in 2020, 2021, and 2022 respectively, resulting in a 3-year\naverage ROTCE of 18%, outperforming the absolute threshold for the 2019 PSU awards granted in January 2020.\nOn March 25, 2023, the 2019 PSU awards vested at 150%.

To meet this objective, OC members are\nsubject to a stock ownership guideline and retention\npolicy. While on the Operating Committee, each\nmember is required to accumulate either: \u2022 A minimum\nof between 200,000 and 400,000 shares (1 million\nshares for the CEO); or \u2022 A minimum fixed dollar\nvalue of shares of between $10 million and $30\nmillion ($75 million for the CEO). Shares credited\nfor purposes of satisfying the above ownership\nlevels include shares owned outright, as well as 50%\nof unvested RSUs and PSUs, but do not include stock\nappreciation rights (\"SARs\") or stock options. The\nstock ownership guideline must be met within six\nyears of the later of the effective date of the\npolicy or appointment to the Operating Committee. If\nthe stock ownership guidelines are subsequently\nincreased, the higher ownership guideline must be\nsatisfied within six years of such revision, unless\notherwise determined by the CEO and CMDC. Prior to\nreaching their designated share ownership guideline,\nOC members are required to retain 75% of all net\nshares received from equity awards granted after\nthey join the Operating Committee. Once they have\nmet their ownership guideline, the policy requires\nOC members to continue retaining 50% of all net\nshares received from awards (75% for the CEO) as\nsummarized below:\n                                                                                                            \n  Retention Requirement                                                                                     \n  Before Guideline Met                After Guideline Met                                                   \n  75% of net shares until             50% of net shares for theduration of their service\u00a0on\u00a0theOperating    \n  stock ownership guideline is met    Committee(75% for the CEO)                                            \n                                                                                                            \nBecause OC members are required to continue accumulating shares even after having met their share ownership\nguideline, the resulting increase of share ownership over time further strengthens their interests with\nthose of our shareholders. Since he became CEO, Mr. Dimon has acquired a substantial amount of stock through\ncompensation and purchases on the open market, but has never sold a share to date. ANTI-HEDGING/ANTI-\nPLEDGING PROVISIONS All employees are prohibited from hedging or pledging unvested RSUs and PSUs, and\nunexercised stock appreciation rights or stock options. In addition: \u2022 Hedging any shares owned outright or\nthrough deferred compensation by an OC member is prohibited\n\n\u2022 Shares held directly by an OC or Board member may not be held in margin accounts or otherwise pledged For\ninformation on the hedging/pledging restrictions applicable to our directors, please see \u201cDirector\ncompensation\u201d on pages 32 and 33. INTEGRATING RISK WITH COMPENSATION The CMDC holds an annual joint session\nwith the Risk Committee to review Firmwide HR and compensation practices, including: \u2022 How we integrate\nrisk, controls and conduct considerations into key HR practices including performance development,\ncompensation, promotion and succession planning \u2022 Compensation features and elements designed to discourage\nimprudent risk-taking (e.g., multi-year vesting, clawbacks, prohibition on hedging, etc.) \u2022 Annual incentive\npool processes for LOBs and functions \u2022 Regulatory updates which have impacted or may impact HR practices in\nthe future The committees are also provided with information on our performance development process, a\nsummary of risk, controls and conduct feedback, and updates regarding HR Control Forum issues. STRONG\nACCOUNTABILITY AND RECOVERY PROVISIONS Our executive compensation program is designed to hold executives\naccountable, when appropriate, for meaningful actions or issues that negatively impact business performance\nor the Firm\u2019s reputation in current or future years. Issues that may warrant recovery determinations can be\nraised at any time, including in HR Control Forums, annual assessments of employee performance and when\nDesignated Employees resign or their employment is terminated by the Firm. Under the Firm\u2019s process to\ngovern these determinations: \u2022 We have established a process for reviewing compensation or other employee\nactions following a determination that the cause and materiality of a risk-related loss, issue or other set\nof facts and circumstances warrants such a review of accountability for actual or potential misconduct. \u2022\nThe CMDC is responsible for determinations involving OC members (determinations involving the CEO are\nsubject to ratification by independent members of the Board). The Firm has a framework that identifies and\nassesses employee risk and drives consistent management decisions and discipline. For more material risk and\ncontrol issues, the HR Control Forum process described on the following page explains how issues are\nreviewed and impacts are recommended.\n                                                                                                            \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.522023 PROXY STATEMENT                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                                   \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION |COMPENSATION DISCUSSION  \n  AND ANALYSIS                                     \n                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n  Overview    How we think about pay          How we performed against our    How performance determined    \n              decisions                       business strategy               pay in 2022                   \n                                                                                                            \nHOLDING INDIVIDUALS ACCOUNTABLE\n\nTo hold individuals responsible for taking risks\ninconsistent with the Firm\u2019s risk appetite and to\ndiscourage future imprudent behavior, the Firm has\npolicies and procedures that enable it to take\ntimely and proportionate actions with respect to\naccountable individuals, including:\n\nI.

The Firm has a framework in place that provides for recommended impacts to drive consistency.\nHowever, the precise actions we take with respect to accountable individuals, which may also include\ncoaching and training in addition to the above, are based on the relevant circumstances, including the\nnature of their involvement, the magnitude of the event and the impact on the Firm.

CONSULTANT\n\nDuring the second half of 2022, the CMDC retained Semler Brossy, an independent compensation consultant, who\nprovided input on our performance assessment process, compensation program, and market expectation as a\nresult of the 2022 Say on Pay vote. The CMDC recognized the importance of responding to shareholder\nfeedback, and determined that seeking the input of an independent compensation consulting firm that is well-\nqualified to provide advice was appropriate. The independent compensation consultant did not determine or\nrecommend the amount or form of compensation granted to our NEOs for the 2022 performance year.\n\nThe Consultant solely served the independent members of the Board and the CMDC, not the Firm; the CMDC\ndetermined that Semler Brossy had no conflicts of interest in providing services to the Committee and was\nindependent under the factors set forth in the NYSE rules for compensation committee advisors.\n\n1 Since 2015, the Firm has maintained a local Malus and Clawback Policy in accordance with E.U. and U.K.\nregulations which operates in addition to the recovery provisions in the table above. Under the policy, the\nFirm is able to cancel and/or recover incentive compensation for relevant Identified Staff (including Mr.\nPinto's prior awards granted when he was in the U.K.) in certain circumstances for a minimum period of seven\nyears following the date of the award.\n\n2 Provisions apply to PSUs, RSUs and SARs granted to the Operating Committee and may result in cancellation\nof up to a total of 50% of the award. For the SARs granted to Messrs. Dimon and Pinto in 2021, the\ncumulative ROTCE threshold is 20% for the four calendar years preceding the fifth-year exercisable dates.\n                                                                                                            \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.542023 PROXY STATEMENT                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                                   \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION |COMPENSATION DISCUSSION  \n  AND ANALYSIS                                     \n                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n  Overview    How we think about pay          How we performed against our    How performance determined    \n              decisions                       business strategy               pay in 2022                   \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       How we performed against our business strategy                                                       \n       We continued to deliver strong multi-year financial performance, invest in our future, strengthen    \n  2    our risk and control environment, and reinforce our culture and values, including our long-standing  \n       commitment to serve our customers, employees and communities, and conduct business in a responsible  \n       way to drive inclusive growth.                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \nIn assessing the Firm\u2019s performance in 2022, the CMDC considered the following factors in the context of the\nFirm\u2019s Business Principles and strategic framework:\n                                                                                                            \n  Business Results    Risk, Controls & Conduct    Client / Customer / Stakeholder    Teamwork & Leadership  \n                                                                                                            \n                    \n  Business Results  \n                    \n2022 KEY HIGHLIGHTS\n\nThe Firm continued to build upon its strong momentum from prior years amid challenging market conditions,\nreflecting the diversity and durability of our products and services, as well as long-term strategic\ninvestments made in our businesses.

Highlights of our work include:\n\n\u2022 Sustainable Development Target : Building off\nprior initiatives, in 2021, we set a Sustainable\nDevelopment Target to finance and facilitate $2.5\ntrillion by the end of 2030 to advance long-term\nsolutions that address climate change and contribute\nto sustainable development across three objectives:\n\n\u25e6 Green: Aiming to drive climate action, clean\nenergy, and sustainable resource management, with a\nfocus on accelerating the deployment of solutions\nfor cleaner sources of energy and facilitating the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy. We are targeting\n$1 trillion toward this area by the end of 2030.\n\n\u25e6 Development Finance: Working to support\nsocioeconomic development in emerging economies,\nwith a focus on mobilizing capital to advance the\nUnited Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\n\u25e6 Community Development: Striving to advance\neconomic inclusion in developed markets, with a\nfocus in the U.S. on Low-to-Moderate Income (LMI)\nindividuals and communities and closing the racial\nwealth gap among Black, Hispanic and Latino\nindividuals and communities. This includes many of\nthe actions we are taking as part of our Racial\nEquity Commitment.\n\n\u2022 Driving inclusive economic growth: The Firm\ncontinues to apply its business, philanthropic and\npolicy expertise, sustainable business practices,\ndata, capital and global presence to advance\nsolutions that create economic opportunities for our\ncustomers, employees and the communities we serve.\nOur efforts focus on the areas where our business\nand expertise can drive long-term impact: careers\nand skills, business growth and entrepreneurship,\ncommunity development, financial health and wealth\ncreation as well as environmental sustainability.\n\n\u2022 Advancing racial equity: By the end of 2022, we\nreported nearly $29 billion of progress toward our\n$30 billion Racial Equity Commitment to help close\nthe racial wealth gap among Black, Hispanic, Latino\nand underserved customers and communities.\n                                                                                                            \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT57JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                                   \n  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS| EXECUTIVE  \n  COMPENSATION                                     \n                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n  Overview    How we think about pay          How we performed against our    How performance determined    \n              decisions                       business strategy               pay in 2022                   \n                                                                                                            \n                         \n  Teamwork & Leadership  \n                         \nOur employees\u2019 effectiveness, career development and ability to adapt to a changing landscape enables\ncontinued delivery of sustained shareholder value. In order to attract and retain the highest quality\ntalent, we develop key talent and succession plans, invest in Firmwide diversity, equity and inclusion\ninitiatives, and provide well-paid jobs with strong benefits and wellness programs.\n\nSUCCESSION PLANNING\n\nSuccession planning is a priority for the Board and the Firm\u2019s senior leadership, with the objective of\nhaving a pipeline of top and diverse executives who lead inclusively for today and the future. We have\nimplemented a disciplined executive talent management and succession planning process that includes LOBs and\nFunctions holding talent review discussions within their management teams and identifying potential\nsuccessors for key leadership roles.\n\nOne of the Board\u2019s top priorities is succession planning for Mr. Dimon, which entails enabling an orderly\nCEO transition to take place in the medium-term. As part of this succession plan, the Board has developed,\nand will continue to develop, several Operating Committee members who are well-known to shareholders as\nstrong potential candidates to succeed Mr. Dimon. Should the need arise in the near-term, the Board views\nMr. Pinto as a key executive who is immediately ready to step into the role of sole CEO. Mr. Pinto's\nexceptional leadership capabilities are well-known to our shareholders and he has previously served as co-\nCEO of the Firm during Mr. Dimon's unplanned absence in 2020 due to prior unforeseen circumstances. The\nBoard has well-developed processes in place to support proper governance. This includes the CMDC regularly\nreviewing the succession plan for the CEO and the Lead Independent Director regularly leading succession\ndiscussions with the non-executive directors of the Board. The CMDC also reviews the succession plan for\nmembers of the Operating Committee other than the CEO, which is also discussed by the full Board of\nDirectors. This is in addition to Board discussions of talent management, which occur frequently throughout\nthe year.\n\nBelow our Operating Committee level, the Firm continues to focus on our leadership pipeline through enhanced\ndata and reporting capabilities to drive manager excellence and accountability in processes, including our\nmobility and promotion pipeline from Executive Director to Managing Director.\n\nDIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION\n\nPromoting diversity, equity and inclusion is important to the work we do. We are committed to maintaining a\nculture of respect and inclusion and believe that all individuals should have the opportunity to succeed. We\nbelieve a diverse and inclusive environment fosters innovation, creativity and productivity, which is\ncritical to our long-term success. We are committed to hiring and retaining employees from all races,\nethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, abilities, backgrounds, experiences and locations.\n\nWe are focused on being an employer of choice for all talent, where employees feel like they belong. As a\nfirm, we strive to embed diversity, inclusion and accessibility into the way we do business every day. While\nwe are proud of the industry recognition our Firm and leaders have received, we continue to be intentional\nabout investing in women; Black, Hispanic and Latino, Asian, Pacific Islander and LGBTQ+ communities;\nindividuals with disabilities; and veterans.\n\nWe continue to invest significant time and resources toward executing diversity, equity and inclusion best\npractices firmwide. An important part of these efforts includes the Firm's Business Resource Groups\n(\"BRGs\"), which are groups of employees who support the Firm's DEI strategies by leveraging the unique\nperspectives of their members. In addition to the BRGs, the Firm has global DEI Centers of Excellence that\nplay an important role in supporting our commitments to advance racial equity, create lasting impact in\ncommunities, and strengthen the Firm's inclusive culture.\n\nExecuting on our DEI commitments requires promoting accountability across our Firm. Our Accountability\nFramework, which we continue to enhance over time since its launch in 2020, is used to evaluate senior\nleaders, including OC members, on behaviors, practices and progress toward representation goals related to\nthe Firm's DEI priorities, and to incorporate that into year-end performance and compensation assessments.\n                                                                                                            \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.582023 PROXY STATEMENT                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                                   \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION |COMPENSATION DISCUSSION  \n  AND ANALYSIS                                     \n                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n  Overview    How we think about pay          How we performed against our    How performance determined    \n              decisions                       business strategy               pay in 2022                   \n                                                                                                            \nEMPLOYEE GROWTH\n\nWe are dedicated to a culture that enables employees and leaders to grow and succeed throughout their\ncareers while encouraging them to uphold a standard of excellence. To do so, we make substantial investments\nin learning content, tools and training programs to help employees build their knowledge, skills and\nexperience, and to guide their career advancement. In 2022, we continued to deliver development and training\nprograms to our employees by using virtual learning and creating content to support our employees.\n\nWELL-BEING AND WORK LIFE BALANCE\n\nWe are committed to providing programs and policies that support the needs of our employees and their\nfamilies. We continually invest in and explore ways to improve health outcomes and strengthen our benefits\nofferings. We offer an extensive benefits and wellness package to employees and their families, including\nhealthcare coverage, retirement benefits, life and disability insurance, on-site health and wellness\ncenters, employee assistance programs, competitive vacation and leave policies, backup child care\narrangements, tuition reimbursement programs, counseling and resources related to mental health, and\nfinancial coaching.\n\nHighlights from 2022 include:\n\n\u2022 Health Programs : In 2022, the Firm covered approximately $1.4 billion in medical costs for U.S. employees\nand their families, and enhanced U.S. benefits for LGBTQ+ employees and family members\n\n\u2022 Supporting Families : The Firm provides family building assistance to help U.S. employees with the high\ncosts of adoption, surrogacy and fertility expenses, and is enhancing paid time off for employees to handle\npersonal and family needs\n\n\u2022 Financial Health : The Firm offers a wide range of benefits and programs to help employees with their\nfinancial health, including educational sessions, financial wellness assessments and one-on-one financial\ncoaching\n                                                                                                            \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT59JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                                   \n  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS| EXECUTIVE  \n  COMPENSATION                                     \n                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n  Overview    How we think about pay          How we performed against our    How performance determined    \n              decisions                       business strategy               pay in 2022                   \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n       How performance determined pay in 2022                                                               \n       CEO pay is strongly aligned to the Firm\u2019s short-, medium- and long-term performance, with            \n  3    approximately 85% of the CEO\u2019s variable pay deferred into equity, of which 100% is in at-risk PSUs   \n       for both our CEO and our President & COO.

It differs from how compensation is reported in the \u201cSummary Compensation Table\u201d (\u201cSCT\u201d) on\npage 68, which is required by the SEC, and is not intended as a substitute for the SCT. There are two\nprincipal differences between the SCT and the table above:\n\n1. The Firm grants both cash and equity incentive compensation after a performance year is completed. In\nboth the table above and the SCT, cash incentive compensation paid in 2023 for 2022 performance is shown as\n2022 compensation. In the table above, the equity awards (RSUs and PSUs) granted in 2023 for 2022\nperformance are shown as 2022 compensation. In contrast, the SCT reports the value of equity awards in the\nyear in which they are granted. As a result, awards granted in 2022 for 2021 performance are shown in the\nSCT as 2022 compensation.\n\n2. The SCT reports the change in pension value and nonqualified deferred compensation and all other\ncompensation. These amounts are not shown in the table above.\n                                                                                                            \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.602023 PROXY STATEMENT                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                                   \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION |COMPENSATION DISCUSSION  \n  AND ANALYSIS                                     \n                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n  Overview    How we think about pay          How we performed against our    How performance determined    \n              decisions                       business strategy               pay in 2022                   \n                                                                                                            \n2022 CEO annual compensation is aligned with multi-year performance\n                                                                                                            \n  James Dimon                                                                                               \n  CHAIRMAN & CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER                                                                        \n  In determining Mr. Dimon\u2019s compensation, independent members of the Board considered his exemplary        \n  leadership and achievements across the Firm's four broad performance dimensions.

No NEOs had\nearnings in excess of 120% of the applicable federal rate on deferred compensation balances where the rate\nof return is not calculated in the same or in a similar manner as earnings on hypothetical investments under\nthe Firm's qualified plans. The amount of earnings in excess of 120% of the applicable federal rate included\nin this column is $0 for each of 2022, 2021 and 2020. The Change in Pension Value is -$76,420 for Ms.\nErdoes, -$72,126 for Ms. Piepszak, and -$69,126 for Mr. Barnum.\n\n6 \u201cAll other compensation\u201d includes the cost, if any, for a NEO\u2019s spouse to attend business-related events\nwhere spousal attendance is expected or customary.

Mr. Dimon\u2019s personal use of corporate aircraft and cars, and certain related security, is\nrequired pursuant to security measures approved by the Board. Incremental costs are determined as follows:\n\n\u25e6 Aircraft: operating cost per flight hour for the aircraft type used, developed by an independent reference\nsource, including fuel, fuel additives and lubricants; landing and parking fees; crew expenses; small\nsupplies and catering; maintenance, labor and parts; engine restoration costs; and a maintenance service\nplan.\n\n\u25e6 Cars: annual lease valuation of the cars; annual insurance premiums; fuel expense; annual maintenance;\nother miscellaneous expense; and annual drivers\u2019 compensation, including salary, overtime, benefits and\nbonus. The resulting total is allocated between personal and business use based on mileage.\n\n8 Mr. Pinto's 2022 salary of $1,500,000 includes a fee of \u00a3100,000 for his service on the J.P. Morgan\nSecurities plc Board.

Grants made as part of the annual incentive compensation process are generally awarded in January\nafter fourth quarter earnings are released. RSUs and PSUs carry no voting rights. On January 17, 2023, the\nFirm awarded RSU and PSU awards as part of 2022 annual incentive compensation. Because these awards were\ngranted in 2023, they do not appear in this table, which is required to include equity awards actually\ngranted during 2022. These 2023 awards are however reflected in the \u201cNEO annual compensation table\" on page\n60.\n\n2 For NEOs other than Mr. Pinto, PSUs vest on March 25, 2025, and are subject to a two-year holding period\npost-vesting. In accordance with U.K. regulations, for Mr. Pinto, PSUs vest in five equal installments on\nMarch 25, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028 and 2029 and are subject to: (i) a twelve-month holding period for all\ninstallments post-vesting, (ii) a two-year holding period for the installment vesting on March 25, 2025,\nwith the holding periods associated with (i) and (ii) above running concurrently. Each PSU represents the\nright to receive one share of common stock on the vesting date. The ultimate number of PSUs that will vest\nwill be determined by the Firm\u2019s performance over the three-year performance period, and for NEOs other than\nMr. Pinto, will include any accumulated reinvested dividend equivalent shares. The dividend equivalent\nshares, if any, will be based on: (1) the number of PSUs earned at vesting; and (2) on dividends that would\nhave been paid on the Firm\u2019s common stock during the vesting period as of each dividend payment date, if\nany. Under rules applicable in the U.K., for Mr. Pinto, the PSUs are not eligible for reinvested dividend\nequivalent shares and an assessment is also made of his qualitative performance in determining the ultimate\nnumber of PSUs that will vest.\n\n3 For NEOs other than Mr. Pinto, RSUs vest in two equal installments on January 13, 2024 and 2025. Each RSU\nrepresents the right to receive one share of common stock on the vesting date and non-preferential dividend\nequivalents, payable in cash, equal to any dividends paid on the Firm\u2019s common stock during the vesting\nperiod. Under rules applicable in the U.K., for Mr. Pinto, RSUs vest in five equal installments on January\n13, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028 and 2029 and are subject to a twelve-month holding period post-vesting. Mr.\nPinto\u2019s RSUs are not eligible for dividend equivalents.\n\n4 For NEOs other than Mr. Pinto, the grant date fair value for RSUs and PSUs is based on the average of the\nhigh and the low prices of JPMorgan Chase common stock on the grant date multiplied by the number of units\ngranted (for RSUs) or target number of PSUs. For Mr. Pinto the grant date fair value takes into account that\nthese awards do not carry the right to dividends or dividend equivalents prior to vesting, in accordance\nwith local regulations.\n                                                                                                            \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT69JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                            \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES| EXECUTIVE  \n  COMPENSATION                              \n                                            \nIII.

The Plan was frozen with respect to pay credit\ncontributions, effective January 1, 2020, and frozen with respect to new entrants into the Plan, effective\nJanuary 1, 2019. Employees became fully vested in the value of their Plan benefits as a result of this\nchange. The years of service listed above are as of the freeze date. The Plan employed a cash balance\nformula (in the form of pay and interest credits) to determine amounts at retirement. Pay credits ceased\neffective with the plan freeze. Interest credits, which generally equal the yield on one-year U.S. Treasury\nbills plus 1% (subject to a minimum of 4.5%), continue to accrue. Account balances include the value of\nbenefits earned under prior heritage company plans, if any. Benefits are payable as an actuarially\nequivalent lifetime annuity with survivorship rights (if married) or optionally under a variety of other\npayment forms, including a single-sum distribution.\n\nExcess Retirement Plan \u2014 Benefits were determined under the same terms and conditions as the Retirement\nPlan, but reflecting base salary in excess of IRS limits up to $1 million and benefit amounts in excess of\nIRS limits. Benefits are generally payable in a lump sum in the year following termination. The plan is\nclosed to new participants and accruals under the plan were discontinued as of May 1, 2009.\n\nPresent value of accumulated benefits \u2014 The valuation method and all material assumptions used to calculate\nthe amounts above are consistent with those reflected in Note 8 to the Firm\u2019s Consolidated Financial\nStatements in the 2022 Form 10-K on pages 212-214. Key assumptions include the discount rate (5.35%);\ninterest rates (5.00% crediting to project cash balances; 3.95% to convert annuities to lump sums and lump\nsums to annuities) and mortality rates (for the present value of annuities, the Pri-2012 (white-collar)\nprojected generational mortality table with projection scale MP2021; for lump sums, the UP94 mortality table\nprojected to 2002, with 50%/50% male/female weighting). We assumed benefits would commence at normal\nretirement date or unreduced retirement date, if earlier. Benefits paid from the Retirement Plan were\nassumed to be paid either as single-sum distributions (with probability of 85%) or life annuities (with\nprobability of 15%). Benefits from the Excess Retirement Plan are paid as single-sum distributions.

In addition, there are balances\nin deemed investment choices from heritage company plans that are no longer open to new deferrals.\n\nInvestment returns in 2022 for the following investment choices were: Short-Term Fixed Income, 1.36%;\nInterest Income, 2.94%; Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, (13.00)%; High-Yield, (9.36)%; Balanced\nPortfolio, (15.28)%; S&P 500 Index, (18.16)%; Mid-Cap Index, (18.82)%; Russell 2000 Index, (20.51)%; REIT\nIndex, (26.30)%; International, (30.12)%; and JPMorgan Chase common stock, including dividend equivalents,\n(12.61)%.\n\nBeginning with deferrals credited January 2005 under the Deferred Compensation Plan, participants were\nrequired to elect to receive distribution of the deferral balance beginning either following retirement or\ntermination or in a specific year but no earlier than the second anniversary of the date the deferral would\notherwise have been paid. If retirement or termination were elected, payments will commence during the\ncalendar year following retirement or termination. Participants may elect the distribution to be lump sum or\nannual installments for a maximum of 15 years. With respect to deferrals made after December 31, 2004, under\nthe Deferred Compensation Plan, account balances are automatically paid as a lump sum in the year following\ntermination if employment terminates prior to the participant attaining 15 years of service. With respect to\ndeferrals made after December 31, 2017, account balances are automatically paid as a lump sum in the year\nfollowing termination if employment terminates prior to the participant attaining 5 years of service.\n\nThe Supplemental Savings and Investment Plan (\u201cSSIP\u201d) is a heritage plan applicable to former Bank One\nemployees which is closed to new participants and does not permit new deferrals. It functions similarly to\nthe Deferred Compensation Plan. The investment return in 2022 for the following investment choice was:\nShort-Term Fixed Income, 1.70%. With respect to the SSIP, account balances are automatically paid as a lump\nsum in the year following termination unless an installment option is elected prior to termination of\nemployment.\n                                                                                                            \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT73JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                            \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES| EXECUTIVE  \n  COMPENSATION                              \n                                            \nVII. 2022 POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL\n\nWe believe our pay practices relating to termination events, summarized below, illustrate our commitment to\nsound corporate governance, are consistent with best practices and are aligned with the interests of\nshareholders.\n                                                                                                            \n   TERMINATION POLICIES ALIGNED WITH SHAREHOLDER INTERESTS                                                  \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  No golden parachute agreements    \u2022NEOs are not entitled to any accelerated cash/equity payments or       \n                                    special benefits upon a change in control                               \n                                    \u2022All of the U.S. based NEOs are \u201cat will\u201d employees and are not         \n  No employment agreements          covered by employment agreements                                        \n                                    \u2022Ms. Lake's terms of employment reflect applicable U.K. legal           \n                                    standards                                                               \n  No special cash severance         \u2022Severance amounts for NEOs are capped at one-year salary, not to       \n                                    exceed $400,000 (or \u00a3275,000 in the case of Ms. Lake)                   \n  No special executive benefits     \u2022NEOs are not entitled to any special benefits upon termination         \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Standard, broad-based severance                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \nMr. Dimon, Mr. Pinto, Ms. Erdoes, Ms. Piepszak and Mr. Barnum are covered under the Firm\u2019s broad-based U.S.\nSeverance Pay Plan.

In addition, in the event of termination by the Firm for reasons other than\ncause, employees may be considered, at the discretion of the Firm, for a cash payment in lieu of an annual\nincentive compensation award, taking into consideration all circumstances the Firm deems relevant, including\nthe circumstances of the employee\u2019s leaving and the employee\u2019s contributions to the Firm over his or her\ncareer. Severance benefits and any such discretionary payment are subject to execution of a release in favor\nof the Firm and certain post-termination restrictions.\n\nThe table on the following page sets forth the benefits and compensation which the Named Executive Officers\nwould have received if their employment had terminated on December 31, 2022. The amounts shown in the table\non the following page do not include other payments and benefits available generally to salaried employees\nupon termination of employment, such as accrued vacation pay, distributions from the 401(k) Savings Plan,\npension and deferred compensation plans, or any death, disability or post retirement welfare benefits\navailable under broad-based employee plans. For information on the pension and deferred compensation plans,\nsee \u201cTable V: 2022 Pension benefits\u201d on page 72 and \u201cTable VI: 2022 Non-qualified deferred compensation\u201d on\npage 73.

Rather,\nunder certain termination scenarios including disability, death, termination without cause, or resignation\n(if full-career eligible), NEOs\u2019 outstanding equity awards continue to vest in accordance with their terms\n(or accelerate in the event of death). The table on the following page shows the value of these unvested\nRSUs, PSUs and SARs based on the closing price of our common stock on December 30, 2022 (for SARs it was $0,\nsince the closing price of our common stock on December 30, 2022 is less than the applicable exercise price\nof the SARs).\n                                                                                                            \n  Government Office provision                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nEmployees with applicable awards, including NEOs, are covered under the Firm\u2019s Government Office provision\nwhich allows for continued vesting of equity awards if the employee resigns to accept a covered government\noffice. For such employees who are full-career eligible, outstanding performance year awards continue to\nvest in accordance with their terms whether they leave the Firm to enter government service or otherwise,\nso, for these awards, the Government Office provision does not provide any benefit to employees who are\nfull-career eligible. All NEOs meet the full-career eligibility provision of their applicable awards. 1\n\nFor employees who are not full-career eligible, and for awards that do not have full career eligibility\nprovisions, the value of awards that would continue to vest as a result of the Government Office provision\nof our equity plan would equal a percentage of the unvested stock awards ranging from 0% prior to three\nyears of employment by the Firm to 50% after three years of employment increasing to 100% after five years.\n\n1 Refer to Notes 3 and 6 on page 75.\n

NEOs are not entitled to\nany additional equity awards in connection with a potential termination.\n\n2 Involuntary terminations without cause include involuntary terminations due to redundancies and\ninvoluntary terminations without alternative employment. For \u201cSeverance and other\u201d, amounts shown represent\nseverance under the Firm\u2019s broad-based U.S. Severance Pay Plan, or the U.K. Discretionary Redundancy Policy\nin the case of Ms. Lake. Base salary greater than $400,000 per year, or \u00a3275,000 in the case of Ms. Lake, is\ndisregarded for purposes of determining severance amounts. The rate used to convert Ms. Lake\u2019s eligible\nseverance to U.S. dollars was the blended spot rate for the month of December 2022, which was $1.21785 U.S.\ndollars per British pound sterling.\n\n3 For employees in good standing who have resigned and have met full-career eligibility or other acceptable\ncriteria, awards continue to vest over time on their original schedule, provided that the employees, for the\nremainder of the vesting period, do not perform services for a financial services company or work in their\nprofession (whether or not for a financial services company); provided that employees may work for a\ngovernment, education or not-for-profit organization. The awards shown represent RSUs and PSUs that would\ncontinue to vest because the NEOs have met the full-career eligibility criteria. The awards are subject to\ncontinuing post-employment obligations to the Firm during this period.\n\n4 In the case of disability, stock awards continue to vest pursuant to their original vesting schedule.\n\n5 Vesting restrictions on stock awards and restrictions upon exercise of SARs lapse immediately upon death.\n\n6 The Government Office provision of an award does not provide any benefit to employees who have met the\nfull-career eligibility provision of that same award. Therefore, under the terms of the Government Office\nprovision, NEOs would generally not receive any benefit upon termination since they meet the full-career\neligibility provision entitling them to continued vesting of their equity awards (see preceding Note 3). For\nawards that do not have the full career eligibility provision, the amount reported is based on the December\n31, 2022 value of the award in which the NEO is eligible to continue to vest.\n\n7 For death, represents the value of PSUs granted on January 21, 2020, January 19, 2021, and January 18,\n2022, assuming: (a) maximum payout related to 2020, 2021, and 2022 performance years; (b) target payout\nrelated to 2023 and 2024 performance years; and (c) accumulated reinvested dividend equivalent shares as of\nDecember 31, 2022. For involuntary without cause, full career eligibility provision and disability, (a)\nmaximum payout related to PSUs granted on January 21, 2020; and (b) target payout is assumed related to PSUs\ngranted on January 19, 2021 and January 18, 2022.\n                                                                                                            \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT75JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                                \n  PAY VERSUS PERFORMANCE DISCLOSURE| EXECUTIVE  \n  COMPENSATION                                  \n                                                \nPay versus performance disclosure\n\nPAY VERSUS PERFORMANCE TABLE\n\nThe following table presents the executive Compensation Actually Paid (\"CAP\") for our Principal Executive\nOfficer (\"PEO\") and non-PEO NEOs relative to the Firm\u2019s financial performance in the format specified by the\nSEC pursuant to Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K. The CMDC does not utilize CAP for compensation considerations\nand determinations; for more information on our compensation philosophy and pay decisions for our named\nexecutive officers, see our \"Compensation Discussion and Analysis\" which starts on page 41.\n\nThe Firm has selected ROTCE, a comprehensive performance metric that measures the Firm's net income\napplicable to common equity as a percentage of average tangible common equity, as its most important\ncompany-selected financial performance measure for compensation. ROTCE reflects how well management is using\nshareholders\u2019 equity to generate profit. It is a fundamental performance metric that is widely used by the\nFirm, investors and analysts in assessing the earnings power of common shareholders\u2019 equity capital, and it\nis useful for comparing the profitability of the Firm with that of our competitors.\n                                                                                                            \n                                       Avera\u2026    Avera\u2026     Value                                           \n           Summa\u2026                      Summa\u2026    Compe\u2026        of                                           \n           Compe\u2026    Compe\u2026            Compe\u2026    Actua\u2026    Initi\u2026                                           \n            Table    Actua\u2026            Table       Paid     Fixed                      Net       ROTCE4     \n  Year1     Total      Paid            Total         to      $100                      Income       (%)     \n              for    to PEO            for       non-P\u2026    Inves\u2026                      ($B)                 \n              PEO      ($)2            non-P\u2026      NEOs     Based                                           \n              ($)                      NEOs        ($)2       On:                                           \n                                       ($)                                                                  \n  Comp\u2026      Peer                                                                                           \n  TSR3\u2026     Group                                                                                           \n           TSR3(\u2026                                                                                           \n  2022     $34,8\u2026    $37,4\u2026    $19,2\u2026            $17,2\u2026    $105.\u2026    $118.54    $37.7                18  %  \n  2021     84,42\u2026    130,5\u2026    23,47\u2026            35,68\u2026    120.68     132.50    $48.3                23  %  \n  2020     31,66\u2026    10,69\u2026    19,25\u2026            14,70\u2026     94.48      98.24    $29.1                14  %  \n                                                                                                            \n1 NEOs included in the above table are comprised of the following individuals.

The largest impact of the change\nin the stock price is on Mr. Dimon\u2019s outstanding SARs, which were out of the money as of the end of 2022.\nSimilarly, non-PEO NEO average CAP includes a special award of SARs granted to Mr. Pinto in December 2021,\nwhich was also out of the money as of December 31, 2022.\n\nIn summary, the Firm's PEO CAP and non-PEO NEO average CAP reflect a general correlation with:\n\n\u2022 The Firm\u2019s stock price and TSR, primarily due to a significant majority of our NEOs\u2019 compensation being in\nthe form of long-term equity\n\n\u2022 The Firm\u2019s net income, which reflects our pay-for-performance compensation philosophy and practices\n\n\u2022 The Firm\u2019s ROTCE, which emphasizes our commitment to providing strong returns to shareholders while\nmaintaining a fortress balance sheet\n\nIn addition, the Firm\u2019s change in TSR over the past 3 years reflects a general correlation with that of the\nbroader S&P Financials Index.\n\nUNRANKED TABULAR LIST OF THE FIRM'S MOST IMPORTANT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES\n\nAs required by SEC rules, the most important financial performance measures that the Firm used to link\nexecutive compensation during the last fiscal year to company performance are listed below.\n                                                     \n  Performance Measures                               \n  Managed revenue for the Firm and the lines of      \n  business                                           \n  Pre-tax income (ex.

Therefore, for this year's\ndisclosure, we have identified a new estimated median employee from our global employee population using the\nsame methodology as last year, based on data from the Firm's global compensation system as of January 31,\n2023.\n\nAnnual total compensation included salary as of December 31, 2022, as well as overtime pay, fixed allowance\nand incentive compensation, if applicable. We annualized the salary portion of the compensation for\nemployees who were hired during 2022; however, we did not make any full-time equivalent adjustments to part-\ntime, temporary and seasonal employees. We did not apply any cost-of-living adjustments as part of the\ncalculation. In determining the scope of our employees (other than our CEO), we included our global\nworkforce of full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal employees who were employed as of December 31,\n2022.\n\nCOMPARABILITY\n\nWe believe the ratio above is a reasonable estimate, based on the methodology we have described. Given the\ndifferent methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions other companies may use to calculate their\nrespective CEO pay ratios, as well as differences in employment and compensation practices between\ncompanies, the estimated ratio reported above may not be comparable to that reported by other companies.\n\n1 For purposes of the CEO pay ratio disclosure, Mr. Dimon\u2019s annual total compensation includes the amount\nreported in the \u201cTotal\u201d column of the 2022 Summary Compensation Table on page 68 which includes change in\npension value, plus the value of Firm-paid healthcare benefits applicable to Mr. Dimon.\n\n2 The estimated median employee\u2019s annual total compensation includes change in pension value, plus the value\nof Firm-paid employee benefits including healthcare benefits and 401(k) retirement plan contributions.\n                                                                                                            \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.782023 PROXY STATEMENT                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                                 \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION |SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF  \n  DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS               \n                                                 \nSecurity ownership of directors and executive\nofficers\n\nOur share retention policies require share ownership\nfor directors and executive officers, as described\non pages 33 and 52, respectively.\n\nThe following table shows the number of shares of\ncommon stock and common stock equivalents\nbeneficially owned by each director, the current\nexecutive officers named in the SCT, and all\ndirectors and executive officers as a group as of\nFebruary 28, 2023.

Audit fees For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, fees for the\nannual integrated audit of the Firm\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Firm\u2019s internal control\nover financial reporting, and quarterly reviews of the Firm\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements, were $45.1\nmillion and $41.8 million, respectively. Fees for services related to statutory/subsidiary audits,\nattestation reports required by statute or regulation, and comfort letters and consents related to SEC\nfilings and other similar filings with non-U.S. authorities were $25.9 million and $22.1 million,\nrespectively. The increase in Audit fees with PwC is primarily driven by inflation as well as additional\nengagements resulting from acquisitions and continued business growth.\n\nAudit-related fees Audit-related fees comprise assurance and related services that are traditionally\nperformed by the independent registered public accounting firm. These services include attestation and\nagreed-upon procedures which address accounting, reporting and control matters relating to fiduciary,\ntransaction processing, investment management, servicing activities and ESG initiatives; reviews related to\ninvestment and lending processes, and technology systems; and due diligence reviews related to acquisitions\nand divestitures. These services are normally provided in connection with the recurring audit engagement.\nTax fees Fees for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, for tax compliance and tax return preparation\nservices were $4.9 million and $3.8 million, respectively. Fees for other tax services, including tax\nadvisory and consultation on tax matters, were $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively. AUDIT COMMITTEE\nAPPROVAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES The Audit Committee\u2019s policies and procedures require the Audit Committee\nto pre-approve a list of specified audit, audit-related and tax services, and review and approve the terms\nand fees for the annual integrated audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements. All requests for audit,\naudit-related and tax services that are not on the pre-approved list of specified services must be approved\nby the Audit Committee. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s pre-approval policy does not provide for a de minimis exception\nunder which the pre-approval requirement may be waived. Pre-approved services to be performed by PwC with\nestimated costs in excess of $250,000 are approved by the Chair of the Audit Committee; and pre-approved\nservices with estimated costs less than or equal to $250,000 are delegated to the Firmwide Controller\u2019s\noffice for approval.\n                                                                                                            \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT85JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                         \n  AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT |AUDIT MATTERS  \n                                         \nAudit Committee report\n\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of\nJPMorgan Chase is comprised of three non-management\ndirectors. The Board has determined that each member\nof our committee has no material relationship with\nthe Firm under the Board\u2019s director independence\nstandards and that each member is independent under\nthe listing standards of the NYSE, where the Firm\u2019s\nsecurities are listed, and under the SEC\u2019s standards\nrelating to the independence of audit committees.\nThe Board has also determined that each member is\nfinancially literate and is an audit committee\nfinancial expert as defined by the SEC.\n\nCHARTER\n\nThe Audit Committee operates under a written charter\nadopted by the Board, which is available on our\nwebsite at jpmorganchase.com/about/governance/board-\ncommittees/audit-committee. We annually review our\ncharter and our practices. We have determined that\nour charter and practices are consistent with the\nlisting standards of the NYSE and the provisions of\nthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The purpose of the\nAudit Committee is to assist the Board in its\noversight of:\n\n\u2022 the independent registered public accounting\nfirm\u2019s qualifications and independence,\n\n\u2022 the performance of the Firm's internal audit\nfunction and the independent registered public\naccounting firm, and\n\n\u2022 management\u2019s responsibilities to assure that there\nis in place an effective system of controls\nreasonably designed to safeguard the assets and\nincome of the Firm; assure the integrity of the\nFirm\u2019s financial statements; and maintain compliance\nwith the Firm\u2019s ethical standards, policies, plans\nand procedures, and with laws and regulations.\n\nAUDIT COMMUNICATIONS AND FEES\n\nWe discussed with PwC the matters required to be\ndiscussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight\nBoard (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) Auditing Standard No. 1301,\nCommunications with Audit Committees, including\nPwC\u2019s overall audit scope and audit approach as set\nforth in the terms of their engagement letter; PwC\u2019s\noverall audit strategy for significant audit risks\nidentified by them; and the nature and extent of the\nspecialized skills necessary to perform the planned\naudit. We have established procedures to receive and\ntrack the handling of issues regarding accounting\nand reporting, internal control and auditing\nmatters. In addition, we monitor the audit, audit-\nrelated and tax services provided by PwC. The Audit\nCommittee has also evaluated and concluded that\naudit-related and tax services provided by PwC do\nnot impair PwC\u2019s independence.\n\nDetails of the fees paid to PwC for its services, as\nwell as the Audit Committee\u2019s \u201cpre-approval policy\u201d\nfor such services, can be found on page 85.\n\nASSESSMENT OF PWC\n\nThe Audit Committee annually reviews PwC\u2019s\nqualifications, performance and independence in\nconnection with its determination as to whether to\nretain PwC. In conducting our review we considered,\namong other things:\n\n\u2022 the professional qualifications of PwC, and that\nof the lead audit partner, quality review partner\nand other key engagement partners;\n\n\u2022 PwC\u2019s current and historical performance on the\nFirm\u2019s audit, including the extent and quality of\nits communications with the Audit Committee and the\nFirm\u2019s management;\n\n\u2022 PwC\u2019s demonstrated professional skepticism and\nobjectivity, including fresh perspectives brought\nthrough the required periodic rotation of the lead\naudit partner, the quality review partner and other\npartners who play a significant role in the audit\nengagement;\n\n\u2022 PwC\u2019s demonstrated capability, expertise and\nefficiency in which it handles the breadth and\ncomplexity of the Firm\u2019s global operations,\nincluding the use of technology, specialists, and\nsubject matter experts;\n\n\u2022 PwC\u2019s depth of institutional knowledge and\nunderstanding of the Firm\u2019s global businesses,\noperations and systems, the financial services\nindustry, including the global regulatory\nenvironment, U.S. and international accounting\nstandards, the potential effect on the financial\nstatements of the significant risks and exposures\nfacing the Firm, and the Firm\u2019s internal control\nover financial reporting;\n\n\u2022 external data relating to PwC\u2019s audit quality and\nperformance, including recent PCAOB reports on PwC\n(including its global network of firms), and the\nresults of peer review and self-review examinations;\n\n\u2022 an analysis of PwC\u2019s known legal risks and\nsignificant proceedings that could impair PwC\u2019s\nability to perform the Firm\u2019s annual audit;\n\n\u2022 PwC\u2019s tenure as the Firm\u2019s independent auditor;\n\n\u2022 the appropriateness of PwC\u2019s fees, both on an\nabsolute basis and as compared with fees paid by\ncertain peer banking firms; and\n\n\u2022 the advisability and potential impact of selecting\na different independent registered public accounting\nfirm, including the additional costs and\ninefficiencies associated with hiring a new\nindependent registered public accounting firm.\n                                                                                                            \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.862023 PROXY STATEMENT                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                         \n  AUDIT MATTERS |AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT  \n                                         \nPwC provided us the written disclosures and the\nletter required by PCAOB\u2019s Ethics and Independence\nRule 3526, Communications with Audit Committees\nConcerning Independence, and we discussed and\nconfirmed with PwC their independence.\n\nAs a result of this evaluation, we believe PwC has\nthe capability to provide the necessary expertise,\nindependence and professional skepticism to continue\nto audit the Firm\u2019s businesses on a global basis,\nand we approved the appointment of PwC as JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s independent registered public accounting\nfirm for 2023, subject to shareholder ratification.\n\nManagement is responsible for the Firm\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, the financial\nreporting process and JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Consolidated\nFinancial Statements. PwC is responsible for\nperforming an independent audit of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nConsolidated Financial Statements and of the\neffectiveness of internal control over financial\nreporting in accordance with auditing standards\npromulgated by the PCAOB. The Firm\u2019s Internal Audit\nfunction, under the direction of the General\nAuditor, is independent of the Firm\u2019s businesses and\nthe Independent Risk Management function. Internal\nAudit reports directly to the Audit Committee (and\nadministratively to the Firm\u2019s CEO) and is\nresponsible for preparing an annual audit plan and\nconducting internal audits intended to independently\ntest and evaluate the Firm\u2019s governance, risk\nmanagement and internal controls. The members of the\nAudit Committee are not professionally engaged in\nthe practice of accounting or auditing; as noted\nabove, the Audit Committee\u2019s responsibility is to\nmonitor and oversee these processes.\n\nThe Audit Committee regularly meets and holds\ndiscussions with the Firm\u2019s management, internal\nauditors and with PwC, and also holds private\nsessions with the General Auditor and with PwC,\nwithout members of\n\nmanagement present. These discussions include issues\nencountered during the audit, the Firm\u2019s quarterly\nearnings materials, and Quarterly and Annual Reports\non Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, respectively, prior to\nfiling with the SEC; as well as actions the Audit\nCommittee has taken during the prior year.\n\nManagement represented to us that JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nConsolidated Financial Statements were prepared in\naccordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America (\u201cU.S.\nGAAP\u201d). We reviewed and discussed JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nConsolidated Financial Statements with management,\nthe General Auditor and PwC. We also reviewed and\ndiscussed with PwC the quality of the Firm\u2019s\nsignificant accounting principles, the\nreasonableness of critical accounting estimates and\njudgments, critical audit matters PwC identified\nduring the audit, and the disclosures in JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements, including\ndisclosures relating to significant accounting\npolicies. We relied, without independent\nverification, on the information provided to us and\non the representations made by management, internal\nauditors and the independent auditor.

Whenever possible, the Chairman of the\nBoard shall be an Independent Director. The Board\nhas the discretion to select a Temporary Chairman of\nthe Board who is not an Independent Director to\nserve while the Board is seeking an Independent\nChairman of the Board on an accelerated basis. It is\na best practice to adopt this proposal soon. However\nthis policy could be phased in when there is a\ncontract renewal for our current CEO or for the next\nCEO transition. This proposal topic won our\n47%-support at the 2021 JPM annual meeting. There\nare at least 2 ways this can be considered a\nmajority vote. This 47% vote was especially\nimpressive because the proposal had to swim up\nstream against repeated glossy management special\nsolicitations sent to the shareholders who have no\nan independent source for proxy voting advice. The\n47% also represented a majority vote from the shares\nthat had access to independent proxy voting advice.\nAny proposal that gets above 45% support has to get\na majority vote from the most informed shares\nbecause there is an overwhelming abundance of\nautomatic votes from the JPM shares that have no\nother source of proxy voting advice other than JPM\nmanagement. In response to this impressive 47 % vote\nmanagement disingenuously put forth a policy that it\ncould always have one person fill the 2 most\nimportant jobs at JPM as long as the directors gave\nalmost any excuse to not have an independent board\nchairman. JPM also needs to take the role of the\nlead director more seriously. JPM's so-called Lead\nDirector, Mr. Stephen Burke, violates the most\nimportant attribute of a Lead Director -\nindependence. As director tenure goes up director\nindependence goes down. Mr. Burke has 19- years\ndirector tenure. And Mr. Burke got the most against\nvotes of any JPM director in 2022 surpassing Mr.\nJames Dimon who was third highest in against votes.\nA lead director can be given a list of duties but\nthere is no rule that prevents the Chairman from\noverriding the lead director in any of the so-called\nlead director duties. A lead director is no\nsubstitute for an independent board chairman. A lead\ndirector cannot call a special shareholder meeting.\nA lead director can delegate most of the lead\n\ndirector duties to others and then simply rubber-\nstamp it. There is no way shareholders can be sure\nof what goes on. Please vote yes: Independent Board\nChairman \u2014 Proposal 5 Board Response to Proposal 5\nThe Board of Directors recommends that shareholders\nvote AGAINST this proposal for the following\nreasons:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u2022The policy requested by the shareholder proposal would be adverse to the interests of the Firm's         \n  shareholders by restricting the Board\u2019s ability to use its experience, judgment, boardroom insight and    \n  ongoing shareholder feedback to make the best-informed decision on its leadership structure based on      \n  then-current facts and circumstances.                                                                     \n  \u2022The Board evaluates the Firm\u2019s leadership structure on an annual basis and believes that using its       \n  judgment to determine the appropriate structure is a core Board function and a key part of fulfilling     \n  its fiduciary duty to shareholders.                                                                       \n  \u2022The Board is focused on a successful transition of the current CEO's role. Following the 2021 Annual     \n  Meeting, the Firm engaged extensively with shareholders and adopted a general policy, upon the next CEO   \n  transition, that the Chair and CEO positions shall be separate, subject to the Board\u2019s determination of   \n  the leadership structure that best serves the Firm and its shareholders at the time.                      \n  \u2022Contrary to the proponent\u2019s assertion, the Board determined that the current Lead Independent Director,  \n  Stephen B. Burke, is independent. Moreover, his tenure has allowed him to gain invaluable institutional   \n  knowledge making him extremely effective as Lead Independent Director.                                    \n  \u2022JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Lead Independent Director role includes robust responsibilities, independent authority  \n  and provides a strong counterbalance to the Chair.  A Lead Independent Director is appointed when the     \n  Chair is not independent.                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \nThe Board of Directors views the determination of\nits leadership structure as a core Board function\nand a key part of fulfilling its fiduciary duty to\nshareholders. We believe that the Firm and its\nshareholders benefit most when our Board is free to\nexercise its discretion, including determining what\nleadership structure is in the best interest of the\nFirm and its shareholders based on its experience\nand judgment. The Board is committed to robust\ncorporate governance practices\n                                                                                                            \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT89JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Table of ContentsSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nthat facilitate its strong independent oversight of\nthe Firm and its management. The Board's retention\nof discretion in reviewing its leadership structure\nevidences the Board\u2019s intent to give due\nconsideration to the merits of separating the Chair\nand CEO positions. A proper exercise of the Board\u2019s\ndiscretion demands careful consideration of all\navailable information. A restrictive policy such as\nthat proposed by the proponent is not prudent, as it\ncould prevent the Board from adopting the governance\nstructure that it believes is best able to advance\nthe interests of the Firm and its shareholders. The\nindependent directors of the Board evaluate the\nFirm\u2019s leadership structure on an annual basis.\nConsiderations for leadership structure include,\namong other factors, the composition of the Board,\nthe individuals serving in leadership positions, the\nneeds and opportunities of the Firm at the time, and\nshareholder feedback. Such annual evaluation is\nimportant because \u201cone size does not fit all\u201d and\nthere is no clear consensus about ideal leadership\nstructures. A fixed policy requiring separation of\nthe roles fails to consider many factors.\nAccordingly, leadership structures vary among\ncompanies. In fact, Shearman & Sterling's 2022\nCorporate Governance & Executive Compensation Survey\nstates that, of the 100 largest U.S. public\ncompanies listed on the NYSE and Nasdaq, 54 have a\ncombined CEO/Chair role, and at the 46 companies\nwhere the chair and CEO positions are separated, 15\nchairs were not independent. In its evaluation, the\nBoard also considers the role of the Lead\nIndependent Director, whose responsibilities\ndemonstrate the Board\u2019s commitment to empowering the\nLead Independent Director to serve as an effective\ncounterbalance to the CEO. Our Lead Independent\nDirector focuses on the Board\u2019s priorities and\nprocesses, and his responsibilities include\nfacilitating independent oversight of management and\npromoting open dialogue among the independent\ndirectors during Board meetings, at executive\nsessions without the presence of the CEO, and\nbetween Board meetings. Contrary to the claims of\nthis proposal, our Lead Independent Director has\nmeaningful duties and is an active proponent of the\nBoard\u2019s, and the Firm\u2019s, success. The Board, Firm,\nand shareholders benefit from the independence and\ndepth of knowledge and skill possessed by our Lead\nIndependent Director as well as a continuity of\nexperience that complements ongoing Board\nrefreshment. We note that as Lead Independent\nDirector, Mr. Burke has been supported by\nshareholders, receiving more than 90% of shareholder\nvotes for each election during his tenure. For 2023,\nthe Board has determined that its current structure,\nwith a combined Chair and CEO counterbalanced by a\nfully empowered Lead Independent Director, will best\nserve the interests of the Firm and its\nshareholders. The Firm\u2019s continued strong financial\nperformance and meaningful progress on key\ninitiatives, as described throughout this Proxy\nStatement, is evidence that the current structure\nallows for effective execution on strategic\npriorities.\n\nIn considering the appropriate leadership structure,\nthe Board also considered the long-term performance\nof the Firm during the tenure of the current CEO in\nthe combined role. Since Mr. Dimon became CEO, the\nFirm has delivered ROTCE that has consistently and\nsubstantially outperformed that of our PSU\nperformance group by more than 400bps on average.\nFurther, an investment made in JPMC 10 years ago\nwould have significantly outperformed that of the\nKBW Bank and S&P Financials indices by 88 and 151\npercentage points, respectively. This enduring\noutperformance demonstrates the capabilities of the\ncurrent CEO in overseeing the Firm\u2019s business in the\ncombined role. The Board is also focused on a\nsuccessful transition of the current CEO role. Last\nyear, as part of the Board\u2019s annual review of its\nleadership structure and in response to shareholder\nfeedback, it considered how shareholders may best be\nserved upon the next management transition. As part\nof this process, the Board considered feedback\nthrough extensive shareholder outreach that\nidentified both a preference among some shareholders\nfor separate Chair and CEO positions and strong\nsupport for the current CEO. As a result, the Board\nenhanced our Corporate Governance Principles to\nprovide, upon the next CEO transition, that the\nChair and CEO positions will be separate, subject to\nthe Board\u2019s determination at the time of transition\nof the Board leadership structure that best serves\nthe Firm and its shareholders. If the Board in\nexercising its discretion, determines that retaining\nthe current Chair best serves the interest of the\nFirm, it will also retain a strong Lead Independent\ndirector to facilitate independent oversight of\nmanagement. The Board will continue to evaluate the\nstructure on an annual basis even after the\ntransition, and when the position of Chair is not\nfilled by an independent director, the independent\ndirectors will appoint a Lead Independent Director.\nFinally, it is unclear what the proponent intends in\nsuggesting that the Firm adopt a \u201cTemporary\nChairman.\u201d This is not a standard corporate\ngovernance practice and would undermine the\nauthority of the Chair role at JPMorgan Chase. The\nBoard recommends a vote against this proposal\nbecause it promotes an overly restrictive,\nmechanical analysis of the leadership structure of\nthe Board that would prevent the Board from\nexercising its discretion to make the best-informed\ndecision on its leadership structure. Proper\nexercise of discretion is critical in the Board's\nability to fulfill its fiduciary duties.

Organizations\nlike the Science Based Targets initiative and\nTransition Pathway Initiative can provide\nindependent verification of decarbonization targets.\n\nResolved: Shareholders request that the Board of\nDirectors adopt a policy for a time-bound phase-out\nof JPM\u2019s lending and underwriting to projects and\ncompanies engaging in new fossil fuel exploration\nand development.\n\nSupporting Statement: This proposal is intended, in\nthe discretion of board and management, to enable\nsupport for JPM's energy clients' low-carbon\ntransition.\n\n1 https://www.swissre.com/media/press-\nrelease/nr-20210422-economics-of-climate-change-\nrisks.html\n\n2 https://www.iisd.org/system/files/2022-\n10/navigating-energy-transitions-mapping-road-\nto-1.5.pdf\n\n3 https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/resources/spm-\nheadline-statements/\n\n4 https://www.iea.org/commentaries/what-does-the-\ncurrent-global-energy-crisis-mean-for-energy-\ninvestment\n\n5 https://www.jpmorganchase.com/news-\nstories/jpmorgan-chase-adopts-paris-aligned-\nfinancing-commitment\n\n6 https://www.unepfi.org/net-zero-\nbanking/commitment/\n\n7 http://bankingonclimatechaos.org/\n\n8 https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-\nrelations/2021/ar-ceo-letters.htm\n\n9 https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/press/spe\neches/date/2022/html/ssm.sp220922~bb043aa0bd.en.html\n\n10 https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/press/pr\n/date/2022/html/ssm.pr220708~565c38d18a.en.html\n\n11 https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressre\nleases/other20220929a.htm\n\n12 https://www.bis.org/review/r220223e.htm\n\n13 https://oilgaspolicytracker.org/\n\n14 https://coalpolicytool.org/\n\n15 https://stopthemoneypipeline.com/\n\n16 https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d517.pdf\n                                                                                                            \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT91JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Table of ContentsSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nBOARD RESPONSE TO PROPOSAL 6\n\nThe Board of Directors recommends that shareholders\nvote AGAINST this proposal for the following\nreasons:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u2022JPMorgan Chase supports the goals of providing secure, reliable, affordable energy while promoting       \n  clean energy solutions and strategies to reduce the world's carbon footprint.

The Firm continues to        \n  support our clients\u2019 development of long-term business strategies, emission reduction plans, and carbon   \n  disclosures consistent with those objectives.                                                             \n  \u2022We are also helping to accelerate progress toward advancing innovative green technology and have set a   \n  target to finance and facilitate $1 trillion toward green\u00a0initiatives.                                    \n  \u2022An abrupt withdrawal from financing new oil and natural gas projects would not be prudent, as it would   \n  increase risks associated with energy security without necessarily optimizing global carbon emissions     \n  reduction over the long-term. Our climate goals are sensitive to the necessity for technological          \n  advancements, the evolution of consumer behavior and demand, and the need for thoughtful climate          \n  policies and the balancing of our commitment to short-term targets with the need to facilitate energy     \n  security.                                                                                                 \n  \u2022Management is best positioned to make decisions on which types of economic activity to finance, as an    \n  important part of day-to-day operations of our core business in the interests of our shareholders.        \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm supports the goals of providing secure, reliable, affordable energy while promoting clean energy\nsolutions and strategies to reduce the world's carbon footprint. Two key features of our approach to climate\ninvolve financed emissions reduction targets and targets for investment in green technologies. To that end,\nin 2021 we published portfolio-level emissions intensity reduction targets for the Oil & Gas, Electric Power\nand Auto Manufacturing sectors, and in 2022, we published 2030 portfolio-level emissions intensity reduction\ntargets for three new sectors \u2013 Iron & Steel, Cement and Aviation. Our new targets are intended to align to\nthe International Energy Agency\u2019s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. The aggregate of these six sectors\naccount for the majority of global emissions across the supply and demand side value chains of the global\nenergy system.\n\nWe continue to work internally and with clients toward these targets. We have made progress in our climate-\nrelated capability building and established the Center for Carbon Transition (\"CCT\") in 2020 as the Firm\u2019s\ncenter of excellence to provide clients globally with cutting edge low-carbon transition focused advisory\nand expertise. Since then, the CCT published JPMorgan Chase & Co. Carbon Compass SM (2021) and launched the\nCarbon Assessment Framework, which enables us to bring a climate lens to the way we make financing decisions\nin Oil & Gas and the five other sectors currently covered by our climate targets. We use a quantitative and\nqualitative assessment of our clients\u2019 emissions and decarbonization plans to provide scores that become one\nelement of our transaction-level decision-making for in-scope clients. This approach, which now applies to\nboth lending and capital markets activity, enables us to assess how an in-scope transaction may affect\nprogress toward our portfolio-level targets. Our 2022 Climate Report includes detailed reporting on our\nprogress toward our initial targets. Massive investment in clean technologies is also required to provide\nfeasible alternatives to traditional fuels. To help accelerate progress toward advancing green technology,\nthe Firm set a target to finance and facilitate $1 trillion toward green initiatives, including supporting\nactivities which advance climate action (such as renewable energy, clean technology and sustainable\ntransportation) and other environmental objectives. We disagree with the assertion that the proposed policy\nis necessary to achieve our climate targets. We believe that adoption of an inflexible policy to phase out\nfinancing of new fossil fuel exploration and development would not be prudent at a time when analysts\nproject that the availability of alternatives to fossil fuels will not be sufficient to meet increases in\nenergy demand over the medium term. This is exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and other geopolitical\nconsiderations that have contributed to higher energy costs and reduced reliability, negatively impacting\nnational security and hurting the most vulnerable. Phasing out fossil fuel financing entirely could also\ndisincentivize some critical short term economic activity and simply transfer some carbon intensive banking\nactivity and associated financed emissions elsewhere. Further, the proposal could reduce certain of our\nenergy clients\u2019 access to capital when seeking to finance green and energy transition activities, such as\nrenewables, hydrogen, carbon capture, and other such activities. Our approach to environmental\nsustainability is based on working with our clients to formulate and take action toward their transition\nstrategies while realizing the economic opportunities of the transition to a low-carbon economy. In order to\nsuccessfully transition the global economy, these companies may require more, not less, financing to\ndecarbonize and support that transition.\n                                                                                                            \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.922023 PROXY STATEMENT                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Table of ContentsSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nWe believe our approach to climate appropriately\ntakes into account these global realities and\nsensibly balances the aim of emissions reduction and\nenergy security by incentivizing reductions over\ntime consistent with the availability of\nalternatives to fossil fuels. We have consistently\nnoted that our climate goals are sensitive to the\nnecessity for technological advancements, the\nevolution of consumer behavior and demand, and the\nneed for thoughtful climate policies and the\nbalancing of our commitment to short-term targets\nwith the need to facilitate energy security.\nShareholder feedback is also an important\nconsideration for management. In 2022, we solicited\nfeedback through 172 engagements with 118\nshareholders, which represented approximately 49% of\nthe Firm\u2019s outstanding common stock, and hosted two\nESG events, which gave shareholders access to the\nFirm's senior leaders. The insights gained from\nthese engagements helped to inform the Firm's\napproach to climate change, considerations for\nenergy security and our work with clients to support\nthe transition. As a diversified financial\ninstitution, JPMorgan Chase conducts many business\nactivities, and it is management's responsibility to\ndetermine whether and how to provide financing to\nspecific sectors, companies and projects. These\ndecisions are important to the Firm's day-to-day\noperations and require complex business judgments,\ntaking into account, among other factors, risk\nconsiderations. Further, given the Firm's existing\nefforts to help address climate change and the\nsignificant market and energy insecurity risks\nassociated with the adoption of a policy for a time-\nbound phase-out of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s lending and\nunderwriting to projects and companies engaging in\nnew fossil fuel exploration and development, we\nbelieve the Firm's management is best positioned to\nmake these decisions, with the oversight of the\nBoard of Directors. The Board believes that adoption\nof the requested policy would restrict management\u2019s\nability to make the best business judgments on which\ncompanies and projects to finance, and would not be\nin the interests of the Firm\u2019s long-term shareholder\nvalue.\n                                       \n  The Board of Directors recommends a  \n  voteAGAINSTthis proposal.            \n                                       \n                                                                                                            \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT93JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Table of ContentsSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nPROPOSAL 7 \u2014 AMENDING PUBLIC RESPONSIBILITY\nCOMMITTEE CHARTER TO INCLUDE MANDATE TO OVERSEE\nANIMAL WELFARE IMPACT AND RISK\n\nHarrington Investments has advised us that it\nintends to introduce the following resolution:\nWHEREAS: Animal welfare issues present material\nfinancial, operational and reputational risks for\ncompanies that receive financing from our Company,\nand to JPMorgan Chase directly as their financier.\nThese include risks of business disruption or loss\nof goodwill associated with inhumane treatment of\nanimals such as animal testing and conditions of\nhabitation, but they also may include environmental\nimpacts of factory farming and related supply chain\nrisks, and potential liabilities associated with\nissues of food safety, including diseases passed\nfrom animals to humans and overuse of antibiotics in\nlivestock. 1 To minimize these risks, some banks are\ntaking animal welfare and related climate disruption\nissues into account as part of their lending\npractices. Recently acquired subsidiary OpenInvest\npublished an analysis of these issues prior to\nacquisition by JPMorgan: \u201cA company that does not\ndisclose or prioritize its processes or impact on\nanimal welfare raises questions for investors on how\neffective that company can be in managing potential\nrisks or opportunities down the road. It is also\nimpossible to assess future risk without the\ndisclosure of the right information.\u201d 2 After\nacquisition, JPMorgan added a notice stating that\narticles posted on the OpenInvest website prior to\nthe acquisition did not necessarily reflect the\nviews of JPMorgan. In this instance, the divergence\nof views may be a significant concern. In its\nEnvironmental, Social, Governance (ESG) report,\nJPMorgan states: \u201cWe produce robust ESG-focused\ninvestment research to meet investors\u2019 needs for\ntimely insights and analysis that support their\nsustainability and ESG investment strategies.\u201d\nJPMorgan established the Public Responsibility\nCommittee (the \u201cCommittee\u201d) to provide \u201coversight\nand review of the Firm\u2019s positions and practices on\npublic responsibility matters such as community\ninvestment, fair lending, sustainability, consumer\npractices and other public policy issues that\nreflect the Firm\u2019s values and character and impact\nthe Firm\u2019s reputation among all of its\nstakeholders.\u201d 3 The Committee\u2019s charter is\ninstrumental in defining the scope of fiduciary\nduties of its members. The charter, as noted above,\nspecifies some issues but omits others. Omitting\ninclusion of animal welfare issues risks a failure\nof oversight on material issues. RESOLVED:\nShareholders request that the Board revise the\nPublic Responsibility Committee Charter to include\nCommittee oversight of material issues related to\nanimal welfare.\n\nSUPPORTING STATEMENT: Extending the fiduciary\nresponsibility of board members to oversight of\nanimal welfare issues can go hand-in-hand with\nimproved transparency, through which the Board or\nCommittee may update investors on any oversight or\nnew policies developed to address material risks\nassociated with animal welfare.

With respect to\nenvironmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") matters\nreferenced by the proponent, each of the Board\u2019s\nstanding committees assists the Board in its\noversight of ESG-related matters within its\nrespective scope of responsibility. The Corporate\nGovernance & Nominating Committee annually reviews\nthe allocation of responsibility among the\ncommittees, and the specific areas of business\nactivities and risk that each committee oversees may\nchange over time depending on the needs of the Firm\nand the Board and the advice of senior management.\nAnimal welfare as a standalone topic has not been\nidentified as a key risk for the Firm. In accordance\nwith its charter, the Public Responsibility\nCommittee (\u201cPRC\u201d) provides oversight of the Firm\u2019s\npositions and practices on public policy issues that\nreflect the Firm\u2019s values and character and impact\nits reputation generally among its stakeholders. The\nPRC is not a single-issue committee. It oversees\nnumerous issues that are consistent with its purpose\nbut are not specifically enumerated in its charter.\nThe inclusion or omission of a particular issue in\nthe committee\u2019s charter does not indicate the degree\nof time or attention that may, or may not be, spent\non that topic in the course of the PRC\u2019s, or the\nBoard\u2019s, work. The shareholder proposal refers to\nthe connection between animal welfare and climate\ndisruption, and suggests that banks, through their\nlending practices, can contribute to minimizing the\nrisks of many potential negative impacts at the\nintersection of these issues. We strive to do our\npart to help address climate change. The Firm has\nembarked on numerous initiatives relating to climate\nchange that underscore our ongoing efforts to\nadvance sustainability in our operations and\nfinancing activities. Our efforts are guided by the\nthree pillars of our environmental sustainability\nstrategy \u2013 scaling green solutions, meeting needs\nresponsibly, and minimizing our operational impact \u2013\nall of which is underpinned by our ongoing focus on\naccountability, transparency and engagement. We\nbelieve the proposal to add animal welfare\nconsiderations to the PRC Charter is not necessary\nin light of the Board\u2019s already robust risk\noversight framework and would provide no meaningful\nbenefits to shareholders.\n                                       \n  The Board of Directors recommends a  \n  voteAGAINSTthis proposal.            \n                                       \n                                                                                                            \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT95JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Table of ContentsSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nPROPOSAL 8 \u2014 SPECIAL SHAREHOLDER MEETING IMPROVEMENT\n\nJohn Chevedden has advised us that he intends to\nintroduce the following resolution: Shareholders ask\nour Board to take the steps necessary to amend the\nappropriate company governing documents to give\nstreet name shares and non-street name shares an\nequal right to call for a special shareholder\nmeeting and that the current 20% of shares\nrequirement to call a special meeting be improved to\n10% of shares. 10% of shares is reasonable because\nsome states require that 10% of shares be able to\ncall for a special shareholder meeting. One of the\nmain purposes of this proposal is to give all\nshares, including street name shares, the right to\nnormally participate in calling for a special\nshareholder meeting to the fullest extent possible\nand to clear up any ambiguity on whether street name\nshares can formally participate equally in calling\nfor a special shareholder meeting without converting\ntheir shares to another class of stock. One of the\nmain purposes of this proposal is to make sure that\nall street name shares can count 100% toward the\npercent of shares needed to call for a special\nshareholder meeting to the fullest extent possible\nand clear up any ambiguity. It is important to clear\nup ambiguity because ambiguity means that once a\ngroup of shareholders go through the process to call\nfor a meeting the result is a JPM lawsuit\nimmediately over an interpretation of meeting the\nrequirements and thereby killing in the crib the\nattempt to call for a special shareholder meeting.\nThe current JPM bylaw words regarding calling for a\nspecial shareholder meeting are defective in regard\nto clarity. Currently it takes a theoretical 20% of\nall shares outstanding to call for a special\nshareholder meeting. It then appears that all the\nshares that are held in street name are 100%\ndisqualified from participating in the calling of a\nspecial shareholder meeting. If 50% of JPMorgan\nshares are held in street name then it would take\n40% of non-street name shares (20% times 2) to call\nfor a special shareholder meeting. If 75% of\nJPMorgan shares are held in street name then it\nwould take 80% of non-street name shares (20% times\n4) to call for a special shareholder meeting. A\nright for 40% or 80% of a limited class of shares to\ncall a special shareholder meeting, and excluding\nall other shares, is not much of a right for the\nBoard to brag about. Plus JPMorgan shareholders have\na useless right to act by written consent, a related\nissue. Calling for a special shareholder meeting is\nhardly ever used by shareholders but the main point\nof the right to call for a special shareholder\nmeeting is that it gives shareholders at least\nsignificant standing to engage effectively with\nmanagement. Management will have an incentive to\ngenuinely engage with shareholders, instead of\nstonewalling, if shareholders have a\n\nrealistic Plan B option of calling a special\nshareholder meeting. Please vote yes: Special\nShareholder Meeting improvement - Proposal 8 BOARD\nRESPONSE TO PROPOSAL 8 The Board of Directors\nrecommends that shareholders vote AGAINST this\nproposal for the following reasons:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u2022JPMorgan Chase provides shareholders with various opportunities to engage with the Board and management  \n  as well as important rights, including the right to call a special meeting.                               \n  \u2022Our current record holder status requirement and the 20% ownership threshold promote shareholder rights  \n  while safeguarding the interests of all shareholders.                                                     \n  \u2022The right to call a special meeting is extended to shareholders of record (registered ownership).        \n  Shareholders who hold their shares in street name (beneficial ownership) may invoke the right to call a   \n  special meeting by transferring their shares to registered ownership.                                     \n  \u2022The Firm cannot meaningfully engage with shareholders who wish to invoke their right to call a special   \n  meeting, unless they self-identify by registering their ownership.                                        \n  \u2022The provisions governing our shareholders\u2019 right to call a special meeting strike a balance between      \n  protecting the interests of all shareholders, large and small, and avoiding a waste of resources to       \n  address narrowly supported interests.                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \nThe right of JPMorgan Chase shareholders holding in\nthe aggregate 20% or more of the Firm\u2019s common stock\nto call a special meeting exemplifies the Firm\u2019s\nongoing commitment to strong corporate governance\npractices that are designed to enable meaningful\nshareholder engagement and promote long-term\nshareholder value. We believe the Firm\u2019s existing\nspecial meeting provisions are clear and accessible\nby our shareholders. This proposal overcomplicates a\nstraightforward process of transferring shares in an\neffort to allege disenfranchisement of certain\nshareholders. The right to call a special meeting is\nan important shareholder right that complements the\nwide array of opportunities our shareholders have to\nengage with the Board and management, including the\nrights to act by written consent, to proxy access\nand to annually elect directors by majority vote.\nOur Board and management also engage actively with\nshareholders throughout the year, on a wide variety\nof topics, through numerous investor meetings and\n                                                                                                            \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.962023 PROXY STATEMENT                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Table of ContentsSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nconferences and an annual Shareholder Outreach\nProgram that includes shareholders representing\napproximately 50% of the Firm's outstanding common\nstock. The Firm\u2019s current special meeting threshold\nallows a significant number of shareholders who\nshare interest in a common topic to call for\nconsideration of a corporate action. At the same\ntime, the requirement provides important protections\nfor the benefit of all shareholders. Commensurate\nwith their importance, shareholder meetings are\nsignificant events that require dedicated expense\nand attention from the Board, management and other\nFirm employees. Enabling a few large shareholders\nthat together meet a lower ownership threshold to\nmonopolize this right would result in outsized\nattention and resources being devoted to the special\ninterests of a minority, at the expense of the\nFirm\u2019s smaller shareholders. A special meeting\npermits shareholders to engage directly with the\nBoard, discuss applicable shareholder concerns, and\nhold the Board accountable. To permit a few large\nshareholders wishing to call a special meeting to\nleverage shares held in the relative anonymity of\nstreet name would contradict the very point of the\nmeeting. A special meeting gives shareholders the\nability to voice their views directly to the Board\nand management, and it is critical for the Board to\nknow with whom it is engaging in such a setting to\nrespond effectively. Permitting shareholders to call\na special meeting in street name would create\nambiguity and hamper effective dialogue regarding\nshareholder interests. Contrary to the claim of the\nproponent, the manner in which shareholders may call\nfor a special meeting is not ambiguous. The right of\nshareholders of record holding at least 20% of the\noutstanding shares of our common stock to call a\nspecial shareholder meeting is stated plainly in the\nFirm\u2019s By-laws and referenced in this Proxy\nStatement. This Proxy Statement also provides clear\ninformation about the implications of holding shares\nin street name. On pages 108-109 of this Proxy\nStatement, we explain the difference between\nshareholders of record and beneficial owners of\nshares held in street name and describe how shares\nheld under each designation are voted. Registering\nshares in street name is not compulsory, but offers\nshareholders recognized benefits, including the\nconvenience, efficiency and security of working with\na brokerage firm. It is important to note that any\nshareholder wishing to become a shareholder of\nrecord in order to participate in a call for a\nspecial meeting may do so. In the event that any of\nthe Firm\u2019s shareholders who hold shares in street\nname wish to become shareholders of record, they can\ndo so easily by initiating a notice of withdrawal\nwith their brokers requesting the transfer of their\nshares to the Firm\u2019s transfer agent. Once the notice\nprocess has been completed with the shareholder\u2019s\nbroker, it is expected that the registered shares\nwill appear in the shareholder\u2019s transfer agent\naccount on the next business day. There is no\nrequirement that shareholders convert their shares\nto a\n\ndifferent class of stock in order to change from\nstreet name to non-street name. The proponent has\nintroduced substantial and unnecessary complexity to\na straightforward matter. As part of the Firm\u2019s\ncommitment to maintaining robust corporate\ngovernance practices, our current record holder\nstatus requirement and the 20% ownership threshold\nrequired to call a special meeting strike the\nappropriate balance between promoting shareholder\nrights and safeguarding the interests of all\nshareholders. Our approach to these important\nshareholder rights is part of the Firm\u2019s strong\ncorporate governance practices, which include\nproviding shareholders with opportunities to engage\nmeaningfully with the Board and management. The\nBoard does not believe that any aspect of this\nproposal will further shareholder interests.\n                                       \n  The Board of Directors recommends a  \n  voteAGAINSTthis proposal.            \n                                       \n                                                                                                            \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT97JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Table of ContentsSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nPROPOSAL 9 \u2014 REPORT ON CLIMATE TRANSITION PLANNING\n\nAs You Sow, on behalf of Catherine Raphael, has\nadvised us that it intends to introduce the\nfollowing resolution: RESOLVED: Shareholders request\nthat JP Morgan Chase issue a report disclosing a\ntransition plan that describes how it intends to\nalign its financing activities with its 2030\nsectoral greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets,\nincluding the specific measures and policies\nnecessary to achieve its targets, the reductions to\nbe achieved by such measures and policies, and\ntimelines for implementation and associated emission\nreductions. WHEREAS: The banking sector has a\ncritical role to play in achieving global Net Zero\nby 2050 goals. The Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA)\nnotes that 40 percent of global banking assets have\ncommitted to aligning lending and investment\nportfolios with Net Zero by 2050. 1 But targets\nalone are insufficient. Investors seek disclosures\ndemonstrating banks' concrete transition strategies\nto credibly achieve their disclosed emission\nreduction targets. The United Nations has\nrecommended that financial institution transition\nplans demonstrate how all parts of the business\nalign with interim targets and long-term net zero\ntargets. 2 Other guidelines exist to help financial\ninstitutions operationalize and translate net zero\ncommitments into strategies \"with specific\nobjectives ... against which progress can be\nassessed.\" 3,4 JP Morgan Chase is the largest global\nfunder of fossil fuels, with nearly $62 billion in\nfossil fuel financing in 2021, and $382 billion\nbetween 2016 through 2021. 5 Recognizing the need\nfor action and the importance of achieving global\n1.5\u00b0C climate goals, Chase is a member of NZBA. In\nOctober 2021, Chase announced a Net Zero by 2050\ngreenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reduction goal; it\nalso set 2030 intensity reduction targets for its\noil and gas, electric power, and auto manufacturing\nemissions. Chase states that it will implement these\ntargets by assessing client's emissions and\ndecarbonization plans when considering new\ntransactions; by supporting clients with capital and\nexpertise, strategic advice, connectivity to bank\nproducts and solutions, and sustainable investing;\nand facilitating approximately $1 trillion through\n2030 to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy. 6,7 Chase has also committed to integrate\nclimate into its risk management framework. 8 These\nare important first steps. But Chase cannot stop\nthere. Shareholders are concerned that Chase does\nnot demonstrate a concrete transition plan for\nachieving its 2030 sectoral reductions targets. An\neffective transition plan creates\n\naccountability by describing the policies,\nindicators, milestones, metrics, and timelines to\ndeliver on its 2030 decarbonization targets and\nensure investors that it is fully accountable for\nthe risks associated with its financing of high-\ncarbon activities. Currently, Chase has not\ndemonstrated whether its planned actions will result\nin 1.5 degree aligned emissions reductions. The\ndisclosures requested in this proposal will help\nassure investors that Chase has an effective and\naccountable transition plan in place for achieving\nits 2030 intensity goals.

The Firm continues to\nsupport our clients\u2019 development of long-term\nbusiness strategies, emission reduction plans, and\ncarbon disclosures consistent with those objectives.\nIn 2021, we published portfolio-level emissions\nintensity reduction targets for Oil & Gas, Electric\nPower and Auto Manufacturing sectors, and in 2022,\nwe published 2030 portfolio-level emissions\nintensity reduction targets for three new sectors \u2013\nIron & Steel, Cement and Aviation. Our new targets\nare intended to align to the International Energy\nAgency\u2019s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. The\naggregate of these six sectors account for the\nmajority of global emissions across the supply and\ndemand side value chains of the global energy\nsystem. Further, we have established the Firm's\nCenter for Carbon Transition (\"CCT\") as the Firm\u2019s\ncenter of excellence to provide clients globally\nwith cutting edge low-carbon transition focused\nadvisory and expertise. Since then, the CCT\npublished JPMorgan Chase & Co\u2019s Carbon Compass SM\n(2021) and launched the Carbon Assessment Framework,\nwhich enables us to bring a climate lens to the way\nwe make financing decisions in the six sectors\ncovered by our climate targets. We use a\nquantitative and qualitative assessment of our\nclients\u2019 emissions and decarbonization plans to\nprovide scores that become one element of our\ntransaction-level decision-making for in-scope\nclients. This approach, which now applies to both\nlending and capital markets activity, enables us to\nassess how an in-scope transaction may affect\nprogress toward our portfolio-level targets. In\naddition, the Firm has set a target to finance and\nfacilitate $1 trillion toward green initiatives,\nincluding supporting activities which advance\nclimate action (such as renewable energy, clean\ntechnology and sustainable transportation) and other\nenvironmental objectives. We have disclosed details\nabout our approach, including specific targets,\nmeasurement tools, and quantified progress towards\nour targets. The Firm\u2019s 2022 Climate Report 9 ,\ninformed by recommendations of the Task Force for\nClimate Related Financial Disclosures, outlines the\nmeasures we are taking to address the climate\nchallenge across our business against the backdrop\nof global energy shortages. The report provides\ndetails on how we are responding to climate risks\nand opportunities, including helping clients meet\ntheir objectives and our evolving strategies and\nprograms to support the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy. It also provides updates on how we are\nmeasuring and making progress towards previously\nestablished targets for the Oil & Gas, Electric\nPower and Automotive Manufacturing sectors and\nannounces 2030 emissions intensity reduction targets\nfor three new sectors. The report also describes the\nFirm\u2019s approach to climate-related risk management.\nWe recognize that, as a global financial\ninstitution, our clients, operations and business\n\nstrategy may be impacted by climate change \u2014 either\nfrom the transition to a low-carbon economy\n(transition risk) or through the changing climate\nitself (physical risk). We have developed a climate\nrisk framework to assess the ways in which these\nclimate risks may impact each of our four risk types\n(strategic, credit & investment, market and\noperational). This framework is designed to enable\nassessment, quantification and management of the\nclimate risks that may manifest across our diverse\nglobal footprint. We believe the actions we are\ntaking today will position us well to make\nappropriate progress toward our targets in the years\nahead. We have previously indicated our belief that\nsuch progress will not be linear, as it will take\ntime to implement effective and innovative solutions\nwhile also continuing to promote energy security and\nmeet important economic and societal needs around\nthe world. We have also consistently noted that our\nclimate ambitions are subject to important\nprerequisites and considerations, both within and\noutside of our control, including the necessity of\ntechnological advancements, the evolution of\nconsumer behavior and demand, and the need for\nthoughtful climate policies \u2014 as well as the\npotential impact of legal and regulatory obligations\nand the challenge of balancing our commitment to\nshort-term targets with the need to facilitate\nenergy security. The detail required in the proposal\ndoes not give appropriate weight to these realities\nand the potential need to adjust course as\ncircumstances may merit. Shareholder feedback is an\nimportant consideration for management. In 2022, we\nsolicited feedback through 172 engagements with 118\nshareholders, which represented approximately 49% of\nthe Firm\u2019s outstanding common stock, and hosted two\nESG events, which gave shareholders access to the\nFirm's senior leaders. The insights gained from\nthese engagements helped to inform the Firm's\napproach to climate change, considerations for\nenergy security and our work with clients to support\nthe transition. We believe our Climate Report\nprovides shareholders with appropriate and\nmeaningful information, including details about\nmanagement\u2019s approach to climate risk management,\nthe Firm\u2019s existing efforts to help address climate\nchange, and extensive disclosure of our strategies\nand progress. The requested report would prescribe\nthe content of our climate-related communications\nand would not necessarily be in the interests of\nlong-term shareholder value.\n                                       \n  The Board of Directors recommends a  \n  voteAGAINSTthis proposal.            \n                                       \n9 https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-chase-and-co/documents/Climate-Report-2022.pdf\n                                                                                                            \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT99JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Table of ContentsSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nPROPOSAL 10 \u2013 REPORT ON ENSURING RESPECT FOR CIVIL\nLIBERTIES\n\nDavid Bahnsen has advised us that he intends to\nintroduce the following resolution: Supporting\nStatement: Companies that provide banking or\nfinancial services are essential pillars of the\nmarketplace. Because of their unique and pivotal\nrole in America\u2019s economy, many federal and state\nlaws already prohibit them from discriminating when\nproviding financial services to the public. And the\nUN Declaration of Human Rights, consistent with many\nother laws and the U.S. Constitution, recognizes\nthat \u201ceveryone has the right to freedom of thought,\nconscience, and religion.\u201d 1 Financial institutions\nshould respect these freedoms. As shareholders of\nJPMorgan Chase & Co., (\u201cJPMC\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d) we\nbelieve it is of great import that the Company\nrespect civil rights by identifying potential\nfactors that may contribute to discrimination in the\nprovision of services based on race, color,\nreligion, sex, national origin, or social,\npolitical, or religious views. We are particularly\nconcerned about recent evidence of religious and\npolitical discrimination by companies in the\nfinancial services industry, as detailed in the\nStatement on Debanking and Free Speech. 2 When\ncompanies engage in this kind of discrimination,\nthey hinder the ability of individuals, groups, and\nbusinesses to access and equally participate in the\nmarketplace and instead skew it to their own ends.\nThe Statement on Debanking and Free Speech\nidentified many companies in the financial services\nindustry that frequently include vague and\nsubjective standards in their policies like \u201chate\nspeech\u201d or promoting \u201cintolerance\u201d that allow\nemployees to deny or restrict service for arbitrary\nor discriminatory reasons. The 2022 edition of the\nViewpoint Diversity Business Index 3 also identified\nnumerous examples of this in many companies\u2019 terms\nof service. The inclusion of vague and arbitrary\nterms risks impacting clients\u2019 exercise of their\nconstitutionally protected civil rights, by creating\nthe potential that such persons or groups will be\ndenied access to essential services as a consequence\nof their speech or political activity. Moreover,\nthey risk giving fringe activists and governments a\nfoothold to demand that private financial\ninstitutions deny service under the sweeping,\nunfettered discretion that such policies provide.\nThese actions and policies are an affront to public\ntrust, destabilize the market, and threaten the\nability of American citizens to live freely and do\nbusiness according to their deeply held convictions.\nJPMC also maintains that it promotes good social\npolicy and diversity, equity, and inclusion\npractices. 4 It is important for the shareholders to\nknow that the Company is adhering to its own\nstandards by serving diverse consumers without\nregard to their beliefs or other factors above.\n\nResolved: Shareholders request the Board of\nDirectors of JPMorgan Chase & Co. conduct an\nevaluation and issue a report within the next year,\nat reasonable cost and excluding proprietary\ninformation and disclosure of anything that would\nconstitute an admission of pending litigation,\nevaluating how it oversees risks related to\ndiscrimination against individuals based on their\nrace, color, religion (including religious views),\nsex, national origin, or political views, and\nwhether such discrimination may impact individuals\u2019\nexercise of their constitutionally protected civil\nrights. BOARD RESPONSE TO PROPOSAL 10 The Board of\nDirectors recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST\nthis proposal for the following reasons:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u2022We believe the requested report is based on allegations that are not true. It is not our policy to       \n  debank people because of their political views or religious affiliation. We believe the Firm has a        \n  strong corporate culture that values diversity of backgrounds, ideas and experience and effectively       \n  works to prevent discrimination.                                                                          \n  \u2022The Firm has in place anti-discrimination policies that are intended to promote equal opportunity and    \n  prevent discrimination and harassment.                                                                    \n  \u2022The maintenance of accounts is subject to extensive applicable law and regulation. Adherence to these    \n  obligations may, under certain circumstances, require account closures. It is not our policy to debank    \n  people because of their political views or religious affiliation.                                         \n                                                                                                            \nWe believe the requested report is based on\nallegations that are not true. It is not our policy\nto debank people because of their political views,\nideas or religious affiliation. JPMorgan Chase is\nworking to support a diverse and inclusive culture\nfor our employees and our business, and the Firm has\nkey policies in place intended to prevent\ndiscrimination.

and\n\n\u2022 Environmental, social, and corporate governance\n(\u201cESG\u201d). 1\n\nHowever, Chase\u2019s political expenditures appear to\nbe misaligned with its public statements on\ncompany values, views, and operational practices.\n\nFor example, Chase states that its employee\nPolitical Action Committee (PAC) \u201csupport(s)\ncandidates, parties and committees whose views on\nspecific issues are consistent with the Firm\u2019s\npriorities,\u201d 2 but it has contributed hundreds of\nthousands of dollars to state and federal\nlawmakers with extreme anti- LGBTQ+ voting\nrecords. 3 Likewise, Chase has extensively\ncontributed to sponsors of legislation that\nrestricts access to reproductive healthcare. 4\nChase\u2019s support for these lawmakers come despite\nits warning that \u201ccandidates who advance positions\nor exhibit behaviors that are in conflict with the\nFirm\u2019s ethos may be ineligible for PAC donations.\u201d\n5\n\nChase also trumpets its commitment to \u201csupporting\nthe transition to a low-carbon economy,\u201d 6 yet\nfunds industry associations like the Chamber of\nCommerce and the Business Roundtable that oppose\nmeaningful climate action. 7 Similarly, while\nChase claims that supporting ESG is a core tenet\nof its political engagement, Chase sponsors the\nState Financial Officers Foundation (\u201cSFOF\u201d), an\norganization that works to prevent investor\nconsideration of climate risk and other ESG\nfactors, despite a recent pledge to end its\nsponsorship of this controversial group. 8 SFOF\nhas, in turn, promoted anti-ESG investigations\ndirectly targeting Chase and its ability to\nconduct business with certain states. 9\n\nFinally, while Chase claims to support voting\nrights, 10 it is among the top corporate\ncontributors to sponsors of anti-voting\nlegislation. 11\n\nRESOLVED: Shareholders request the Board publish a\nreport, at reasonable expense, analyzing the\ncongruence of Chase\u2019s political and electioneering\nexpenditures during the preceding year against\nChase\u2019s publicly stated company values and\npolicies; listing and explaining any instances of\nincongruent expenditures; and stating whether the\ncompany has made, or plans to make, changes in\ncontributions or communications to candidates as a\nresult of identified incongruencies.\n\nSUPPORTING STATEMENT: Shareholders recommend, at\nBoard and management discretion, that the report\ninclude an analysis of risks to the Company brand,\nreputation, or shareholder value associated with\nexpenditures in conflict with its publicly stated\nvalues.\n\nAs used in this resolution, \u201cpolitical and\nelectioneering expenditures\u201d means spending, from\ncorporate treasury and from any associated PACs,\ndirectly or through a third party, at any time\nduring the year, which are either direct lobbying\nexpenditures or which are reasonably susceptible\nto interpretation as being in support of or in\nopposition to a specific candidate, piece of\nlegislation, or regulation, including payments\nmade pursuant to membership in trade associations\nor politically active nonprofits.\n\n1 https://www.Chaseorganchase.com/about/governance\n/political-engagement-and-public-policy\n\n2 Ibid\n\n3 https://popular.info/p/corporate-pride-\npolitical-donations?s= r\n\n4 https://www.businessinsider.com/wall-street-\nfinance-anti-abortion-lawmakers-2022-5\n\n5 https://www.Chaseorganchase.com/about/governance\n/political-engagement-and-public-policy\n\n6 https://www.Chaseorganchase.com/impact/sustainab\nility\n\n7 https://www.Chaseorganchase.com/content/dam/Chas\nec/Chaseorgan-chase-and-\nco/documents/2021-political-engagment- report-\nfinal.pdf;

The Firm seeks to engage on core       \n  business issues and policy initiatives that we believe advance and protect the long-term interests of     \n  the Firm and our stakeholders and we make our own independent decisions on each issue.                    \n  \u2022In March 2022, JPMorgan Chase updated its Political Engagement and Public Policy (\u201cPEPP\u201d) Statement,     \n  committing to review for substantial misalignment in the Firm\u2019s values and organizational priorities and  \n  recipients of political contributions from our employee PACs in our annual Political Engagement Reports.  \n  \u2022Effective governance and transparency are important components of our approach to political engagement.  \n  Our political activities, as well as our lobbying and governance and oversight practices, are described   \n  in detail on the PEPP Statement page of our website, which provides extensive information, including      \n  links to five years of Political Engagement Reports that detail the specific amounts contributed to       \n  individuals, ballot initiatives, organizations and state and federal lobbying.                            \n  \u2022JPMorgan Chase has long been recognized as a leader in corporate political transparency and              \n  accountability.  Since 2019, our policies and practices have consistently earned a score of 97.1 out of   \n  100 in the Center for Political Accountability (CPA)-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and  \n  Accountability.                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \nJPMorgan Chase believes that responsible corporate citizenship demands a strong commitment to a healthy and\ninformed democracy through civic and community involvement. Our business is subject to extensive laws and\nregulations, and changes to such laws can significantly affect how we operate, our revenues and the costs we\nincur. Because of the impact public policy can have on our businesses, employees, communities and customers,\nwe engage with policymakers holding a range of views, on a range of issues to advance and protect the long-\nterm interests of the Firm. Governance and transparency are important components of our approach and are\npart of our framework for engagement in the political process. Managed by the Firm\u2019s Government Relations\nand Public Policy (\u201cGRPP\u201d) team, our employee PACs are funded entirely by voluntary contributions from\neligible employees.\n\nContributions are made on a bipartisan basis to support candidates, parties and committees whose views on\nspecific issues are consistent with the Firm\u2019s priorities, prioritizing candidates who represent communities\nwe serve and demonstrate support for policies of importance to the Firm. Our policies prohibit the use of\ncorporate funds to contribute to candidates, political party committees and PACs. The Firm does not use\ncorporate funds to make independent political expenditures or electioneering communications and we restrict\ntrade associations from using our membership dues for any such election-related activity. We acknowledge\nconcerns have been expressed by some investors and stakeholders about the potential for misalignments\nbetween our Firm\u2019s values and priorities and the recipients of our political contributions. To address these\nconcerns, on March 29, 2022, JPMorgan Chase updated its PEPP Statement to state: \u201cIn the event of a\nsubstantial misalignment with the company\u2019s values and organizational priorities and the recipients of\npolitical contributions, we would disclose such misalignment with information about our response in our\nannual Political Engagement Report.\u201d PAC disbursement decisions are intended to reflect areas of common\ninterest and engagement opportunities with legislators and candidates. Like other corporate PACs, we\nparticipate in a rigorous election-cycle budget process designed to identify and support the election\nefforts of legislators and candidates who support core business issues and policy initiatives that we\nbelieve advance and protect the long-term interests of the Firm. Legislators address a wide range of complex\nissues, and we recognize that we will not align with all positions of legislators. We take a bipartisan\napproach to our PAC disbursements and closely monitor disbursement ratios. No single criterion or policy\ndetermines a candidate's eligibility for PAC contribution; however, candidates whose positions substantially\nmisalign with the Firm's views on issues of importance to the Firm may be ineligible for PAC donations. The\nJPMC PAC governance structure allows for pauses in political support. However, we do not believe permanently\nsevering relationships serves the best interests of the Firm and our stakeholders. GRPP reviews recipients\non an ongoing basis for actions inconsistent with the Firm\u2019s values and also reviews candidate-giving at the\nbeginning of every election cycle. Further, the Firm belongs to a number of trade associations that advocate\non major public policy issues of importance to the Firm and the communities we serve. The Firm's\nparticipation in these associations comes with the understanding that we may not always align with all of\ntheir positions or those of its other members. We are committed to independent decision-making at the Firm\nand providing appropriate feedback on the efforts by these associations.\n                                                                                                            \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT103JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Table of ContentsSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm evaluates membership with trade\nassociations on an annual basis, while recognizing\nthat these organizations may engage in legislative\nand policy priorities that extend beyond the scope\nof core financial services and banking issues. Any\nchange of our principal trade associations will be\nreflected on our annual Political Engagement Report.\nJPMorgan Chase has long been recognized as a leader\nin corporate political transparency and\naccountability. Since 2019, our policies and\npractices have consistently earned a score of 97.1\nout of 100 in the Center for Political\nAccountability (CPA)-Zicklin Index of Corporate\nPolitical Disclosure and Accountability, which ranks\nthe political spending disclosure of S&P 500\ncompanies, meriting JPMorgan Chase \u201cTrendsetter\u201d\nstatus for corporate political disclosure since\n2015. Our political engagement and lobbying\nactivities, as well as our governance and oversight\npractices, are described in detail on the PEPP page,\nincluding links to five years of Political\nEngagement Reports, setting forth for each year: \u2022\nAll contributions made by our employee PACs, \u2022 Any\ncorporate payment made to support or oppose a ballot\ninitiative, \u2022 Information about our state lobbying\nactivity, \u2022 Detailed information about JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s federal lobbying disclosures, including\nthree years of lobbying expenditures and the key\nsubjects on which we lobby, and \u2022 The principal\ntrade associations to which we belong and the\naggregate value of our membership payments to such\norganizations attributable to lobbying.

These targets should\nbe aligned with a science-based net zero pathway and\nin addition to any emission intensity targets for\nthese sectors that JPMorgan has or will set.\nSupporting Statement: The Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change (IPCC) has advised that greenhouse\ngas (GHG) emissions must be halved by 2030 and reach\nnet zero by 2050 to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. 1\nEvery incremental increase in temperature above\n1.5\u00b0C will entail increasingly severe physical,\ntransition, and systemic risks to companies,\ninvestors, the markets, and the economy as a whole.\nClimate change mitigation is therefore critical to\naddress investment risks in order to avert the large\neconomic losses projected to occur if insufficient\naction is taken. According to the International\nEnergy Agency, transformation of the Oil and Gas and\nPower Generation sectors are critical to reaching\nthe global goal of keeping temperature rise below\n1.5\u00b0C, and are therefore significant to JPMorgan\u2019s\nclimate-risk mitigation strategy. JPMorgan should\nadopt absolute emission targets in these sectors to\nprotect the Company and its long-term investors.\nThough JPMorgan has a commitment to reach net zero\nemissions by 2050 and a target to reduce GHG\nemissions intensity of the Oil & Gas and Power\nsectors by 2030, it does not yet have a science-\nbased 2030 target to reduce these GHG emissions on\nan absolute basis. Intensity targets will measure\nthe reduction in emissions per unit or per dollar,\nhowever, by definition, they will not capture\nwhether JPMorgan\u2019s total financed GHG emissions have\ndecreased in the real world. Rather, we believe\nJPMorgan should consider target-setting approaches\nused by advisory groups such as the Science Based\nTargets initiative. Such an absolute reduction\ntarget aligned with a science-based net zero\nemissions pathway is critical for the Company to\nachieve its net-zero commitment and more fully\naddress its climate risks. JPMorgan trails its peers\nin setting absolute GHG emissions reduction targets.\nCitigroup has committed to reducing its absolute\nemissions for the energy sector by 29% by 2030,\nstating \u201cabsolute reduction is required to meet net\nzero goals and is the most transparent target\nselection.\u201d 2 Wells Fargo has set a target to reduce\nabsolute emissions for the oil and gas sector by 26%\nby 2030. Other banks setting absolute reduction\ngoals for the oil and gas sector include HSBC (34%),\nSo\n\nci\u00e9t\u00e9 Generale (30%), BBVA (30%), and Deutsche Bank\n(23%). By setting absolute targets in addition to\nits intensity targets in the energy sector, the\nCompany can ensure it is moving toward its stated\ncommitments and real-economy emissions reductions.\nWe urge you to vote FOR this proposal. BOARD\nRESPONSE TO PROPOSAL 12 The Board of Directors\nrecommends that shareholders vote AGAINST this\nproposal for the following reasons:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u2022The Firm supports the goals of providing secure, reliable, affordable energy while promoting clean       \n  energy solutions and strategies to reduce the world's carbon footprint.

In 2022, the Firm\nestablished three new sectoral goals \u2013 Iron & Steel,\nCement and Aviation.\n\n1 https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/\n\n2 taskforce-on-climate-related-financial-\ndisclosures-report-2021.pdf (citigroup.com)\n                                                                                                            \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT105JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Table of ContentsSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nIn setting greenhouse gas emission targets for\nfinanced emissions in the Oil & Gas and Electric\nPower sectors, among others, management considered\nthe interests of all our stakeholders; the goals of\nproviding secure, reliable, affordable energy while\npromoting clean energy solutions and strategies to\nreduce the world's footprint; and selected carbon\nintensity targets for important strategic and\npractical reasons. Carbon intensity is a widely used\nmetric that assesses the carbon efficiency of a\ncompany through the ratio of greenhouse emissions to\neconomic output (e.g., oil barrels produced or\nkilowatt hours of electricity generated). In\ncontrast, absolute targets refer to the volume of\nemissions attributable to a particular company,\nwithout providing context on the company's size or\neconomic output. At this time, we believe carbon\nintensity targets better optimizes the interest of\nall stakeholders and interrelated climate and energy\nconsiderations. Carbon intensity targets also better\nbalance accelerating emission reductions with\nfostering economic growth, as they measure a\ncompany\u2019s ability to do more with less, and more\neffectively consider energy security imperatives. We\nbelieve our approach to climate, including the use\nof intensity targets, appropriately takes into\naccount global realities and sensibly balances the\naim of emissions reduction and energy security by\nincentivizing reductions over time consistent with\nthe availability of alternatives to fossil fuels. We\nalso consider carbon intensity to be the most\ndecision-useful metric for our targets right now.\nCarbon intensity metrics allow us to continue more\nmeaningful engagement with clients and support their\ntransition efforts, including providing advice and\ncapital toward solutions that responsibly meet\nenergy needs and support economic growth while\nreflecting progress in transitioning to lower carbon\nbusinesses and products. Carbon intensity targets\nalso enable the Firm to make easier comparisons\nacross a portfolio of companies of different sizes\nwithin a sector, and for a single company across\ntime as it grows or shrinks in size. We continue to\nevaluate the comparative strengths and advantages of\nboth absolute and intensity-based metrics. While\nadoption of absolute targets could have the apparent\nbenefit of reducing financed emissions more quickly\non paper, they could also risk disincentivizing some\ncritical short term economic activity and simply\ntransfer some carbon intensive banking activity and\nassociated emissions elsewhere. The proposal for the\nFirm to commit to absolute targets over and above\nthe existing set of intensity targets is also not\npractical. Multiplying the number and type of\ntargets for Oil & Gas and Electric Power would\nincrease the cost and complexity of monitoring and\nreporting to shareholders and stakeholders on\nclimate progress, while progress and client\nengagement is well underway with regard to carbon\nintensity targets.\n\nHowever, we do recognize that global achievement of\nnet zero will necessitate absolute emissions\nreductions, and that absolute-based metrics are an\narea of interest for many of our stakeholders and\nhave a role to play in how we understand the impact\nof our emissions reduction efforts. That is why we\nhave stated that we intend to share more details in\n2023 on our approach to absolute-based metrics,\nincluding disclosure of absolute financed emissions\nin key sectors of our financing portfolio. We\nbelieve the actions we are taking today will\nposition us well to make appropriate progress toward\nour targets in the years ahead. We have previously\nindicated our belief that such progress will not be\nlinear, as it will take time to implement effective\nand innovative solutions while also continuing to\npromote energy security and meet important economic\nand societal needs around the world. We have also\nconsistently noted that our climate ambitions are\nsubject to important prerequisites and\nconsiderations, both within and outside of our\ncontrol, including the necessity of technological\nadvancements, the evolution of consumer behavior and\ndemand, and the need for thoughtful climate policies\n\u2014 as well as the potential impact of legal and\nregulatory obligations and the challenge of\nbalancing our commitment to short-term targets with\nthe need to facilitate energy security. Shareholder\nfeedback is an important consideration for\nmanagement. In 2022, we solicited feedback through\n172 engagements with 118 shareholders, which\nrepresented approximately 49% of the Firm\u2019s\noutstanding common stock, and hosted two ESG events,\nwhich gave shareholders access to the Firm's senior\nleaders. The insights gained from these engagements\nhelped to inform the Firm's approach to climate\nchange, considerations for energy security and our\nwork with clients to support the transition. We\nbelieve management is best positioned to decide the\ndetails of the Firm's climate initiatives, including\nthe optimal format of targets, as an important part\nof conducting our day-to-day business in the\ninterests of our shareholders. Management has\nconsidered the carbon metrics \u2013 both intensity and\nabsolute \u2013 of our financing portfolio, in light of\nthe identified considerations and has analyzed the\nfit between choice of targets and business strategy\nof supporting clients during the low-carbon\ntransition. The Firm has made a considered decision\nat this time to maintain carbon intensity reduction\ntargets as the best tool to support clients in\ntransition and contribute to real world emission\nreductions, and we have reported extensively on our\napproach and our progress. The requested report\nwould interfere with management\u2019s ability to pursue\nits strategy, monitor and respond to developments,\nand is not in the interests of long-term shareholder\nvalue.\n                                       \n  The Board of Directors recommends a  \n  voteAGAINSTthis proposal.            \n                                       \n                                                                                                            \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.1062023 PROXY STATEMENT                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                                    \n  INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL SHAREHOLDER MEETING  \n                                                    \nInformation About the Annual Shareholder Meeting\n\nGeneral\n\nWHY AM I RECEIVING THESE MATERIALS?

In addition, the proxies may\ndetermine in their discretion how to vote your\nshares regarding any other matters properly\npresented for a vote at our annual meeting.\n\nAlthough our Board does not anticipate that any of\nthe director nominees will be unable to stand for\nelection as a director nominee at our annual\nmeeting, if this occurs, the persons named as\nproxies on the proxy card will vote your shares in\nfavor of such other person or persons as may be\nrecommended by our Governance Committee and\ndesignated by the Board.\n                                                                                                            \n  JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.1082023 PROXY STATEMENT                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                                    \n  INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL SHAREHOLDER MEETING  \n                                                    \nBeneficial Owner of Shares Held in Street Name: If\nyou are a beneficial owner of shares held in street\nname and the organization holding your shares does\nnot receive specific voting instructions from you,\nhow your shares may be voted will depend on whether\nthe proposal is considered \u201croutine\u201d or \u201cnon-\nroutine\u201d, as described below.\n\nParticipants in the 401(k) Savings Plan: The trustee\nof the JPMorgan Chase 401(k) Savings Plan (\u201cPlan\u201d)\nwill vote the shares held in the Common Stock Fund\nas of the Record Date. If you have an interest in\nthe JPMorgan Chase Common Stock Fund through the\nPlan, your vote will provide voting instructions to\nthe trustee. If no voting instructions are given,\nthe trustee will vote uninstructed shares in the\nsame proportion as voted shares.\n\nWHICH PROPOSALS ARE CONSIDERED \u201cROUTINE\u201d OR \u201cNON-\nROUTINE\u201d?\n\nThe ratification of the appointment of the\nindependent registered public accounting firm is\nconsidered to be a \u201croutine\u201d matter under NYSE\nrules. A bank, brokerage firm, broker-dealer or\nother similar organization may generally vote in\ntheir discretion on routine matters, if specific\nvoting instructions are not received from a\nbeneficial owner.\n\nAll other proposals are considered \u201cnon-routine\u201d\nunder NYSE rules and are therefore \u201cnon-\ndiscretionary\u201d matters. This\n\nmeans your bank, brokerage firm, broker-dealer or\nother similar organization may not vote your shares\nwithout instructions from you. If the organization\nthat holds your shares does not receive instructions\nfrom you on how to vote on one of these non-routine\nmatters, it will so inform the inspector of\nelection. This is generally referred to as a \u201cbroker\nnon-vote.\u201d\n\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOLDING SHARES AS A\nSHAREHOLDER OF RECORD AND AS A BENEFICIAL OWNER OF\nSHARES HELD IN STREET NAME?\n\nShareholder of Record: If your shares of JPMorgan\nChase common stock are registered directly in your\nname with our transfer agent, Computershare, you are\nconsidered a \u201cshareholder of record\u201d of those\nshares.\n\nBeneficial Owner of Shares Held in Street Name: If\nyour shares are held in an account at a bank,\nbrokerage firm, broker-dealer or other similar\norganization, you are a beneficial owner of shares\nheld in street name. In that case, you will have\nreceived these proxy materials, as well as a voting\ninstruction form, from the organization holding your\nshares and, as a beneficial owner, you have the\nright to direct the organization as to how to vote\nthem. Most individual shareholders are beneficial\nowners of shares held in street name.\n\nWHAT IS THE VOTING REQUIREMENT TO APPROVE EACH OF\nTHE PROPOSALS?\n\nQuorum Requirement: Before any business can be\ntransacted at our annual meeting, a quorum must be\npresent. Holders of a majority of the shares\nentitled to vote at the annual meeting, present at\nthe meeting or represented by proxy, will constitute\na quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes are\ntreated as present for quorum purposes.\n\nRequirements for each proposal: What is the voting\nrequirement for each proposal?\n                                                                                                            \n  Proposal             Voting options        Vote requirement      Effect of            Effect of broker    \n                                                                   abstentions1         non-votes2          \n  Corporate                                                                                                 \n  Governance:                                                                                               \n                       FOR, AGAINST or       Majority of the       No effect \u2014 not      No effect \u2014 broker  \n  \u2013 Election of        ABSTAIN (for each     votes cast FOR or     counted as a vote    non-votes are not   \n  Directors3           director nominee)     AGAINST (for each     cast                 permitted           \n                                             director nominee)                                              \n  Executive                                                                                                 \n  Compensation:                                                                                             \n                                             Majority of the                            No effect \u2014 broker  \n  \u2013 Advisory vote      FOR, AGAINST or       shares present or     Counts as a vote     non-votes are not   \n  on compensation4     ABSTAIN               represented by\u00a0       AGAINST              permitted           \n                                             proxy                                                          \n                                                                   Counts as a vote                         \n  \u2013 Advisory vote                            Majority of the       AGAINST each                             \n  on frequency of      ONE YEAR, TWO         shares present or     frequency            No effect \u2014 broker  \n  advisory             YEARS , THREE         represented by\u00a0       (treated as not      non-votes are not   \n  vote on              YEARS or ABSTAIN      proxy                 expressing           permitted           \n  compensation5                                                    frequency                                \n                                                                   preference)                              \n  Audit Matters:                                                                                            \n                                                                                        N/A \u2014 the           \n  Ratification of                            Majority of the                            organization that   \n  Independent          FOR, AGAINST or       shares present or     Counts as a vote     holds shares of     \n  Auditor              ABSTAIN               represented by\u00a0       AGAINST              beneficial owners   \n                                             proxy                                      may vote in their   \n                                                                                        discretion          \n  Shareholder                                                                                               \n  Proposals:                                                                                                \n  Voting                                     Majority of the                            No effect \u2014 broker  \n  requirements for     FOR, AGAINST or       shares present or     Counts as a vote     non-votes are not   \n  each proposal        ABSTAIN               represented by\u00a0       AGAINST              permitted           \n  are the same                               proxy                                                          \n                                                                                                            \n1 For election of directors, abstentions have no effect because the required vote is determined as follows:\nvotes FOR divided by the sum of votes FOR plus votes AGAINST.

Unless the Board decides to reject the offer or to postpone the effective date, the\nresignation shall become effective 45 days after the date of the election.\n\n4 The result of the advisory vote on compensation is not binding on the Board, whether or not the resolution\nis passed under the standard described above.\n\n5 The result of the advisory vote on frequency of advisory vote on compensation is not binding on the Board.\n                                                                                                            \n  2023 PROXY STATEMENT109JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nTable of Contents\n                                                    \n  INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL SHAREHOLDER MEETING  \n                                                    \nIS MY VOTE CONFIDENTIAL?\n\nProxy instructions, ballots and voting tabulations\nthat identify individual shareholders are handled in\na manner that protects your voting privacy. JPMorgan\nChase will not disclose the proxy instructions or\nballots of individual shareholders except to those\nrecording the vote, or as may be required in\naccordance with appropriate legal process, or as\nauthorized by the shareholder.\n\nCOULD OTHER MATTERS BE DECIDED AT THE 2023 ANNUAL\nMEETING?\n\nWe do not know of any matters that will be\nconsidered at the annual meeting other than those\ndescribed above. If a shareholder proposal that was\nproperly excluded from this proxy statement or is\notherwise not properly presented at the meeting is\nnevertheless brought before the meeting, the Chair\nwill declare such a proposal out of order, and it\nwill be disregarded. If any other matters arise at\nthe annual meeting that are properly presented at\nthe meeting, the proxies will be voted at the\ndiscretion of the proxy holders.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS IF THE MEETING IS POSTPONED OR\nADJOURNED?\n\nYour proxy will still be good and may be voted at\nthe postponed or adjourned meeting. You will still\nbe able to change or revoke your proxy until it is\nvoted.\n\nWHO COUNTS THE VOTES CAST AT OUR ANNUAL MEETING?\n\nRepresentatives of Broadridge Financial Solutions,\nInc. will tabulate the votes cast at our annual\nmeeting, and American Election Services, LLC will\nact as the independent inspector of election.\n\nWHERE CAN I FIND THE VOTING RESULTS OF OUR ANNUAL\nMEETING?\n\nWe expect to announce the preliminary voting results\nat our annual meeting. The final voting results will\nbe reported on a Current Report on Form 8-K that\nwill be filed with the SEC and be available on our\nwebsite.\n\nWHO IS PAYING THE COSTS OF THIS PROXY SOLICITATION?\n\nJPMorgan Chase is paying the costs of the\nsolicitation of proxies. JPMorgan Chase has retained\nMacKenzie Partners, Inc. to assist in the\ndistribution of proxy materials and the solicitation\nof proxies from brokerage firms, banks, broker-\ndealers and other similar organizations representing\nbeneficial owners of shares. We have agreed to pay\nMacKenzie Partners a fee of approximately $50,000\nplus reimbursement of certain out-of-pocket\nexpenses.\n\nJPMorgan Chase must also pay brokerage firms, banks,\nbroker-dealers and other similar organizations\nrepresenting beneficial owners certain fees\nassociated with:\n\n\u2022 Forwarding the Notice of Internet Availability to\nbeneficial owners;\n\n\u2022 Forwarding printed proxy materials by mail to\nbeneficial owners who specifically request them; and\n\n\u2022 Obtaining beneficial owners\u2019 voting instructions.\n\nIn addition to solicitations by mail, the persons\nwho will be serving as the proxies and JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s directors, officers and employees may\nsolicit, without additional compensation, proxies on\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s behalf in person, by phone or by\nelectronic communication.\n\nHOW DO I INSPECT THE LIST OF SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD?\n\nA list of shareholders of record as of March 17,\n2023 will be available for inspection during\nordinary business hours at our offices at 383\nMadison Avenue, New York, NY 10179, from May 5,\n2023, to May 15, 2023. Please contact the Office of\nthe Secretary by sending an email to\ncorporate.secretary@jpmchase.com if you wish to\ninspect the list prior to the annual meeting.\n\nInformation about paper and electronic delivery of\nproxy materials\n\nJPMorgan Chase uses the SEC rule commonly known as\n\u201cNotice and Access\u201d that permits companies to\nfurnish proxy materials to our shareholders over the\nInternet. This process enables us to expedite\ndelivery of materials to our shareholders and\nreduces the costs to us of printing and mailing\npaper proxy materials.\n\nIn accordance with the Notice and Access rules, on\nor about April 4, 2023, we sent those current\nshareholders of record on March 17, 2023, the Record\nDate for the annual meeting, a Notice. The Notice\ncontains instructions on how to access our proxy\nstatement and annual report online.

TCE, ROTCE, TBVPS and Pre-tax income ex. LLR are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the\nFirm\u2019s common stockholders\u2019 equity (i.e., total stockholders\u2019 equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and\nidentifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax\nliabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm\u2019s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average\nTCE. TBVPS represents the Firm\u2019s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Pre-tax income\nex. LLR represents income on a managed basis before income tax expense (pre-tax income) excluding the change\nin loan loss reserves. This reflects the exclusion of the portion of the provision for credit losses\nattributable to the change in allowance for credit losses. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as\nwell as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm\u2019s use of equity. Pre-tax income ex. LLR is utilized by\nthe Firm to assess the Firm's operating performance. The following tables provide reconciliations and\ncalculations of these measures for the periods presented.\n\n2. In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results on a\n\"managed\" basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews\nthe results of the lines of business on a \u201cmanaged\u201d basis. The Firm\u2019s definition of managed basis starts, in\neach case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net\nrevenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent basis.\nAccordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the\nmanaged results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow\nmanagement to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt\nsources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax\nexpense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines\nof business.\n\nNon-GAAP reconciliations\n

On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law. The Firm\u2019s results for the year ended December 31,\n2017, included a $2.4 billion decrease to net income, as a result of the enactment of the TCJA, as well as a\nlegal benefit of $406 million (after-tax) related to a settlement with the FDIC receivership for Washington\nMutual and with Deutsche Bank as trustee to certain Washington Mutual trusts. Adjusted net income, adjusted\nROTCE and adjusted earnings per share, which exclude the impact of these significant items, are each non-\nGAAP financial measures. Management believes these measures help investors understand the effect of these\nitems on reported results.\n\nAdditional notes\n\n1.
