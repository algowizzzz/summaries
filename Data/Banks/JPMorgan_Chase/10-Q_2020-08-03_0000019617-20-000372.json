The         \n     increase was driven by downgrades in the wholesale portfolio across          \n     multiple industries on client credit deterioration, and the inclusion of     \n     purchased credit deteriorated loans in the mortgage portfolio, which are     \n     subject to nonaccrual loan treatment following the adoption of CECL.         \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n     Firmwide average loans of $1.0 trillion were up 4%, largely reflecting       \n     drawdowns on committed revolving credit facilities in March and higher loan  \n  \u2022  balances in AWM, as well as loans originated under the Small Business        \n     Administration\u2019s (\u201cSBA\u201d) Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d).

The Firm\u2019s Brexit-related\nplanning in the second half of 2020\nwill focus on the possibility that the\nU.K. will complete its departure from\nthe EU without having agreed the terms\nof their future relationship, which is\ncommonly referred to as \u201chard Brexit,\u201d\nas the July 1, 2020 deadline for the\nU.K. to request an extension of the\ntransition period has passed. This will\nrequire completion of the relocation of\ncertain front office roles from the\nU.K. to EU locations, and finalization\nof the migration of EU clients and\ncertain positions to EU entities by the\nend of 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has\nadded incremental risk to the Firm\u2019s\nBrexit Implementation program due to\nthe potential impact on its ability to\nexecute changes such as relocation of\nemployees given travel restrictions, or\nthe ability of clients to be\noperationally ready to the extent that\nthey have diverted resources during\n2020 to address the effects of the\npandemic.

The CARES Act, which was\nsigned into law on March 27, 2020,\nprovides, among other things, funding\nto support loan facilities to assist\nconsumers and businesses. Set forth\nbelow is a summary as of the date of\nthis Form 10-Q of U.S. government\nactions currently impacting the Firm\nand U.S. government programs in which\nthe Firm is participating to support\nindividuals, businesses, and the\nbroader economy. The Firm will continue\nto assess ongoing developments in\ngovernment actions in response to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. U.S. government\nactions Eligible retained income\ndefinition . On March 17, 2020, the\nOffice of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency (\u201cOCC\u201d), the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System\n(\u201cFederal Reserve\u201d), and the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d),\ncollectively the \u201cfederal banking\nagencies,\u201d issued an interim final rule\nthat revised the definition of\n\u201celigible retained income\u201d in the\nregulatory capital rules that apply to\nall U.S. banking organizations. On\nMarch 23, 2020, the Federal Reserve\nissued an interim final rule that\nrevised the definition of \u201celigible\nretained income\u201d for purposes of the\ntotal loss-absorbing capacity (\u201cTLAC\u201d)\nbuffer requirements that apply to\nglobal systemically important banking\norganizations. The revised definition\nof eligible retained income makes any\nautomatic limitations on payout\ndistributions that could apply under\nthe agencies\u2019 capital rules or TLAC\nrule take effect on a more graduated\nbasis in the event that a banking\norganization\u2019s capital, leverage and\nTLAC ratios were to decline below\nregulatory requirements (including\nbuffers). The March 17, 2020 interim\nfinal rule was issued, in conjunction\nwith an interagency statement\nencouraging banking organizations to\nuse their capital and liquidity\nbuffers, to further support banking\norganizations\u2019 abilities to lend to\nhouseholds and businesses affected by\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. Reserve\nrequirements . On March 26, 2020, the\nFederal Reserve reduced reserve\nrequirement ratios to zero percent,\neffectively eliminating the reserve\nrequirement for all depository\ninstitutions, an action that freed up\nliquidity in the banking system to\nsupport lending to households and\nbusinesses. Refer to Liquidity Risk\nManagement on pages 55-59 and Note 21\nfor additional information on the\nreduction to the reserve requirement.\nRegulatory Capital - Current Expected\nCredit Losses (\u201cCECL\u201d) transition\ndelay. On March 31, 2020, the federal\nbanking agencies issued an interim\nfinal rule that provided banking\norganizations with the option to delay\nthe effects of CECL on regulatory\ncapital for two years, followed by a\nthree-year\n\ntransition period (\u201cCECL capital\ntransition provisions\u201d). The Firm\nelected to apply the CECL capital\ntransition provisions. Refer to Capital\nRisk Management on pages 49-54 and Note\n22 on pages 176-177 for additional\ninformation on the CECL capital\ntransition provisions and the impact to\nthe Firm\u2019s capital metrics.\nSupplementary leverage ratio (\u201cSLR\u201d)\ntemporary revision. On April 1, 2020,\nthe Federal Reserve issued an interim\nfinal rule that requires, on a\ntemporary basis, the calculation of\ntotal leverage exposure for purposes of\ncalculating the SLR for bank holding\ncompanies, to exclude the on-balance\nsheet amounts of U.S. Treasury\nsecurities and deposits at Federal\nReserve Banks. These exclusions became\neffective April 1, 2020, and will\nremain in effect through March 31,\n2021. Refer to Capital Risk Management\non pages 49-54 and Note 22 for\nadditional information on the Firm\u2019s\nSLR. Loan modifications. On April 7,\n2020, the federal banking agencies\nalong with the National Credit Union\nAdministration, and the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau, in\nconsultation with the state financial\nregulators, issued an interagency\nstatement revising a March 22, 2020\ninteragency statement on loan\nmodifications and the reporting for\nfinancial institutions working with\ncustomers affected by the COVID-19\npandemic (the \u201cIA Statement\u201d). The IA\nStatement reconfirmed that efforts to\nwork with borrowers where the loans are\nprudently underwritten, and not\nconsidered past due or carried on\nnonaccrual status, should not result in\nthe loans automatically being\nconsidered modified in a troubled debt\nrestructuring (\u201cTDR\u201d) for accounting\nand financial reporting purposes, or\nfor purposes of their respective risk-\nbased capital rules, which would\notherwise require financial\ninstitutions subject to the capital\nrules to hold more capital. The IA\nStatement also clarified the\ninteraction between its previous\nguidance and Section 4013 of the CARES\nAct, which provides certain financial\ninstitutions with the option to suspend\nthe application of accounting guidance\nfor TDRs for a limited period of time\nfor loan modifications made to address\nthe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Firm has granted various forms of\nassistance to customers and clients\nimpacted by the COVID-19 pandemic,\nincluding payment deferrals and\ncovenant modifications. The majority of\nthe Firm\u2019s COVID-19 related loan\nmodifications have not been considered\nTDRs as:\n                                                                                  \n     they represent short-term or other insignificant modifications, whether      \n  \u2022  under the Firm\u2019s regular loan modification assessments or the IA Statement   \n     guidance, or                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n     the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application of       \n  \u2022  accounting guidance for TDRs as provided under section 4013 of the CARES     \n     Act.                                                                         \n                                                                                  \nTo the extent that certain\nmodifications do not meet any of the\nabove criteria, the Firm accounts for\nthem as TDRs. Refer to Credit Portfolio\non pages 60-61 and Note 12 for\n\n11 additional information on the Firm\u2019s\nloan modification activities. U.S.\ngovernment facilities and programs .\nBeginning in March 2020, the Federal\nReserve announced a suite of facilities\nusing its emergency lending powers\nunder section 13(3) of the Federal\nReserve Act to support the flow of\ncredit to individuals, households and\nbusinesses adversely affected by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and to support the\nbroader economy. These facilities\ninclude the Money Market Mutual Fund\nLiquidity Facility (\u201cMMLF\u201d), Main\nStreet Lending Facilities, Primary\nDealer Credit Facility (\u201cPDCF\u201d),\nCommercial Paper Funding Facility\n(\u201cCPFF\u201d), Secondary Market Corporate\nCredit Facility (\u201cSMCCF\u201d) and Term\nAsset-Backed Securities Loan Facility\n(\u201cTALF\u201d). In addition, beginning April\n3, 2020, the PPP, established by the\nCARES Act and administered by the SBA,\nauthorized eligible lenders to provide\nnonrecourse loans to eligible borrowers\nuntil August 8, 2020 to provide an\nincentive for these businesses to keep\ntheir workers on their payroll. The\nFirm has participated and is\nparticipating in certain of these\nfacilities and programs, as needed, to\nassist its clients and customers or to\nsupport the broader economy.

tax\nexpense due to the impact of changes in the level and mix of income and expenses\nsubject to U.S. federal, and state and local taxes was more than offset by the\nabsence of the $768 million of tax benefits recorded in the prior year related to\nthe resolution of certain tax audits. Year-to-date results The effective tax rate\ndecreased driven by changes in the level and mix of income and expenses subject to\nU.S. federal, and state and local taxes, as well as the more significant effect of\ncertain tax benefits on a lower level of pre-tax income. The decrease was\npartially offset by the recognition of $874 million of tax benefits recorded in\nthe prior year related to the resolution of certain tax audits. 17\n                                              \n  CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND CASH FLOWS  \n  ANALYSIS                                    \n                                              \nEffective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting guidance.

&\nCommunity Banking, Corporate &\nInvestment Bank, Commercial Banking and\nAsset & Wealth Management. In addition,\nthere is a Corporate segment. The\nbusiness segments are determined based\non the products and services provided,\nor the type of customer served, and\nthey reflect the manner in which\nfinancial information is currently\nevaluated by the Firm\u2019s Operating\nCommittee. Segment results are\npresented on a managed basis. Refer to\nExplanation and Reconciliation of the\nFirm\u2019s use of Non-GAAP Financial\nMeasures on pages 22-23 for a\ndefinition of managed basis.\nDescription of business segment\nreporting methodology Results of the\nbusiness segments are intended to\npresent each segment as if it were a\nstand-alone business. The management\nreporting process that derives business\nsegment results includes the allocation\nof certain income and expense items.\nThe Firm periodically assesses the\nassumptions, methodologies and\nreporting classifications used for\nsegment reporting, and further\nrefinements may be implemented in\nfuture periods. The Firm\u2019s LOBs also\nprovide various business metrics which\nare utilized by the Firm and its\ninvestors and analysts in assessing\nperformance. Revenue sharing When\nbusiness segments join efforts to sell\nproducts and services to the Firm\u2019s\nclients, the participating business\nsegments may agree to share revenue\nfrom those transactions. Revenue and\nexpense are generally recognized in the\nsegment responsible for the related\nproduct or service, with allocations to\nthe other segment(s)\n\ninvolved in the transaction. The\nsegment results reflect these revenue-\nsharing agreements. Business segment\ncapital allocation The amount of\ncapital assigned to each business is\nreferred to as equity. Periodically,\nthe assumptions and methodologies used\nto allocate capital are assessed and as\na result, the capital allocated to the\nLOBs may change. Refer to Line of\nbusiness equity on page 90 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2019 Form 10-K for additional\ninformation on business segment capital\nallocation. Refer to Business Segment\nResults \u2013 Description of business\nsegment reporting methodology on pages\n60\u201361 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2019 Form\n10-K for a further discussion of those\nmethodologies. Business segment changes\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the Firm\nbegan reporting a Wholesale Payments\nbusiness unit within CIB following a\nrealignment of the Firm\u2019s wholesale\npayments businesses.

For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-\nmanaged by derivatives that are recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer\nto Notes 6 and 7 for a description of the composition of these income statement\nline items. Refer to Markets revenue on page 69 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2019 Form 10-K\nfor further information.

Net revenue was a loss of $754 million , down $1.1\nbillion, driven by lower net interest income on lower rates. The current quarter\nalso included small net gains on certain legacy private equity investments\ncompared to losses in the prior year. Noninterest expense of $147 million was down\n$85 million due to lower structural expense, partially offset by a lower net legal\nbenefit compared to the prior year. The current period income tax benefit was\npredominantly driven by the change in the level and mix of income and expenses\nsubject to U.S. federal, and state and local taxes. The prior period included tax\nbenefits of $742 million related to the resolution of certain tax audits. Year-to-\ndate results Net loss was $693 million compared with net income of $1.1 billion in\nthe prior year. Net revenue was a loss of $588 million , compared with $747\nmillion in the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower net interest income on\nlower rates, partially offset by higher noninterest revenue primarily due to\nhigher net investment securities gains reflecting the impact of repositioning the\ninvestment securities portfolio. Noninterest expense of $293 million was down $150\nmillion due to lower structural expense, partially offset by a lower net legal\nbenefit compared to the prior year. The current period income tax benefit was\ndriven by the change in the level and mix of income and expenses subject to U.S.\nfederal, and state and local taxes as well as other tax adjustments, partially\noffset by the impact of the Firm\u2019s estimated full-year expected tax rate relative\nto the level of year-to-date pretax income.

Refer to pages 85\u201392\nof JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2019 Form 10-K, Note 22 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm\u2019s\nPillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm\u2019s\nwebsite, for further discussion of the Firm\u2019s Capital Risk Management, including\ncapital planning and stress testing. COVID-19 Pandemic The Firm has been impacted\nby recent market events as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, but remains well-\ncapitalized. However, the continuation or further deterioration of the current\nmacroeconomic environment could result in impacts to the Firm\u2019s capital and\nleverage position. Basel III Overview The capital rules under Basel III establish\nminimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and\ninternationally active U.S. bank holding companies (\u201cBHC\u201d) and banks, including\nthe Firm and its insured depository institution (\u201cIDI\u201d) subsidiaries, including\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be\nheld by BHCs and banks is determined by calculating risk-weighted assets (\u201cRWA\u201d),\nwhich are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted\naccording to risk. Two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating\nRWA: a standardized approach (\u201cBasel III Standardized\u201d), and an advanced approach\n(\u201cBasel III Advanced\u201d). For each of the risk-based capital ratios, the capital\nadequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or\nAdvanced approaches. The Firm\u2019s Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios are\ncurrently more binding than the Basel III Advanced-risk-based ratios. Basel III\nalso includes a requirement for Advanced Approach banking organizations, including\nthe Firm, to calculate the SLR . Refer to SLR on page 90 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2019\nForm 10-K for additional information. Key Regulatory Developments Current Expected\nCredit Losses . As disclosed in the Firm\u2019s 2019 Form 10-K, the Firm initially\nelected to phase-in the January 1, 2020 (\u201cday 1\u201d) CECL adoption impact to retained\nearnings of $2.7 billion to CET1 capital, at 25% per year in each of 2020 to 2023.\nAs part of their response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 31,\n2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provided the\noption to delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed\nby a three-year transition period (\u201cCECL capital transition provisions\u201d). The\ninterim final rule provides a uniform approach for estimating the effects of CECL\ncompared to the legacy incurred loss model during the first two years of the\ntransition period (the \u201cday 2\u201d transition amount), whereby the Firm may exclude\nfrom CET1 capital 25% of the change in the allowance for credit losses (excluding\nallowances on PCD loans). The cumulative day 2 transition amount as at December\n31, 2021 that is not recognized in CET1 capital as well as the $2.7 billion day 1\nimpact, will be phased into CET1 capital at 25% per year beginning January 1,\n2022. The Firm has elected to apply the CECL capital transition provisions, and\naccordingly, for the period ended June 30, 2020, the capital metrics of the Firm\nexclude $6.5 billion, which is the $2.7 billion day 1 impact to retained earnings\nand 25% of the $15.7 billion increase in the allowance for credit losses\n(excluding allowances on PCD loans). The impacts of the CECL capital transition\nprovisions on Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, and total leverage exposure\nhave also been incorporated into the Firm\u2019s capital metrics. Refer to Note 1 for\nfurther information on the CECL accounting guidance. Money Market Mutual Fund\nLiquidity Facility . On March 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve established the MMLF\nfacility, authorized through September 30, 2020, to enhance the liquidity and\nfunctioning of money markets. On July 28, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that\nit was extending the MMLF through December 31, 2020. Under the MMLF, the FRBB\nmakes nonrecourse advances to participating financial institutions to purchase\ncertain types of assets from eligible money market mutual fund clients. These\nassets, which are reflected in other assets on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated balance\nsheets, are pledged to the FRBB as collateral. On March 23, 2020, the federal\nbanking agencies issued an interim final rule to neutralize the effects of\npurchasing assets through the program on risk-based and leverage-based capital\nratios . As of June 30, 2020, the Firm excluded assets purchased from money market\nmutual fund clients pursuant to nonrecourse advances provided under the MMLF in\nthe amount of $3.8 billion from its RWA and $7.8 billion from adjusted average\nassets and total leverage exposure. Supplementary leverage ratio temporary\nrevision. On April 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve issued an interim final rule that\nrequires, on a temporary basis, the calculation of total leverage exposure for\npurposes of calculating the SLR for bank holding companies, to exclude the on-\nbalance sheet amounts of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve\nBanks. These exclusions became effective April 1, 2020, and will remain in effect\nthrough March 31, 2021. On June 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC issued\nan interim final rule that provides IDI subsidiaries with an option to apply this\ntemporary exclusion subject to certain 49 restrictions. As of June 30, 2020,\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has not elected to apply this exclusion. Paycheck\nProtection Program. On April 13, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an\ninterim final rule to neutralize the regulatory capital effects of participating\nin the PPP on risk-based capital ratios by applying a zero percent risk weight to\nloans originated under the program. As of June 30, 2020, the Firm had\napproximately $28 billion of loans under the program. The interim rule also\nprovides that if the PPP loan is pledged as collateral for a non-recourse loan\nunder the Federal Reserve\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program Lending (\u201cPPPL\u201d) Facility,\nthe PPP loans can be excluded from leverage-based capital ratios. As of June 30,\n2020, the Firm had not participated in the PPPL Facility. Refer to Regulatory\nDevelopments Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic on pages 11-12 for additional\ninformation on regulatory actions and significant financing programs that the U.S.\ngovernment and regulators have introduced to address the effects of the COVID-19\npandemic. Stress Capital Buffer. On March 4, 2020, the Federal Reserve issued the\nfinal rule introducing the SCB framework for the Basel III Standardized approach\nthat is designed to more closely integrate the results of the quantitative\nassessment in the annual CCAR with the ongoing minimum capital requirements for\nBHCs under the U.S. Basel III rules. The final rule replaces the static 2.5% CET1\ncapital conservation buffer in the Standardized approach with a dynamic\ninstitution-specific SCB. The final rule does not apply to the Advanced approach\ncapital requirements. The SCB requirement for BHCs will be effective on October 1\nof each year and is expected to remain in effect until September 30 of the\nfollowing year.\n\nThe following tables present the Firm\u2019s risk-based and leverage-based capital\nmetrics under both the Basel III Standardized and Advanced Approaches.

The\nSCB will be integrated into the Firm\u2019s\nongoing Standardized risk-based capital\nrequirements, increasing the minimum\nCET1 capital ratio to 11.3% (up from\n10.5%). The Federal Reserve has\ndetermined that changes in financial\nmarkets or the macroeconomic outlook\ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic could have\na material effect on a firm\u2019s risk\nprofile and financial condition and\ntherefore is requiring all large bank\nholding companies, including the Firm,\nto update and resubmit their capital\nplans later this year.

Liquidity in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. increased during the quarter\nprimarily due to deposits net of loan growth. Deposits increased in the second\nquarter as a result of market conditions driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAdditionally, effective March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve, in response\n\nto the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced reserve requirements to zero percent, which\nincreased JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s average HQLA by approximately $25 billion in\nthe second quarter. However, these increases in excess liquidity in JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. are excluded from the Firm\u2019s reported LCR under the LCR rule. Refer to\nNote 21 for additional information. The Firm's average LCR increased during the\nthree months ended June 30, 2020, compared with the prior year period, primarily\ndue to an increase in the average amount of reportable HQLA as a result of\nincreased cash from unsecured long-term debt issuances. The Firm\u2019s average LCR\nfluctuates from period to period, due to changes in its HQLA and estimated net\ncash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity. Other liquidity sources In\naddition to the assets reported in the Firm\u2019s HQLA above, the Firm had\nunencumbered marketable securities, such as equity securities and fixed income\ndebt securities, that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity.\nThis includes securities included as part of the excess HQLA at JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates, as described above.\nThe fair value of these securities was approximately $606 billion and $315 billion\nas of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively , although the amount of\nliquidity that could be raised would be dependent on prevailing market conditions.\nThe fair value increased compared to December 31, 2019, due to an increase in\nexcess HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. which was primarily a result of increased\ndeposits as noted above. The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at FHLBs\nand the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral\npledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $281 billion and $322 billion\nas of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. This borrowing capacity\nexcludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm\u2019s HQLA or other\nunencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank\ndiscount window and other central banks. Available borrowing capacity decreased\nfrom December 31, 2019 primarily due to lower credit card receivable balances and\nlower collateral values due to a decline in their fair value, both driven by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Although available, the Firm does not view this borrowing\ncapacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and the other central banks\nas a primary source of liquidity.\n\n55 Funding Sources of funds Management believes that the Firm\u2019s unsecured and\nsecured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance sheet\nobligations. The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse sources of\nfunding including stable deposits, secured and unsecured funding in the capital\nmarkets and stockholders\u2019 equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

A\nsignificant portion of the Firm\u2019s\ndeposits are consumer deposits and\nwholesale operating deposits, which are\nboth considered to be stable sources of\nliquidity. Wholesale operating deposits\nare considered to be stable sources of\nliquidity because they are generated\nfrom customers that maintain operating\nservice relationships with the Firm.\nThe table below shows the loan and\ndeposit balances, the loans-to-deposits\nratios, and deposits as a percentage of\ntotal liabilities, as of June 30, 2020\nand December 31, 2019 .\n                                                                                  \n  (in billions except ratios)        June\u00a030, 2020          December\u00a031, 2019     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Deposits                        $        1,931.0       $            1,562.4     \n  Deposits as a % of total                      65  %                      64  %  \n  liabilities                                                                     \n  Loans                           $          978.5       $              959.8     \n  Loans-to-deposits ratio                       51  %                      61  %  \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm believes that average deposit balances are generally more representative\nof deposit trends than period-end deposit balances, over time. However, during\nperiods of market disruption those trends could be affected.\n\nAverage deposits increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 ,\nreflecting significant inflows across the LOBs primarily driven by the COVID-19\npandemic, as customers and clients looked to remain liquid as a result of market\nconditions. In the wholesale businesses, the inflows principally occurred in\nMarch, and in general were maintained through the second quarter. In CCB, the\nincrease was driven by the continued growth in both existing and new accounts, as\nwell as COVID-19 related factors, such as the government stimulus for consumers\nand small businesses, lower consumer spending and delays in tax payments.

agreements to repurchase. These\ninstruments are secured predominantly by high-quality securities collateral,\nincluding government-issued debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS.\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase increased at June 30, 2020 ,\ncompared with December 31, 2019 , reflecting in CIB, a net increase related to\nclient-driven market-making activities, and higher secured financing of trading\nassets, partially offset by a decline in the Firm's participation in the Federal\nReserve's open market operations, and in Treasury and CIO, higher secured\nfinancing of AFS investment securities. The balances associated with securities\nloaned or sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to\ncustomers\u2019 investment and financing activities, the Firm\u2019s demand for financing,\nthe ongoing management of the mix of the Firm\u2019s liabilities, including its secured\nand unsecured financing (for both the investment securities and market-making\nportfolios), and other market and portfolio factors. As of June 30, 2020 , the\nFirm participated in the MMLF government facility. The secured nonrecourse\nadvances under the MMLF are included in other borrowed funds. Refer to Capital\nRisk Management on pages 49-54 for additional information on the MMLF. The PDCF\nwas established by the Federal Reserve on March 20, 2020, to allow primary dealers\nto support smooth market functioning by facilitating the availability of credit to\nbusinesses and households. Under the PDCF, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\n(\u201cFRBNY\u201d) provides collateralized financing on a term basis to primary dealers.\nThese financing transactions were reported as securities sold under agreements to\nrepurchase. On July 28, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that it was extending\nthrough December 31, 2020 the PDCF, which was previously scheduled to expire on or\naround September 30, 2020. The Firm participated in the PDCF in the first quarter\nof 2020, and ceased its participation in May 2020 as the secured financing market\nnormalized. The Firm also continues to participate in the Federal Reserve\u2019s open\nmarket operations. The Firm\u2019s sources of short-term unsecured funding primarily\nconsist of issuance of wholesale commercial paper. The decrease in commercial\npaper at June 30, 2020 , from December 31, 2019 and for the average three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2020 compared to the prior year period, was due to lower net\nissuance primarily for short-term liquidity management. 57 Long-term funding and\nissuance Long-term funding provides additional sources of stable funding and\nliquidity for the Firm. The Firm\u2019s long-term funding plan is driven primarily by\nexpected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements,\nincluding TLAC . Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification,\nmaximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various\nfunding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding\nplan. The significant majority of the Firm\u2019s long-term unsecured funding is issued\nby the Parent Company to provide flexibility in support of both bank and non-bank\nsubsidiary funding needs. The Parent Company advances substantially all net\nfunding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to\nexternal counterparties. The following table summarizes long-term unsecured\nissuance and maturities or redemptions for the three and six months ended June 30,\n2020 and 2019 . Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 93\u201398 and Note 20 of\nJPMorgan Chase \u2019s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information on the IHC and long-\nterm debt.\n

Reductions in these ratings could have\nan adverse effect on the Firm\u2019s access to liquidity sources, increase the cost of\nfunds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the\nnumber of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature and\nmagnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades depends on numerous contractual and\nbehavioral factors, which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk\nand stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it maintains sufficient\nliquidity to withstand a potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings\ndowngrades. Additionally, the Firm\u2019s funding requirements for VIEs and other\nthird-party commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in credit ratings.\nRefer to SPEs on page 21 , and liquidity risk and credit-related contingent\nfeatures in Note 5 for additional information on the impact of a credit ratings\ndowngrade on the funding requirements for VIEs, and on derivatives and collateral\nagreements.

In\nconjunction with the adoption of CECL,\nthe Firm reclassified risk-rated loans\nand lending-related commitments from\nthe consumer, excluding credit card\nportfolio segment to the wholesale\nportfolio segment, to align with the\nmethodology applied when determining\nthe allowance. Prior-period amounts\nhave been revised to conform with the\ncurrent presentation. Refer to Note 1\nfor further information. The Firm has\ngranted various forms of assistance to\ncustomers and clients impacted by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, including payment\ndeferrals and covenant modifications.\nThe majority of the Firm\u2019s COVID-19\nrelated loan modifications have not\nbeen considered TDRs as:\n                                                                                  \n     they represent short-term or other insignificant modifications, whether      \n  \u2022  under the Firm\u2019s regular loan modification assessments or the IA Statement   \n     guidance, or                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n     the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application of       \n  \u2022  accounting guidance for TDRs as provided under section 4013 of the CARES     \n     Act.                                                                         \n                                                                                  \nTo the extent that certain modifications do not meet any of the above criteria,\nthe Firm accounts for them as TDRs. The Firm considers expected losses of\nprincipal and accrued interest associated with all COVID-19 related loan\nmodifications in its allowance for credit losses. Refer to Business Developments\non pages 9-10 for more information on customer and client assistance granted.\nRefer to Notes 12 and 13 for further information on the Firm\u2019s accounting\n\npolicies on loan modifications and the allowance for credit losses. The\neffectiveness of the Firm\u2019s actions in helping borrowers recover and in mitigating\nthe Firm\u2019s credit losses remains uncertain in light of the unpredictable nature\nand duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Assistance provided in response to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic could delay the recognition of delinquencies, nonaccrual status,\nand net charge-offs for those customers and clients who would have otherwise moved\ninto past due or nonaccrual status.

In addition, the Firm\u2019s policy is generally to       \n       exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as         \n       permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the Federal Financial           \n       Institutions Examination Council (\u201cFFIEC\u201d).                                \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       AtJune\u00a030, 2020, nonperforming loans included$1.3 billionof PCD loans on   \n  (e)  nonaccrual status. Prior to the adoption of CECL, nonaccrual loans         \n       excluded PCI loans as the Firm recognized interest income on each pool of  \n       PCI loans as each of the pools was performing.                             \n                                                                                  \nPaycheck Protection Program The PPP, established by the CARES Act and implemented\nby the SBA, provides the Firm with delegated authority to process and originate\nPPP loans until August 8, 2020. When certain criteria are met, PPP loans are\nsubject to forgiveness and the Firm will receive payment of the forgiveness amount\nfrom the SBA. The term for PPP loans issued before June 5, 2020 is two years (with\nan option to extend to five years) and five years for those originated on or after\nJune 5, 2020. PPP loan terms provide borrowers with an automatic payment deferral\nof principal and interest. Given that PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA, the\nFirm does not expect to realize material credit losses on these loans. PPP\nprocessing fees are deferred and accreted into interest income over the\ncontractual life of the loans. At June 30, 2020, the Firm had approximately $28\nbillion of loans under the PPP, of which $20 billion and $8 billion are in\nConsumer and Wholesale, respectively. The impact on interest income related to PPP\nloans was not material for the three months ended June 30, 2020.\n\n61\n                             \n  CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO  \n                             \nThe Firm\u2019s retained consumer portfolio consists primarily of residential real\nestate loans, credit card loans, scored auto and business banking loans, as well\nas associated lending-related commitments. The Firm\u2019s focus is on serving\nprimarily the prime segment of the consumer credit market. Refer to Note 12 for\nfurther information on consumer loans, as well as the Firm\u2019s nonaccrual and\ncharge-off accounting policies. Refer to Note 23 for further information on\nlending-related commitments. Continued weakness in the macroeconomic environment\ndriven by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in an additional increase\nin the allowance for credit losses. The continuation or worsening of the effects\nof the COVID-19 pandemic on the macroeconomic environment and the extent to which\ncustomer assistance and government stimulus efforts are effective could result in\nfurther impacts to credit quality metrics, including delinquencies, nonaccrual\nloans and charge-offs.

For credit card  \n  (e)  commitments, and if certain conditions are met, home equity commitments    \n       and certain business banking commitments, the Firm can reduce or cancel    \n       these lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases   \n       as permitted by law, without notice.

The portfolio decreased from\nDecember 31, 2019 driven by paydowns\nand loan sales in Home Lending, largely\noffset by originations of prime\nmortgage loans that have been retained\non the balance sheet. Net recoveries\nfor the three months ended June 30,\n2020 were lower when compared with the\nsame period in the prior year as the\ncurrent quarter included losses\nassociated with the purchased credit\ndeteriorated portfolio as a result of\nthe adoption of CECL. Net recoveries\nfor the six months ended June 30, 2020\nwere higher when compared with the same\nperiod in the prior year as the current\nyear benefited from a recovery on a\nloan sale. The carrying value of home\nequity lines of credit outstanding was\n$26.5 billion at June 30, 2020 . This\namount included $9.9 billion of HELOCs\nthat have recast from interest-only to\nfully amortizing payments or have been\nmodified and $8.7 billion of interest-\nonly balloon HELOCs, which primarily\nmature after 2030. The Firm manages the\nrisk of HELOCs during their revolving\nperiod by closing or reducing the\nundrawn line to the extent permitted by\nlaw when borrowers are exhibiting a\nmaterial deterioration in their credit\nrisk profile. At June 30, 2020 , and\nDecember 31, 2019 , the carrying value\nof interest-only residential mortgage\nloans was $23.2 billion and $22.5\nbillion , respectively. These loans\nhave an interest-only payment period\ngenerally followed by an adjustable-\nrate or fixed-rate fully amortizing\npayment period to maturity and are\ntypically originated as higher-balance\nloans to higher-income borrowers,\npredominantly in AWM. Performance of\nthis portfolio for the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2020 was in line\nwith the performance of the broader\nresidential mortgage portfolio for the\nsame period. The following table\nprovides a summary of the Firm\u2019s\nresidential mortgage portfolio insured\nand/or guaranteed by U.S. government\nagencies, including loans held-for-\nsale.

The June 30, 2020 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates\nof 1.71% and 0.93% , respectively, decreased compared to the December 31, 2019 30+\nand 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.87% and 0.95% , respectively. The delinquency\nrate was positively impacted by loans in payment deferral programs, as these loans\nare generally not considered delinquent if they are performing according to their\nmodified terms. Net charge-offs decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2020\ncompared with the same period in the prior year due to higher recoveries. However,\nnet charge-offs increased for the six months ended June 30, 2020 when compared\nwith the same period in the prior year due to loan growth in the prior year\nlargely offset by higher recoveries. Consistent with the Firm\u2019s policy, all credit\ncard loans typically remain on accrual status until charged off. However, the\nFirm\u2019s allowance for loan losses includes the estimated uncollectible portion of\naccrued and billed interest and fee income. Refer to Note 12 for further\ninformation about this portfolio, including information about delinquencies.\nGeographic and FICO composition of credit card loans Refer to Note 12 for\ninformation on the geographic and FICO composition of the Firm\u2019s credit card\nloans. Modifications of credit card loans At June 30, 2020 the Firm had $1.4\nbillion of credit card loans outstanding that have been modified in TDRs, which\ndoes not include loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that\nare not considered TDRs, compared to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2019 . Refer to\nNote 12 for additional information about loan modification programs to borrowers.\n66\n                              \n  WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO  \n                              \nIn its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through\nits underwriting, lending, market-making, and hedging activities with and for\nclients and counterparties, as well as through various operating services (such as\ncash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash\nplaced with banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm\u2019s\nwholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm\ndistributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the\nmarket as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio\nconcentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in\npart by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and\ntransaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry,\nproduct and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 70-74\nfor further information. The Firm\u2019s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure\nheld in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated business banking and\nauto dealer exposures held in CCB for which the wholesale methodology is applied\nwhen determining the allowance for credit losses. The macroeconomic environment,\ndriven by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, has resulted in broad-based\ndeterioration and an increase in the allowance for credit losses. In the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2020, the investment-grade percentage of the portfolio\ndecreased from 74% to 72%, and criticized exposure increased $24.3 billion from\n$15.1 billion to $39.4 billion. The increase in criticized exposure was largely\ndriven by downgrades in Consumer & Retail and Oil & Gas. The continuation or\nworsening of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the macroeconomic environment\ncould result in further impacts to credit quality metrics, including investment-\ngrade percentages, as well as to criticized and nonperforming exposures and\ncharge-offs. Retained loans increased by $35.1 billion in the six months ended\nJune 30, 2020, driven by the CIB and CB, predominantly to commercial and\nindustrial clients. The $35.1 billion increase reflects the outstanding loans from\nthe March drawdown activity on committed revolving credit facilities, as a result\nof the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact of loans under the PPP.\n                                                                                  \n                        Credit                                                    \n

The\ncontractual amounts of these financial\ninstruments represent the maximum\npossible credit risk should the clients\ndraw down on these commitments or when\nthe Firm fulfills its obligations under\nthese guarantees, and the clients\nsubsequently fail to perform according\nto the terms of these contracts. Most\nof these commitments and guarantees\nhave historically been refinanced,\nextended, cancelled, or expired without\nbeing drawn upon or a default\noccurring. As a result, the Firm does\nnot believe that the total contractual\namount of these wholesale lending-\nrelated commitments is representative\nof the Firm\u2019s expected future credit\nexposure or funding requirements. Refer\nto Note 23 for further information on\nwholesale lending-related commitments.\nReceivables from Customers Receivables\nfrom customers primarily represent\nheld-for-investment margin loans to\nbrokerage clients in CIB and AWM that\nare collateralized by assets maintained\nin the clients\u2019 brokerage accounts\n(e.g., cash on deposit, liquid and\nreadily marketable debt or equity\nsecurities), as such generally no\nallowance for credit losses is held\nagainst these receivables. To manage\nits credit risk the Firm establishes\nmargin requirements and monitors the\nrequired margin levels on an ongoing\nbasis, and requires clients to deposit\nadditional cash or other collateral, or\nto reduce positions, when appropriate.\nThese receivables are reported within\naccrued interest and accounts\nreceivable on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated\nbalance sheets. Derivative contracts\nDerivatives enable clients and\ncounterparties to manage risks\nincluding credit risk and risks arising\nfrom fluctuations in interest rates,\nforeign exchange, equities, and\ncommodities. The Firm makes markets in\nderivatives in order to meet these\nneeds and uses derivatives to manage\ncertain risks associated with net open\nrisk positions from its market-making\nactivities, including the counterparty\ncredit risk arising from derivative\nreceivables. The Firm also uses\nderivative instruments to manage its\nown credit risk and other market risk\nexposure. Refer to Note 5 f or a\nfurther discussion of derivative\ncontracts. The following table\nsummarizes the net derivative\nreceivables for the periods presented.\n                                                                                  \n  Derivative receivables                                                          \n  (in millions)                                                                   \n  Total, net of cash collateral                                                   \n  Liquid securities and other cash       June\u00a030,2020        December\u00a031,2019     \n  collateral held against derivative           74,846                  49,766     \n  receivables(a)                              (21,501  )              (16,009  )  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Total, net of collateral            $        53,345     $            33,757     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Includes collateral related to derivative instruments where appropriate    \n  (a)  legal opinions have not been either sought or obtained with respect to     \n       master netting agreements.                                                 \n                                                                                  \nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance\nsheets were $74.8 billion and $49.8 billion at June 30, 2020 , and December 31,\n2019 , respectively, with increases in CIB resulting from market movements.\nDerivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after\ngiving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral\nheld by the Firm. However, in management\u2019s view, the appropriate measure of\ncurrent credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid\nsecurities (primarily U.S. government and agency securities and other Group of\nSeven nations (\u201cG7\u201d) government securities) and other cash collateral held by the\nFirm aggregating $21.5 billion and $16.0 billion at June 30, 2020 , and December\n31, 2019 , respectively, that may be used as security when the fair value of the\nclient\u2019s exposure is in the Firm\u2019s favor. The Firm also holds additional\ncollateral (primarily cash, G7 government securities, other liquid government\nagency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities)\ndelivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral\nrelated to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the\nFirm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date.\nAlthough this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the\ntable above, it is available as security against potential exposure that could\narise should the fair value of the client\u2019s derivative contracts move in the\nFirm\u2019s favor. The derivative receivables fair value, net of all collateral, also\ndoes not include other credit enhancements, such as letters of credit.

In\nconjunction with the adoption of CECL,\nthe Firm reclassified risk-rated loans\nand lending-related commitments from\nthe consumer, excluding credit card\nportfolio segment to the wholesale\nportfolio segment, to align with the\nmethodology applied when determining\nthe allowance.

The investment securities\nportfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm\u2019s\nbalance sheet or asset-liability management objectives. Principal investments are\npredominantly privately-held financial instruments and are managed in the LOBs and\nCorporate. Investments are typically intended to be held over extended periods\nand, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term realized gains with\nrespect to these investments. Investment securities risk Investment securities\nrisk includes the exposure associated with a default in the payment of principal\nand interest. This risk is mitigated given that the investment securities\nportfolio held by Treasury and CIO is predominantly invested in high-quality\nsecurities. At June 30, 2020 , the Treasury and CIO investment securities\nportfolio, net of allowance for credit losses, was $556.7 billion, and the average\ncredit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon\nexternal ratings where available and where not available, based primarily upon\ninternal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on page 46 and Note 10\nfor further information on the investment securities portfolio and internal risk\nratings. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 80-84 for further information on\nthe market risk inherent in the portfolio. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on\npages 55-59 for further information on related liquidity risk. Principal\ninvestment risk Principal investments are typically private non-traded financial\ninstruments representing ownership or other forms of junior capital and span\nmultiple asset classes. These investments are made by dedicated investing\nbusinesses or as part of a broader business strategy. In general, new principal\ninvestments include tax-oriented investments, as well as investments made to\nenhance or accelerate LOB and Corporate strategic business initiatives. The Firm\u2019s\nprincipal investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and are reflected\nwithin their respective financial results. The carrying values of the principal\ninvestment portfolios have not been significantly affected by recent market events\nas a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the duration and severity of\nadverse macroeconomic conditions could subject certain principal investments to\nimpairments, write-downs, or other negative impacts. As of June 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019 , the aggregate carrying values of the principal investment\nportfolios were $24.5 billion and $24.2 billion , respectively, which included\ntax-oriented investments (e.g., affordable housing and alternative energy\ninvestments) of $18.5 billion and $18.2 billion respectively, and private equity,\nvarious debt and equity instruments, and real assets of $6.0 billion at the end of\nboth periods.

Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 119\u2013126 of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm\u2019s Market Risk\nManagement organization, market risk measurement, risk monitoring and control, and\npredominant business activities that give rise to market risk. COVID-19 Pandemic\nMarket Risk Management is actively monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\non market risk exposures by leveraging existing risk measures and controls. Models\nused to measure market risk are inherently imprecise and may be limited in their\nability to measure certain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be\nheightened when sudden or severe shifts in market conditions occur, such as those\nobserved during the COVID-19 pandemic. For additional discussion on model\nuncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 87 . Market\nRisk Management periodically reviews the Firm\u2019s existing market risk measures to\nidentify opportunities for enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will\ncalibrate those measures accordingly over time. This is increasingly important in\nperiods of sustained, heightened market volatility. Value-at-risk JPMorgan Chase\nutilizes value-at-risk (\u201cVaR\u201d), a statistical risk measure , to estimate the\npotential loss from adverse market moves in the current market environment. The\nFirm has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating Risk Management\nVaR and Regulatory VaR. The Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a\none-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a\n95% confidence level. For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this\nmethodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk\nmanagement decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market\nrisk measures, provides the appropriate information needed to respond to risk\nevents. The Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with\nregulatory rules (\u201cRegulatory VaR\u201d), which is used to derive the Firm\u2019s regulatory\nVaR-based capital requirements under Basel III. The Firm\u2019s VaR model calculations\nare periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition\nof the Firm\u2019s portfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm\u2019s\nmodeling techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such changes may affect\nhistorical comparisons of VaR results. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk\nManagement on page 135 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2019 Form 10-K for information\nregarding model reviews and approvals. Refer to page 121 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2019\nForm 10-K for further information regarding VaR, including the inherent\nlimitations, and the key differences between Risk Management VaR and Regulatory\nVaR.

This increase was driven\nby the substantial increase in\nvolatility in the one-year historical\nlook-back period as a result of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. The most significant\nimpacts were reflected in the fixed\nincome and commodities risk types.\n\nEffective January 1, 2020, the Firm\nrefined the scope of VaR to exclude\npositions related to the risk\nmanagement of interest rate exposure\nfrom changes in the Firm\u2019s own credit\nspread on fair value option elected\nliabilities, and included these\npositions in other sensitivity-based\nmeasures.

These\nexcluded components of total net revenue may more than offset backtesting gains\nand losses on a particular day.

The following chart compares Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses\nwith the Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR for the 12 months ended June 30, 2020 . The\nresults in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the\nMarket Risk section of the Firm\u2019s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital\nDisclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm\u2019s\ncovered positions. For the 12 months ended June 30, 2020 , the Firm posted\nbacktesting gains on 142 of the 260 days, and observed 16 VaR backtesting\nexceptions, which was higher than the statistically expected number of backtesting\nexceptions due to recent market volatility being materially higher than the levels\nrealized in the historical data used for the VaR calculation. For the three months\nended June 30, 2020 , the Firm posted backtesting gains on 38 of the 65 days, and\nobserved two VaR backtesting exceptions as higher volatility became fully embedded\nin the look-back period used for the VaR calculation. Firmwide backtesting loss\ndays can differ from the loss days for which Fixed Income Markets and Equity\nMarkets posted losses, as disclosed in the CIB Markets revenue results, as the\npopulation of positions which compose each metric are different and due to the\nexclusion of select components of total net revenue in backtesting gains and\nlosses as described above.

Interest rate\nrisk arises not only from trading\nactivities but also from the Firm\u2019s\ntraditional banking activities, which\ninclude extension of loans and credit\nfacilities, taking deposits and issuing\ndebt as well as from the investment\nsecurities portfolio. Refer to the\ntable on page 120 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n2019 Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and\nCorporate, identifying positions\nincluded in earnings-at-risk. One way\nthe Firm evaluates its structural\ninterest rate risk is through earnings-\nat-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the\nFirm\u2019s interest rate exposure for a\ngiven interest rate scenario. It is\npresented as a sensitivity to a\nbaseline, which includes net interest\nincome and certain interest rate\nsensitive fees. The baseline uses\nmarket interest rates and in the case\nof deposits, pricing assumptions. The\nFirm conducts simulations of changes to\nthis baseline for interest rate-\nsensitive assets and liabilities\ndenominated in U.S. dollars and other\ncurrencies (\u201cnon-U.S. dollar\u201d\ncurrencies). These simulations\nprimarily include retained loans,\ndeposits, deposits with banks,\ninvestment securities, long term debt\nand any related interest rate hedges,\nand exclude other positions in risk\nmanagement VaR and other sensitivity-\nbased measures as described on page 120\nof JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2019 Form 10-K.\nEarnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the\npotential change to a net interest\nincome baseline, over the following 12\nmonths utilizing multiple assumptions.\nThese scenarios include a parallel\nshift involving changes to both short-\nterm and long-term rates by an equal\namount; a steeper yield curve involving\nholding short-term rates constant and\nincreasing long-term rates; and a\nflatter yield curve involving\nincreasing short-term rates and holding\nlong-term rates constant. These\nscenarios consider many different\nfactors, including:\n                                                                                  \n  \u2022  The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest     \n     rates from baseline rates.                                                   \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n     Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment     \n     behavior, but do not include assumptions about actions that could be taken   \n     by the Firm in response to any such instantaneous rate changes.

Risk\nReporting The following table presents the Firm\u2019s top 20 exposures by country\n(excluding the U.S.) as of June 30, 2020 and their comparative exposures as of\nDecember 31, 2019 . The selection of countries represents the Firm\u2019s largest total\nexposures by country, based on the Firm\u2019s internal country risk management\napproach, and does not represent the Firm\u2019s view of any actual or potentially\nadverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to period\ndue to client activity and market flows. The overall increase in top 20 exposures\nwas predominantly driven by client activity and demand for liquidity, relative to\nthe period ending December 31, 2019. This resulted in an increase in cash\nplacements primarily with the central banks of Germany, the United Kingdom and\nAustralia.\n

The estimation methods are of varying\nlevels of sophistication and are used for many purposes, such as the valuation of\npositions, measurement of risk, sizing the allowance for credit losses, assessing\nregulatory capital requirements, conducting stress testing, and making business\ndecisions. While models are inherently imprecise, the degree of imprecision or\nuncertainty can be heightened by the market or economic environment. This is\nparticularly true when the current and forecasted environment is significantly\ndifferent from the historical macroeconomic environments upon which the models\nwere calibrated, as the Firm has experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. This\nuncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment and analytics to inform\nadjustments to model outputs than in typical periods.

The\nFirm\u2019s most complex accounting\nestimates require management\u2019s judgment\nto ascertain the appropriate carrying\nvalue of assets and liabilities. The\nFirm has established policies and\ncontrol procedures intended to ensure\nthat estimation methods, including any\njudgments made as part of such methods,\nare well-controlled, independently\nreviewed and applied consistently from\nperiod to period. The methods used and\njudgments made reflect, among other\nfactors, the nature of the assets or\nliabilities and the related business\nand risk management strategies, which\nmay vary across the Firm\u2019s businesses\nand portfolios. In addition, the\npolicies and procedures are intended to\nensure that the process for changing\nmethodologies occurs in an appropriate\nmanner. The Firm believes its estimates\nfor determining the carrying value of\nits assets and liabilities are\nappropriate. The following is a brief\ndescription of the Firm\u2019s critical\naccounting estimates involving\nsignificant judgments. Allowance for\ncredit losses The Firm\u2019s allowance for\ncredit losses represents management\u2019s\nestimate of expected credit losses over\nthe remaining expected life of the\nFirm\u2019s financial assets measured at\namortized cost, certain off-balance\nsheet lending-related commitments and\ninvestment securities. The allowance\nfor credit losses comprises:\n                                                                                  \n  \u2022  The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm\u2019s retained loan         \n     portfolios (scored and risk-rated),                                          \n                                                                                  \n                                                         \n  \u2022  The allowance for lending-related commitments, and  \n                                                         \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022  The allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which covers the   \n     Firm\u2019s HTM and AFS securities.                                               \n                                                                                  \nThe allowance for credit losses\ninvolves significant judgment on a\nnumber of matters including development\nand weighting of macroeconomic\nforecasts, incorporation of historical\nloss experience, assessment of risk\ncharacteristics, assignment of risk\nratings, valuation of collateral, and\nthe determination of remaining expected\nlife. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for\nfurther information on these judgments\nas well as the Firm\u2019s policies and\nmethodologies used to determine the\nFirm\u2019s allowance for credit losses. One\nof the most significant judgments\ninvolved in estimating the Firm\u2019s\nallowance for credit losses relates to\nthe macroeconomic forecasts used to\nestimate credit losses over the eight-\nquarter forecast period within the\nFirm\u2019s methodology. The eight-quarter\nforecast incorporates hundreds of\nmacroeconomic variables (\u201cMEVs\u201d) that\nare relevant for exposures across the\nFirm, with modeled credit losses being\ndriven primarily by a subset of less\nthan twenty variables. The specific\nvariables that have the greatest effect\non the modeled losses of each portfolio\nvary by portfolio and geography.\n                                                                                  \n  \u2022  Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S. unemployment, house price   \n     index (\u201cHPI\u201d) and U.S. real gross domestic product (\u201cGDP\u201d).                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n     Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real GDP, U.S.             \n  \u2022  unemployment, U.S. equity prices, corporate credit spreads, oil prices,      \n     commercial real estate prices and HPI.                                       \n                                                                                  \nChanges in the Firm\u2019s assumptions and\nforecasts of economic conditions could\nsignificantly affect its estimate of\nexpected credit losses in the portfolio\nat the balance sheet date or lead to\nsignificant changes in the estimate\nfrom one reporting period to the next.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a\nweak labor market and weak overall\neconomic conditions that will continue\nto affect borrowers across the Firm\u2019s\nconsumer and wholesale lending\nportfolios. Significant judgment is\nrequired to estimate the severity and\nduration of the current economic\ndownturn, as well as its potential\nimpact on borrower defaults and loss\nseverities. In particular,\nmacroeconomic conditions and forecasts\nregarding the duration and severity of\nthe economic downturn caused by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic have been rapidly\nchanging and remain highly uncertain.\nIt is difficult to predict exactly how\nborrower behavior will be impacted by\nthese changes in economic conditions.\nThe effectiveness of government\nsupport, customer assistance and\nenhanced unemployment benefits should\nact as mitigants to credit losses, but\nthe extent of the mitigation impact\nremains uncertain. It is difficult to\nestimate how potential changes in any\none factor or input might affect the\noverall allowance for credit losses\nbecause management considers a wide\nvariety of factors and inputs in\nestimating the allowance for credit\nlosses. Changes in the factors and\ninputs considered may not occur at the\nsame rate and may not be consistent\nacross all geographies or product\ntypes, and changes in factors and\ninputs may be directionally\ninconsistent, such that improvement in\none factor or input may offset\ndeterioration in others. To consider\nthe impact of a hypothetical alternate\nmacroeconomic forecast, the Firm\ncompared the modeled credit losses\ndetermined using its central and\nrelative adverse macroeconomic\nscenarios, which are two of the five\nscenarios considered in estimating the\nallowances for loan losses and lending-\nrelated commitments. The central and\nrelative adverse scenarios each\nincluded a full suite of MEVs, but\ndiffered in the levels, paths and\npeaks/troughs of those variables over\nthe eight-quarter forecast period. For\nexample, compared to the Firm\u2019s central\nscenario described on page 77 and in\nNote 13 , the Firm\u2019s relative adverse\nscenario assumes a significantly\nelevated U.S. unemployment rate through\nthe first half of 2021, averaging 3.6%\nhigher over the eight-quarter forecast,\nwith a peak difference of nearly 7% in\nthe fourth quarter of 2020; lower U.S.\nreal GDP with a slower recovery,\nremaining nearly 4% lower at the end of\nthe eight-quarter\n\n88\n\nforecast, with a peak difference of\nnearly 5.5% in the first quarter of\n2021; and an 11% further deterioration\nin the national HPI with a trough in\nthe first quarter of 2022. This\nanalysis is not intended to estimate\nexpected future changes in the\nallowance for credit losses, for a\nnumber of reasons, including:\n                                                                                  \n     the Firm has placed significant weight on its adverse scenarios in           \n     estimating its allowance for credit losses as of June 30, 2020, and          \n     accordingly, the existing allowance already reflects credit losses beyond    \n  \u2022  those estimated under the central scenario                                   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022  the changes in the MEVs are not intended to imply management\u2019s expectation   \n     of the extent or nature of future deterioration in MEVs                      \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n     the impacts of changes in many MEVs are both interrelated and nonlinear, so  \n  \u2022  the results of this analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe   \n     changes in macroeconomic variables                                           \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n     the COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs at a speed and to degrees not   \n  \u2022  seen in recent history, adding significantly higher degrees of uncertainty   \n     around modeled credit loss estimations which use scenarios outside of        \n     historical experience                                                        \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n     significant changes in the expected severity and duration of the economic    \n     downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the effects of government support  \n  \u2022  and customer assistance, and the speed of the subsequent recovery could      \n     significantly affect the Firm\u2019s estimate of expected credit losses           \n     irrespective of the estimated sensitivities described below.                 \n                                                                                  \nTo demonstrate the sensitivity of\ncredit loss estimates to macroeconomic\nforecasts as of June 30, 2020 , the\nFirm compared the modeled estimates\nunder its relative adverse scenario to\nits central scenario. Without\nconsidering the additional weight the\nFirm has placed on its adverse\nscenarios or any other offsetting or\ncorrelated effects in other qualitative\ncomponents of the Firm\u2019s allowance for\ncredit losses for these lending\nexposures, the difference between these\ntwo scenarios would result in the\nfollowing:\n                                                                                  \n  \u2022  An increase of approximately$2 billionfor residential real estate loans and  \n     lending-related commitments                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                  \n  \u2022  An increase of approximately$4 billionfor credit card loans  \n                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  \u2022  An increase of approximately$7 billionfor wholesale loans and                \n     lending-related commitments                                                  \n                                                                                  \nThis analysis relates only to the\nmodeled credit loss estimates and is\nnot intended to estimate changes in the\noverall allowance for credit losses as\nit does not reflect any potential\nchanges in other adjustments to the\nquantitative calculation, which would\nalso be influenced by the judgment\nmanagement applies to the modeled\nlifetime loss estimates to reflect the\nuncertainty and imprecision of these\nmodeled lifetime loss estimates based\non then-current circumstances\n\nand conditions. Recognizing that\nforecasts of macroeconomic conditions\nare inherently uncertain, particularly\nin light of the recent economic\nconditions, the Firm believes that its\nprocess to consider the available\ninformation and associated risks and\nuncertainties is appropriately governed\nand that its estimates of expected\ncredit losses were reasonable and\nappropriate for the period ended June\n30, 2020 . Fair value JPMorgan Chase\ncarries a portion of its assets and\nliabilities at fair value.

The level 3 balances  \n       would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit    \n       associated with cash collateral.                                           \n                                                                                  \nValuation Estimating fair value\nrequires the application of judgment.\nThe type and level of judgment required\nis largely dependent on the amount of\nobservable market information available\nto the Firm. For instruments valued\nusing internally developed valuation\nmodels and other valuation techniques\nthat use significant unobservable\ninputs and are\n\n89 therefore classified within level 3\nof the valuation hierarchy, judgments\nused to estimate fair value are more\nsignificant than those required when\nestimating the fair value of\ninstruments classified within levels 1\nand 2. In arriving at an estimate of\nfair value for an instrument within\nlevel 3, management must first\ndetermine the appropriate valuation\ntechnique to use. Second, the lack of\nobservability of certain significant\ninputs requires management to assess\nall relevant empirical data in deriving\nvaluation inputs including, for\nexample, transaction details, yield\ncurves, interest rates, prepayment\nrates, default rates, volatilities,\ncorrelations, equity or debt prices,\nvaluations of comparable instruments,\nforeign exchange rates and credit\ncurves. Refer to Note 2 for a further\ndiscussion of the valuation of level 3\ninstruments, including unobservable\ninputs used. For instruments classified\nin levels 2 and 3, management judgment\nmust be applied to assess the\nappropriate level of valuation\nadjustments to reflect counterparty\ncredit quality, the Firm\u2019s\ncreditworthiness, market funding rates,\nliquidity considerations, unobservable\nparameters, and for portfolios that\nmeet specified criteria, the size of\nthe net open risk position. The\njudgments made are typically affected\nby the type of product and its specific\ncontractual terms, and the level of\nliquidity for the product or within the\nmarket as a whole. In periods of\nheightened market volatility and\nuncertainty judgments are further\naffected by the wider variation of\nreasonable valuation estimates,\nparticularly for positions that are\nless liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a\nfurther discussion of valuation\nadjustments applied by the Firm.\nImprecision in estimating unobservable\nmarket inputs or other factors can\naffect the amount of gain or loss\nrecorded for a particular position.\nFurthermore, while the Firm believes\nits valuation methods are appropriate\nand consistent with those of other\nmarket participants, the methods and\nassumptions used reflect management\njudgment and may vary across the Firm\u2019s\nbusinesses and portfolios. The Firm\nuses various methodologies and\nassumptions in the determination of\nfair value. The use of methodologies or\nassumptions different than those used\nby the Firm could result in a different\nestimate of fair value at the reporting\ndate. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed\ndiscussion of the Firm\u2019s valuation\nprocess and hierarchy, and its\ndetermination of fair value for\nindividual financial instruments.\nGoodwill impairment Management applies\nsignificant judgment when testing\ngoodwill for impairment.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) Note\n1 \u2013 Basis of presentation JPMorgan Chase & Co. (\u201cJPMorgan Chase\u201d or \u201cthe Firm\u201d), a\nfinancial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading\nglobal financial services firm and one of the largest banking institutions in the\nU.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking,\nfinancial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking,\nfinancial transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 26 for a\nfurther discussion of the Firm\u2019s business segments. The accounting and financial\nreporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP.\nAdditionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and\nreporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. The unaudited\nConsolidated Financial Statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets\nand liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the\nopinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included such\nthat this interim financial information is fairly stated. These unaudited\nConsolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited\nConsolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in JPMorgan\nChase \u2019s 2019 Form 10-K. Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been\nreclassified to conform with the current presentation. Consolidation The\nConsolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other\nentities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material\nintercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Assets held for\nclients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan\nChase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm determines\nwhether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating\nwhether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity.\nRefer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2019 Form 10-K for a further\ndescription of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s accounting policies regarding consolidation.\nOffsetting assets and liabilities U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative\nreceivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related\ncash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S.\nGAAP also permits securities financing activities to be presented on a net basis\nwhen specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally\nenforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances\nwhen the specified conditions are met.

Prior-period amounts   \n       have been revised to conform with the current presentation.                \n       Accordingly,$0.6billionof the allowance for credit losses at December 31,  \n       2019 and$(0.2) billionof the CECL adoption impact were reclassified.       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Represents the recognition of the nonaccretable difference on purchased    \n  (b)  credit deteriorated loans and the Firm's election to recognize the         \n       reserve for uncollectible accrued interest on credit card loans in the     \n       allowance, both of which resulted in a corresponding increase to loans.    \n                                                                                  \nSecurities Financing Agreements\nAs permitted by the guidance, the Firm\nelected the fair value option for\ncertain securities financing\nagreements. The difference between\ntheir carrying amount and fair value\nwas immaterial and was recorded as part\nof the Firm\u2019s cumulative-effect\nadjustment. Refer to Note 11 for\nfurther information.\nInvestment securities\nUpon adoption, HTM securities are\npresented net of an allowance for\ncredit losses. The guidance also\namended the previous other-than-\ntemporary impairment (\u201cOTTI\u201d) model for\nAFS securities to incorporate an\nallowance. Refer to Note 10 for further\ninformation.\nCredit quality disclosures As a result of the adoption of this guidance, the Firm\nexpanded credit quality disclosures for financial assets measured at amortized\ncost particularly within the retained loan portfolios. Refer to Note 12 for\nfurther information. PCD loans The adoption resulted in a change in the accounting\nfor PCI loans, which are considered purchased credit deteriorated (\u201cPCD\u201d) loans\nunder CECL. Upon adoption, the Firm recognized the nonaccretable difference on PCD\nloans in the allowance, which resulted in a corresponding increase to loans. PCD\nloans are subject to the Firm\u2019s nonaccrual and charge-off policies and are now\nreported in the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio\u2019s residential real\nestate loan class. Refer to Note 12 for further information. Changes in credit\nportfolio segments and classes In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm\nreclassified risk-rated loans and lending-related commitments from the consumer\nexcluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale portoflio segment, to\nalign with the methodology applied when determining the allowance. The Firm also\nrevised its loan classes. Prior- period amounts have been revised to conform with\nthe current presentation. Refer to Note 12 for further information. Accrued\ninterest receivables As permitted by the guidance, the Firm elected to continue\nclassifying accrued interest on loans, including accrued but unbilled interest on\ncredit card loans, and investment securities in accrued interest and accounts\nreceivables on the Consolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans, accrued\ninterest once billed is then recognized in the loan balances, with the related\nallowance recorded in the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the allowance\nfor credit losses on accrued interest on credit card loans are recognized in the\nprovision for credit losses and charge-offs are recognized by reversing interest\nincome. For other loans and securities, the Firm generally does not recognize an\nallowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivables, consistent with its\npolicy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest\nincome. Capital transition provisions As disclosed in the Firm\u2019s 2019 Form 10-K,\nthe Firm initially elected to phase-in the January 1, 2020 (\u201cday 1\u201d) CECL adoption\nimpact to retained earnings of $2.7 billion to CET1 capital, at 25% per year in\neach of 2020 to 2023. As part of their response to the impact of the COVID-19\npandemic, on March 31, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final\nrule that provided the option to delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital\nfor two years, followed by a three-year transition period (\u201cCECL capital\ntransition provisions\u201d).

Transaction costs for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities             \n       inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the    \n       inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for     \n       the Firm\u2019s physical commodities                                            \n                                                                                  \n102\ninventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable     \nvalue is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair\nvalue, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for  \nchanges in fair value. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of the Firm\u2019s     \nhedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure       \ninformation, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each      \nperiod presented.                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n       Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by     \n  (d)  the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short       \n       positions).                                                                \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset    \n       value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not       \n       required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. AtJune\u00a030, 2020,    \n       andDecember\u00a031, 2019, the fair values of these investments, which include  \n  (e)  certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds,    \n       were$702millionand$684million, respectively.

The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied,     \n       including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.             \n                                                                                  \nLevel 3 valuations Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2019 Form 10-K for further\ninformation on the Firm\u2019s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the\ndetermination of fair value for individual financial instruments. The following\ntable presents the Firm\u2019s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation\ntechniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the\nsignificant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the\nweighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to\nclassify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the\nunobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial\ninstruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are\nactively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the\nunobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the\ntable. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of\nlevel 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are\nclassified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of values\npresented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input\nused to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument\nclassification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values\npresented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments\nthat the input is being used to value. In the Firm\u2019s view, the input range,\nweighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of input\nuncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm\u2019s estimates and\nassumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments\nheld by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of\ncharacteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of\nmarket risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly\ndifferent implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different\nunderlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted average values\nwill therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the\ncharacteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.\n103\n                                                                                  \n         Level                                                                    \n         3

Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements The following\ntables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including\nchanges in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within\nlevel 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three and six months ended June 30,\n2020 and 2019 . When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument\nwithin level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable\ninputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial\ninstruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3\ncomponents, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted\nand can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in\nthe table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors\nthat are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the\nobservable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and\nderivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value\nhierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not\nincluded below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the\neffect of the Firm\u2019s risk management activities related to such level 3\ninstruments. 105\n                                                                                  \n                                                \u2026

Carrying value of the loan takes into account the   \n       loan\u2019s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan\u2019s expected     \n       credit losses over its remaining expected life.  The difference between    \n       the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally         \n       attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit         \n       spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair  \n       value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value.                      \n                                                                                  \nThe majority of the Firm\u2019s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair    \nvalue on a recurring basis on the Consolidated balance sheets.

JPMorgan Chase\nregularly monitors various segments of its credit portfolios to assess potential\ncredit risk concentrations and to obtain additional collateral when deemed\nnecessary and permitted under the Firm\u2019s agreements. Senior management is\nsignificantly involved in the credit approval and review process, and risk levels\nare adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm\u2019s risk appetite. In the Firm\u2019s consumer\nportfolio, concentrations are managed primarily by product and by U.S. geographic\nregion, with a key focus on trends and concentrations at the portfolio level,\nwhere potential credit risk concentrations can be remedied through changes in\nunderwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. Refer to Note 12 for additional\ninformation on the geographic composition of the Firm\u2019s consumer loan portfolios.\nIn the wholesale portfolio, credit risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by\nindustry and monitored regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level and on an\nindividual client or counterparty basis. The Firm\u2019s wholesale exposure is managed\nthrough loan syndications and participations, loan sales, securitizations, credit\nderivatives, master netting agreements, collateral and other risk-reduction\ntechniques. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on loans. The Firm does\nnot believe that its exposure to any particular loan product or industry segment\n(e.g., real estate), or its exposure to residential real estate loans with high\nLTV ratios, results in a significant concentration of credit risk. Terms of loan\nproducts and collateral coverage are included in the Firm\u2019s assessment when\nextending credit and establishing its allowance for loan losses. 118\nThe table below presents both on\u2013balance sheet and off\u2013balance sheet consumer and \nwholesale-related credit exposure by the Firm\u2019s three credit portfolio segments as\nof June 30, 2020 , and December 31, 2019 . The wholesale industry of risk category\nis generally based on the client or counterparty\u2019s primary business activity.     \nIn conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans  \nand lending-related commitments from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio\nsegment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the methodology applied \nwhen determining the allowance.

The following tables present a summary of the notional     \namounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased\nas of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The Firm does not use notional amounts \nof credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such          \nderivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the           \nprobability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the        \nreference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of    \nwhich reduces, in the

The Firm\u2019s internal risk ratings\ngenerally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to\nmeet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic\nenvironment) defined by S&P and Moody\u2019s, however the quantitative characteristics\n(e.g., probability of default (\u201cPD\u201d) and loss given default (\u201cLGD\u201d)) may differ as\nthey reflect internal historical experiences and assumptions. Risk ratings are\nassigned at acquisition, are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit\nRisk Management and are adjusted as necessary over the life of the investment for\nupdated information affecting the issuer\u2019s ability to fulfill its obligations.\nAFS securities impairment                                                         \nThe following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses by aging  \ncategory for AFS securities at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 .

                              \n136 As a result of the adoption of the amended AFS securities impairment guidance,\nan allowance for credit losses on AFS securities is required for impaired\nsecurities if a credit loss exists. AFS securities are considered impaired if the\nfair value is less than the amortized cost (excluding accrued interest\nreceivable). The Firm recognizes impairment losses in earnings if the Firm has the\nintent to sell the debt security, or if it is more likely than not that the Firm\nwill be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost.\nIn these circumstances the impairment loss recognized in earnings is equal to the\nfull difference between the amortized cost (excluding accrued interest receivable\nand net of allowance if applicable) and the fair value of the securities. For\nimpaired debt securities that the Firm has the intent and ability to hold, the\nsecurities are evaluated to determine if a credit loss exists. If it is determined\nthat a credit loss exists, that loss is recognized as an allowance for credit\nlosses through the provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome, limited by the amount of impairment. Any impairment not due to credit\nlosses is recorded in OCI. Factors considered in evaluating credit losses include\nadverse conditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or\nfinancial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security; and\npayment structure of the security. When assessing securities issued in a\nsecuritization for credit losses, the Firm estimates cash flows considering\nrelevant market and economic data, underlying loan-level data, and structural\nfeatures of the securitization, such as subordination, excess spread,\novercollateralization or other forms of credit enhancement, and compares the\nlosses projected for the underlying collateral (\u201cpool losses\u201d) against the level\nof credit enhancement in the securitization structure to determine whether these\nfeatures are sufficient to absorb the pool losses, or whether a credit loss\nexists. For beneficial interests in securitizations that are rated below \u201cAA\u201d at\ntheir acquisition, or that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in\nsuch a way that the Firm would not recover substantially all of its recorded\ninvestment, the Firm evaluates impairment for credit losses when there is an\nadverse change in expected cash flows. Unrealized losses on AFS securities\nincreased during the period ended June 30, 2020 as credit spreads widened during\nthe first quarter amid volatile financial markets in connection with the COVID-19\npandemic and tightened in the second quarter. The increase was largely related to\ncollateralized loan obligations which had gross unrealized losses of $ 590million\nas of June 30, 2020 compared to $ 2.0billion as of March 31, 2020. Approximately\n99% of these collateralized loan obligations are rated \u201cAAA\u201d, and the average\ncredit enhancement was 37% . Credit enhancement in collateralized loan obligations\nis primarily in the form of overcollateralization, which is the excess of the par\namount of collateral over the par amount of securities. Management assessed the\nprojected collateral performance and the structural protections of these\nsecurities including underlying loan defaults and loss severity to determine if a\ncredit loss exists. Based on this assessment, the Firm believes the unrealized\nlosses on collateralized loan obligations are not due to credit losses. Allowance\nfor credit losses Based on its assessment, the Firm did not recognize an allowance\nfor credit losses on impaired AFS securities as of January 1 or June 30, 2020 .\n137\n\nHTM securities \u2013 credit risk The adoption of the CECL accounting guidance requires\nmanagement to estimate expected credit losses on HTM securities over the remaining\nexpected life and recognize this estimate as an allowance for credit losses. As a\nresult of the adoption of this guidance, the Firm recognized an allowance for\ncredit losses on HTM obligations of U.S. states and municipalities of $ 10million\nas a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2020.\nCredit quality indicator The primary credit quality indicator for HTM securities\nis the risk rating assigned to each security. At June 30, 2020 , all HTM\nsecurities were rated investment grade and were current and accruing, with\napproximately 95% rated AAA. Allowance for credit losses The allowance for credit\nlosses on HTM obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and commercial\nmortgage-backed securities is calculated by applying statistical credit loss\nfactors (estimated PD and LGD) to the amortized cost (excluding accrued interest\nreceivable). The credit loss factors are derived using a weighted average of five\ninternally developed eight-quarter macroeconomic scenarios, followed by a single\nyear straight-line interpolation to revert to long run historical information for\nperiods beyond the forecast period. Refer to Note 13 for further information on\nthe eight-quarter macroeconomic forecast. The allowance for credit losses on HTM\ncollateralized loan obligations is calculated as the difference between the\namortized cost (excluding accrued interest receivable) and the present value of\nthe cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the security\u2019s effective\ninterest rate. These cash flow estimates are developed based on expectations of\nunderlying collateral performance derived using the eight-quarter macroeconomic\nforecast and the single year straight-line interpolation, as well as considering\nthe structural features of the security. The application of different inputs and\nassumptions into the calculation of the allowance for credit losses is subject to\nsignificant management judgment, and emphasizing one input or assumption over\nanother, or considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of\nthe allowance for credit losses on HTM securities. The allowance for credit losses\non HTM securities was $ 23million as of June 30, 2020 , reflecting $ 4million and\n$ 13million recognized in the provision for credit losses for the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2020 , respectively.\nSelected impacts of investment                                                    \nsecurities on the Consolidated

Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where     \n       applicable.

Securities financing agreements are treated as collateralized\nfinancings on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated balance sheets. Where appropriate under\napplicable accounting guidance, securities financing agreements with the same\ncounterparty are reported on a net basis. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion\nof the offsetting of assets and liabilities. Fees received and paid in connection\nwith securities financing agreements are recorded over the life of the agreement\nin interest income and interest expense on the Consolidated statements of income.\nThe Firm has elected the fair value option for certain securities financing\nagreements. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding the fair value\noption. The securities financing agreements for which the fair value option has\nbeen elected are reported within securities purchased under resale agreements,\nsecurities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, and securities borrowed on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements carried at fair value,\ncurrent-period interest accruals are recorded within interest income and interest\nexpense, with changes in fair value reported in principal transactions revenue.\nHowever, for financial instruments containing embedded derivatives that would be\nseparately accounted for in accordance with accounting guidance for hybrid\ninstruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest elements, are\nreported in principal transactions revenue. Securities financing agreements not\nelected under the fair value option are measured at amortized cost. As a result of\nthe Firm\u2019s credit risk mitigation practices described below, the Firm did not hold\nany allowance for credit losses with respect to resale and securities borrowed\narrangements as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Credit risk mitigation\npractices Securities financing agreements expose the Firm primarily to credit and\nliquidity risk. To manage these risks, the Firm monitors the value of the\nunderlying securities (predominantly high-quality securities collateral, including\ngovernment-issued debt and U.S. GSEs and government agencies MBS) that it has\nreceived from or provided to its counterparties compared to the value of cash\nproceeds and exchanged collateral, and either requests additional collateral or\nreturns securities or collateral when appropriate. Margin levels are initially\nestablished based upon the counterparty, the type of underlying securities, and\nthe permissible collateral, and are monitored on an ongoing basis. In resale and\nsecurities borrowed agreements, the Firm is exposed to credit risk to the extent\nthat the value of the securities received is less than initial cash principal\nadvanced and any collateral amounts exchanged. In repurchase and securities loaned\nagreements, credit risk exposure arises to the extent that the value of underlying\nsecurities advanced exceeds the value of the initial cash principal received, and\nany collateral amounts exchanged. Additionally, the Firm typically enters into\nmaster netting agreements and other similar arrangements with its counterparties,\nwhich provide for the right to liquidate the underlying securities and any\ncollateral amounts exchanged in the event of a counterparty default. It is also\nthe Firm\u2019s policy to take possession, where possible, of the securities underlying\nresale and securities borrowed agreements. Refer to Note 24 for further\ninformation regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities\nfinancing agreements. 140 The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of\nthe Firm\u2019s securities financing agreements as of June 30, 2020 and December 31,\n2019 . When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a\nmaster netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting\ncriteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance\nsheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with\nthe same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash\ncollateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the\ncounterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance\nsheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with\nrespect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with\nsecurities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria\nunder U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table below as \u201cAmounts not nettable on the\nConsolidated balance sheets,\u201d and reduces the \u201cNet amounts\u201d presented. Where a\nlegal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing\nbalances are presented gross in the \u201cNet amounts\u201d below.\n

The determination of whether\nto recognize a charge-off includes many\nfactors, including the prioritization\nof the Firm\u2019s claim in bankruptcy,\nexpectations of the\nworkout/restructuring of the loan and\nvaluation of the borrower\u2019s equity or\nthe loan collateral.\nWhen a loan is charged down to the                                                \nestimated net realizable value, the                                               \ndetermination of the fair value of the                                            \ncollateral depends on the type of                                                 \ncollateral (e.g., securities, real                                                \nestate).

Collateral values are\ntypically updated every six to twelve months , either by obtaining a new appraisal\nor by performing an internal analysis, in accordance with the Firm\u2019s policies. The\nFirm also considers both borrower- and market-specific factors, which may result\nin obtaining appraisal updates or broker price opinions at more frequent\nintervals.\n\nLoans held-for-sale Loans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair\nvalue, with valuation changes recorded in noninterest revenue. For consumer loans,\nthe valuation is performed on a portfolio basis. For wholesale loans, the\nvaluation is performed on an individual loan basis. Interest income on loans held-\nfor-sale is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Loan\norigination fees or costs and purchase price discounts or premiums are deferred in\na contra loan account until the related loan is sold. The deferred fees or costs\nand discounts or premiums are an adjustment to the basis of the loan and therefore\nare included in the periodic determination of the lower of cost or fair value\nadjustments and/or the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale. Because these\nloans are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value, the Firm\u2019s allowance for\nloan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans\nheld-for-sale are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above. Loans at\nfair value Loans used in a market-making strategy or risk managed on a fair value\nbasis are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in\nnoninterest revenue. Interest income on these loans is accrued and recognized\nbased on the contractual rate of interest. Changes in fair value are recognized in\nnoninterest revenue. Loan origination fees are recognized upfront in noninterest\nrevenue. Loan origination costs are recognized in the associated expense category\nas incurred. Because these loans are recognized at fair value, the Firm\u2019s\nallowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans.\nHowever, loans at fair value are subject to the nonaccrual policies described\nabove. Refer to Note 3 for further information on the Firm\u2019s elections of fair\nvalue accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 and Note 3 for\nfurther information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading\nassets.\n\n144\n\nLoan classification changes Loans in the held-for-investment portfolio that\nmanagement decides to sell are transferred to the held-for-sale portfolio at the\nlower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer. Credit-related losses are\ncharged against the allowance for loan losses; non-credit related losses such as\nthose due to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are\nrecognized in noninterest revenue. In the event that management decides to retain\na loan in the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to the held-for-\ninvestment portfolio at amortized cost on the date of transfer. These loans are\nsubsequently assessed for impairment based on the Firm\u2019s allowance methodology.\nRefer to Note 13 for a further discussion of the methodologies used in\nestablishing the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses. Loan modifications The Firm\nseeks to modify certain loans in conjunction with its loss mitigation activities.\nThrough the modification, JPMorgan Chase grants one or more concessions to a\nborrower who is experiencing financial difficulty in order to minimize the Firm\u2019s\neconomic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral, and to\nultimately maximize payments received by the Firm from the borrower. The\nconcessions granted vary by program and by borrower-specific characteristics, and\nmay include interest rate reductions, term extensions, payment delays, principal\nforgiveness, or the acceptance of equity or other assets in lieu of payments. Such\nmodifications are accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term and\nother insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not\nTDRs. Loans, except for credit card loans, modified in a TDR are generally placed\non nonaccrual status, although in many cases such loans were already on nonaccrual\nstatus prior to modification. These loans may be returned to performing status\n(the accrual of interest is resumed) if the following criteria are met: (i) the\nborrower has performed under the modified terms for a minimum of six months and/or\nsix payments, and (ii) the Firm has an expectation that repayment of the modified\nloan is reasonably assured based on, for example, the borrower\u2019s debt capacity and\nlevel of future earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other current market\nconsiderations. In certain limited and well-defined circumstances in which the\nloan is current at the modification date, such loans are not placed on nonaccrual\nstatus at the time of modification. Loans modified in TDRs are generally measured\nfor impairment using the Firm\u2019s established asset-specific allowance methodology,\nwhich considers the expected re-default rates for the modified loans. A loan\nmodified in a TDR generally remains subject to the asset-specific component of the\nallowance throughout its remaining life, regardless of whether the loan is\nperforming and has been returned to accrual status.

Additionally, LTV or        \n     combined LTV ratios can provide insight into a borrower\u2019s continued          \n     willingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-LTV loans tends to be    \n     greater than that for loans where the borrower has equity in the             \n     collateral. The geographic distribution of the loan collateral also          \n     provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio, as factors such  \n  \u2022  as the regional economy, home price changes and specific events such as      \n     natural disasters, will affect credit quality. The borrower\u2019s current or     \n     \u201crefreshed\u201d FICO score is a secondary credit quality indicator for certain   \n     loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower\u2019s credit payment     \n     history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a low FICO score (less than660 )is  \n     considered to be of higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a higher      \n     FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high LTV ratio and a low    \n     FICO score is at greater risk of default than a loan to a borrower that has  \n     both a high LTV ratio and a high FICO score.                                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n     For scored auto and business banking loans, geographic distribution is an    \n     indicator of the credit performance of the portfolio.

concessions to borrowers who are experiencing\nfinancial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications\nthat are not considered concessions are not TDRs. The impact of these\nmodifications, as well as new TDRs, were not material to the Firm for the three\nand six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 . Additional commitments to lend to\nborrowers whose loans have been modified in TDRs as of June 30, 2020 and December\n31, 2019 were not material.\n\n152 Credit card loan portfolio The credit card portfolio segment includes credit\ncard loans originated and purchased by the Firm. Delinquency rates are the primary\ncredit quality indicator for credit card loans as they provide an early warning\nthat borrowers may be experiencing difficulties ( 30 days past due); information\non those borrowers that have been delinquent for a longer period of time ( 90 days\npast due) is also considered. In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic\ndistribution of the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the\nportfolio based on the regional economy. While the borrower\u2019s credit score is\nanother general indicator of credit quality, the Firm does not view credit scores\nas a primary indicator of credit quality because the borrower\u2019s credit score tends\nto be a lagging indicator. The distribution of such scores provides a general\nindicator of credit quality trends within the portfolio; however, the score does\nnot capture all factors that would be predictive of future credit performance.\nRefreshed FICO score information, which is obtained at least quarterly, for a\nstatistically significant random sample of the credit card portfolio is indicated\nin the following table. FICO is considered to be the industry benchmark for credit\nscores. The Firm generally originates new card accounts to prime consumer\nborrowers. However, certain cardholders\u2019 FICO scores may decrease over time,\ndepending on the performance of the cardholder and changes in the credit score\ncalculation.\n\nThe following table provides information on delinquency, which is the primary\ncredit quality indicator for retained credit card loans.\n                                                                                  \n  (in

to credit\ncard borrowers who are experiencing\nfinancial difficulty. The Firm grants\nconcessions for most of the credit card\nloans under long-term programs.

The primary\ncredit quality indicator for wholesale\nloans is the internal risk rating\nassigned to each loan. Risk ratings are\nused to identify the credit quality of\nloans and differentiate risk within the\nportfolio. Risk ratings on loans\nconsider the PD and the LGD. The PD is\nthe likelihood that a loan will\ndefault. The LGD is the estimated loss\non the loan that would be realized upon\nthe default of the borrower and takes\ninto consideration collateral and\nstructural support for each credit\nfacility. Management considers several\nfactors to determine an appropriate\ninternal risk rating, including the\nobligor\u2019s debt capacity and financial\nflexibility, the level of the obligor\u2019s\nearnings, the amount and sources for\nrepayment, the level and nature of\ncontingencies, management strength, and\nthe industry and geography in which the\nobligor operates. The Firm\u2019s internal\nrisk ratings generally align with the\nqualitative characteristics (e.g.,\nborrower capacity to meet financial\ncommitments and vulnerability to\nchanges in the economic environment)\ndefined by S&P and Moody\u2019s, however the\nquantitative characteristics (e.g., PD\nand LGD) may differ as they reflect\ninternal historical experiences and\nassumptions. The Firm considers\ninternal ratings equivalent to\nBBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment\ngrade, and these ratings have a lower\nPD and/or lower LGD than non-investment\ngrade ratings. Noninvestment-grade\nratings are further classified as\nnoncriticized and criticized, and the\ncriticized portion is further\nsubdivided into performing and\nnonaccrual loans, representing\nmanagement\u2019s assessment of the\ncollectibility of principal and\ninterest. Criticized loans have a\nhigher PD than noncriticized loans. The\nFirm\u2019s definition of criticized aligns\nwith the U.S. banking regulatory\ndefinition of criticized exposures,\nwhich consist of special mention,\nsubstandard and doubtful categories .\nRisk ratings are reviewed on a regular\nand ongoing basis by Credit Risk\nManagement and are adjusted as\nnecessary for updated information\naffecting the obligor\u2019s ability to\nfulfill its obligations. As noted\nabove, the risk rating of a loan\nconsiders the industry in which the\nobligor conducts its operations. As\npart of the overall credit risk\nmanagement framework, the Firm focuses\non the management and diversification\nof its industry and client exposures,\nwith particular attention paid to\nindustries with actual or potential\ncredit concern.

The five                                           \n158 macroeconomic scenarios consist of a central, relative adverse, extreme\nadverse, relative upside and extreme upside scenario, and are updated by the\nFirm\u2019s central forecasting team. The scenarios take into consideration the Firm\u2019s\noverarching economic outlook, internal perspectives from subject matter experts\nacross the Firm , and market consensus and involve a governed process that\nincorporates feedback from senior management across LOBs, Corporate Finance and\nRisk Management. The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs to degrees not\nexperienced in recent history, which creates additional challenges in the use of\nmodeled credit loss estimates and increases the reliance on management judgment.\nDuring the second quarter, certain MEVs were well outside the range of historical\nexperience on which the Firm\u2019s models had been calibrated and therefore\nadjustments were required to appropriately address these economic circumstances.\nFor example, while forecasted U.S. employment rates in certain of the Firm\u2019s\nscenarios are higher than historical experience, such rates are developed on a\nreported basis and do not reflect the significant mitigating impact of current\ngovernment unemployment benefits and other stimulus programs. Consequently,\nmanagement considered such mitigating impact to arrive at an effective\nunemployment rate, which informed modeled credit loss estimates, particularly in\nthe consumer portfolio. In addition, for the wholesale portfolio, management used\nthe historical relationship between credit spreads and portfolio default rates to\ninform the adjustment of the Firm\u2019s modeled loss estimates. The quantitative\ncalculation is further adjusted to take into consideration model imprecision,\nemerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet\nreflected in the calculation. These adjustments are accomplished in part by\nanalyzing the historical loss experience, including during stressed periods, for\neach major product or model. Management applies judgement in making this\nadjustment, including taking into account uncertainties associated with the\neconomic and political conditions, quality of underwriting standards, borrower\nbehavior, credit concentrations or deterioration within an industry, product or\nportfolio, as well as other relevant internal and external factors affecting the\ncredit quality of the portfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships\nbetween these factors create further uncertainties. In the second quarter of 2020,\nthese qualitative adjustments also consider additional weight placed on the\nrelative and extreme adverse scenarios, as a result of increased uncertainty\nrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic. The application of different inputs into the\nquantitative calculation, and the assumptions used by management to adjust the\nquantitative calculation, are subject to significant management judgment, and\nemphasizing one input or assumption over another, or considering other inputs or\nassumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for loan losses and the\nallowance for lending-related commitments. Asset-specific component To determine\nthe asset-specific component of the allowance, collateral-dependent loans\n(including those loans for which foreclosure is probable) and larger, nonaccrual\nrisk-rated loans in the wholesale portfolio segment are generally evaluated\nindividually, while smaller loans (both scored and risk-rated) are aggregated for\nevaluation using factors relevant for the respective class of assets. The Firm\ngenerally measures the asset-specific allowance as the difference between the\namortized cost of the loan and the present value of the cash flows expected to be\ncollected, discounted at the loan\u2019s original effective interest rate. Subsequent\nchanges in impairment are generally recognized as an adjustment to the allowance\nfor loan losses. For collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of collateral less\nestimated costs to sell is used to determine the charge-off amount for declines in\nvalue (to reduce the amortized cost of the loan to the fair value of collateral)\nor the amount of negative allowance that should be recognized (for recoveries of\nprior charge-offs associated with improvements in the fair value of collateral).\nThe asset-specific component of the allowance for loan losses that have been or\nare expected to be modified in TDRs incorporates the effect of the modification on\nthe loan\u2019s expected cash flows (including forgone interest, principal forgiveness,\nas well as other concessions), and also the potential for redefault. For\nresidential real estate loans modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs, the\nFirm develops product-specific probability of default estimates, which are applied\nat a loan level to compute expected losses. In developing these probabilities of\ndefault, the Firm considers the relationship between the credit quality\ncharacteristics of the underlying loans and certain assumptions about housing\nprices and unemployment, based upon industry-wide data. The Firm also considers\nits own historical loss experience to-date based on actual redefaulted modified\nloans. For credit card loans modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs,\nexpected losses incorporate projected delinquencies and charge-offs based on the\nFirm\u2019s historical experience by type of modification program. For wholesale loans\nmodified or expected to be modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate\nmanagement\u2019s expectation of the borrower\u2019s ability to repay under the modified\nterms. Estimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows is highly judgmental\nas these cash flow projections rely upon estimates such as loss severities, asset\nvaluations, default rates (including redefault rates on modified loans), the\namounts and timing of interest or principal payments (including any expected\nprepayments) or other factors that are reflective of current and expected market\nconditions. These estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as the\nduration of current overall economic conditions, industry-, portfolio-, or\nborrower-specific factors, the expected outcome of insolvency proceedings as well\nas, in certain circumstances, other economic factors. All of these estimates and\nassumptions require significant management judgment and certain assumptions are\nhighly subjective. 159\nAllowance for credit losses and related information                               \nThe table below summarizes information about the allowances for loan losses and   \nlending-related commitments, and includes a breakdown of loans and lending-related\ncommitments by impairment methodology. Refer to Note 10 for further information on\nthe allowance for credit losses on investment securities.                         \nThe adoption of the CECL accounting guidance resulted in a change in the\naccounting for PCI loans, which are considered PCD loans. In conjunction with the\nadoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and lending-related\ncommitments from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment to the\nwholesale portfolio segment, to align with the methodology applied when\ndetermining the allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with\nthe current presentation.

These\ninclude, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider ,\ninvestor , underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian.\nThese transactions are conducted at arm\u2019s-length, and individual credit decisions\nare based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the\nquality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct\nthe activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic\nperformance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the\nFirm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these\npositions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record\nand report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. Tax credit\nvehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which\nare limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable\nhousing , energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered\nVIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has\ncontrol over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and\naccordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally\ninvests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily\nthrough the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss\nexposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $\n21.0billion and $ 19.1billion , of which $ 6.1billion and $ 5.5billion was\nunfunded at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. In order to reduce\nthe risk of loss, the Firm assesses each project and withholds varying amounts of\nits capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note\n25 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2019 Form 10-K for further information on affordable\nhousing tax credits. Refer to Note 23 of this Form 10-Q for more information on\noff-balance sheet lending-related commitments. 165 Customer municipal bond\nvehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB\ntrusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In\ncertain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered\ninto a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions,\nupon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party\nResidual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect\nResidual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds.\nThe Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have\nthe power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of\nthe municipal bond vehicle. The Firm\u2019s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to\ncustomer TOB trusts at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was $ 6.1billion and $\n5.5billion , respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at June 30,\n2020 and December 31, 2019 , was $ 9.7billion and $ 8.6billion , respectively.\nRefer to Note 23 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related\ncommitments. Loan securitizations The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of\nloans, including residential mortgage, credit card, and commercial mortgage.

These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the\npurpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee\nprovisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into\nsecuritization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are\ntypically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does\nnot consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is\nnot the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is\nobligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans\nwith the purchaser.

The adoption of the\nguidance requires recognition of an impairment loss when the estimated fair value\nof a reporting unit falls below its carrying value. It eliminated the requirement\nthat an impairment loss be recognized only if the estimated implied fair value of\nthe goodwill is below its carrying value. Refer to Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n2019 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the primary method used to estimate the\nfair value of the reporting units and the assumptions used in the goodwill\nimpairment test. Goodwill is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of\neach fiscal year, or more often if events or circumstances, such as adverse\nchanges in the business climate, indicate that there may be an impairment.\nUnanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit losses,\nincreases in capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market\nconditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the\nestimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the\nFirm\u2019s reporting units to decline in the future, which could result in a material\nimpairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the\nassociated goodwill. As of June 30, 2020 , the Firm reviewed current economic\nconditions, including the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on business\nperformance, estimated market cost of equity, and also reviewed actuals and\nprojections of business performance for all its reporting units. The Firm has\nconcluded that the goodwill allocated to its reporting units was no t impaired as\nof June 30, 2020 , or December 31, 2019 , nor was goodwill written off due to\nimpairment during the six months ended June 30, 2020 or 2019 .\n\n168\n\nMortgage servicing rights\nMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing        \nservicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future        \nservicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the    \nloans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, \neffectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary  \nfee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale  \nor securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Note s 2   \nand 15 of JPMorgan Chase \u2019s 2019 Form 10-K for a further description of the MSR   \nasset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs.                  \nThe

The Firm\u2019s credit risk  \n  (d)  associated with these servicer advances is minimal because reimbursement   \n       of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In  \n       addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if     \n       the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance.

The contractual amount of these financial instruments\nrepresents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or\nclient draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation\nunder the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to\nperform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and\nguarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired\nwithout being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual\namount of these instruments is not, in the Firm\u2019s view, representative of its\nexpected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of\nJPMorgan Chase \u2019s 2019 Form 10-K for a further discussion of lending-related\ncommitments and guarantees, and the Firm\u2019s related accounting policies. To provide\nfor expected credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related\ncommitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is\nmaintained. Refer to Note 13 for further information regarding the allowance for\ncredit losses on lending-related commitments, including the impact of the Firm\u2019s\nadoption of the CECL accounting guidance on January 1, 2020. The following table\nsummarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet\nlending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at June\n30, 2020 , and December 31, 2019 . The amounts in the table below for credit card,\nhome equity and certain scored business banking lending-related commitments\nrepresent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not\nexperienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these\nproducts will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit\ncard and certain scored business banking lines of credit by providing the borrower\nnotice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the\nFirm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60days or more past\ndue. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in\nthe value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable\ndecline in the creditworthiness of the borrower. 178\n\nIn conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans\nand lending-related commitments from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio\nsegment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the methodology applied\nwhen determining the allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform\nwith the current presentation.

If a dispute is\nresolved in the cardholder\u2019s favor,\nMerchant Services will (through the\ncardholder\u2019s issuing bank) credit or\nrefund the amount to the cardholder and\nwill charge back the transaction to the\nmerchant. If Merchant Services is\nunable to collect the amount from the\nmerchant, Merchant Services will bear\nthe loss for the amount credited or\nrefunded to the cardholder. Merchant\nServices mitigates this risk by\nwithholding future settlements,\nretaining cash reserve accounts or\nobtaining other collateral. In\naddition, Merchant Services recognizes\na valuation allowance that covers the\npayment or performance risk to the Firm\nrelated to charge-backs. The carrying\nvalue of the valuation allowance was $\n20million and $ 11million at June 30,\n2020 and December 31, 2019,\nrespectively.\n\n180\n\nLoan sales- and securitization-related\nindemnifications In connection with the\nFirm\u2019s mortgage loan sale and\nsecuritization activities with GSEs the\nFirm has made representations and\nwarranties that the loans sold meet\ncertain requirements, and that may\nrequire the Firm to repurchase mortgage\nloans and/or indemnify the loan\npurchaser if such representations and\nwarranties are breached by the Firm.\nFurther, although the Firm\u2019s\nsecuritizations are predominantly\nnonrecourse, the Firm does provide\nrecourse servicing in certain limited\ncases where it agrees to share credit\nrisk with the owner of the mortgage\nloans. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2019 Form 10-K for additional\ninformation. The liability related to\nrepurchase demands associated with\nprivate label securitizations is\nseparately evaluated by the Firm in\nestablishing its litigation reserves.\nRefer to Note 25 of this Form 10-Q and\nNote 30 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2019 Form\n10-K for additional information\nregarding litigation. Sponsored member\nrepo program The Firm acts as a\nsponsoring member to clear eligible\novernight resale and repurchase\nagreements through the Government\nSecurities Division of the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation (\u201cFICC\u201d) on behalf\nof clients that become sponsored\nmembers under the FICC\u2019s rules. The\nFirm also guarantees to the FICC the\nprompt and full payment and performance\nof its sponsored member clients\u2019\nrespective obligations under the FICC\u2019s\nrules. The Firm minimizes its liability\nunder these overnight guarantees by\nobtaining a security interest in the\ncash or high-quality securities\ncollateral that the clients place with\nthe clearing house therefore the Firm\nexpects the risk of loss to be remote.\nThe Firm\u2019s maximum possible exposure,\nwithout taking into consideration the\nassociated collateral, is included in\nthe Exchange & clearing house\nguarantees and commitments line on page\n179 .

This                                                 \nestimated aggregate range of reasonably                                           \npossible losses was based upon                                                    \ninformation available as of that date                                             \nfor those proceedings in which the Firm                                           \nbelieves that an estimate of reasonably                                           \npossible loss can be made.

India\u2019s Enforcement\nDirectorate (\u201cED\u201d) is investigating\nJPMorgan India Private Limited in\nconnection with investments made in\n2010 and 2012 by two offshore funds\nformerly managed by JPMorgan Chase\nentities into residential housing\nprojects developed by the Amrapali\nGroup (\u201cAmrapali\u201d). In 2017, numerous\ncreditors filed civil claims against\nAmrapali including petitions brought by\nhome buyers relating to delays in\ndelivering or failure to deliver\nresidential units. The home buyers\u2019\npetitions have been overseen by the\nSupreme Court of India since 2017\npursuant to its jurisdiction over\npublic interest litigation. In July\n2019, the Supreme Court of India issued\nan order making preliminary findings\nthat Amrapali and other parties,\nincluding unspecified JPMorgan Chase\nentities and the offshore funds that\nhad invested in the projects, violated\ncertain currency control and money\nlaundering provisions, and ordering the\nED to conduct a further inquiry under\nIndia\u2019s Prevention of Money Laundering\nAct (\u201cPMLA\u201d) and Foreign Exchange\nManagement Act (\u201cFEMA\u201d). In May 2020,\nthe Enforcement Directorate issued a\nprovisional attachment order as part of\nthe criminal PMLA proceedings freezing\napproximately $ 25million held by\nJPMorgan India Private Limited. In June\n2020, the funds were transferred to an\naccount held by the Supreme Court of\nIndia. A separate civil proceeding\nrelating to alleged FEMA violations is\nongoing. The Firm is responding to and\ncooperating with the investigation.\nFederal Republic of Nigeria Litigation.\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. operated an\nescrow and depository account for the\nFederal Government of Nigeria (\u201cFGN\u201d)\nand two major international oil\ncompanies. The account held\napproximately $ 1.1billion in\nconnection with a dispute among the\nclients over rights to an oil field.\nFollowing the settlement of the\ndispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid\nout the monies in the account in 2011\nand 2013 in accordance with directions\nreceived from its clients. In November\n2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria\n(\u201cFRN\u201d) commenced a claim in the\nEnglish High Court for approximately $\n875million in payments made out of the\naccounts. The FRN, claiming to be the\nsame entity as the FGN, alleges that\nthe payments were instructed as part of\na complex fraud not involving JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A., but that JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. was or should have\nbeen on notice that the payments may be\nfraudulent. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\napplied for summary judgment and was\nunsuccessful. The claim is ongoing and\nno trial date has been set. Foreign\nExchange Investigations and Litigation.\nThe Firm previously reported\nsettlements with certain government\nauthorities relating to its foreign\nexchange (\u201cFX\u201d) sales and trading\nactivities and controls related to\nthose activities. Among those\nresolutions, in May 2015, the Firm\npleaded\n\n182 guilty to a single violation of\nfederal antitrust law. In January 2017,\nthe Firm was sentenced, with judgment\nentered thereafter and a term of\nprobation ending in January 2020. The\nterm of probation has concluded, with\nthe Firm remaining in good standing\nthroughout the probation period. The\nDepartment of Labor granted the Firm a\nfive-year exemption of disqualification\nthat allows the Firm and its affiliates\nto continue to rely on the Qualified\nProfessional Asset Manager exemption\nunder the Employee Retirement Income\nSecurity Act (\u201cERISA\u201d) until January\n2023. The Firm will need to reapply in\ndue course for a further exemption to\ncover the remainder of the ten-year\ndisqualification period. A South Africa\nCompetition Commission matter is the\nremaining FX-related governmental\ninquiry, and is currently pending\nbefore the South Africa Competition\nTribunal. In August 2018, the United\nStates District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York granted final\napproval to the Firm\u2019s settlement of a\nconsolidated class action brought by\nU.S.-based plaintiffs, which\nprincipally alleged violations of\nfederal antitrust laws based on an\nalleged conspiracy to manipulate\nforeign exchange rates and also sought\ndamages on behalf of persons who\ntransacted in FX futures and options on\nfutures. Certain members of the\nsettlement class filed requests to the\nCourt to be excluded from the class,\nand certain of them filed a complaint\nagainst the Firm and a number of other\nforeign exchange dealers in November\n2018. A number of these actions remain\npending. Further, putative class\nactions have been filed against the\nFirm and a number of other foreign\nexchange dealers on behalf of certain\nconsumers who purchased foreign\ncurrencies at allegedly inflated rates\nand purported indirect purchasers of FX\ninstruments; these actions also remain\npending in the District Court. In 2020,\nthe Firm and 11 other defendants agreed\nto settle the class action filed by\npurported indirect purchasers for a\ntotal of $ 10million . That settlement\nremains subject to court approval. In\naddition, some FX-related individual\nand putative class actions based on\nsimilar alleged underlying conduct have\nbeen filed outside the U.S., including\nin the U.K., Israel and Australia.\nInterchange Litigation. G roups of\nmerchants and retail associations filed\na series of class action complaints\nalleging that Visa and Mastercard, as\nwell as certain banks, conspired to set\nthe price of credit and debit card\ninterchange fees and enacted related\nrules in violation of antitrust laws.\nIn 2012, the parties initially settled\nthe cases for a cash payment, a\ntemporary reduction of credit card\ninterchange, and modifications to\ncertain credit card network rules. In\n2017, after the approval of that\nsettlement was reversed on appeal, the\ncase was remanded to the United States\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District\nof New York for further proceedings\nconsistent with the appellate decision.\nThe original class action was divided\ninto two separate actions, one seeking\nprimarily monetary relief and the other\nseeking primarily injunctive relief. In\nSeptember 2018, the parties to the\nclass action seeking monetary relief\nfinalized an agreement which amends and\nsupersedes the prior settlement\nagreement. Pursuant to this settlement,\nthe defendants collectively contributed\nan additional $ 900million to the\napproximately $ 5.3billion previously\nheld in escrow from the original\nsettlement. In December 2019, the\namended agreement was approved by the\nDistrict Court. Certain merchants\nappealed the District Court\u2019s approval\norder, and those appeals are pending.\nBased on the percentage of merchants\nthat opted out of the amended class\nsettlement, $ 700million has been\nreturned to the defendants from the\nsettlement escrow in accordance with\nthe settlement agreement. The class\naction seeking primarily injunctive\nrelief continues separately. In\naddition, certain merchants have filed\nindividual actions raising similar\nallegations against Visa and\nMastercard, as well as against the Firm\nand other banks, and some of those\nactions remain pending. LIBOR and Other\nBenchmark Rate Investigations and\nLitigation. JPMorgan Chase has\nresponded to inquiries from various\ngovernmental agencies and entities\naround the world relating primarily to\nthe British Bankers Association\u2019s\nLondon Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d)\nfor various currencies and the European\nBanking Federation\u2019s Euro Interbank\nOffered Rate (\u201cEURIBOR\u201d). The Swiss\nCompetition Commission\u2019s investigation\nrelating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm\nand other banks are subject, continues.\nIn December 2016, the European\nCommission issued a decision against\nthe Firm and other banks finding an\ninfringement of European antitrust\nrules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has\nfiled an appeal of that decision with\nthe European General Court, and that\nappeal is pending. In addition, the\nFirm has been named as a defendant\nalong with other banks in a series of\nindividual and putative class actions\nrelated to benchmarks, including U.S.\ndollar LIBOR during the period that it\nwas administered by the BBA and, in a\nseparate consolidated putative class\naction, during the period that it was\nadministered by ICE Benchmark\nAdministration. These actions have been\nfiled, or consolidated for pre-trial\npurposes, in the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of New\nYork. In these actions, plaintiffs make\nvarying allegations that in various\nperiods, starting in 2000 or later,\ndefendants either individually or\ncollectively manipulated various\nbenchmark rates by submitting rates\nthat were artificially low or high.\nPlaintiffs allege that they transacted\nin loans, derivatives or other\nfinancial instruments whose values are\naffected by changes in these rates and\nassert a variety of claims including\nantitrust claims seeking treble\ndamages. In actions related to U.S.\ndollar LIBOR during the period that it\nwas administered by the BBA, the Firm\nhas resolved certain of these actions,\nand others are in various stages of\nlitigation. The District Court\ndismissed certain claims, including\nantitrust claims brought by some\nplaintiffs whom the District Court\nfound did not have standing to assert\nsuch claims, and permitted certain\nclaims to proceed, including 183\nantitrust, Commodity Exchange Act,\nSection 10(b) of the Securities\nExchange Act and common law claims. The\nplaintiffs whose antitrust claims were\ndismissed for lack of standing have\nfiled an appeal. The District Court\ngranted class certification of\nantitrust claims related to bonds and\ninterest rate swaps sold directly by\nthe defendants and denied class\ncertification motions filed by other\nplaintiffs. In the consolidated\nputative class action related to the\ntime period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was\nadministered by ICE Benchmark\nAdministration, the District Court\ngranted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss\nplaintiffs\u2019 complaint, and the\nplaintiffs have appealed. The Firm\u2019s\nsettlements of putative class actions\nrelated to Swiss franc LIBOR, the\nSingapore Interbank Offered Rate and\nthe Singapore Swap Offer Rate\n(\u201cSIBOR\u201d), the Australian Bank Bill\nSwap Reference Rate, and certain of the\nputative class actions related to U.S.\ndollar LIBOR remain subject to court\napproval. In the class actions related\nto SIBOR and Swiss franc LIBOR, the\nDistrict Court concluded that the Court\nlacked subject matter jurisdiction, and\nplaintiffs\u2019 appeals of those decisions\nare pending. Metals and U.S. Treasuries\nInvestigations and Litigation and\nRelated Inquiries. Various authorities,\nincluding the Department of Justice\u2019s\nCriminal Division, are conducting\ninvestigations relating to trading\npractices in the metals markets and\nrelated conduct. The Firm also is\nresponding to related requests\nconcerning similar trading-practices\nissues in markets for other financial\ninstruments, such as U.S. Treasuries.\nThe Firm continues to cooperate with\nthese investigations and is currently\nengaged in discussions with various\nregulators about resolving their\nrespective investigations. There is no\nassurance that such discussions will\nresult in settlements. Several putative\nclass action complaints have been filed\nin the United States District Court for\nthe Southern District of New York\nagainst the Firm and certain former\nemployees, alleging a precious metals\nfutures and options price manipulation\nscheme in violation of the Commodity\nExchange Act. Some of the complaints\nalso allege unjust enrichment and\ndeceptive acts or practices under the\nGeneral Business Law of the State of\nNew York. The Court consolidated these\nputative class actions in February\n2019, and the consolidated action is\nstayed through May 2021. In addition,\nseveral putative class actions have\nbeen filed in the United States\nDistrict Courts for the Northern\nDistrict of Illinois and Southern\nDistrict of New York against the Firm,\nalleging manipulation of U.S.\nTreasuries futures and options, and\nbringing claims under the Commodity\nExchange Act. Some of the complaints\nalso allege unjust enrichment. A motion\nis pending before the United States\nJudicial Panel on Multidistrict\nLitigation to transfer and consolidate\nor coordinate the actions. The Firm is\nalso a defendant in a consolidated\naction filed in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York alleging\nmonopolization of silver futures in\nviolation of the Sherman Act. Wendel.\nSince 2012, the French criminal\nauthorities have been investigating a\nseries of transactions entered into by\nsenior managers of Wendel\nInvestissement (\u201cWendel\u201d) during the\nperiod from 2004 through 2007 to\nrestructure their shareholdings in\nWendel. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,\nParis branch provided financing for the\ntransactions to a number of managers of\nWendel in 2007. JPMorgan Chase has\ncooperated with the investigation. The\ninvestigating judges issued an\nordonnance de renvoi in November 2016,\nreferring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to\nthe French tribunal correctionnel for\nalleged complicity in tax fraud. In\nJanuary 2018, the Paris Court of Appeal\nissued a decision cancelling the mise\nen examen of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nThe Court of Cassation, France\u2019s\nhighest court, ruled in September 2018\nthat a mise en examen is a prerequisite\nfor an ordonnance de renvoi and in\nJanuary 2020 ordered the annulment of\nthe ordonnance de renvoi referring\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French\ntribunal correctionnel. In addition, a\nnumber of the managers have commenced\ncivil proceedings against JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. The claims are\nseparate, involve different allegations\nand are at various stages of\nproceedings. * * * In addition to the\nvarious legal proceedings discussed\nabove, JPMorgan Chase and its\nsubsidiaries are named as defendants or\nare otherwise involved in a substantial\nnumber of other legal proceedings. The\nFirm believes it has meritorious\ndefenses to the claims asserted against\nit in its currently outstanding legal\nproceedings and it intends to defend\nitself vigorously. Additional legal\nproceedings may be initiated from time\nto time in the future. The Firm has\nestablished reserves for several\nhundred of its currently outstanding\nlegal proceedings. In accordance with\nthe provisions of U.S. GAAP for\ncontingencies, the Firm accrues for a\nlitigation-related liability when it is\nprobable that such a liability has been\nincurred and the amount of the loss can\nbe reasonably estimated. The Firm\nevaluates its outstanding legal\nproceedings each quarter to assess its\nlitigation reserves, and makes\nadjustments in such reserves, upward or\ndownward, as appropriate, based on\nmanagement\u2019s best judgment after\nconsultation with counsel. The Firm\u2019s\nlegal expense/(benefit) was $\n118million and $ 69million for the\nthree months ended June 30, 2020 and\n2019, respectively, and $ 315million\nand $( 12) million for the six months\nended June 30, 2020 and 2019. There is\nno assurance that the Firm\u2019s litigation\nreserves will not need to be adjusted\nin the future. In view of the inherent\ndifficulty of predicting the outcome of\nlegal proceedings, particularly where\nthe claimants seek very large or\nindeterminate damages, or where the\nmatters present novel legal theories,\ninvolve a large number of parties or\nare in early stages of discovery, the\nFirm cannot state with confidence what\nwill be the eventual outcomes of the\ncurrently pending matters, the timing\nof their ultimate resolution or the\neventual losses, fines, penalties or\nconsequences related to those matters.\nJPMorgan Chase 184 believes, based upon\nits current knowledge and after\nconsultation with counsel,\nconsideration of the material legal\nproceedings described above and after\ntaking into account its current\nlitigation reserves and its estimated\naggregate range of possible losses,\nthat the other legal proceedings\ncurrently pending against it should not\nhave a material adverse effect on the\nFirm\u2019s consolidated financial\ncondition. The Firm notes, however,\nthat in light of the uncertainties\ninvolved in such proceedings, there is\nno assurance that the ultimate\nresolution of these matters will not\nsignificantly exceed the reserves it\nhas currently accrued or that a matter\nwill not have material reputational\nconsequences. As a result, the outcome\nof a particular matter may be material\nto JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operating results\nfor a particular period, depending on,\namong other factors, the size of the\nloss or liability imposed and the level\nof JPMorgan Chase\u2019s income for that\nperiod. 185 Note 26 \u2013 Business segments\n\nThe Firm is managed on an LOB basis.\nThere are four major reportable\nbusiness segments - Consumer &\nCommunity Banking, Corporate &\nInvestment Bank, Commercial Banking and\nAsset & Wealth Management. In addition,\nthere is a Corporate segment. The\nbusiness segments are determined based\non the products and services provided,\nor the type of customer served, and\nthey reflect the manner in which\nfinancial information is currently\nevaluated by the Firm\u2019s Operating\nCommittee.

Based on our reviews, we are\nnot aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying\ninterim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America. We have previously\naudited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of the Firm as of\nDecember 31, 2019, and the related consolidated statements of income,\ncomprehensive income, changes in stockholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for the year\nthen ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 25, 2020, we\nexpressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In\nour opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance\nsheet information as of December 31, 2019, is fairly stated, in all material\nrespects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been\nderived. Basis for Review Results These interim financial statements are the\nresponsibility of the Firm\u2019s management. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(\u201cPCAOB\u201d) and are required to be independent with respect to the Firm in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted\nour review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim\nfinancial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and\nmaking inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It\nis substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the\nstandards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion\nregarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not\nexpress such an opinion.

Origination date LTV ratio The\nLTV ratio at the origination date of\nthe loan. Origination date LTV ratios\nare calculated based on the actual\nappraised values of collateral (i.e.,\nloan-level data) at the origination\ndate. Current estimated LTV ratio An\nestimate of the LTV as of a certain\ndate. The current estimated LTV ratios\nare calculated using estimated\ncollateral values derived from a\nnationally recognized home price index\nmeasured at the metropolitan\nstatistical area (\u201cMSA\u201d) level. These\nMSA-level home price indices consist of\nactual data to the extent available and\nforecasted data where actual data is\nnot available. As a result, the\nestimated collateral values used to\ncalculate these ratios do not represent\nactual appraised loan-level collateral\nvalues; as such, the resulting LTV\nratios are necessarily imprecise and\nshould therefore be viewed as\nestimates. Combined LTV ratio The LTV\nratio considering all available lien\npositions, as well as unused lines,\nrelated to the property. Combined LTV\nratios are used for junior lien home\nequity products.

Option\nARMs The option ARM real estate loan\nproduct is an adjustable-rate mortgage\nloan that provides the borrower with\nthe option each month to make a fully\namortizing, interest-only or minimum\npayment. The minimum payment on an\noption ARM loan is based on the\ninterest rate charged during the\nintroductory period. This introductory\nrate is usually significantly below the\nfully indexed rate. The fully indexed\nrate is calculated using an index rate\nplus a margin. Once the introductory\nperiod ends, the contractual interest\nrate charged on the loan increases to\nthe fully indexed rate and adjusts\nmonthly to reflect movements in the\nindex. The minimum payment is typically\ninsufficient to cover interest accrued\nin the prior month, and any unpaid\ninterest is deferred and added to the\nprincipal balance of the loan. Option\nARM loans are subject to payment\nrecast, which converts the loan to a\nvariable-rate fully amortizing loan\nupon meeting specified loan balance and\nanniversary date triggers. Prime Prime\nmortgage loans are made to borrowers\nwith good credit records who meet\nspecific underwriting requirements,\nincluding prescriptive requirements\nrelated to income and overall debt\nlevels. New prime mortgage borrowers\nprovide full documentation and\ngenerally have reliable payment\nhistories. Subprime Subprime loans are\nloans that, prior to mid-2008, were\noffered to certain customers with one\nor more high risk characteristics,\nincluding but not limited to: (i)\nunreliable or poor payment histories;\n(ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than\n80% (without borrower-paid mortgage\ninsurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income\nratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the\nloan is other than the borrower\u2019s\nprimary residence; or (v) a history of\ndelinquencies or late payments on the\nloan.

JPMorgan Chase grants restricted\nstock and RSUs to certain employees under its share-based compensation programs,\nwhich entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the\nvesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to\n\nholders of common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition of\nparticipating securities. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed\nand undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating\nsecurities, based on their respective rights to receive dividends. PCD: \u201cPurchased\ncredit deteriorated\u201d assets represent acquired financial assets that as of the\ndate of acquisition have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in\ncredit quality since origination, as determined by the Firm. PCI : \u201cPurchased\ncredit-impaired\u201d loans represented certain loans that were acquired and deemed to\nbe credit-impaired on the acquisition date. The superseded FASB guidance allowed\npurchasers to aggregate credit-impaired loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter\ninto one or more pools, provided that the loans had common risk characteristics\n(e.g., product type, LTV ratios, FICO scores, past due status, geographic\nlocation). A pool was then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite\ninterest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows.

In connection with its client-driven market-making\nactivities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and\ncommodities (including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments\nthat reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue also includes certain\nrealized and unrealized gains and losses related to hedge accounting and specified\nrisk-management activities, including: (a) certain derivatives designated in\nqualifying hedge accounting relationships (primarily fair value hedges of\ncommodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific\nrisk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and foreign exchange\nrisk, and (c) other derivatives.

Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent basis between\nBasel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced. Scored portfolios: Consumer loan\nportfolios that predominantly include residential real estate loans, credit card\nloans, auto loans to individuals and certain small business loans.

Asset Management has two\nhigh-level measures of its overall fund\nperformance: Percentage of mutual fund\nassets under management in funds rated\n4- or 5-star : Mutual fund rating\nservices rank funds based on their\nrisk-adjusted performance over various\nperiods. A 5-star rating is the best\nrating and represents the top 10% of\nindustry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star\nrating represents the next 22.5% of\nindustry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star\nrating represents the next 35% of\nindustry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star\nrating represents the next 22.5% of\nindustry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star\nrating is the worst rating and\nrepresents the bottom 10% of industry-\nwide ranked funds. The \u201coverall\nMorningstar rating\u201d is derived from a\nweighted average of the performance\nassociated with a fund\u2019s three-, five-\nand ten-year (if applicable)\nMorningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.\ndomiciled funds, separate star ratings\nare given at the individual share class\nlevel. The Nomura \u201cstar rating\u201d is\nbased on three-year risk-adjusted\nperformance only. Funds with fewer than\nthree years of history are not rated\nand 198 hence excluded from this\nanalysis. All ratings, the assigned\npeer categories and the asset values\nused to derive this analysis are\nsourced from these fund rating\nproviders. The data providers re-\ndenominate the asset values into U.S.\ndollars. This % of AUM is based on star\nratings at the share class level for\nU.S. domiciled funds, and at a \u201cprimary\nshare class\u201d level to represent the\nstar rating of all other funds except\nfor Japan where Nomura provides ratings\nat the fund level. The \u201cprimary share\nclass\u201d, as defined by Morningstar,\ndenotes the share class recommended as\nbeing the best proxy for the portfolio\nand in most cases will be the most\nretail version (based upon annual\nmanagement charge, minimum investment,\ncurrency and other factors). The\nperformance data could have been\ndifferent if all funds/accounts would\nhave been included. Past performance is\nnot indicative of future results.\nPercentage of mutual fund assets under\nmanagement in funds ranked in the 1st\nor 2nd quartile (one, three, and five\nyears): All quartile rankings, the\nassigned peer categories and the asset\nvalues used to derive this analysis are\nsourced from the fund ranking\nproviders. Quartile rankings are done\non the net-of-fee absolute return of\neach fund. The data providers re-\ndenominate the asset values into U.S.\ndollars. This % of AUM is based on fund\nperformance and associated peer\nrankings at the share class level for\nU.S. domiciled funds, at a \u201cprimary\nshare class\u201d level to represent the\nquartile ranking of the U.K.,\nLuxembourg and Hong Kong funds and at\nthe fund level for all other funds. The\n\u201cprimary share class\u201d, as defined by\nMorningstar, denotes the share class\nrecommended as being the best proxy for\nthe portfolio and in most cases will be\nthe most retail version (based upon\nannual management charge, minimum\ninvestment, currency and other\nfactors). Where peer group rankings\ngiven for a fund are in more than one\n\u201cprimary share class\u201d territory both\nrankings are included to reflect local\nmarket competitiveness (applies to\n\u201cOffshore Territories\u201d and \u201cHK SFC\nAuthorized\u201d funds only). The\nperformance data could have been\ndifferent if all funds/accounts would\nhave been included. Past performance is\nnot indicative of future results. 199\n\nItem 3.

The\ncontinuation of the adverse economic\nconditions caused by the pandemic can\nbe expected to have a significant\nadverse effect on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbusinesses and results of operations,\nincluding:\n                                                                                  \n  \u2022  significantly reduced demand for products and services from JPMorgan         \n     Chase\u2019s clients and customers                                                \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n     possible recognition of credit losses and increases in the allowance for     \n  \u2022  credit losses, especially if businesses remain closed, unemployment          \n     continues to rise and clients and customers draw on their lines of credit    \n     or seek additional loans to help finance their businesses                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n     possible material impacts on the value of securities, derivatives and other  \n  \u2022  financial instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes         \n     markets due to market fluctuations                                           \n                                                                                  \n                                                             \n  \u2022  possible downgrades in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit ratings  \n                                                             \n200\n                                                                                  \n     possible constraints on liquidity and capital, whether due to increases in   \n  \u2022  risk-weighted assets related to supporting client activities or to           \n     regulatory actions, and                                                      \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n     the possibility that significant portions of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s workforce are  \n  \u2022  unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines,       \n     sheltering-in-place arrangements, government actions or other restrictions   \n     in connection with the pandemic.                                             \n                                                                                  \nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affects JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbusinesses, results of operations and financial condition, as well as its\nregulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments that\nare highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of\nthe pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties\nin response to the pandemic. In addition, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s participation directly\nor on behalf of customers and clients in U.S. government programs designed to\nsupport individuals, households and businesses impacted by the economic\ndisruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could be criticized and subject\nJPMorgan Chase to increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny, negative\npublicity or\n\nincreased exposure to litigation, which could increase its operational, legal and\ncompliance costs and damage its reputation. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic\nadversely affects JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business, results of operations and financial\ncondition, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks\ndescribed in Risk Factors in the 2019 Form 10-K.
