(the \u201cFirm\u201d) awarded Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nJames Dimon 1,500,000 options in the form of stock appreciation rights.\n\nThis special award reflects the Board\u2019s desire for Mr. Dimon to continue to lead\nthe Firm for a further significant number of years. In making the special award,\nthe Board considered the importance of Mr. Dimon's continuing, long-term\nstewardship of the Firm, leadership continuity, and management succession planning\namidst a highly competitive landscape for executive leadership talent. The Board\nalso took into account other factors, including the Firm's strong performance\nunder Mr. Dimon\u2019s stewardship since 2005, his exemplary leadership, and his\nsignificant contributions to the Firm\u2019s success during his tenure.\n\nThe options are not part of Mr. Dimon's regular annual compensation and will not\nbe awarded on a regularly recurring basis.\n\nThe terms of the grant are distinct from, and are generally more restrictive than,\nother equity grants regularly awarded by the Firm. The options will have an\nexercise price equal to the average of the high and low prices of JPMorgan Chase &\nCo. common stock on July 20, 2021 (the \u201cEffective Date\u201d). The options have a ten-\nyear term, will become exercisable no earlier than July 20, 2026, or five years\nafter the Effective Date, and are subject to clawback and recovery provisions 1 .\nVesting is subject to continuous leadership of the Firm, with certain limited\nexceptions.\n\nMoreover, net shares delivered from the exercise of the options must be held until\nJuly 20, 2031, which coincides with the end of the ten-year term of the options.\nNet shares received from exercise are also subject to the Firm\u2019s stock ownership\nguideline and retention requirements applicable to the Firm\u2019s Operating Committee\nmembers.\n\n1 Equity incentives are subject to the JPMorgan Chase Bonus Recoupment Policy\nwhich applies in the event of a material restatement of the Firm's financial\nresults. In addition, all equity awards granted in 2021 contain recapture\nprovisions that enable the Firm to cancel outstanding awards and/or recover the\nvalue of certain stock distributed under the award in specified circumstances. In\naddition to recapture provisions, portions of equity awards awarded to the\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer are also subject to Protection-based Vesting\nprovisions under which awards may be cancelled as determined by the Compensation &\nManagement Development Committee of the Board of Directors and ratified by the\nBoard of Directors.\n\nA copy of the Terms and Conditions of the award is attached as Exhibit 99.
