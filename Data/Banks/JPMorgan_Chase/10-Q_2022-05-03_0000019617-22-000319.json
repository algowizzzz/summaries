Comparisons\nnoted in the sections below are for the first quarter of 2022 versus the first\nquarter of 2021, unless otherwise specified. Firmwide overview JPMorgan Chase\nreported net income of $8.3 billion for the first quarter of 2022, or $2.63 per\nshare, on net revenue of $30.7 billion. The Firm reported ROE of 13% and ROTCE of\n16%. The Firm's results for the first quarter of 2022 included a net increase in\nthe allowance for credit losses of $902 million and a loss of $524 million in\nCredit Adjustments & Other in CIB. \u2022 The Firm had net income of $8.3 billion, down\n42%. \u2022 Total net revenue was down 5%.\n\n\u2013 Noninterest revenue was $16.8 billion, down 13%, driven by lower Investment\nBanking fees, lower net production revenue in Home Lending, and losses on legacy\nequity investments compared to gains in the prior year in Corporate. The decrease\nalso reflected the loss in Credit Adjustments & Other in CIB. \u2013 Net interest\nincome was $13.9 billion, up 8%. Net interest income excluding Markets was $11.8\nbillion, up 9%, predominantly driven by balance sheet growth and higher rates,\npartially offset by lower NII from Paycheck Protection Program (\"PPP\") loans. \u2022\nNoninterest expense was $19.2 billion, up 2%, predominantly driven by investments\nand structural expense across the LOBs, largely offset by lower volume- and\nrevenue-related expense, including revenue-related compensation in CIB. The prior-\nyear expense included a $550 million contribution to the Firm\u2019s Foundation. \u2022 The\nprovision for credit losses was $1.5 billion, driven by; \u2013 a net additi on of $902\nmillion to the allowance for credit losses, which largely reflects an increased\nweight placed on the adverse scenarios, from the more balanced weighting placed on\nthe adverse and upside scenarios at December 31, 2021, due to the potential\neffects associated with higher inflation, changes in monetary policy, as well as\ngeopolitical risks, including the war in Ukraine. The increase in the allowance\nalso included client-specific Russia and Russia-associated downgrades in CIB and\nAWM, and \u2013 $582 million of net charge-offs, down $475 million, driven by Card. The\nprior year provision was a net benefit of $4.2 billion, reflecting a net reduction\nin the allowance for credit losses of $5.2 billion. \u2022 The total allowance for\ncredit losses was $19.6 billion at March 31, 2022. The Firm had an allowance for\nloan losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 1.69%, compared with 2.42% in the\nprior year. \u2022 The Firm\u2019s nonperforming assets totaled $8.6 billion at March 31,\n2022, a net decrease of $1.7 billion from the prior year, driven by lower\nnonaccrual loans, reflecting improved credit performance in consumer; and in\nwholesale, net portfolio activity as well as client-specific upgrades, largely\noffset by client-specific downgrades, including Russia and Russia-associated\nclients. \u2022 Firmwide average loans of $1.1 trillion were up 5%, driven by higher\nloans in AWM and CIB. \u2022 Firmwide average deposits of $2.5 trillion were up 13%,\nreflecting inflows across the LOBs primarily driven by the ongoing effect of\ncertain government actions. In CCB, the increase was also driven by growth from\nnew and existing\n                                        5                                         \naccounts across both consumer and small\nbusiness customers. Selected capital-\nrelated metrics \u2022 The Firm\u2019s CET1\ncapital was $208 billion, and the\nStandardized and Advanced CET1 ratios\nwere 11.9% and 12.7%, respectively. \u2022\nThe Firm\u2019s SLR was 5.2%. \u2022 The Firm\ngrew TBVPS, ending the first quarter of\n2022 at $69.58, up 5% versus the prior\nyear.

Investment banking fees\ndecreased in CIB, reflecting: \u2022 lower equity underwriting fees primarily driven by\nlower issuance activity, particularly in North America and EMEA, \u2022 lower debt\nunderwriting fees predominantly driven by high-yield bonds as a result of reduced\nissuances in a volatile market, partially offset by \u2022 higher advisory fees\nbenefiting from the closing of deals announced in 2021. Refer to C IB segment\nresults on pages 22-26 and Note 5 for additional information. Principal\ntransactions revenue decreased largely in CIB, reflecting: \u2022 a loss of $524\nmillion in Credit Adjustments & Other, predominantly driven by funding spread\nwidening, and credit valuation adjustments related to increases in commodities\nexposures and markdowns of derivative receivables from Russia-associated\ncounterparties, \u2022 lower revenue in Equity Markets, particularly in derivatives and\nCash Equities, compared to a strong prior year, and \u2022 lower revenue in Fixed\nIncome Markets, particularly in Securitized Products largely due to the rising\nrate environment, which slowed down the pace of mortgage production, predominantly\noffset by higher revenue in Currencies & Emerging Markets on elevated client\nactivity in a volatile market. The decrease in Principal transactions revenue also\nreflects net losses on certain legacy private equity investments in Corporate,\ncompared with net gains in the prior year.\n\nRefer to CIB and Corporate segment results on pages 22-26 and pages 32-33, and\nNote 5 for additional information. Lending- and deposit-related fees increased as\na result of: \u2022 higher cash management fees in CIB and CB driven by growth in\ntransaction volume, and \u2022 higher deposit-related fees in CCB. Refer to CCB, CIB\nand CB segment results on pages 19-21, pages 22-26 and pages 27-28, respectively,\nand Note 5 for additional information. Asset management, administration and\ncommissions revenue increased predominantly driven by: \u2022 strong cumulative net\ninflows into long-term products, as well as higher performance fees, in AWM, and \u2022\nhigher net inflows and average market levels in CCB. Refer to CCB and AWM segment\nresults on pages 19-21, pages 29-31, respectively, and Note 5 for additional\ninformation. Investment securities gains/(losses) reflected net investment\nsecurities losses on sales of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and government agency\nMBS, compared with net gains in the prior year, associated with repositioning the\ninvestment securities portfolios in both periods in Treasury and CIO. R efer to\nCorporate segment results on pages 32-33 and Note 9 for additional information.\nMortgage fees and related income decreased due to lower production revenue from\nlower margins and volume, largely offset by higher net mortgage servicing revenue\non an increase in MSR risk management results primarily driven by changes in\nprepayment expectations. Refer to CCB segment results on pages 19-21, Note 5 and\n14 for additional information. Card income decreased due to higher amortization\nrelated to new account origination costs in Card. Refer to CCB, CIB and CB seg\nment results on pages 19-21, pages 22-26 and pages 27-28, respectively , and Note\n5 for additional information. Other income in creased reflecting: \u2022 net gains on\nequity investments in CIB, \u2022 proceeds from an insurance settlement in Corporate,\nand \u2022 the absence of weather-related write-downs recorded in the prior year on\ncertain renewable energy investments in CIB, partially offset by \u2022 lower auto\noperating lease income in CCB as a result of a decline in volume, and \u2022 lower net\ninvestment valuation gains in AWM.\n                                        9                                         \nNet interest income increased driven by balance sheet growth and higher rates,\npartially offset by lower NII from PPP loans. The Firm\u2019s average interest-earning\nassets were $3.4 trillion, up $275 billion, predominantly driven by higher\ndeposits with banks and investment securities, and the yield was 1.86%, down 1\nbasis point (\u201cbp\u201d). The net yield on these assets, on an FTE basis, was 1.67%, a\ndecrease of 2 bps. The net yield excluding Markets was 1.95%, up 2 bps. Net yield\nexcluding Markets is a non-GAAP financial measure.

In addition,\nthere is a Corporate segment.\n\nThe business segments are determined\nbased on the products and services\nprovided, or the type of customer\nserved, and they reflect the manner in\nwhich financial information is\ncurrently evaluated by the Firm\u2019s\nOperating Committee. Segment results\nare presented on a managed basis. Refer\nto Explanation and Reconciliation of\nthe Firm\u2019s use of Non-GAAP Financial\nMeasures on pages 15-16 for a\ndefinition of managed basis.\n\nDescription of business segment\nreporting methodology\n\nResults of the business segments are\nintended to present each segment as if\nit were a stand-alone business. The\nmanagement reporting process that\nderives business segment results\nincludes the allocation of certain\nincome and expense items. The Firm\nperiodically assesses the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting\nclassifications used for segment\nreporting, and further refinements may\nbe implemented in future periods. The\nFirm also assesses the level of capital\nrequired for each LOB on at least an\nannual basis. The Firm\u2019s LOBs also\nprovide various business metrics which\nare utilized by the Firm and its\ninvestors and analysts in assessing\nperformance.\n\nRevenue sharing\n\nWhen business segments join efforts to\nsell products and services to the\nFirm\u2019s clients, the participating\nbusiness segments may agree to share\nrevenue from those transactions.\nRevenue is generally recognized in the\nsegment responsible for the related\nproduct or service, with allocations to\nthe other segment(s) involved in the\ntransaction. The segment results\nreflect these revenue-sharing\nagreements.\n\nFunds transfer pricing\n\nFunds transfer pricing (\"FTP\") is the\nprocess by which the Firm allocates\ninterest income and expense to each\nbusiness segment and transfers the\nprimary interest rate risk and\nliquidity risk to Treasury and CIO\nwithin Corporate.\n\nThe funds transfer pricing process\nconsiders the interest rate risk and\nliquidity risk characteristics of\nassets and liabilities and off-balance\nsheet products. Periodically the\nmethodology and assumptions utilized in\nthe FTP process are adjusted to reflect\neconomic conditions and other factors,\nwhich may impact the allocation of net\ninterest income to the business\nsegments.\n\nCapital allocation\n\nThe amount of capital assigned to each\nsegment is referred to as equity.\nPeriodically, the assumptions and\nmethodologies used to allocate capital\nare reassessed and as a result, the\ncapital allocated to the LOBs may\nchange.

(c) Included MSR risk\nmanagement results of $109 million and $(115) million for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nQuarterly results Net income was $2.9 billion, down 57%, reflecting an increase in\nthe provision for credit losses compared with a net benefit in the prior year. Net\nrevenue was $12.2 billion, a decrease of 2%. Net interest income was $8.3 billion,\nup 5%, driven by: \u2022 growth in deposits net of margin compression partially offset\nby lower PPP loan forgiveness, in CBB, and \u2022 higher revolving loans in Card.\nNoninterest revenue was $3.9 billion, down 15%, driven by: \u2022 lower production\nrevenue from lower margins and volume in Home Lending, \u2022 higher amortization\nrelated to new account origination costs in Card, and \u2022 lower auto operating lease\nincome as a result of a decline in volume, partially offset by \u2022 higher net\nmortgage servicing revenue on an increase in MSR risk management results primarily\ndriven by changes in prepayment expectations, \u2022 higher asset management fees as a\nresult of higher net inflows and average market levels, and \u2022 higher deposit-\nrelated fees. Refer to Note 14 for further information regarding changes in the\nvalue of the MSR asset and related hedges, and mortgage fees and related income.\nRefer to Note 5 for additional information on card income. Noninterest expense was\n$7.7 billion, up 7%, reflecting: \u2022 investments in the business and increased\nstructural expenses, predominantly driven by compensation, technology and\nmarketing, partially offset by \u2022 lower volume- and revenue- related expenses\nprimarily depreciation expense due to lower auto lease assets and the impact of\nhigher vehicle collateral values. The provision for credit losses was $678\nmillion, reflecting: \u2022 net charge-offs of $553 million, down $470 million, driven\nby Card, as consumer cash balances remained elevated, and \u2022 a $125 million\naddition to the allowance for credit losses in Home Lending. The prior year\nincluded a $4.6 billion reduction in the allowance for credit losses.

Quarterly\nresults Net income was $4.4 billion,\ndown 26%. Net revenue was $13.5\nbillion, down 7%. Banking revenue was\n$4.2 billion, down 6%. \u2022 Investment\nBanking revenue was $2.1 billion, down\n28%, driven by lower Investment Banking\nfees, down 31%, reflecting lower equity\nand debt underwriting fees. The Firm\nranked #1 for Global Investment Banking\nfees, according to Dealogic. \u2013 Equity\nunderwriting fees were $249 million,\ndown 76%, primarily driven by lower\nissuance activity, particularly in\nNorth America and EMEA. \u2013 Debt\nunderwriting fees were $1.0 billion,\ndown 20%, predominantly driven by high-\nyield bonds as a result of reduced\nissuances in a volatile market. \u2013\nAdvisory fees were $801 million, up\n18%, benefiting from the closing of\ndeals announced in 2021. \u2022 Payments\nrevenue was $1.9 billion, up 33%, and\nincluded net gains on equity\ninvestments. Excluding these net gains,\nrevenue was $1.5 billion, up 9%,\npredominantly driven by higher fees,\ndeposits and improved deposit margins.\n\u2022 Lending revenue was $321 million, up\n21%, predominantly driven by fair value\ngains on hedges of accrual loans,\ncompared to losses in the prior year.\nMarkets & Securities Services revenue\nwas $9.3 billion, down 8%. Markets\nrevenue was $8.8 billion, down 3%. \u2022\nFixed Income Markets revenue was $5.7\nbillion, down 1%, particularly in\nSecuritized Products, largely due to\nthe rising rate environment, which\nslowed down the pace of mortgage\nproduction, predominantly offset by\nhigher revenue in Currencies & Emerging\nMarkets on elevated client activity in\na volatile market.\n                                        22                                        \n\u2022 Equity Markets revenue was $3.1 billion, down 7%, driven by lower revenue in\nderivatives and Cash Equities, compared to a strong prior year. \u2022 Securities\nServices revenue was $1.1 billion, up 2%, driven by improved deposit margins and\ngrowth in fees. \u2022 Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $524 million, driven by\nfunding spread widening as well as credit valuation adjustments relating to both\nincreases in commodities exposures and markdowns of derivative receivables from\nRussia-associated counterparties. Noninterest expense was $7.3 billion, up 3%,\ndriven by higher structural expense, investments in the business and legal\nexpense, largely offset by lower volume- and revenue-related expense including\nrevenue-related compensation. The provision for credit losses of $445 million was\ndriven by a net addition to the allowance for credit losses, compared with a net\nbenefit of $331 million in the prior year.

Net revenue\nwas $2.4 billion, flat compared to the\nprior year. Net interest income was\n$1.5 billion, up 4%, driven by the\nimpact of higher deposits. Noninterest\nrevenue was $867 million, down 5%,\ndriven by lower investment banking\nrevenue, predominantly offset by higher\npayments revenue. Noninterest expense\nwas $1.1 billion, up 17%, largely\ndriven by investments in the business\nand higher volume- and revenue- related\nexpense, including compensation. The\nprovision for credit losses was $157\nmillion, driven by a net addition to\nthe allowance for credit losses,\ncompared with a net benefit of $118\nmillion in the prior year.

2022, the Firm changed its methodology for allocating\nincome taxes to the LOBs, with no impact to Firmwide net income. Prior-period\namounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.\n\nQuarterly results Net income was $1.0 billion, down 20%. Net revenue was $4.3\nbillion, up 6%. Net interest income was $1.1 billion, up 16%. Noninterest revenue\nwas $3.2 billion, up 3%. Revenue from Asset Management was $2.3 billion, up 6%\ndriven by: \u2022 higher asset management fees, net of liquidity fee waivers, on strong\ncumulative net inflows into long-term products, and higher performance fees,\npartially offset by \u2022 lower net investment valuation gains. Revenue from Global\nPrivate Bank was $2.0 billion, up 6% driven by: \u2022 higher loans including the\nimpact of lower funding costs, and \u2022 growth in deposits, net of margin\ncompression, partially offset by \u2022 lower brokerage fees on reduced volume.\nNoninterest expense was $2.9 billion, up 11% predominantly driven by higher\nstructural expense and investments in the business, largely driven by\ncompensation, and higher volume- and revenue-related expense, including\ndistribution fees. The provision for credit losses was $154 million, driven by an\naddition to the allowance for credit losses, compared with a net benefit of $121\nmillion in the prior year.

(b) In the first quarter of 2022, the Firm\nchanged its methodology for allocating income taxes to the LOBs, with no impact to\nFirmwide net income. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the\ncurrent presentation.\n\nQuarterly results Net loss was $856 million compared with a net loss of $852\nmillion in the prior year. Net revenue was a loss of $881 million, compared with a\nloss of $473 million in the prior year. Noninterest revenue decreased primarily\ndue to: \u2022 net losses on certain legacy private equity investments, compared with\nnet gains in the prior year, and \u2022 net investment securities losses on sales of\nU.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, compared with net gains in\nthe prior year, associated with repositioning the investment securities portfolios\nin both periods, partially offset by \u2022 proceeds from an insurance settlement. Net\ninterest income increased primarily driven by higher rates, which resulted in\nslower prepayments. Noninterest expense of $184 million was down $691 million\nprimarily driven by the absence of the contribution to the Firm's Foundation\nrecorded in the prior year. The current period tax benefit was predominantly\ndriven by the change in the level and mix of income and expenses subject to U.S.\nfederal and state and local taxes.

The minimum amount of\nregulatory capital that must be held by\nBHCs and banks is determined by\ncalculating risk-weighted assets\n(\u201cRWA\u201d), which are on-balance sheet\nassets and off-balance sheet exposures,\nweighted according to risk. Two\ncomprehensive approaches are prescribed\nfor calculating RWA: a standardized\napproach (\u201cBasel III Standardized\u201d),\nand an advanced approach (\u201cBasel III\nAdvanced\u201d). For each of the risk-based\ncapital ratios, the capital adequacy of\nthe Firm is evaluated against the lower\nof the Standardized or Advanced\napproaches compared to their respective\nregulatory capital ratio requirements.\nThe Firm\u2019s Basel III Standardized-risk-\nbased ratios are currently more binding\nthan the Basel III Advanced-risk-based\nratios.\n\nBasel III also includes a requirement\nfor Advanced Approaches banking\norganizations, including the Firm, to\ncalculate the SLR. The Firm\u2019s SLR is\ncurrently more binding than the Basel\nIII Standardized-risk-based ratios.\nRefer to SLR on page 38 for additional\ninformation.\n\nKey Regulatory Developments\n\nCECL regulatory capital transition. On\nDecember 31, 2021, the CECL capital\ntransition provisions , which delayed\nthe effects of CECL on regulatory\ncapital for two years, expired.\nBeginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9\nbillion CECL capital benefit recognized\nas of December 31, 2021, will be phased\nout at 25% per year over a three-year\nperiod. As of March 31, 2022, CET1\ncapital reflected the remaining 75%, or\n$2.2 billion, benefit associated with\nthe CECL capital transition provisions.\n\nAdditionally, effective January 1,\n2022, the Firm phased out 25% of the\nother relevant CECL capital transition\nprovisions recognized as of December\n31, 2021, from Tier 2 capital, adjusted\naverage assets, and total leverage\nexposure.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on\npages 86-96 and Note 1 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K for further\ninformation on CECL capital transition\nprovisions and the CECL accounting\nguidance.\n\nPPP. As of March 31, 2022, the Firm had\n$3.6 billion of loans remaining under\nthe PPP program, which receive a zero\npercent risk weight under the federal\nbanking agencies\u2019 regulatory capital\nrule. The Firm does not expect to\nrealize material credit losses on PPP\nloans because the loans are guaranteed\nby the SBA.\n\nTotal leverage exposure for purposes of\ncalculating the SLR includes PPP loans\nas the Firm did not participate in the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s Paycheck Protection\nProgram Lending Facility, which would\nhave allowed the Firm to exclude them\nunder the final rule.\n\nStandardized Approach for Counterparty\nCredit Risk. On January 1, 2022, the\nFirm adopted \u201cStandardized Approach for\nCounterparty Credit Risk\u201d (\u201cSA-CCR\u201d),\nwhich replaced the Current Exposure\nMethod used to measure derivatives\ncounterparty exposure under\nStandardized approach RWA and Advanced\napproach RWA where internal models are\nnot used, as well as leverage exposure\nused to calculate the SLR in the\nregulatory capital framework. The rule\nissued by the U.S. banking regulators\nin November 2019 applies to Basel III\nAdvanced Approaches banking\norganizations, such as the Firm and\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\n\nBased on the derivatives exposure as of\nDecember 31, 2021, the adoption of SA-\nCCR increased the Firm\u2019s Standardized\nRWA by approximately $40 billion, a\ndecrease of approximately 30 bps to the\nFirm's CET1 capital ratio at March 31,\n2022, and resulted in a modest decrease\nin its total leverage exposure. In\naddition, the adoption of SA-CCR\nincreased the Firm's Advanced RWA at\nMarch 31, 2022, but to a lesser extent\nthan Standardized.\n                                        35

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s\naverage LCR increased during the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared with\nboth the three month periods ended December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2021 primarily\ndue to growth in deposits. The increase in excess liquidity in JPMorgan Chase\nBank,\n\nN.A. is excluded from the Firm\u2019s reported LCR under the LCR rule. The Firm and\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR fluctuates from period to period, due to\nchanges in its eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of\nongoing business activity. Other liquidity sources In addition to the assets\nreported in the Firm\u2019s eligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered\nmarketable securities, such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm believes\nwould be available to raise liquidity. This includes excess eligible HQLA\nsecurities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank\naffiliates. The fair value of these securities was approximately $939 billion and\n$914 billion as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, although\nthe amount of liquidity that could be raised at any particular time would be\ndependent on prevailing market conditions. The fair value increased compared to\nDecember 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in CIB trading assets . The Firm\nalso had available borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Banks (\"FHLBs\") and\nthe discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral pledged\nby the Firm to such banks of approximately $298 billion and $308 billion as of\nMarch 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. This borrowing capacity\nexcludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm\u2019s eligible HQLA\nor other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve\nBank discount window and other central banks. Although available, the Firm does\nnot view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and\nthe other central banks as a primary source of liquidity. NSFR The net stable\nfunding ratio (\u201cNSFR\u201d) rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nmaintain an amount of \u201cavailable\u201d stable funding that is sufficient to meet their\n\u201crequired\u201d amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon.

Average deposits increased for\nthe three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended March 31,\n2021, reflecting inflows across the LOBs primarily driven by the ongoing effect of\ncertain government actions. In CCB, the increase was also driven by growth from\nnew and existing accounts across both consumer and small business customers.

These\ninstruments are secured predominantly\nby high-quality securities collateral,\nincluding government-issued debt and\nU.S. GSE and government agency MBS.\nSecurities sold under agreements to\nrepurchase increased at March 31, 2022,\ncompared with December 31, 2021, due to\nthe impact of client activities and\nhigher secured financing of trading\nassets in Markets.\n\nThe balances associated with securities\nloaned or sold under agreements to\nrepurchase fluctuate over time due to\ninvestment and financing activities of\nclients, the Firm\u2019s demand for\nfinancing, the ongoing management of\nthe mix of the Firm\u2019s liabilities,\nincluding its secured and unsecured\nfinancing (for both the investment\nsecurities and market-making\nportfolios), and other market and\nportfolio factors.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s sources of short-term\nunsecured funding primarily consist of\nissuances of wholesale commercial paper\nand other borrowed funds. The increase\nin commercial paper at March 31, 2022,\nfrom December 31, 2021, and for the\naverage three months ended March 31,\n2022 compared to the prior year period,\nwas due to higher net issuance\nprimarily for short-term liquidity\nmanagement.\n\nThe increase in unsecured other\nborrowed funds at March 31, 2022, from\nDecember 31, 2021, and for the average\nthree months ended March 31, 2022\ncompared to the prior year period, was\nprimarily due to higher overdrafts in\nCIB.\n                                        43                                        \nLong-term funding and issuance Long-\nterm funding provides an additional\nsource of stable funding and liquidity\nfor the Firm. The Firm\u2019s long-term\nfunding plan is driven primarily by\nexpected client activity, liquidity\nconsiderations, and regulatory\nrequirements, including TLAC. Long-term\nfunding objectives include maintaining\ndiversification, maximizing market\naccess and optimizing funding costs.\nThe Firm evaluates various funding\nmarkets, tenors and currencies in\ncreating its optimal long-term funding\nplan. The significant majority of the\nFirm\u2019s long-term unsecured funding is\nissued by the Parent Company to provide\nflexibility in support of both bank and\nnon-bank subsidiary funding needs.

In the\nfirst quarter of 2022, the COVID-19\nconsumer payment deferral programs\nended for new enrollments, except for\nloans collateralized by residential\nreal estate, as that program remains in\neffect due to the U.S. government's\nextension of its declaration of a\nnational emergency with respect to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAs of March 31, 2022, the Firm had\napproximately $825 million of retained\nconsumer loans under payment deferral\nprograms, predominantly in residential\nreal estate. Predominantly all\nborrowers that exited payment deferral\nprograms are current. During the first\nquarter of 2022, there were\napproximately $385 million of new\nenrollments in consumer payment\ndeferral programs.

Residential real estate:\nThe residential real estate portfolio,\nincluding loans held-for-sale and loans\nat fair value, predominantly consists\nof prime mortgage loans and home equity\nlines of credit. Retained loans\nincreased compared to December 31, 2021\nin AWM, on slower prepayments. Retained\nnonaccrual loans decreased from\nDecember 31, 2021 reflecting improved\ncredit performance . Net recoveries for\nt he three months ended March 31, 2022\nwere higher when compared with the same\nperiod in the prior year as the current\nyear benefited from the recovery on a\nloan sale as well as further\nimprovement in Home Price Index\n(\"HPI\"). Loans at fair value decreased\nfrom December 31, 2021, as sales\noutpaced originations in Home Lending\ndue to higher interest rates and lower\nloan purchase activity in CIB.\nNonaccrual loans at fair value\nincreased from December 31, 2021 driven\nby CIB. The carrying value of home\nequity lines of credit outstanding was\n$17.6 billion at March 31, 2022. This\namount included $5.9 billion of HELOCs\nthat have recast from interest-only to\nfully amortizing payments or have been\nmodified and $5.7 billion of interest-\nonly balloon HELOCs, which primarily\nmature after 2030. The Firm manages the\nrisk of HELOCs during their revolving\nperiod by closing or reducing the\nundrawn line to the extent permitted by\nlaw when borrowers are exhibiting a\nmaterial deterioration in their credit\nrisk profile.

A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm\u2019s\nwholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm\ndistributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the\nmarket as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio\nconcentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in\npart by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and\ntransaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry,\nproduct and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 56-59\nfor further information. The Firm\u2019s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure\nheld in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated exposures held in CCB,\nincluding business banking and auto dealer exposure for which the wholesale\nmethodology is applied when determining the allowance for credit losses. In the\nthree months ended March 31, 2022, credit continued to perform well with charge-\noffs at historically low levels, however, nonperforming exposure increased driven\nby client-specific Russia and Russia-associated downgrades. Refer to Business\nDevelopments on page 8 and Country Risk on pages 72-73 for additional information.\nAs of March 31, 2022, retained loans increased $9.6 billion driven by CIB and CB\npartially offset by decreases in AWM. Lending-related commitments increased $10.8\nbillion, driven by net portfolio activity in CIB. As of March 31, 2022, the net\nincrease in nonperforming loans of $303 million was driven by client-specific\nRussia and Russia-associated downgrades. Nonperforming derivatives increased $281\nmillion largely driven by client-specific downgrades in commodities.\n                                                                                  \n

hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.\n\n(c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference\nentity and the ratings profile shown is based on the ratings of the reference\nentity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the credit\nderivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used in\ncredit portfolio management activities are executed with investment-grade\ncounterparties. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection against certain\nloans in the retained loan portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes.\n\n(d) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and\nderivative receivables is generally based on remaining contractual maturity.\nDerivative contracts that are in a receivable position at March 31, 2022, may\nbecome payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or changes in\nmarket conditions.\n                                        55                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Wholesale credit exposure \u2013 industry exposures                                  \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures,\nand pays particular attention to industries with actual or potential credit\nconcerns.\n\nExposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators\u2019 definition of\ncriticized exposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard and\ndoubtful categories. Total criticized exposure, excluding loans held-for-sale and\nloans at fair value, was $36.9 billion and $38.2 billion at March 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, representing approximately 3.2% and 3.5% of total wholesale\ncredit exposure, respectively. The decrease in criticized exposure was driven by\nclient-specific upgrades and net portfolio activity, largely offset by client-\nspecific downgrades. The $36.9 billion of criticized exposure at March 31, 2022\nwas largely undrawn and $33.2 billion was performing.\n\nThe table below summarizes by industry the Firm\u2019s exposures as of March 31, 2022,\nand December 31, 2021. The industry of risk category is generally based on the\nclient or counterparty\u2019s primary business activity.

The\ncontractual amounts of these financial\ninstruments represent the maximum\npossible credit risk should the clients\ndraw down on these commitments or when\nthe Firm fulfills its obligations under\nthese guarantees, and the clients\nsubsequently fail to perform according\nto the terms of these contracts. Most\nof these commitments and guarantees\nhave historically been refinanced,\nextended, cancelled, or expired without\nbeing drawn upon or a default\noccurring. As a result, the Firm does\nnot believe that the total contractual\namount of these wholesale lending-\nrelated commitments is representative\nof the Firm\u2019s expected future credit\nexposure or funding requirements. Refer\nto Note 22 for further information on\nwholesale lending-related commitments.\n                                                                                  \n  Receivables from customers                                                      \n                                                                                  \nReceivables from customers reflect\nheld-for-investment margin loans to\nbrokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM\nthat are collateralized by assets\nmaintained in the clients\u2019 brokerage\naccounts (e.g., cash on deposit, and\nliquid and readily marketable debt or\nequity securities). Because of this\ncollateralization, no allowance for\ncredit losses is generally held against\nthese receivables. To manage its credit\nrisk the Firm establishes margin\nrequirements and monitors the required\nmargin levels on an ongoing basis, and\nrequires clients to deposit additional\ncash or other collateral, or to reduce\npositions, when appropriate. These\nreceivables are reported within accrued\ninterest and accounts receivable on the\nFirm\u2019s Consolidated balance sheets.\n                                                                                  \n  Derivative contracts                                                            \n                                                                                  \nDerivatives enable clients and\ncounterparties to manage risk including\ncredit risk and risks arising from\nfluctuations in interest rates, foreign\nexchange and equities and commodities\nprices. The Firm makes markets in\nderivatives in order to meet these\nneeds and uses derivatives to manage\ncertain risks associated with net open\nrisk positions from its market-making\nactivities, including the counterparty\ncredit risk arising from derivative\nreceivables. The Firm also uses\nderivative instruments to manage its\nown credit risk and other market risk\nexposure. The nature of the\ncounterparty and the settlement\nmechanism of the derivative affect the\ncredit risk to which the Firm is\nexposed. For OTC derivatives the Firm\nis exposed to the credit risk of the\nderivative counterparty. For exchange-\ntraded derivatives (\u201cETD\u201d), such as\nfutures and options, and cleared over-\nthe-counter (\u201cOTC-cleared\u201d)\nderivatives, the Firm can also be\nexposed to the credit risk of the\nrelevant central counterparty clearing\nhouse (\"CCP\"). Where possible, the Firm\nseeks to mitigate its credit risk\nexposures arising from derivative\ncontracts through the use of legally\nenforceable master netting arrangements\nand collateral agreements.\n\nThe percentage of the Firm\u2019s over-the-\ncounter derivative transactions subject\nto collateral agreements \u2014 excluding\nforeign exchange spot trades, which are\nnot typically covered by collateral\nagreements due to their short maturity\nand centrally cleared trades that are\nsettled daily \u2014 was approximately 88%\nat both March 31, 2022 and December 31,\n2021. Refer to Note 4 for additional\ninformation on the Firm\u2019s use of\ncollateral agreements. Refer to Note 4\nfor a further discussion of derivative\ncontracts, counterparties and\nsettlement types.\n\nThe fair value of derivative\nreceivables reported on the\nConsolidated balance sheets were $73.6\nbillion and $57.1 billion at March 31,\n2022, and December 31, 2021,\nrespectively. The increase was largely\ncommodities, predominantly oil and gas,\nas a result of market movements.\nDerivative receivables represent the\nfair value of the derivative contracts\nafter giving effect to legally\nenforceable master netting agreements\nand the related cash collateral held by\nthe Firm.\n\nIn addition, the Firm held liquid\nsecurities and other cash collateral\nthat may be used as security when the\nfair value of the client\u2019s exposure is\nin the Firm\u2019s favor. For these\npurposes, the definition of liquid\nsecurities is consistent with the\ndefinition of high quality liquid\nassets as defined in the LCR rule.\n\nIn management\u2019s view, the appropriate\nmeasure of current credit risk should\nalso take into consideration other\ncollateral, which generally represents\nsecurities that do not qualify as high\nquality liquid assets under the LCR\nrule.\n\nThe benefits of these additional\ncollateral amounts for each\ncounterparty are subject to a legally\nenforceable master netting agreement\nand limited to the net amount of the\nderivative receivables for each\ncounterparty.\n\nThe Firm also holds additional\ncollateral (primarily cash, G7\ngovernment securities, other liquid\ngovernment agency and guaranteed\nsecurities, and corporate debt and\nequity securities) delivered by clients\nat the initiation of transactions, as\nwell as collateral related to contracts\nthat have a non-daily call frequency\nand collateral that the Firm has agreed\nto return but has not yet settled as of\nthe reporting date. Although this\ncollateral does not reduce the balances\nand is not included in the tables\nbelow, it is available as security\nagainst potential exposure that could\narise should the fair value of the\nclient\u2019s derivative contracts move in\nthe Firm\u2019s favor.

The\nallowance for credit losses comprises:\n\u2022 the allowance for loan losses, which\ncovers the Firm\u2019s retained loan\nportfolios (scored and risk-rated) and\nis presented separately on the\nConsolidated balance sheets, \u2022 the\nallowance for lending-related\ncommitments, which is presented on the\nConsolidated balance sheets in accounts\npayable and other liabilities, and \u2022\nthe allowance for credit losses on\ninvestment securities, which is\nreflected in investment securities on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets.\nDiscussion of changes in the allowance\nThe allowance for credit losses as of\nMarch 31, 2022 was $19.6 billion, an\nincrease from $18.7 billion at December\n31, 2021, consisting of: $776 million\nin wholesale, across the LOBs, and $127\nmillion in consumer, driven by the\nresidential real estate portfolio. The\nchange in the allowance largely\nreflects an increased weight placed on\nthe adverse scenarios, from the more\nbalanced weighting placed on the\nadverse and upside scenarios at\nDecember 31, 2021, due to the potential\neffects associated with higher\ninflation, changes in monetary policy,\nas well as geopolitical risks,\nincluding the war in Ukraine. The\nincrease in the allowance also included\nclient-specific Russia and Russia-\nassociated downgrades in CIB and AWM.\nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses\nis estimated using a weighted average\nof five internally developed\nmacroeconomic scenarios. The adverse\nscenarios incorporate more punitive\nmacroeconomic factors than the central\ncase assumptions provided in the table\nbelow, resulting in weighted average\nU.S. unemployment rates above 4%\nthrough the second quarter of 2023 and\nyear over year growth in U.S. real GDP\nof 2.5% in the second quarter of 2023.\nThe Firm\u2019s central case assumptions\nreflected U.S. unemployment rates and\nU.S. real GDP as follows:\n                                                                                  \n                               Assumptions at March 31,                           \n                                                   2022                           \n                                                   2Q22       4Q22       2Q23     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. unemployment                                 3.6  %     3.3  %     3.3  %  \n  rate(a)                                                                         \n  YoY growth in U.S. real                           3.7  %     2.9  %     2.6  %  \n  GDP(b)                                                                          \n                                Assumptions at December                           \n                                               31, 2021                           \n                                                   2Q22       4Q22       2Q23     \n  U.S. unemployment                                 4.2  %     4.0  %     3.9  %  \n  rate(a)                                                                         \n  YoY growth in U.S. real                           3.1  %     2.8  %     2.1  %  \n  GDP(b)                                                                          \n                                                                                  \n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate.

The investment securities\nportfolio is predominantly held by\nTreasury and CIO in connection with the\nFirm\u2019s balance sheet and asset-\nliability management objectives.\nPrincipal investments are predominantly\nprivately-held financial instruments\nand are managed in the LOBs and\nCorporate. Investments are typically\nintended to be held over extended\nperiods and, accordingly, the Firm has\nno expectation for short-term realized\ngains with respect to these\ninvestments. Investment securities risk\nInvestment securities risk includes the\nexposure associated with a default in\nthe payment of principal and interest.\nThis risk is mitigated given that the\ninvestment securities portfolio held by\nTreasury and CIO predominantly consists\nof high-quality securities. At March\n31, 2022, the Treasury and CIO\ninvestment securities portfolio, net of\nallowance for credit losses, was $677.5\nbillion, and the average credit rating\nof the securities comprising the\nportfolio was AA+ (based upon external\nratings where available, and where not\navailable, based primarily upon\ninternal risk ratings). Refer to\nCorporate segment results on pages\n32-33 and Note 9 for further\ninformation on the investment\nsecurities portfolio and internal risk\nratings. Refer to Market Risk\nManagement on pages 67-71 for further\ninformation on the market risk inherent\nin the portfolio. Refer to Liquidity\nRisk Management on pages 41-45 for\nfurther information on related\nliquidity risk.\n\nPrincipal investment risk Principal\ninvestments are typically privately-\nheld financial instruments representing\nownership interests or other forms of\njunior capital. In general, principal\ninvestments include tax-oriented\ninvestments and investments made to\nenhance or accelerate the Firm\u2019s\nbusiness strategies and exclude those\nthat are consolidated on the Firm's\nbalance sheets. These investments are\nmade by dedicated investing businesses\nor as part of a broader business\nstrategy. The Firm\u2019s principal\ninvestments are managed by the LOBs and\nCorporate and are reflected within\ntheir respective financial results. The\nFirm\u2019s investments will continue to\nevolve in line with its strategies,\nincluding the Firm\u2019s commitment to\nsupport underserved communities and\nminority-owned businesses.

This decrease\nwas driven by volatility which occurred\nat the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic\nrolling out of the one-year historical\nlook-back period in the first half of\n2021, predominantly impacting exposures\nin fixed income and commodities.\n\nThe following graph presents daily Risk\nManagement VaR for the five trailing\nquarters.

The gains and losses depicted in the chart below do not\nreflect the Firm\u2019s reported revenue as they exclude select components of total net\nrevenue, such as those associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e.,\nintraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees,\ncommissions, certain valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded\ncomponents of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or loss\non a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is\nconsistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.\n\nA backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily\nRisk Management VaR for the prior day. Under the Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR\nmethodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent with the\nhistorical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR\nbacktesting exceptions on average five times every 100 trading days. The number of\nVaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected\nnumber of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is\nmaterially different from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of\nhistorical data used in the VaR calculation.\n\nFor the 12 months ended March 31, 2022, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 141\nof the 261 days, and observed 23 VaR backtesting exceptions. For the three months\nended March 31, 2022, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 43 of the 64 days, and\nobserved three VaR backtesting exceptions.\n\nThe following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains\nand losses for the trailing 12 months and three months ended March 31, 2022. The\ndaily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding daily\nRisk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in\naggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are\ndisplayed within the intervals that are greater than one hundred percent. The\nresults in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the\nMarket Risk section of the Firm\u2019s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital\nDisclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm\u2019s\ncovered positions.\n                Distribution of Daily Backtesting Gains and Losses                \n                                                                                  \n                                        69                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Earnings-at-risk                                                                \n                                                                                  \nThe effect of interest rate exposure on\nthe Firm\u2019s reported net income is\nimportant as interest rate risk\nrepresents one of the Firm\u2019s\nsignificant market risks. Interest rate\nrisk arises not only from trading\nactivities but also from the Firm\u2019s\ntraditional banking activities, which\ninclude extension of loans and credit\nfacilities, taking deposits, issuing\ndebt and the investment securities\nportfolio. Refer to the table on page\n134 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K\nfor a summary by LOB and Corporate,\nidentifying positions included in\nearnings-at-risk. One way the Firm\nevaluates its structural interest rate\nrisk is through earnings-at-risk.\nEarnings-at-risk estimates the Firm\u2019s\ninterest rate exposure for a given\ninterest rate scenario. It is presented\nas a sensitivity to a baseline, which\nincludes net interest income and\ncertain interest rate sensitive fees.\nThe baseline uses market interest rates\nand in the case of deposits, pricing\nassumptions. The Firm conducts\nsimulations of changes to this baseline\nfor interest rate-sensitive assets and\nliabilities denominated in U.S. dollars\nand other currencies (\u201cnon-U.S. dollar\u201d\ncurrencies). These simulations\nprimarily include retained loans,\ndeposits, deposits with banks,\ninvestment securities, long-term debt\nand any related interest rate hedges,\nand funds transfer pricing of other\npositions in risk management VaR and\nother sensitivity-based measures as\ndescribed on page 134 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K. Earnings-at-\nrisk scenarios estimate the potential\nchange to a net interest income\nbaseline, over the following 12 months\nutilizing multiple assumptions. These\nscenarios include a parallel shift\ninvolving changes to both short-term\nand long-term rates by an equal amount;\na steeper yield curve involving holding\nshort-term rates constant and\nincreasing long-term rates; and a\nflatter yield curve involving\nincreasing short-term rates and holding\nlong-term rates constant or holding\nshort-term rates constant and\ndecreasing long-term rates. These\nscenarios consider many different\nfactors, including: \u2022 The impact on\nexposures as a result of instantaneous\nchanges in interest rates from baseline\nrates. \u2022 Forecasted balance sheet, as\nwell as modeled prepayment and\nreinvestment behavior, but excluding\nassumptions about actions that could be\ntaken by the Firm or its clients and\ncustomers in response to any such\ninstantaneous rate changes. Mortgage\nprepayment assumptions are based on the\ninterest rates used in the scenarios\ncompared with underlying contractual\nrates, the time since origination, and\nother factors which are updated\nperiodically based on historical\nexperience. Deposit forecasts used in\nthe baseline and scenarios include\ncertain assumptions relating to the\nreversal of Quantitative Easing. \u2022 The\npricing sensitivity of deposits, known\nas deposit betas, represent the amount\nby which deposit rates paid could\nchange upon a given change in market\ninterest rates.

Country exposure\nincludes activity with both government\nand private-sector entities in a\ncountry.\n\nUnder the Firm\u2019s internal country risk\nmanagement approach, attribution of\nexposure to an individual country is\nbased on the country where the largest\nproportion of the assets of the\ncounterparty, issuer, obligor or\nguarantor are located or where the\nlargest proportion of its revenue is\nderived, which may be different than\nthe domicile (i.e. legal residence) or\ncountry of incorporation.\n\nIndividual country exposures reflect an\naggregation of the Firm\u2019s risk to an\nimmediate default, with zero recovery,\nof the counterparties, issuers,\nobligors or guarantors attributed to\nthat country. Activities which result\nin contingent or indirect exposure to a\ncountry are not included in the country\nexposure measure (for exa mple,\nproviding clearing services or\nsecondary exposure to collateral on\nsecurities financing receivables).\n\nAssumptions are sometimes required in\ndetermining the measurement and\nallocation of country exposure,\nparticularly in the case of certain\nnon-linear or index products, or where\nthe nature of the counterparty, issuer,\nobligor or guarantor is not suitable\nfor attribution to an individual\ncountry. The use of different\nmeasurement approaches or assumptions\ncould affect the amount of reported\ncountry exposure.\n\nUnder the Firm\u2019s internal country risk\nmeasurement framework:\n\n\u2022 Lending exposures are measured at the\ntotal committed amount (funded and\nunfunded), net of the allowance for\ncredit losses and eligible cash and\nmarketable securities collateral\nreceived\n\n\u2022 Deposits are measured as the cash\nbalances placed with central and\ncommercial banks\n\n\u2022 Securities financing exposures are\nmeasured at their receivable balance,\nnet of eligible collateral received\n\n\u2022 Debt and equity securities are\nmeasured at the fair value of all\npositions, including both long and\nshort positions\n\n\u2022 Counterparty exposure on derivative\nreceivables is measured at the\nderivative\u2019s fair value, net of the\nfair value of the eligible collateral\nreceived\n\n\u2022 Credit derivatives exposure is\nmeasured at the net notional amount of\nprotection purchased or sold for the\nsame underlying reference entity,\ninclusive of the fair value of the\nderivative receivable or payable;\nreflecting the manner in which the Firm\nmanages these exposures\n\nThe Firm\u2019s internal country risk\nreporting differs from the reporting\nprovided under the FFIEC bank\nregulatory requirements.\n                                        72                                        \nRisk Reporting The following table presents the Firm\u2019s top 20 exposures by country\n(excluding the U.S.) as of March 31, 2022 and their comparative exposures as of\nDecember 31, 2021. The selection of countries represents the Firm\u2019s largest total\nexposures by individual country, based on the Firm\u2019s internal country risk\nmanagement approach, and does not represent the Firm\u2019s view of any existing or\npotentially adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate from period\nto period due to client activity and market flows. The increase in exposure to\nGermany and the decrease in exposure to the U.K. were primarily due to changes in\ncash placements with the central banks of those countries driven by balance sheet\nand liquidity management activities. As of March 31, 2022, exposure to Russia,\nbased on the Firm's internal country risk measurement framework, was approximately\n$650 million. This largely reflects cross-border lending activity, net of the\nallowance for credit losses, to Russian corporate clients.\n                                                                                  \n  Top                                                                             \n  20                                                                              \n  co\u2026                                                                             \n  ex\u2026                                                                             \n  (e\u2026                                                                             \n  the                                                                             \n  U.\u2026    March                                                  Dec\u2026              \n  (in    31,                                                    31,               \n  bi\u2026    2022                                                   202\u2026              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                     Len\u2026       Trad\u2026                  Total               Total  \n                      and         and       Oth\u2026       expo\u2026               expo\u2026  \n                     dep\u2026       inve\u2026                                             \n  Ge\u2026             $  95.5    $    6.6    $   0.5    $  102.6            $   61.7  \n  Un\u2026                59.4        11.1        3.3        73.8                96.4  \n  Ki\u2026                                                                             \n  Ja\u2026                31.0        11.5        0.3        42.8                45.5  \n  Au\u2026                28.2        10.4          \u2014        38.6                39.1  \n  Sw\u2026                15.5         1.3        5.1        21.9                20.9  \n  Ch\u2026                10.6         7.6        1.4        19.6                18.6  \n  Fr\u2026                12.7         1.3        4.1        18.1                14.0  \n  Ca\u2026                12.8         3.2        0.3        16.3                16.9  \n  Br\u2026                 5.3         8.2          \u2014        13.5                12.0  \n  Si\u2026                 7.0         4.2        1.6        12.8                12.3  \n  Lu\u2026                11.5         1.3          \u2014        12.8                11.5  \n  In\u2026                 5.9         4.3        1.3        11.5                14.7  \n  Sp\u2026                10.0         0.1          \u2014        10.1                10.1  \n  Ne\u2026                 7.6         0.9        0.9         9.4                 6.8  \n  Sa\u2026                 6.8         2.5          \u2014         9.3                 9.1  \n  Ar\u2026                                                                             \n  So\u2026                 4.7         3.0        0.3         8.0                 8.7  \n  Ko\u2026                                                                             \n  Ho\u2026                                                                             \n  Ko\u2026                 4.7         2.1        0.6         7.4                 5.9  \n  SAR                                                                             \n  Be\u2026                 5.8         1.4          \u2014         7.2                 6.8  \n  Ch\u2026                 5.0         0.2          \u2014         5.2                 1.5  \n  Me\u2026                 4.4         0.1          \u2014         4.5                 4.9  \n                                                                                  \n(a) Country exposures presented in the\ntable reflect 89% and 87% of total\nFirmwide non-U.S. exposure, where\nexposure is attributed to an individual\ncountry, at March 31, 2022 and December\n31, 2021, respectively.

Operational Risk includes\ncompliance, conduct, legal, and\nestimations and model risk. Operational\nrisk is inherent in the Firm\u2019s\nactivities and can manifest itself in\nvarious ways, including fraudulent\nacts, business disruptions (including\nthose caused by extraordinary events\nbeyond the Firm's control),\ncyberattacks, inappropriate employee\nbehavior, failure to comply with\napplicable laws, rules and regulations\nor failure of vendors or other third\nparty providers to perform in\naccordance with their agreements.\nOperational Risk Management attempts to\nmanage operational risk at appropriate\nlevels in light of the Firm\u2019s financial\nposition, the characteristics of its\nbusinesses, and the markets and\nregulatory environments in which it\noperates. Refer to Operational Risk\nManagement on pages 143-149 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion\nof the Firm\u2019s Operational Risk\nManagement. Details on other select\nexamples of operational risks are\nprovided below.\n\nIn response to the war in Ukraine,\nnumerous sanctions have been imposed on\nRussia and Russia-associated entities\nand individuals by various governments\naround the world, including the\nauthorities in the U.S., the U.K. and\nthe EU. These sanctions are complex and\nevolving at a rapid pace in response to\nthe war. The Firm faces increased\noperational risk associated with\ninterpreting and maintaining these\ncomplex compliance programs. To manage\nthis increased risk, the Firm has\nimplemented additional controls\nreasonably designed to mitigate the\nrisk of non-compliance and to prevent\ndealing with sanctioned persons or in\nproperty subject to sanctions, as well\nas to block or restrict payments as\nrequired by the applicable regulations.\n\nBusiness and technology resiliency risk\n\nDisruptions can occur due to forces\nbeyond the Firm\u2019s control such as the\nspread of infectious diseases or\npandemics, severe weather, power or\ntelecommunications loss, failure of a\nthird party to provide expected\nservices, cyberattacks and terrorism.\nThe Firmwide Business Resiliency\nProgram is designed to enable the Firm\nto prepare for, adapt to, withstand and\nrecover from business disruptions\nincluding occurrence of an\nextraordinary event beyond its control\nthat may impact critical business\nfunctions and supporting assets (i.e.,\nstaff, technology, facilities and third\nparties). The program includes\ngovernance, awareness training,\nplanning and testing of recovery\nstrategies, as well as strategic and\ntactical initiatives to identify,\nassess, and manage business\ninterruption and public safety risks.\n\nCybersecurity Risk\n\nThe Firm faces increased risk of cyber\nattacks due to potential retaliation\nfor the sanctions imposed as a result\nof the war in Ukraine. The Firm has\nimplemented additional precautionary\nmeasures and controls reasonably\ndesigned to address this increased\nrisk, such as enhanced threat\nmonitoring. There can be no assurance\nthat the measures taken by the Firm to\nprotect against cybersecurity breaches\nwill provide absolute security against\ncyber attacks.\n                                        74                                        \n                                                  \n  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM  \n                                                  \nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s accounting policies\nand use of estimates are integral to\nunderstanding its reported results. The\nFirm\u2019s most complex accounting\nestimates require management\u2019s judgment\nto ascertain the appropriate carrying\nvalue of assets and liabilities. The\nFirm has established policies and\ncontrol procedures intended to ensure\nthat estimation methods, including any\njudgments made as part of such methods,\nare well-controlled, independently\nreviewed and applied consistently from\nperiod to period. The methods used and\njudgments made reflect, among other\nfactors, the nature of the assets or\nliabilities and the related business\nand risk management strategies, which\nmay vary across the Firm\u2019s businesses\nand portfolios. In addition, the\npolicies and procedures are intended to\nensure that the process for changing\nmethodologies occurs in an appropriate\nmanner. The Firm believes its estimates\nfor determining the carrying value of\nits assets and liabilities are\nappropriate. The following is a brief\ndescription of the Firm\u2019s critical\naccounting estimates involving\nsignificant judgments.\n                                                                                  \n  Allowance for credit losses                                                     \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses\nrepresents management\u2019s estimate of\nexpected credit losses over the\nremaining expected life of the Firm\u2019s\nfinancial assets measured at amortized\ncost and certain off-balance sheet\nlending-related commitments. The\nallowance for credit losses comprises:\n\n\u2022 The allowance for loan losses, which\ncovers the Firm\u2019s retained loan\nportfolios (scored and risk-rated),\n\n\u2022 The allowance for lending-related\ncommitments, and\n\n\u2022 The allowance for credit losses on\ninvestment securities.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses\ninvolves significant judgment on a\nnumber of matters including development\nand weighting of macroeconomic\nforecasts, incorporation of historical\nloss experience, assessment of risk\ncharacteristics, assignment of risk\nratings, valuation of collateral, and\nthe determination of remaining expected\nlife. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 of\nJPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for\nfurther information on these judgments\nas well as the Firm\u2019s policies and\nmethodologies used to determine the\nFirm\u2019s allowance for credit losses; and\nrefer to Allowance for credit losses on\npages 63-65 and Note 12 of this Form\n10-Q for further information.\n\nOne of the most significant judgments\ninvolved in estimating the Firm\u2019s\nallowance for credit losses relates to\nthe macroeconomic forecasts used to\nestimate credit losses over the eight-\nquarter forecast period within the\nFirm\u2019s methodology. The eight-quarter\nforecast incorporates hundreds of MEVs\nthat are relevant for exposures across\nthe Firm, with modeled credit losses\nbeing driven primarily by a subset of\nless than twenty variables. The\nspecific variables that have the\ngreatest effect on the modeled losses\nof each portfolio vary by portfolio and\ngeography.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio\ninclude U.S. unemployment, HPI and U.S.\nreal GDP.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio\ninclude U.S. real GDP, U.S.\nunemployment, U.S. equity prices,\ncorporate credit spreads, oil prices,\ncommercial real estate prices and HPI.\n\nChanges in the Firm\u2019s assumptions and\nforecasts of economic conditions could\nsignificantly affect its estimate of\nexpected credit losses in the portfolio\nat the balance sheet date or lead to\nsignificant changes in the estimate\nfrom one reporting period to the next.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate how\npotential changes in any one factor or\ninput might affect the overall\nallowance for credit losses because\nmanagement considers a wide variety of\nfactors and inputs in estimating the\nallowance for credit losses. Changes in\nthe factors and inputs considered may\nnot occur at the same rate and may not\nbe consistent across all geographies or\nproduct types, and changes in factors\nand inputs may be directionally\ninconsistent, such that improvement in\none factor or input may offset\ndeterioration in others.\n\nTo consider the impact of a\nhypothetical alternate macroeconomic\nforecast, the Firm compared the modeled\ncredit losses determined using its\ncentral and relative adverse\nmacroeconomic scenarios, which are two\nof the five scenarios considered in\nestimating the allowances for loan\nlosses and lending-related commitments.\nThe central and relative adverse\nscenarios each included a full suite of\nMEVs, but differed in the levels, paths\nand peaks/troughs of those variables\nover the eight-quarter forecast period.\n\nFor example, compared to the Firm\u2019s\ncentral scenario shown on page 63 and\nin Note 12, the Firm\u2019s relative adverse\nscenario assumes a significantly\nelevated U.S. unemployment rate,\naveraging approximately 2.5% higher\n\nover the eight-quarter forecast, with a\npeak difference of\n\napproximately 4.5% in the fourth\nquarter of 2022; lower\n\nU.S. real GDP with a slower recovery,\nremaining nearly\n\n3.1% lower at the end of the eight-\nquarter forecast, with a\n\npeak difference of approximately 7.0%\nin the fourth\n\nquarter of 2022; and lower national HPI\nwith a peak\n\ndifference of 20.0% in the fourth\nquarter of 2023.\n\nThis analysis is not intended to\nestimate expected future changes in the\nallowance for credit losses, for a\nnumber of reasons, including:\n\n\u2022 The Firm increased the weight placed\non the adverse scenarios in estimating\nthe allowance for credit losses as of\nMarch 31, 2022, and accordingly, the\nexisting allowance reflects credit\nlosses beyond those estimated under the\ncentral scenario.\n\n\u2022 The impacts of changes in many MEVs\nare both interrelated and nonlinear, so\nthe results of this analysis cannot be\nsimply extrapolated for more severe\nchanges in macroeconomic variables.\n                                        75                                        \n\u2022 Expectations of future changes in\nportfolio composition and borrower\nbehavior can significantly affect the\nallowance for credit losses. To\ndemonstrate the sensitivity of credit\nloss estimates to macroeconomic\nforecasts as of March 31, 2022, the\nFirm compared the modeled estimates\nunder its relative adverse scenario to\nits central scenario. Without\nconsidering offsetting or correlated\neffects in other qualitative components\nof the Firm\u2019s allowance for credit\nlosses, the comparison between these\ntwo scenarios for the lending exposures\nbelow reflect the following\ndifferences: \u2022 An increase of\napproximately $600 million for\nresidential real estate loans and\nlending-related commitments \u2022 An\nincrease of approximately $2.4 billion\nfor credit card loans \u2022 An increase of\napproximately $2.8 billion for\nwholesale loans and lending-related\ncommitments This analysis relates only\nto the modeled credit loss estimates\nand is not intended to estimate changes\nin the overall allowance for credit\nlosses as it does not reflect any\npotential changes in other adjustments\nto the quantitative calculation, which\nwould also be influenced by the\njudgment management applies to the\nmodeled lifetime loss estimates to\nreflect the uncertainty and imprecision\nof these modeled lifetime loss\nestimates based on then-current\ncircumstances and conditions.\nRecognizing that forecasts of\nmacroeconomic conditions are inherently\nuncertain, particularly in light of the\nrecent economic conditions, the Firm\nbelieves that its process to consider\nthe available information and\nassociated risks and uncertainties is\nappropriately governed and that its\nestimates of expected credit losses\nwere reasonable and appropriate for the\nperiod ended March 31, 2022.\n\nFair value JPMorgan Chase carries a\nportion of its assets and liabilities\nat fair value. The majority of such\nassets and liabilities are measured at\nfair value on a recurring basis,\nincluding, derivatives, structured note\nproducts and certain securities\nfinancing agreements.

The level 3 balances would\nbe reduced if netting were applied,\nincluding the netting benefit\nassociated with cash collateral.\n                                        76                                        \nValuation\nEstimating fair value requires the\napplication of judgment. The type and\nlevel of judgment required is largely\ndependent on the amount of observable\nmarket information available to the\nFirm. For instruments valued using\ninternally developed valuation models\nand other valuation techniques that use\nsignificant unobservable inputs and are\ntherefore classified within level 3 of\nthe fair value hierarchy, judgments\nused to estimate fair value are more\nsignificant than those required when\nestimating the fair value of\ninstruments classified within levels 1\nand 2.\n\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair\nvalue for an instrument within level 3,\nmanagement must first determine the\nappropriate valuation model or other\nvaluation technique to use. Second, the\nlack of observability of certain\nsignificant inputs requires management\nto assess relevant empirical data in\nderiving valuation inputs including,\nfor example, transaction details, yield\ncurves, interest rates, prepayment\nspeed, default rates, volatilities,\ncorrelations, prices (such as\ncommodity, equity or debt prices),\nvaluations of comparable instruments,\nforeign exchange rates and credit\ncurves. Refer to Note 2 for a further\ndiscussion of the valuation of level 3\ninstruments, including unobservable\ninputs used.\n\nFor instruments classified in levels 2\nand 3, management judgment must be\napplied to assess the appropriate level\nof valuation adjustments to reflect\ncounterparty credit quality, the Firm\u2019s\ncreditworthiness, market funding rates,\nliquidity considerations, unobservable\nparameters, and for portfolios that\nmeet specified criteria, the size of\nthe net open risk position. The\njudgments made are typically affected\nby the type of product and its specific\ncontractual terms, and the level of\nliquidity for the product or within the\nmarket as a whole. In periods of\nheightened market volatility and\nuncertainty judgments are further\naffected by the wider variation of\nreasonable valuation estimates,\nparticularly for positions that are\nless liquid.

Refer to Note 25 for\na further discussion of the Firm\u2019s\nbusiness segments. The accounting and\nfinancial reporting policies of\nJPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries\nconform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally,\nwhere applicable, the policies conform\nto the accounting and reporting\nguidelines prescribed by regulatory\nauthorities. The unaudited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements prepared in\nconformity with U.S. GAAP require\nmanagement to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets, liabilities, revenue\nand expense, and the disclosures of\ncontingent assets and liabilities.\nActual results could be different from\nthese estimates. In the opinion of\nmanagement, all normal, recurring\nadjustments have been included such\nthat this interim financial information\nis fairly stated. These unaudited\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nshould be read in conjunction with the\naudited Consolidated Financial\nStatements, and related notes thereto,\nincluded in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2021 Form\n10-K. Certain amounts reported in prior\nperiods have been reclassified to\nconform with the current presentation.\n\nConsolidation The Consolidated\nFinancial Statements include the\naccounts of JPMorgan Chase and other\nentities in which the Firm has a\ncontrolling financial interest. All\nmaterial intercompany balances and\ntransactions have been eliminated.\nAssets held for clients in an agency or\nfiduciary capacity by the Firm are not\nassets of JPMorgan Chase and are not\nincluded on the Consolidated balance\nsheets. The Firm determines whether it\nhas a controlling financial interest in\nan entity by first evaluating whether\nthe entity is a voting interest entity\nor a variable interest entity.

U.S. GAAP also\npermits securities financing activities\nto be presented on a net basis when\nspecified conditions are met, including\nthe existence of a legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreement. The Firm has\nelected to net such balances where it\nhas determined that the specified\nconditions are met.

72.8billion and $ 73.9billion, respectively, which were mortgage-related.\n\n(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of\ncost or net realizable value. \u201cNet realizable value\u201d is a term defined in U.S.\nGAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (\u201ctransaction costs\u201d).\nTransaction costs for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories are either not\napplicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable\nvalue approximates fair value for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories.\nWhen fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below\ncost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because\nunder fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair\nvalue. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of the Firm\u2019s hedge accounting\nrelationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all\nphysical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.\n                                        88                                        \n(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the\namount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).\n\n(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value\nper share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be\nclassified in the fair value hierarchy. At March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021,\nthe fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private\nequity funds, real estate and other funds, were $ 845million and $ 801million,\nrespectively. Included in these balances at March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021,\nwere trading assets of $ 45million and $ 51million, respectively, and other assets\nof $ 800million and $ 750million, respectively.\n\n(e) At March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, included $ 15.1billion and $\n26.2billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $ 9.3billion\nand $ 8.2billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential\nmortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to\nsell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $ 5.0billion and $ 13.6billion,\nrespectively.\n\n(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative\nreceivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and\npaid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3\nbalances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit\nassociated with cash collateral.\n\nLevel 3 valuations\n\nRefer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K for further information on the\nFirm\u2019s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair\nvalue for individual financial instruments. The following table presents the\nFirm\u2019s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to\nmeasure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant\nunobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or\narithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an\ninstrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs\nto the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically\ninclude observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and\ncan be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components.\nThe level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the\nFirm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial\ninstruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within\nlevels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of values presented in the\ntable is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the\nsignificant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification.\nWhere provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table\nare calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being\nused to value. In the Firm\u2019s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic\naverage values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of\nthe reasonableness of the Firm\u2019s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect\nthe characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative\ndistribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two\noption contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation\nuncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels\nbecause the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices.\nThe input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-\nperiod and parameter-to-parameter based on the

Consolidated\nbalance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in\nthe table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the\ntechnique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ.\n(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $ 286million, nonagency\nsecurities of $ 10million and non-trading loans of $ 987million.\n(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $ 10million, trading loans of $ 40million\nand non-trading loans of $ 345million.\n(d) Comprises trading loans of $ 1.0billion and non-trading loans of $ 740million.\n(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes\nissued by the Firm that are financial instruments that typically contain embedded\nderivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the\nderivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable\ninputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.\n(f) Includes equity securities of $ 850million including $ 187million in Other\nAssets, for which quoted prices are not readily available and the fair value is\ngenerally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA multiples and\ncomparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant\nboth individually and in aggregate.\n(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted\nmarket prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price-\nbased internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par\nvalue of $ 100.\n(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.\n(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where\narithmetic averages are used.\n                                        90                                        \nChanges in and ranges of unobservable\ninputs Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan\nChase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion\nof the impact on fair value of changes\nin unobservable inputs and the\nrelationships between unobservable\ninputs as well as a description of\nattributes of the underlying\ninstruments and external market factors\nthat affect the range of inputs used in\nthe valuation of the Firm\u2019s positions.\nChanges in level 3 recurring fair value\nmeasurements The following tables\ninclude a rollforward of the\nConsolidated balance sheets amounts\n(including changes in fair value) for\nfinancial instruments classified by the\nFirm within level 3 of the fair value\nhierarchy for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2022 and 2021. When a\ndetermination is made to classify a\nfinancial instrument within level 3,\nthe determination is based on the\nsignificance of the unobservable inputs\nto the overall fair value measurement.\nHowever, level 3 financial instruments\ntypically include, in addition to the\nunobservable or level 3 components,\nobservable components (that is,\ncomponents that are actively quoted and\ncan be validated to external sources);\naccordingly, the gains and losses in\nthe table below include changes in fair\nvalue due in part to observable factors\nthat are part of the valuation\nmethodology. Also, the Firm risk-\nmanages the observable components of\nlevel 3 financial instruments using\nsecurities and derivative positions\nthat are classified within level 1 or 2\nof the fair value hierarchy; as these\nlevel 1 and level 2 risk management\ninstruments are not included below, the\ngains or losses in the following tables\ndo not reflect the effect of the Firm\u2019s\nrisk

For certain loans, the fair value is\nmeasured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the\nloan takes into account the loan\u2019s allowance for loan losses, which represents the\nloan\u2019s expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference\nbetween the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally\nattributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market\nliquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do\nnot affect its carrying value.\nThe majority of the Firm\u2019s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis on the Consolidated balance sheets.

CIB, primarily in its market-making\nbusinesses.\n(c) Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the\nunderlying reference instrument is identical to the reference instrument on\nprotection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each individual\nidentical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than the\nnotional amount of protection sold.\n(d) Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the\ntime of settlement, which would generally reduce the amount the seller of\nprotection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement value.\n(e) Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-\nname, portfolio or index) where the Firm has not sold any protection on the\nidentical reference instrument.\nThe following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity\nprofile, and total fair value, of credit derivatives as of March 31, 2022, and\nDecember 31, 2021, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of protection. The maturity\nprofile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative\ncontracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on\nwhich the credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of\ncredit derivatives where JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are\ncomparable to the profile reflected below.\n

amortized cost of each security. The\neffective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and\naccretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-\nequivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes\nunscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of\nsecurities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain\nsecurities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the\naverage yield is calculated to the earliest call date.\n(b) Substantially all of the Firm\u2019s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized\nmortgage obligations are due in 10years or more, based on contractual maturity.\nThe estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future\nprepayments, is approximately 7years for agency residential MBS, 4years for agency\nresidential collateralized mortgage obligations and 5years for nonagency\nresidential collateralized mortgage obligations.\n                                       119                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Note 10 \u2013 Securities financing activities                                       \n                                                                                  \nRefer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting\npolicies relating to securities financing activities. Refer to Note 3 for further\ninformation regarding securities borrowed and securities lending agreements for\nwhich the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 23 for further\ninformation regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities\nfinancing agreements. The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the\nFirm\u2019s securities financing agreements as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\nWhen the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master\nnetting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria\nunder U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the\nbalances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same\ncounterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral\nwith its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but\nsuch collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation.\nWhere the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the\ncounterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with securities\nfinancing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S.\nGAAP, is presented in the table below as \u201cAmounts not nettable on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets,\u201d and reduces the \u201cNet amounts\u201d presented. Where a legal opinion\nhas not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are\npresented gross in the \u201cNet amounts\u201d below. In transactions where the Firm is\nacting as the lender in a securities-for-securities lending agreement and receives\nsecurities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, the Firm recognizes the\nsecurities received at fair value within other assets and the obligation to return\nthose securities within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets.\n

held $ 415million and $\n440million, respectively, of financial assets for which the rights have been\ntransferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized\nfinancing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and\nloans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in short-term\nborrowings on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n                                       121                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Note 11 \u2013 Loans                                                                 \n                                                                                  \nLoan accounting framework\n\nThe accounting for a loan depends on management\u2019s strategy for the loan.

The Firm\nreports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans\nthat have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the\nborrower (\u201cChapter 7 loans\u201d) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless\nof their delinquency status. At March 31, 2022, approximately 5% of Chapter 7\nresidential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.\n\n(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with\nregulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-\ndependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value\nof their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying\ncollateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be\nnegative.\n\n(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $ 45million\nfor both the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n(d) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response\nto the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n(e) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed\nby U.S government agencies. Typically the principal balance of the loans is\ninsured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to\nmeeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\nthese balances were no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing\nguidelines. There were noloans that were not guaranteed by U.S. government\nagencies that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at March\n31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\n\n(f) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the\nestimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a\nminimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized\nhome price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent\navailable and forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current\nestimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available\nlien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.\n\n(g) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower\u2019s most recent credit score,\nwhich is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.\n\n(h) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did\nnot have a refreshed FICO score. These loans have been included in a FICO band\nbased on management\u2019s estimation of the borrower\u2019s credit quality.\n\n(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.\n\n(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the\nmagnitude of the corresponding loan balances at March 31, 2022.\n\n(k) At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, included mortgage loans insured by\nU.S. government agencies of $ 65million and $ 66million, respectively.

Loans with short-term or other\ninsignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs. The\ncarrying value of new TDRs was $ 118million and $ 251million for the three months\nended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There were no additional commitments\nto lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans have been modified in\nTDRs. Nature and extent of modifications The Firm\u2019s proprietary modification\nprograms as well as government programs, including U.S. GSE programs, generally\nprovide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not\nlimited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and delays of\nprincipal and/or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under\nthe terms of the original agreement.

In accordance with\nregulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-\ndependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value\nof their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying\ncollateral improves subsequent to the charge down, the related allowance may be\nnegative.\n\n(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not\nmaterial for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 .\n\n(d) The geographic regions presented in this table are ordered based on the\nmagnitude of the corresponding loan balances at March 31, 2022.\n\nLoan modifications Certain auto and other loan modifications are considered to be\nTDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing\nfinancial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications\nthat are not considered concessions are not TDRs. The impact of these\nmodifications, as well as new TDRs, were not material to the Firm for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2022 and 2021.

borrowers\nwho are experiencing financial\ndifficulty. The Firm grants concessions\nfor most of the credit card loans under\nlong-term programs. These modifications\ninvolve placing the customer on a fixed\npayment plan, generally for 60months,\nand typically include reducing the\ninterest rate on the credit card.\nSubstantially all modifications under\nthe Firm\u2019s long-term programs are\nconsidered to be TDRs. Loans with\nshort-term or other insignificant\nmodifications that are not considered\nconcessions are not TDRs. If the\ncardholder does not comply with the\nmodified payment terms, then the credit\ncard loan continues to age and will\nultimately be charged-off in accordance\nwith the Firm\u2019s standard charge-off\npolicy. In most cases, the Firm does\nnot reinstate the borrower\u2019s line of\ncredit.\n\nFinancial effects of modifications and\nredefaults\n\nThe following table provides\ninformation about the financial effects\nof the concessions granted on credit\ncard loans modified in TDRs and\nredefaults for the periods presented.\nFor all periods disclosed, new\nenrollments were less than 1% of total\nretained credit card loans.\n                                                                                  \n  (in millions, except                   Three months ended                       \n  weighted-average data)        2022              March 31,  2021                 \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Balance of new TDRs(a)              $                        82  $         143  \n  Weighted-average interest                                                       \n  rate of loans                                       18.00     %     17.74    %  \n  \u2013 before TDR                                                                    \n  Weighted-average interest                                                       \n  rate of loans                                        4.87            5.23       \n  \u2013 after TDR                                                                     \n  Balance of loans that                                                           \n  redefaulted within                  $                         9  $          19  \n  one year of modification(b)                                                     \n                                                                                  \n(a) Represents the outstanding balance\nprior to modification.\n\n(b) Represents loans modified in TDRs\nthat experienced a payment default in\nthe periods presented, and for which\nthe payment default occurred within one\nyearof the modification.

New TDRs for the three months ended March 31,\n2022 and 2021 reflected extending maturity dates, covenant waivers and the receipt\nof assets in partial satisfaction of the loan predominantly in the Commercial and\nIndustrial loan class. The impact of these modifications resulting in new TDRs was\nnot material to the Firm for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\nThe carrying value of TDRs was $ 906million and $ 607million as of March 31, 2022,\nand December 31, 2021, respectively.\n                                       135                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Note 12 \u2013 Allowance for credit losses                                           \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses\nrepresents management's estimate of\nexpected credit losses over the\nremaining expected life of the Firm's\nfinancial assets measured at amortized\ncost and certain off-balance sheet\nlending-related commitments.

The\nchange in the allowance largely\nreflects an increased weight placed on\nthe adverse scenarios, from the more\nbalanced weighting placed on the\nadverse and upside scenarios at\nDecember 31, 2021, due to the potential\neffects associated with higher\ninflation, changes in monetary policy,\nas well as geopolitical risks,\nincluding the war in Ukraine. The\nincrease in the allowance also included\nclient-specific Russia and Russia-\nassociated downgrades in CIB and AWM.\nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses\nis estimated using a weighted average\nof five internally developed\nmacroeconomic scenarios. The adverse\nscenarios incorporate more punitive\nmacroeconomic factors than the central\ncase assumptions provided in the table\nbelow, resulting in weighted average\nU.S. unemployment rates above 4%\nthrough the second quarter of 2023 and\nyear over year growth in U.S. real GDP\nof 2.5% in the second quarter of 2023.\nThe Firm\u2019s central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and U.S.\nreal GDP as follows:\n                                                                                  \n                               Assumptions at March 31,                           \n                                                   2022                           \n                                                   2Q22       4Q22       2Q23     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. unemployment                                 3.6  %     3.3  %     3.3  %  \n  rate(a)                                                                         \n  YoY growth in U.S. real                           3.7  %     2.9  %     2.6  %  \n  GDP(b)                                                                          \n                                Assumptions at December                           \n                                               31, 2021                           \n                                                   2Q22       4Q22       2Q23     \n  U.S. unemployment                                 4.2  %     4.0  %     3.9  %  \n  rate(a)                                                                         \n  YoY growth in U.S. real                           3.1  %     2.8  %     2.1  %  \n  GDP(b)                                                                          \n                                                                                  \n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate.\n(b) As of March 31, 2022, the year over\nyear growth in U.S. real GDP in the\nforecast horizon of the central\nscenario is calculated as the percent\nchange in U.S. real GDP levels from the\nprior year.

The holders of these\nbeneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of\nJPMorgan Chase. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term\nbeneficial interests of $ 1.9billion and $ 2.6billion at March 31, 2022, and\nDecember 31, 2021, respectively.\n(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets.\nVIEs sponsored by third parties\n\nThe Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These\ninclude, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider,\ninvestor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian.\nThese transactions are conducted at arm\u2019s-length, and individual credit decisions\nare based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the\nquality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct\nthe activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic\nperformance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the\nFirm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these\npositions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record\nand report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. Tax credit\nvehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which\nare limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable\nhousing, energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs.\nA third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control\nover the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the\nFirm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these\npartnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt\nof tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented\nby equity investments and funding commitments, was $ 26.5billion and $\n26.8billion, of which $ 9.0billion and $ 9.4billion was unfunded at March 31, 2022\nand December 31, 2021, respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce\nthe risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the\nproject qualifies for tax credits.

In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity\nprovider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In\nthose transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to\nthe third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any\nintent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying\nmunicipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm\ndoes not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the municipal bond vehicle.

Refer to Note 15 of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K for a\nfurther discussion of the Firm\u2019s\ngoodwill impairment testing.\nUnanticipated declines in business\nperformance, increases in credit\nlosses, increases in capital\nrequirements, as well as deterioration\nin economic or market conditions,\nadverse regulatory or legislative\nchanges or increases in the estimated\nmarket cost of equity, could cause the\nestimated fair values of the Firm\u2019s\nreporting units to decline in the\nfuture, which could result in a\nmaterial impairment charge to earnings\nin a future period related to some\nportion of the associated goodwill. As\nof March 31, 2022, the Firm reviewed\ncurrent economic conditions, estimated\nmarket cost of equity, as well as\nactual business results and projections\nof business performance. Based on such\nreviews, the Firm has concluded that\ngoodwill was not impaired as of March\n31, 2022, or December 31, 2021, nor was\ngoodwill written off due to impairment\nduring the three months ended March 31,\n2022 or 2021.\n                                       145                                        \nMortgage servicing rights\n\nMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing\nservicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future\nservicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the\nloans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received,\neffectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary\nfee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale\nor securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained.

The\ncontractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible\ncredit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or\nthe Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the\ncustomer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the\ncontract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been\nrefinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default\noccurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not,\nin the Firm\u2019s view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or\nfunding requirements.

Refer to Note 12 for further\ninformation regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related\ncommitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying\nvalues of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and\nother commitments at March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021. The amounts in the\ntable below for credit card, home equity and certain scored business banking\nlending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these\nproducts. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all\navailable lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time.\nThe Firm can reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business banking\nlines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by\nlaw, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when\nthe borrower is 60days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when\nthere are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when\nthere has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.\n                                       155                                        \n                                                                                  \n         \u2026

Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of credit\nderivatives.\n\nMerchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment networks, the Firm, in its role\nas a merchant acquirer, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed\ncredit and debit card transactions that result in a charge-back to the merchant.\nIf a dispute is resolved in the cardholder\u2019s favor, Merchant Services will\n(through the cardholder\u2019s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the\ncardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If Merchant\nServices is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, Merchant Services will\nbear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. Merchant\nServices mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash\nreserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, Merchant Services\nrecognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk to\nthe Firm related to charge-backs.\n                                       157                                        \nLoan sales- and securitization-related\nindemnifications In connection with the\nFirm\u2019s mortgage loan sale and\nsecuritization activities with GSEs the\nFirm has made representations and\nwarranties that the loans sold meet\ncertain requirements, and that may\nrequire the Firm to repurchase mortgage\nloans and/or indemnify the loan\npurchaser if such representations and\nwarranties are breached by the Firm.\nThe liability related to repurchase\ndemands associated with private label\nsecuritizations is separately evaluated\nby the Firm in establishing its\nlitigation reserves. Refer to Note 24\nof this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K for\nadditional information regarding\nlitigation. Sponsored member repo\nprogram The Firm acts as a sponsoring\nmember to clear eligible overnight and\nterm resale and repurchase agreements\nthrough the Government Securities\nDivision of the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation (\u201cFICC\u201d) on behalf of\nclients that become sponsored members\nunder the FICC\u2019s rules. The Firm also\nguarantees to the FICC the prompt and\nfull payment and performance of its\nsponsored member clients\u2019 respective\nobligations under the FICC\u2019s rules. The\nFirm minimizes its liability under\nthese guarantees by obtaining a\nsecurity interest in the cash or high-\nquality securities collateral that the\nclients place with the clearing house\ntherefore the Firm expects the risk of\nloss to be remote. The Firm\u2019s maximum\npossible exposure, without taking into\nconsideration the associated\ncollateral, is included in the Exchange\n& clearing house guarantees and\ncommitments line on page 156. Refer to\nNote 11 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2021 Form\n10-K for additional information on\ncredit risk mitigation practices on\nresale agreements and the types of\ncollateral pledged under repurchase\nagreements. Guarantees of subsidiaries\nThe Parent Company has guaranteed\ncertain long-term debt and structured\nnotes of its subsidiaries, including\nJPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC\n(\u201cJPMFC\u201d), a 100%-owned finance\nsubsidiary. All securities issued by\nJPMFC are fully and unconditionally\nguaranteed by the Parent Company and no\nother subsidiary of the Parent Company\nguarantees these securities. These\nguarantees, which rank on a parity with\nthe Firm\u2019s unsecured and unsubordinated\nindebtedness, are not included in the\ntable on page 156 of this Note.

The\nlitigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class\naction lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations and\nregulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by\nboth governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal\nproceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation,\nand involve each of the Firm\u2019s lines of business and several geographies and a\nwide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and\nstatutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which\npresent novel legal theories. The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate\nrange of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its\nlegal proceedings is from $ 0to approximately $ 1.4billion at March 31, 2022. This\nestimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information\navailable as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an\nestimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm\ndoes not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm\u2019s\nestimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant\njudgment, given: \u2022 the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings,\nincluding the fact that many are in preliminary stages, \u2022 the existence in many\nsuch proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of\nliability (if any) has yet to be determined, \u2022 the numerous yet-unresolved issues\nin many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the\nscope of many of the claims, and \u2022 the attendant uncertainty of the various\npotential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made\nassumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about\nthe behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those\nassumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular\nproceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its\nestimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote.\nAccordingly, the Firm\u2019s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible\nlosses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly.\nSet forth below are descriptions of the Firm\u2019s material legal proceedings.\nAmrapali . India\u2019s Enforcement Directorate (\u201cED\u201d) is investigating J.P. Morgan\nIndia Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by\ntwooffshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential\nhousing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (\u201cAmrapali\u201d). In 2017, numerous\ncreditors filed civil claims against Amrapali, including petitions brought by home\nbuyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units.\nThe home buyers\u2019 petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India and\nare ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India\nPrivate Limited approximately $ 31.5million. The Firm is appealing the order and\nthe fine. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order\nmaking preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified\nJPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects,\nviolated certain currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordering\nthe ED to conduct a further inquiry under India\u2019s Prevention of Money Laundering\nAct (\u201cPMLA\u201d) and Foreign Exchange Management Act (\u201cFEMA\u201d). In May 2020, the ED\nattached approximately $ 25million from J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in\nconnection with the criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and\ncooperating with the PMLA investigation. Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation.\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the\nFederal Government of Nigeria (\u201cFGN\u201d) and two major international oil companies.\nThe account held approximately $ 1.1billion in connection with a dispute among the\nclients over rights to an oil field. Following the settlement of the dispute,\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in\naccordance with directions received from its clients. In November 2017, the\nFederal Republic of Nigeria (\u201cFRN\u201d) commenced a claim in the English High Court\nfor approximately $ 875million in payments made out of the accounts. The FRN,\nclaiming to be the same entity as the FGN, alleges that the payments were\ninstructed as part of a complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but\nthat JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or should have been on notice that the payments\nmay be fraudulent. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. applied for summary judgment and was\nunsuccessful. A trial was held between February and April 2022, and the parties\nare awaiting the Court's decision. Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation.\nThe Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities\nrelating to its foreign exchange (\u201cFX\u201d) sales and trading activities and controls\nrelated to those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm\npleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The Department of\nLabor granted the Firm a five-year\n                                       159                                        \nexemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and its affiliates to continue\nto rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee\nRetirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d) until January 2023. The Firm will need\nthe Department of Labor to approve a further exemption to cover the remainder of\nthe ten-yeardisqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only\nremaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission\nmatter which is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal.\nWith respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval to the\nFirm\u2019s settlement of a consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs,\nwhich principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged\nconspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf\nof persons who transacted in FX futures and options on futures. Certain members of\nthe settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class,\nand certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm and other foreign exchange\ndealers in November 2018. A number of these actions remain pending. Further, a\nputative class action has been filed against the Firm and other foreign exchange\ndealers on behalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at\nallegedly inflated rates. Another putative class action was brought against the\nFirm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of purported indirect purchasers\nof FX instruments. In 2020, the Court approved a settlement by the Firm and\n11other defendants of that class action for a total of $ 10million. In addition,\nsome FX-related individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged\nunderlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K.,\nIsrael, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. In a putative class action pending\nbefore the U.K. Competition Appeal Tribunal, the tribunal has denied a request by\nthe proposed class representatives for class certification on an opt-out basis.\nInquiries Concerning Preservation Requirements . In December 2021 certain of the\nFirm\u2019s subsidiaries entered into resolutions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) to\nresolve their respective civil investigations of compliance with records\npreservation requirements applicable to broker-dealer firms, swap dealers and\nfutures commission merchants. The SEC and CFTC found that J.P. Morgan Securities\nLLC did not maintain copies of certain communications required to be maintained\nunder their respective record keeping rules, where such communications were sent\nor received by employees over electronic messaging channels that had not been\napproved for employee use by the Firm. The CFTC resolution also included JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities plc as swap dealers. The SEC and CFTC\nalso found related supervision failures. Under these resolutions, J.P. Morgan\nSecurities LLC paid a $ 125million civil monetary penalty to the SEC, and J.P.\nMorgan Securities LLC, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities plc\npaid a total $ 75million civil monetary penalty to the CFTC. The Firm continues to\nrespond to requests for information and other material from certain authorities\nconcerning its compliance with records preservation requirements in connection\nwith business communications sent over electronic messaging channels that have not\nbeen approved by the Firm. The Firm is cooperating with these inquiries. In March\n2022, a shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of New York against the Firm\u2019s Board of Directors\nasserting breaches of fiduciary duty and violation of federal securities laws\nbased on the Board\u2019s alleged failure to exercise adequate oversight over\ncompliance with records preservation requirements. The complaint seeks damages,\nrestitution, disgorgement and corporate governance reforms. Interchange\nLitigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class\naction complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks,\nconspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted\nrelated rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially\nsettled the cases for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card\ninterchange, and modifications to certain credit card network rules. In 2017,\nafter the approval of that settlement was reversed on appeal, the case was\nremanded to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York\nfor further proceedings consistent with the appellate decision. The original class\naction was divided into twoseparate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief\nand the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties\nto the monetary class action finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes\nthe prior settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants\ncollectively contributed an additional $ 900million to the approximately $\n5.3billion previously held in escrow from the original settlement. In December\n2019, the amended settlement agreement was approved by the District Court. Certain\nmerchants appealed the District Court\u2019s approval order, and those appeals are\npending. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended class\nsettlement, $ 700million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement\nescrow in accordance with the settlement agreement. The injunctive class action\ncontinues separately, and in September 2021, the District Court granted\nplaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion in part.\nIn addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions raising similar\nallegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other\nbanks, and some of those actions remain pending. LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate\nInvestigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from\nvarious governmental agencies and entities around the\n                                       160                                        \nworld relating primarily to the British Bankers Association\u2019s (\"BBA\") London\nInterbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) for various currencies and the European Banking\nFederation\u2019s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cEURIBOR\u201d). The Swiss Competition\nCommission\u2019s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and other banks\nare subject, continues. In December 2016, the European Commission issued a\ndecision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European\nantitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision\nwith the European General Court, and that appeal is pending. In addition, the Firm\nhas been named as a defendant along with other banks in various individual and\nputative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In\nactions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by\nthe BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain\nother actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York has granted class\ncertification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold\ndirectly by the defendants, including the Firm. A consolidated putative class\naction related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was administered by ICE\nBenchmark Administration has been dismissed. In addition, a group of individual\nplaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and\nother defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR\nand conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit\ncards. Defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. In December 2021, the\ncourt denied plaintiffs\u2019 motions for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin\ndefendants from setting U.S. dollar LIBOR and enforcing any financial instruments\nthat rely on U.S. dollar LIBOR. The Firm\u2019s settlements of putative class actions\nrelated to Swiss franc LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the\nSingapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate remain\nsubject to court approval. Metals and U.S. Treasuries Investigations and\nLitigation and Related Inquiries. The Firm previously reported that it and/or\ncertain of its subsidiaries had entered into resolutions with the U.S. Department\nof Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d), the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) and the\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), which, collectively, resolved\nthose agencies\u2019 respective investigations relating to historical trading practices\nby former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related\nconduct from 2008 to 2016. The Firm entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement\n(\u201cDPA\u201d) with the DOJ in which it agreed to the filing of a criminal information\ncharging JPMorgan Chase & Co. with twocounts of wire fraud and agreed, along with\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to certain terms and\nobligations as set forth therein. Under the terms of the DPA, the criminal\ninformation will be dismissed after three years, provided that JPMorgan Chase &\nCo., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC fully comply with\nall of their obligations. Across the threeresolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC,\nJPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC\nagreed to pay a total monetary amount of approximately $ 920million. A portion of\nthe total monetary amount includes victim compensation payments. Several putative\nclass action complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for\nthe Southern District of New York against the Firm and certain former employees,\nalleging a precious metals futures and options price manipulation scheme in\nviolation of the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust\nenrichment and deceptive acts or practices under the General Business Law of the\nState of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class actions, and, in\nDecember 2021, the Court preliminarily approved a settlement among the parties. In\naddition, several putative class actions were filed in the United States District\nCourts for the Northern District of Illinois and Southern District of New York\nagainst the Firm, alleging manipulation of U.S. Treasury futures and options, and\nbringing claims under the Commodity Exchange Act. The actions in the Northern\nDistrict of Illinois were transferred to the Southern District of New York. The\nCourt consolidated these putative class actions, and, in December 2021, the Court\npreliminarily approved a settlement among the parties. In Canada, plaintiffs have\nmoved to commence putative class action proceedings based on similar alleged\nunderlying conduct related to precious metals. In October 2020, twoputative class\naction complaints were filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the Firm\nand certain individual defendants on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares\nduring the putative class period alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm\nwere materially false or misleading in that they did not disclose certain\ninformation relating to the above-referenced investigations. The Court\nconsolidated these putative class actions in January 2021. Plaintiffs filed their\nsecond amended complaint in May 2021, which additionally alleged that certain\norders in precious metals futures contracts placed by precious metals futures\ntraders during the putative class period were materially false and misleading.\nDefendants have moved to dismiss. Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation .\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc.,\nand J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a\nputative class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law\nand New York State common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent\nthe emergence of anonymous exchange trading for securities lending transactions.\nDefendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint was denied.\n                                       161                                        \nPlaintiffs have moved to certify a\nclass in this action, which defendants\nare opposing. * * * In addition to the\nvarious legal proceedings discussed\nabove, JPMorgan Chase and its\nsubsidiaries are named as defendants or\nare otherwise involved in a substantial\nnumber of other legal proceedings. The\nFirm believes it has meritorious\ndefenses to the claims asserted against\nit in its currently outstanding legal\nproceedings and it intends to defend\nitself vigorously. Additional legal\nproceedings may be initiated from time\nto time in the future. The Firm has\nestablished reserves for several\nhundred of its currently outstanding\nlegal proceedings. In accordance with\nthe provisions of U.S. GAAP for\ncontingencies, the Firm accrues for a\nlitigation-related liability when it is\nprobable that such a liability has been\nincurred and the amount of the loss can\nbe reasonably estimated. The Firm\nevaluates its outstanding legal\nproceedings each quarter to assess its\nlitigation reserves, and makes\nadjustments in such reserves, upward or\ndownward, as appropriate, based on\nmanagement\u2019s best judgment after\nconsultation with counsel. The Firm\u2019s\nlegal expense was $ 119million and $\n28million for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThere is no assurance that the Firm\u2019s\nlitigation reserves will not need to be\nadjusted in the future. In view of the\ninherent difficulty of predicting the\noutcome of legal proceedings,\nparticularly where the claimants seek\nvery large or indeterminate damages, or\nwhere the matters present novel legal\ntheories, involve a large number of\nparties or are in early stages of\ndiscovery, the Firm cannot state with\nconfidence what will be the eventual\noutcomes of the currently pending\nmatters, the timing of their ultimate\nresolution or the eventual losses,\nfines, penalties or consequences\nrelated to those matters. JPMorgan\nChase believes, based upon its current\nknowledge and after consultation with\ncounsel, consideration of the material\nlegal proceedings described above and\nafter taking into account its current\nlitigation reserves and its estimated\naggregate range of possible losses,\nthat the other legal proceedings\ncurrently pending against it should not\nhave a material adverse effect on the\nFirm\u2019s consolidated financial\ncondition. The Firm notes, however,\nthat in light of the uncertainties\ninvolved in such proceedings, there is\nno assurance that the ultimate\nresolution of these matters will not\nsignificantly exceed the reserves it\nhas currently accrued or that a matter\nwill not have material reputational\nconsequences. As a result, the outcome\nof a particular matter may be material\nto JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operating results\nfor a particular period, depending on,\namong other factors, the size of the\nloss or liability imposed and the level\nof JPMorgan Chase\u2019s income for that\nperiod.\n                                       162                                        \n                                                                                  \n  Note 25 \u2013 Business segments                                                     \n                                                                                  \nThe Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are fourmajor reportable business\nsegments - Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial\nBanking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment.\nThe business segments are determined based on the products and services provided,\nor the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial\ninformation is currently evaluated by the Firm\u2019s Operating Committee. Segment\nresults are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results below, and Note\n32 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\nbusiness segments. Segment results The following table provides a summary of the\nFirm\u2019s segment results as of or for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and\n2021, on a managed basis. The Firm\u2019s definition of managed basis starts with the\nreported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total\nnet revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE\nbasis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-\nexempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to\ntaxable investments and securities. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2021 Form\n10-K for additional information on the Firm\u2019s managed basis. Capital allocation\nThe amount of capital assigned to each segment is referred to as equity.\nPeriodically, the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are\nreassessed and as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change.

As a result, the\nestimated collateral values used to\ncalculate these ratios do not represent\nactual appraised loan-level collateral\nvalues; as such, the resulting LTV\nratios are necessarily imprecise and\nshould therefore be viewed as\nestimates.\n                                                                                  \n  Combined LTV ratio                                                              \n                                                                                  \nThe LTV ratio considering all available\nlien positions, as well as unused\nlines, related to the property.\nCombined LTV ratios are used for junior\nlien home equity products.\n\nManaged basis: A non-GAAP presentation\nof Firmwide financial results that\nincludes reclassifications to present\nrevenue on a fully taxable-equivalent\nbasis.

Alt-A lending\ncharacteristics may include one or more\nof the following: (i) limited\ndocumentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio;\n(iii) loans secured by non-owner\noccupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-\nincome ratio above normal limits. A\nsubstantial proportion of the Firm\u2019s\nAlt-A loans are those where a borrower\ndoes not provide complete documentation\nof his or her assets or the amount or\nsource of his or her income.\n\nOption ARMs\n\nThe option ARM real estate loan product\nis an adjustable-rate mortgage loan\nthat provides the borrower with the\noption each month to make a fully\namortizing, interest-only or minimum\npayment. The minimum payment on an\noption ARM loan is based on the\ninterest rate charged during the\nintroductory period. This introductory\nrate is usually significantly below the\nfully indexed rate. The fully indexed\nrate is calculated using an index rate\nplus a margin. Once the introductory\nperiod ends, the contractual interest\nrate charged on the loan increases to\nthe fully indexed rate and adjusts\nmonthly to reflect movements in the\nindex. The minimum payment is typically\ninsufficient to cover interest accrued\nin the prior month, and any unpaid\ninterest is deferred and added to the\nprincipal balance of the loan. Option\nARM loans are subject to payment\nrecast, which converts the loan to a\nvariable-rate fully amortizing loan\nupon meeting specified loan balance and\nanniversary date triggers.\n\nPrime\n\nPrime mortgage loans are made to\nborrowers with good credit records who\nmeet specific underwriting\nrequirements, including prescriptive\nrequirements related to income and\noverall debt levels.

The Nomura \u201cstar\nrating\u201d is based on three-year risk-\nadjusted performance only. Funds with\nfewer than three years of history are\nnot rated and hence excluded from these\nrankings. All ratings, the assigned\npeer\n                                       173                                        \ncategories and the asset values used to\nderive these rankings are sourced from\nthe applicable fund rating provider.\nWhere applicable, the fund rating\nproviders redenominate asset values\ninto U.S. dollars. The percentage of\nAUM is based on star ratings at the\nshare class level for U.S.-domiciled\nfunds, and at a \u201cprimary share class\u201d\nlevel to represent the star rating of\nall other funds, except for Japan, for\nwhich Nomura provides ratings at the\nfund level. The performance data may\nhave been different if all share\nclasses had been included. Past\nperformance is not indicative of future\nresults.\n\nPercentage of mutual fund assets under\nmanagement in funds ranked in the 1st\nor 2nd quartile (one, three, and five\nyears): All quartile rankings, the\nassigned peer categories and the asset\nvalues used to derive these rankings\nare sourced from the fund rating\nproviders. Quartile rankings are based\non the net-of-fee absolute return of\neach fund. Where applicable, the fund\nrating providers redenominate asset\nvalues into U.S. dollars. The\npercentage of AUM is based on fund\nperformance and associated peer\nrankings at the share class level for\nU.S.-domiciled funds, at a \u201cprimary\nshare class\u201d level to represent the\nquartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg\nand Hong Kong funds and at the fund\nlevel for all other funds. The\nperformance data may have been\ndifferent if all share classes had been\nincluded. Past performance is not\nindicative of future results.\n\n\u201c Primary share class \u201d means the C\nshare class for European funds and Acc\nshare class for Hong Kong and Taiwan\nfunds. If these share classes are not\navailable, the oldest share class is\nused as the primary share class.\n                                       174                                        \n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                                                                \u2502\n\u2502  Item 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.Refer   \u2502\n\u2502  to the Market Risk Management section of Management\u2019s discussion and          \u2502\n\u2502  analysis and pages 133-140 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K for a           \u2502\n\u2502  discussion of the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market       \u2502\n\u2502  risk.Item 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Controls and Procedures.As of the end of the period covered   \u2502\n\u2502  by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with  \u2502\n\u2502  the participation of the Firm\u2019s management, including its Chairman and Chief  \u2502\n\u2502  Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of    \u2502\n\u2502  its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under    \u2502\n\u2502  the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Chairman  \u2502\n\u2502  and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that    \u2502\n\u2502  these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Refer to Exhibits    \u2502\n\u2502  31.1 and 31.2 for the Certifications furnished by the Chairman and Chief      \u2502\n\u2502  Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively.The Firm is       \u2502\n\u2502  committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial    \u2502\n\u2502  reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal        \u2502\n\u2502  control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all                \u2502\n\u2502  misstatements. Deficiencies or lapses in internal controls may occur from     \u2502\n\u2502  time to time, and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will   \u2502\n\u2502  not result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal     \u2502\n\u2502  control in the future and collateral consequences therefrom. Refer to         \u2502\n\u2502  \u201cManagement\u2019s report on internal control over financial reporting\u201d on page    \u2502\n\u2502  156 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K for further information.
