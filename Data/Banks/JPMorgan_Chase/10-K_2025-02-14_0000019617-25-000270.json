JPMorgan Chase & Co. is\na bank holding company (\u201cBHC\u201d) and a financial\nholding company (\u201cFHC\u201d) under U.S. federal law, and\nis subject to comprehensive consolidated\nsupervision, regulation and examination by the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n(the \u201cFederal Reserve\u201d). The Federal Reserve acts\nas the supervisor of the consolidated operations of\nBHCs. Certain of JPMorganChase\u2019s subsidiaries are\nalso regulated directly by additional authorities\nbased on the activities or licenses of those\nsubsidiaries.\n\nJPMorganChase\u2019s national bank subsidiary, JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A., is supervised and regulated by\nthe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\n(\u201cOCC\u201d) and, with respect to certain matters, by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the\n\u201cFDIC\u201d).\n\nJPMorganChase\u2019s U.S. broker-dealers are supervised\nand regulated by the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and the Financial Industry\nRegulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d). Subsidiaries of the\nFirm that engage in certain futures-related and\nswaps-related activities are supervised and\nregulated by the Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission (\u201cCFTC\u201d). J.P. Morgan Securities plc\nholds a banking license in the U.K. and is\nregulated by the U.K. Prudential Regulation\nAuthority (the \u201cPRA\u201d) and the U.K. Financial\nConduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d).\n\nJPMSE is a Germany-based credit institution jointly\nregulated by the European Central Bank (\u201cECB\u201d), the\nGerman Financial Supervisory Authority and the\nGerman Central Bank, as well as the local\nregulators in each of the countries in which it\noperates. The Firm\u2019s other non-U.S. subsidiaries\nare regulated by the banking, securities,\nprudential, payments and conduct regulatory\nauthorities, as applicable, in the countries in\nwhich they operate.\n\nPermissible business activities . The Bank Holding\nCompany Act restricts BHCs from engaging in\nbusiness activities other than the business of\nbanking and certain closely-related activities.\nFHCs are permitted to engage in a broader range of\nfinancial activities. The Federal Reserve has the\nauthority to limit an FHC\u2019s ability to conduct\notherwise permissible activities if the FHC or any\nof its depository institution subsidiaries ceases\nto meet applicable eligibility requirements. The\nFederal Reserve may also impose corrective capital\nand/or managerial requirements on the FHC, and if\ndeficiencies are persistent, may require\ndivestiture of the FHC\u2019s depository institutions.\nIf any\n\ndepository institution controlled by an FHC fails\nto maintain a satisfactory rating under the\nCommunity Reinvestment Act, the Federal Reserve\nmust prohibit the FHC and its subsidiaries from\nengaging in any new activities other than those\npermissible for BHCs, or acquiring a company\nengaged in such activities.\n\nCapital and liquidity requirements . The Federal\nReserve establishes capital, liquidity and leverage\nrequirements for JPMorganChase that are generally\nconsistent with the international Basel III capital\nand liquidity framework and evaluates the Firm\u2019s\ncompliance with those requirements. The OCC\nestablishes similar requirements for JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. Certain of the Firm\u2019s non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries and branches are also subject to local\ncapital and liquidity requirements.\n\nBanking supervisors globally continue to refine and\nenhance the Basel III capital framework for\nfinancial institutions. In July 2023, U.S. banking\nregulators released a proposal to amend the U.S.\nrisk-based capital framework to incorporate certain\nelements of the revised international Basel III\ncapital framework. The proposal would significantly\nrevise risk-based capital requirements for banks\nwith assets of $100 billion or more, including the\nFirm and other U.S. global systemically important\nbanks (\"GSIBs\"). Finalization of the proposal,\nincluding the required implementation date, is\nuncertain. The Firm continues to monitor\ndevelopments and potential impacts.\n\nIn the EU and U.K., regulators have finalized the\nrules implementing their Basel III frameworks. The\nnew rules became effective in the EU beginning\nJanuary 1, 2025, with market risk aspects delayed\nuntil January 1, 2026. In January 2025, the PRA\nannounced that it intends to delay the\nimplementation of the new rules in the U.K. to\nJanuary 1, 2027. There are certain transitional\narrangements applicable in both the EU and U.K.\nuntil 2032 and 2030, respectively.\n\nStress tests . As a large BHC, JPMorganChase is\nsubject to supervisory stress testing administered\nby the Federal Reserve as part of the Federal\nReserve\u2019s annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and\nReview (\u201cCCAR\u201d) framework. The Firm must conduct\nannual company-run stress tests and must also\nsubmit an annual capital plan to the Federal\nReserve, taking into account the results of\nseparate stress tests designed by each of the Firm\nand the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve uses\nthe results under the severely adverse scenario\nfrom its supervisory stress test to determine the\nFirm\u2019s Stress Capital Buffer (\u201cSCB\u201d) requirement\nfor the coming year, which forms part of the Firm\u2019s\napplicable capital buffers. The Firm is required to\nfile its annual CCAR submission on April 5, 2025.\nThe Federal Reserve will notify the Firm of its\nindicative SCB requirement by June 30, 2025 and\nfinal SCB requirement by August 31, 2025. The\nFirm\u2019s final\n     \n  2  \n     \nSCB requirement will become effective on October 1,\n2025. The OCC requires JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to\nperform separate, similar stress tests annually.\nThe Firm publishes each year the results of the\nannual stress tests for the Firm and JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. under the supervisory \u201cseverely adverse\u201d\nscenarios provided by the Federal Reserve and the\nOCC. In December 2024, the Federal Reserve\nindicated in a press release that it intends to\nseek public comment on changes to its stress\ntesting framework. Additionally, there is a pending\nlegal challenge to the manner in which stress\ntesting is administered. Refer to Litigation and\nregulatory challenges on pages 6-7 for further\ninformation.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 97\u2013107\nand Liquidity Risk Management on pages 108\u2013115 for\nmore information.\n\nEnhanced prudential standards . As part of its\nmandate to identify and monitor risks to the\nfinancial stability of the U.S. posed by large\nbanking organizations, the Financial Stability\nOversight Council (\u201cFSOC\u201d) recommends prudential\nstandards and reporting requirements to the Federal\nReserve for systemically important financial\ninstitutions (\u201cSIFIs\u201d), such as JPMorganChase. The\nFederal Reserve has adopted several rules to\nimplement those heightened prudential standards,\nincluding rules relating to risk management and\ncorporate governance of subject BHCs. JPMorganChase\nis required under these rules to comply with\nenhanced liquidity and overall risk management\nstandards, including oversight by the board of\ndirectors of risk management activities.\n\nHolding company as a source of strength. JPMorgan\nChase & Co. is required to serve as a source of\nfinancial strength for its depository institution\nsubsidiaries and to commit resources to support\nthose subsidiaries, including when directed to do\nso by the Federal Reserve.\n\nRegulation of acquisitions . Acquisitions by BHCs\nand their banks are subject to requirements,\nlimitations and prohibitions established by law and\nby the Federal Reserve and the OCC. For example,\nFHCs and BHCs are required to obtain the approval\nof the Federal Reserve before they acquire more\nthan 5% of the voting shares of an unaffiliated\nbank. In addition, acquisitions by financial\ncompanies are generally prohibited if, as a result\nof the acquisition, the total liabilities of the\nfinancial company would exceed 10% of the total\nliabilities of all financial companies, as\ndetermined under Federal Reserve regulations.\nFurthermore, for certain acquisitions, the Firm\nmust provide written notice to the Federal Reserve\nprior to acquiring direct or indirect ownership or\ncontrol of any voting shares of any company with\nover $10 billion in assets that is engaged in\nactivities that are \u201cfinancial in nature.\u201d\nMoreover, while FHCs may engage in a\n\nbroader range of activities (including\nacquisitions) than BHCs, the Federal Reserve has\nthe authority to limit an FHC\u2019s ability to conduct\notherwise permissible acquisitions if the FHC or\nany of its depository institution subsidiaries\nceases to meet applicable eligibility requirements.\n\nOngoing obligations . The Firm is subject to a\nfive-year cooperation obligation under an order\nissued by the CFTC on September 29, 2020, relating\nto precious metals and U.S. Treasuries markets\ninvestigations. The Firm also remains subject to\nconsent orders entered into in March 2024 with the\nOCC and the Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, and a resolution entered into in\nMay 2024 with the CFTC, which relate to the Firm\u2019s\nprocesses to inventory trading venues and confirm\nthe completeness of certain data fed to trade\nsurveillance platforms.\n\nSubsidiary banks:\n\nThe activities of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the\nFirm\u2019s principal subsidiary bank, are limited to\nthose specifically authorized under the National\nBank Act and related interpretations of the OCC.\nThe OCC has authority to bring an enforcement\naction against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. for unsafe\nor unsound banking practices, which could include\nlimiting JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s ability to\nconduct otherwise permissible activities, or\nimposing corrective capital or managerial\nrequirements on the bank.\n\nFDIC deposit insurance. The FDIC deposit insurance\nfund provides insurance coverage for certain\ndeposits and is funded through assessments on\nbanks, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The FDIC\nis required to maintain a minimum reserve ratio,\nwhich measures the balance of reserves in the\ndeposit insurance fund against an estimate of FDIC-\ninsured deposits, of 1.35%. The reserve ratio is\ncurrently below the statutory minimum and, in\nOctober 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule to\nraise bank assessments and accelerate the time by\nwhich the reserve ratio would meet the statutory\nminimum. As a result, the FDIC has adopted a\nrestoration plan to bring the reserve ratio up to\nthe required 1.35% by September 30, 2028, with a\nlonger-term target of maintaining a reserve ratio\nof 2%.\n\nFDIC powers upon a bank insolvency. Upon any\ninsolvency of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the FDIC\ncould be appointed as conservator or receiver under\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The FDIC has\nbroad powers to transfer assets and liabilities\nwithout the approval of the institution\u2019s\ncreditors.\n\nPrompt corrective action. The Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991\nrequires the relevant federal banking regulator to\ntake \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d with respect to a\ndepository institution if that institution does not\nmeet certain\n     \n  3  \n     \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                                                  \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\ncapital adequacy standards. The Federal Reserve is\nalso authorized to take appropriate action against\nthe parent BHC, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co., based\non the undercapitalized status of any bank\nsubsidiary. In certain instances, the BHC would be\nrequired to guarantee the performance of the\ncapital restoration plan for its undercapitalized\nsubsidiary.\n\nHeightened Supervisory Standards. In the U.S., the\nOCC has established guidelines setting forth\nheightened standards for large banks, including\nminimum standards for the design and implementation\nof a risk governance framework for banks. Under\nthese standards, a bank\u2019s risk governance framework\nmust ensure that the bank\u2019s risk profile is easily\ndistinguished and separate from that of its parent\nBHC for risk management purposes. The bank\u2019s board\nor risk committee is responsible for approving the\nbank\u2019s risk governance framework, providing active\noversight of the bank\u2019s risk-taking activities, and\nholding management accountable for adhering to the\nrisk governance framework.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s banking entities in the EU and the U.K.\nare subject to supervisory expectations published\nby the ECB and the PRA, respectively, addressing\nbank strategy, governance and risk management in\nthe areas of climate change, operational\nresilience, reliance on IT systems and third-party\nservices, and resilience from macro-financial and\ngeopolitical shocks.\n\nRestrictions on transactions with affiliates.\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries are\nsubject to restrictions imposed by federal law on\nextensions of credit to, investments in stock or\nsecurities of, and derivatives, securities lending\nand certain other transactions with, JPMorgan Chase\n& Co. and certain other affiliates. These\nrestrictions prevent JPMorgan Chase & Co. and other\naffiliates from borrowing from JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. and its subsidiaries unless the loans are\nsecured in specified amounts and comply with\ncertain other requirements.\n\nDividend restrictions. Federal law imposes\nlimitations on the payment of dividends by national\nbanks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Refer to\nNote 26 for the amount of dividends that JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. could pay, at January 1, 2025, to\nJPMorganChase without the approval of the banking\nregulators. The OCC and the Federal Reserve also\nhave authority to prohibit or limit the payment of\ndividends of a bank subsidiary that they supervise\nif, in the banking regulator\u2019s opinion, payment of\na dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound\npractice in light of the financial condition of the\nbank.\n\nDepositor preference. Under federal law, the claims\nof a receiver of an insured depositary institution\n(\u201cIDI\u201d) for administrative expense and the claims\nof holders of\n\nU.S. deposit liabilities (including the FDIC and\ndeposits in non-U.S. branches that are dually\npayable in the U.S. and in a non-U.S. branch) have\npriority over the claims of other unsecured\ncreditors of the institution, including depositors\nin non-U.S. branches and public noteholders.\n\nConsumer supervision and regulation. JPMorganChase\nand JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. are subject to\nsupervision and regulation in the U.S. by the\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) with\nrespect to federal consumer protection laws,\nincluding laws relating to fair lending and the\nprohibition of unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or\npractices in connection with the offer, sale or\nprovision of consumer financial products and\nservices. The CFPB also has jurisdiction over small\nbusiness lending activities with respect to fair\nlending and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. As\npart of its regulatory oversight, the CFPB has\nauthority to take enforcement actions against firms\nthat offer certain products and services to\nconsumers using practices that are deemed to be\nunfair, deceptive or abusive. In March 2024, the\nCFPB released a final rule which significantly\nreduces the late payment fees that large credit\ncard issuers, including the Firm, are permitted to\ncharge to customers (the \u201cCFPB Late Fee Rule\u201d). The\nfinal rule is currently stayed pending resolution\nof an industry-led challenge in federal court.\nRefer to Litigation and regulatory challenges on\npages 6-7 for further information.\n\nIn addition, in October 2024, the CFPB issued a\nfinal rule that requires data providers, including\nbanks, to make certain consumer data available to\nconsumers and authorized third parties in\nelectronic form beginning in April 2026 (the \u201cCFPB\nData Sharing Rule\u201d).

These laws, rules and regulations are\nconstantly evolving, subject to interpretation,\nremain a focus of regulators globally, may be\nenforced by private parties or government bodies,\nand continue to have a significant impact on all of\nthe Firm\u2019s businesses and operations.\n\nFor example, the Digital Operational Resilience Act\n(DORA) mandates that the Firm\u2019s financial services\nsubsidiaries operating in the EU comply with\nrequirements relating to information and\ncommunications technology (\u201cICT\u201d) risk management,\nreporting, security control testing and ICT third\nparty risks beginning in January 2025. In addition,\nthe EU Artificial Intelligence Act regulates the\ndevelopment and deployment of artificial\nintelligence systems within the EU, with phased-in\nrequirements that began in February 2025.\n\nThe Bank Secrecy Act and Economic Sanctions:\n\nThe Bank Secrecy Act (\u201cBSA\u201d) requires all financial\ninstitutions, including banks and securities\nbroker-dealers, to establish a risk-based system of\ninternal controls reasonably designed to prevent\nmoney laundering and the financing of terrorism.\nThe BSA includes a variety of record-keeping and\nreporting requirements, as well as due\ndiligence/know-your-customer documentation\nrequirements. The Firm is also subject to the\nregulations and economic sanctions programs\nadministered and enforced by the U.S. Treasury\u2019s\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) and EU\nand U.K. authorities which target entities or\nindividuals that are, or are located in countries\nthat are, involved in activities including\nterrorism, hostilities, embezzlement or human\nrights violations. The Firm is also subject to\neconomic sanctions laws, rules and regulations in\nother jurisdictions in which it operates, including\nthose that conflict with or prohibit a firm such as\nJPMorganChase from complying with certain laws,\nrules and regulations to which it is otherwise\nsubject.\n\nAnti-Corruption:\n\nThe Firm is subject to laws and regulations\nrelating to corrupt and illegal payments to\ngovernment officials and others in the\njurisdictions in which it operates, including the\nU.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K.\nBribery Act.\n\nCompensation practices:\n\nThe Firm\u2019s compensation practices are subject to\noversight by the Federal Reserve, as well as other\nagencies. The Federal Reserve has jointly issued\nguidance with the FDIC and the OCC that is designed\nto ensure that incentive compensation paid by\nbanking organizations does not encourage imprudent\nrisk-taking that threatens the organizations\u2019\nsafety and soundness. The Financial Stability Board\n(\u201cFSB\u201d) has also established standards covering\ncompensation principles for banks. The Firm\u2019s\ncompensation\n\npractices are also subject to regulation and\noversight by regulators in other jurisdictions,\nnotably the Fifth Capital Requirements Directive\n(\u201cCRD V\u201d), as implemented in the EU and as largely\nadopted in the U.K, which includes compensation-\nrelated provisions. The European Banking Authority\nhas instituted guidelines on compensation policies\nincluding under CRD V which in certain countries\n(such as Germany) are implemented or supplemented\nby local regulations or guidelines. The U.K.\nregulators have also instituted regulations and\nguidelines on compensation policies, which diverge\nin certain areas from EU rules. The Firm expects\nthat the implementation of regulatory guidelines\nregarding compensation in the U.S. and other\ncountries will continue to evolve, and may affect\nthe manner in which the Firm structures its\ncompensation programs and practices.\n\nSustainability:\n\nPolicymakers in the U.K. and the EU have continued\nto implement and enhance sustainability-related\ninitiatives and disclosure requirements. The\nCorporate Sustainability Reporting Directive\n(\u201cCSRD\u201d) will replace and significantly expand the\nscope and content of certain EU ESG reporting\nrequirements, with phased-in requirements expected\nto start with fiscal year 2024. The implementation\nof CSRD into local law has been delayed in a number\nof member states, including in Germany, and the\nFirm continues to monitor developments and\npotential impacts. In addition, in July 2024, the\nEU enacted the Corporate Sustainability Due\nDiligence Directive (\u201cCSDDD\u201d), which provides for\nphased-in requirements starting in 2027. The CSDDD\nsets mandatory due diligence obligations for\ncompanies to address actual and potential human\nrights violations and environmental adverse impacts\nstemming from their own operations and business\nrelationships, including the activities of certain\ncompanies with which they have established business\nrelationships and also requires the adoption of\ncompany-specific climate-related transition plans.\nBoth the CSRD and CSDDD will impact certain of the\nFirm\u2019s EU and non-EU entities.\n\nLitigation and regulatory challenges:\n\nTrade organizations representing the financial\nservices industry and others have filed lawsuits\nchallenging various laws, rules and regulations\nthat, if enacted, adopted or implemented, could\nhave significant adverse impacts on the results of\noperations or compliance costs of financial\ninstitutions, including the Firm. These matters\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 Stress tests: The Bank Policy Institute (\u201cBPI\u201d),\nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other trade\norganizations filed an action against the Federal\nReserve in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of Ohio in December 2024\nchallenging the manner in which the annual stress\ntesting process is administered.\n     \n  6  \n     \n\u2022 CFPB Late Fee Rule : This rule has been stayed\npending resolution of an action challenging the\nrule filed against the CFPB in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Texas\nin March 2024 by trade organizations including the\nAmerican Bankers Association and the Consumer\nBankers Association.\n\n\u2022 CFPB Data Sharing Rule : The BPI, the Kentucky\nBankers Association and other organizations filed\nan action against the CFPB in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky\nin October 2024 challenging key aspects of this\nrule.\n\n\u2022 CFPB Overdraft Rule : An action filed by trade\norganizations led by the Mississippi Bankers\nAssociation against the CFPB in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of\nMississippi in December 2024 seeks a preliminary\ninjunction to stay the October 1, 2025 effective\ndate of this rule. The CFPB has consented in part\nto stay the effective date of the rule by 90 days\nand to temporarily stay the litigation. The\npreliminary injunction and the stay of litigation\nare pending court approval.\n\n\u2022 Fiduciary Rule : Trade organizations including\nthe Federation of Americans for Consumer Choice and\nthe American Council of Life Insurers filed actions\nagainst the DOL seeking to enjoin this rule, and in\nJuly 2024, the effective date of the rule was\nstayed by two United States District Courts.\n     \n  7  \n     \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                                                  \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\n                                                                                                            \n  Human capital                                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \nJPMorganChase believes that its long-term growth and success depend on its ability to attract, develop and\nretain talented employees and foster an inclusive work environment.

JPMorganChase must comply\nwith the laws, rules and regulations that apply to\nits operations in all of the jurisdictions around\nthe world in which it does business, and financial\nservices firms such as JPMorganChase are subject to\nextensive and constantly-evolving regulation and\nsupervision.\n\nThe regulation and supervision of JPMorganChase\nsignificantly affects the way that it conducts its\nbusiness and structures its operations, and\nJPMorganChase could be required to make changes to\nits business and operations in response to\nsupervisory expectations or decisions or to new or\nchanged laws,\n\nrules and regulations. These types of developments\ncould result in JPMorganChase incurring additional\ncosts or experiencing a reduction in revenues to\ncomply with applicable laws, rules and regulations,\nwhich could reduce its profitability. Furthermore,\nJPMorganChase\u2019s entry into or acquisition of a new\nbusiness or an increase in its principal\ninvestments may require JPMorganChase to comply\nwith additional laws, rules, and regulations.\n\nAdditionally, JPMorganChase\u2019s ability to execute\ncertain business initiatives could become more\nchallenging due to increased regulation in the\nfinancial services industry, such as limitations on\nlate payment, overdraft and interchange fees. This\ncould adversely affect JPMorganChase\u2019s earnings\nfrom its consumer businesses, prompting the\nreevaluation or adjustment of certain businesses or\nproduct offerings, as well as the reallocation of\nresources and incurrence of restructuring costs,\nwhich could impact revenue and profitability in the\naffected lines of business.\n\nIn response to new and existing laws, rules and\nregulations and expanded supervision, JPMorganChase\nhas in the past been and could in the future be,\nrequired to:\n\n\u2022 limit the products and services that it offers\n\n\u2022 reduce the liquidity that it can provide through\nits market-making activities\n\n\u2022 refrain from engaging in business opportunities\nthat it might otherwise pursue\n\n\u2022 pay higher taxes (including as part of any\nminimum global tax regime), assessments, levies or\nother governmental charges, including in connection\nwith the resolution of tax examinations\n\n\u2022 incur losses, including with respect to\nfraudulent transactions perpetrated against its\ncustomers\n\n\u2022 dispose of certain assets, and do so at times or\nprices that are disadvantageous\n\n\u2022 impose restrictions on certain business\nactivities, or\n\n\u2022 increase the prices that it charges for products\nand services, which could reduce the demand for\nthem.\n\nAny failure by JPMorganChase to comply with the\nlaws, rules and regulations to which it is subject\ncould result in:\n\n\u2022 increased regulatory and supervisory scrutiny\n\n\u2022 regulatory and governmental enforcement actions\n\n\u2022 the imposition of fines, penalties or other\nsanctions\n\n\u2022 increased exposure to litigation, or\n\n\u2022 harm to its reputation.\n      \n  11  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                                                  \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\nDifferences and inconsistencies in financial\nservices regulation and supervision can negatively\nimpact JPMorganChase\u2019s businesses, operations and\nfinancial results.\n\nThe content and application of laws, rules and\nregulations affecting financial services firms can\nvary according to factors such as the size of the\nfirm, the jurisdiction in which it is organized or\noperates, and other criteria. For example:\n\n\u2022 larger firms such as JPMorganChase are often\nsubject to more stringent supervision, regulation\nand regulatory scrutiny\n\n\u2022 financial technology companies and other non-\ntraditional competitors may not be subject to\nbanking regulation, or may be supervised by a\nnational or state regulatory agency that does not\nhave the same resources or regulatory priorities as\nthe regulatory agencies that supervise more\ndiversified financial services firms, or\n\n\u2022 the financial services regulatory and supervisory\nframework in a particular jurisdiction may favor\nfinancial institutions that are based in that\njurisdiction.\n\nThese types of differences in the regulatory and\nsupervisory framework can result in JPMorganChase\nlosing market share to competitors that are less\nregulated or not subject to regulation, especially\nwith respect to unregulated financial products.\n\nThere can also be significant differences in the\nways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting\nthe financial services industry are implemented in\nthe U.S. and in other countries and regions in\nwhich JPMorganChase does business. For example,\nwhen adopting rules that are intended to implement\na global regulatory or supervisory standard, a\nnational regulator may introduce additional or more\nrestrictive requirements, which can create\ncompetitive disadvantages for financial services\nfirms, such as JPMorganChase, that may be subject\nto those enhanced regulations.\n\nIn addition, certain national and multi-national\nbodies and governmental agencies outside the U.S.\nhave adopted laws, rules or regulations that may\nconflict with or prohibit JPMorganChase from\ncomplying with laws, rules and regulations to which\nit is otherwise subject, creating conflict of law\nissues that also increase its risk of non-\ncompliance in those jurisdictions.\n\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives outside the\nU.S. have required and could in the future require\nJPMorganChase to make significant modifications to\nits operations and legal entity structure in the\nrelevant countries or regions in order to comply\nwith those requirements. These include laws, rules\nand regulations that have been adopted or proposed,\nas well as regulatory expectations, relating to:\n\n\u2022 the establishment of locally-based intermediate\nholding companies or operating subsidiaries\n\n\u2022 requirements to maintain minimum amounts of\ncapital or liquidity in locally-based subsidiaries\n\n\u2022 the implementation of processes within locally-\nbased subsidiaries to comply with local regulatory\nrequirements or expectations\n\n\u2022 the separation (or \u201cring fencing\u201d) of core\nbanking products and services from markets\nactivities\n\n\u2022 requirements for the orderly resolution of\nfinancial institutions\n\n\u2022 requirements for executing or settling\ntransactions on exchanges or through central\ncounterparties (\u201cCCPs\u201d), or for depositing funds\nwith other financial institutions or clearing and\nsettlement systems\n\n\u2022 position limits and reporting rules for\nderivatives\n\n\u2022 governance and accountability regimes\n\n\u2022 conduct of business and control requirements, and\n\n\u2022 restrictions on compensation.\n\nThese types of differences, inconsistencies and\nconflicts in financial services regulation have\nrequired and could in the future require\nJPMorganChase to:\n\n\u2022 divest assets or restructure its operations\n\n\u2022 maintain higher levels of capital and liquidity,\nor absorb increased capital and liquidity costs\n\n\u2022 incur higher operational and compliance costs\n\n\u2022 change the prices that it charges for its\nproducts and services\n\n\u2022 curtail the products and services that it offers\nto its customers and clients\n\n\u2022 curtail other business opportunities, including\nacquisitions or principal investments, that it\notherwise would have pursued\n\n\u2022 become subject to regulatory fines, penalties or\nother sanctions, or\n\n\u2022 incur higher costs for complying with different\nlegal and regulatory frameworks.\n\nAny or all of these factors could harm\nJPMorganChase\u2019s ability to compete against other\nfirms that are not subject to the same laws, rules\nand regulations or supervisory oversight, or harm\nJPMorganChase\u2019s businesses, results of operations\nand profitability.\n\nResolving regulatory investigations can subject\nJPMorganChase to significant penalties and\ncollateral consequences, and could result in higher\ncompliance costs or restrictions on its operations.\n\nJPMorganChase is subject to heightened oversight\nand scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many\njurisdictions. JPMorganChase has paid significant\nfines, provided other monetary relief, incurred\nother\n      \n  12  \n      \npenalties and experienced other repercussions in\nconnection with resolving investigations and\nenforcement actions by governmental agencies.\nJPMorganChase could become subject to similar\nregulatory or governmental resolutions or other\nactions in the future, and addressing the\nrequirements of any such resolutions or actions\ncould result in JPMorganChase incurring higher\noperational and compliance costs, including\ndevoting substantial resources to the required\nremediation or needing to comply with other\nrestrictions.\n\nIn connection with resolving specific regulatory\ninvestigations or enforcement actions, certain\nregulators have required JPMorganChase and other\nfinancial institutions to admit wrongdoing with\nrespect to the activities that gave rise to the\nresolution. These types of admissions can lead to:\n\n\u2022 greater exposure in litigation\n\n\u2022 damage to JPMorganChase\u2019s reputation\n\n\u2022 disqualification from doing business with certain\nclients or customers, or in specific jurisdictions,\nor\n\n\u2022 other direct and indirect adverse effects.\n\nFurthermore, government officials in the U.S. and\nother countries have demonstrated a willingness to\nbring criminal actions against financial\ninstitutions and have required that institutions\nplead guilty to criminal offenses or admit other\nwrongdoing in connection with resolving regulatory\ninvestigations or enforcement actions. Resolutions\nof this type can have significant collateral\nconsequences for the subject financial institution,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 loss of clients, customers and business\n\n\u2022 restrictions on offering certain products or\nservices, and\n\n\u2022 losing permission to operate certain businesses,\neither temporarily or permanently.\n\nJPMorganChase expects that:\n\n\u2022 it and other financial services firms will\ncontinue to be subject to heightened regulatory\nscrutiny and governmental investigations and\nenforcement actions\n\n\u2022 governmental authorities will continue to require\nthat financial institutions be penalized for actual\nor deemed violations of law with formal and\npunitive enforcement actions, including the\nimposition of significant monetary and other\nsanctions, rather than resolving these matters\nthrough informal supervisory actions, and\n\n\u2022 governmental authorities will be more likely to\npursue formal enforcement actions and resolutions\nagainst JPMorganChase to the extent that it has\npreviously been subject to other governmental\ninvestigations or enforcement actions.\n\nIf JPMorganChase fails to meet the requirements of\nany resolution of a governmental investigation or\nenforcement action, or to maintain risk and control\nprocesses that meet the heightened standards and\nexpectations of its regulators, it could be\nrequired to, among other things:\n\n\u2022 enter into further resolutions of investigations\nor enforcement actions\n\n\u2022 pay additional regulatory penalties or enter into\njudgments, or\n\n\u2022 accept material regulatory restrictions on, or\nchanges in the management of, its businesses.\n\nIn these circumstances, JPMorganChase could also\nbecome subject to other sanctions, or to\nprosecution or civil litigation with respect to the\nconduct that gave rise to an investigation or\nenforcement action. In addition, JPMorganChase can\nbe subject to higher costs or requests for\nadditional capital in connection with the\nresolution of governmental investigations and\nenforcement actions involving newly-acquired\nbusinesses, companies in which JPMorganChase has\nmade principal investments, parties to joint\nventures with JPMorganChase, and vendors with which\nJPMorganChase does business.\n\nJPMorganChase\u2019s operations and financial results\ncan be negatively impacted in jurisdictions with\nless predictable legal and regulatory frameworks .\n\nJPMorganChase conducts existing and new business in\ncertain countries, states, municipalities,\nterritories and other jurisdictions in which the\napplication of the rule of law is inconsistent,\nextralegal or less predictable, including with\nrespect to:\n\n\u2022 the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or\nguidance for engaging in specific types of business\nor transactions\n\n\u2022 conflicting or ambiguous laws, rules, regulations\nand judicial orders, or the inconsistent\napplication or interpretation of existing laws,\nrules, regulations and judicial precedents\n\n\u2022 actions by or at the direction of government\nofficials or agencies\n\n\u2022 uncertainty concerning the enforceability of\nintellectual property rights or contractual or\nother obligations\n\n\u2022 difficulty in competing in economies in which the\ngovernment controls or protects all or a portion of\nthe local economy or specific businesses, or where\ngraft or corruption may be pervasive\n\n\u2022 the threat of regulatory investigations, civil\nlitigations or criminal prosecutions that are\narbitrary or otherwise contrary to established\nlegal principles in other parts of the world, and\n      \n  13  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                                                  \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\n\u2022 the termination of licenses required to operate\nin the local market or the suspension of business\nrelationships with governmental bodies.\n\nIf the application of the laws, rules, regulations\nand judicial precedents in any jurisdiction is\nsusceptible to producing outcomes that are\ninconsistent, unexpected or contrary to established\nlegal principles, this can create a more difficult\nenvironment in which JPMorganChase conducts its\nbusiness and could negatively affect\nJPMorganChase\u2019s operations and reduce its earnings\nwith respect to that jurisdiction. For example,\nJPMorganChase has faced actual and threatened\nlitigation in Russia with respect to payments that\nJPMorganChase cannot make under, and is\ncontractually excused from paying as a result of,\nrelevant economic sanctions laws. That litigation\nhas also resulted in the seizure of assets. In\naddition, conducting business in jurisdictions with\nless predictable legal and regulatory frameworks\ncould require JPMorganChase to devote significant\nadditional resources to understanding local laws,\nrules and regulations, as well as structuring its\noperations to comply with local laws, rules and\nregulations and implementing and administering\nrelated internal policies and procedures.\n\nThere can be no assurance that JPMorganChase will\nalways be successful in its efforts to fully\nunderstand and to conduct its business in\ncompliance with the laws, rules and regulations of\nall of the jurisdictions in which it operates, and\nthe risk of non-compliance, or of interference with\nJPMorganChase's businesses, can be greater in\njurisdictions that have less predictable legal and\nregulatory frameworks.\n\nJPMorganChase's businesses may be negatively\nimpacted by governmental policies that either\ndiscourage or penalize business with certain\nindustries or require specific business practices.\n\nJPMorganChase's businesses and results of\noperations may be adversely affected by actions or\ninitiatives by national, state or local\ngovernmental authorities that:\n\n\u2022 seek to discourage financial institutions from\ndoing business with companies engaged in certain\nindustries, or conversely, to penalize financial\ninstitutions that elect not to do business with\nsuch companies, or\n\n\u2022 mandate specific business practices that\ncompanies operating in the relevant jurisdiction\nmust adopt.\n\nBecause governmental policies in one jurisdiction\nmay differ or conflict with those in other\njurisdictions, JPMorganChase may face negative\nconsequences regardless of the course of action it\ntakes or elects not to take, including:\n\n\u2022 restrictions or prohibitions on doing business\nwithin a particular jurisdiction, or with\ngovernmental entities in a jurisdiction\n\n\u2022 the threat of enforcement actions, including\nunder antitrust or other anti-competition laws,\nrules and regulations, and\n\n\u2022 harm to its reputation arising from public\ncriticism, including from politicians, activists\nand other stakeholders.\n\nJPMorganChase has been prohibited from engaging in\ncertain business activities in specific\njurisdictions as a result of these types of\ngovernmental actions, and there is no assurance\nthat it will not face similar restrictions on its\nbusiness and operations in the future.\n\nRequirements for the orderly resolution of\nJPMorganChase could result in JPMorganChase having\nto restructure or reorganize its businesses and\ncould increase its funding or operational costs or\ncurtail its businesses.\n\nJPMorganChase is required under Federal Reserve and\nFDIC rules to prepare and submit periodically to\nthose agencies a detailed plan for rapid and\norderly resolution in bankruptcy, without\nextraordinary government support, in the event of\nmaterial financial distress or failure. The\nevaluation of JPMorganChase\u2019s resolution plan by\nthese agencies may change, and the requirements for\nresolution plans may be modified from time to time.\nAny such determinations or modifications could\nresult in JPMorganChase needing to make changes to\nits legal entity structure or to certain internal\nor external activities, which could increase its\nfunding or operational costs, or hamper its ability\nto serve clients and customers.\n\nIf the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were both to\ndetermine that a resolution plan submitted by\nJPMorganChase has deficiencies, they could jointly\nimpose more stringent capital, leverage or\nliquidity requirements or restrictions on\nJPMorganChase\u2019s growth, activities or operations.\nThe agencies could also require that JPMorganChase\nrestructure, reorganize or divest assets or\nbusinesses in ways that could materially and\nadversely affect JPMorganChase\u2019s operations and\nstrategy.\n\nHolders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s debt and equity\nsecurities will absorb losses if it were to enter\ninto a resolution.\n\nFederal Reserve rules require that JPMorgan Chase &\nCo. (the \u201cParent Company\u201d) maintain minimum levels\nof unsecured external long-term debt and other\nloss-absorbing capacity with specific terms\n(\u201celigible LTD\u201d) for purposes of recapitalizing\nJPMorganChase\u2019s operating subsidiaries if the\nParent Company were to enter into a resolution\neither:\n\n\u2022 in a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of\nthe U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or\n\n\u2022 in a receivership administered by the FDIC under\nTitle II of the Dodd-Frank Act (\u201cTitle II\u201d).\n      \n  14  \n      \nIf the Parent Company were to enter into a\nresolution, holders of eligible LTD, other\nunsecured creditors and holders of equity\nsecurities of the Parent Company will absorb the\nlosses of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe preferred \u201csingle point of entry\u201d strategy\nunder JPMorganChase\u2019s resolution plan contemplates\nthat the Parent Company would enter bankruptcy\nproceedings and JPMorganChase\u2019s material\nsubsidiaries would be recapitalized, as needed, so\nthat they could continue normal operations or\nsubsequently be divested or wound down in an\norderly manner. As a result, the Parent Company\u2019s\nlosses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries\nwould be imposed first on holders of the Parent\nCompany\u2019s equity securities and thereafter on its\nunsecured creditors, including holders of eligible\nLTD. Claims of the Parent Company's shareholders\nand unsecured creditors would have a junior\nposition to the claims of creditors of\nJPMorganChase\u2019s subsidiaries and to the claims of\npriority (as determined by statute) and secured\ncreditors of the Parent Company.\n\nAccordingly, in a resolution of the Parent Company\nin bankruptcy, unsecured creditors of the Parent\nCompany, including holders of eligible LTD of the\nParent Company, would realize value only to the\nextent available to the Parent Company as a\nshareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its\nother subsidiaries, and only after any claims of\npriority and secured creditors of the Parent\nCompany have been fully repaid.\n\nThe FDIC has similarly indicated that a single\npoint of entry recapitalization model would be its\nexpected strategy to resolve a systemically\nimportant financial institution, such as the Parent\nCompany, under Title II. However, the FDIC has not\nformally adopted or committed to any specific\nresolution strategy.\n\nIf the Parent Company were to approach, or enter\ninto, a resolution, none of the Parent Company, the\nFederal Reserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow\nJPMorganChase\u2019s preferred resolution strategy, and\nlosses to unsecured creditors of the Parent\nCompany, including holders of eligible LTD, and to\nholders of equity securities of the Parent Company,\nunder whatever strategy is ultimately followed,\ncould be greater than they might have been under\nJPMorganChase\u2019s preferred strategy.\n                                                                                                            \n  Political                                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \nEconomic uncertainty or instability caused by\npolitical and geopolitical developments can\nnegatively impact JPMorganChase\u2019s businesses.\n\nPolitical developments in the U.S. and other\ncountries can cause uncertainty in the economic\nenvironment and market conditions in which\nJPMorganChase operates its businesses. Certain\ngovernmental policy initiatives, as well as\nheightened geopolitical tensions,\n\ncould significantly affect U.S. and global economic\ngrowth and cause higher volatility in the financial\nmarkets, including:\n\n\u2022 monetary policies and actions taken by the\nFederal Reserve and other central banks or\ngovernmental authorities, including changes in\ninterest rate levels and any sustained large-scale\nasset purchases or any suspension or reversal of\nthose actions\n\n\u2022 fiscal policies, including with respect to\ntaxation and spending\n\n\u2022 isolationist foreign policies\n\n\u2022 economic or financial sanctions\n\n\u2022 the implementation of tariffs and other\nprotectionist trade policies\n\n\u2022 changes to immigration policies, or\n\n\u2022 actions that the government takes or fails to\ntake in response to the effects of health\nemergencies, the spread of infectious diseases,\nepidemics or pandemics.\n\nThese types of political developments, and\nuncertainty about the possible outcomes of these\ndevelopments, could:\n\n\u2022 erode investor or consumer confidence in the U.S.\neconomy and financial markets, which could\npotentially undermine the status of the U.S. dollar\nas a safe haven currency\n\n\u2022 provoke retaliatory countermeasures by other\ncountries and otherwise heighten tensions in\nregulatory, enforcement or diplomatic relations\n\n\u2022 increase the risk of targeted cyber attacks\n\n\u2022 increase concerns about whether the U.S.\ngovernment will be funded, and its outstanding debt\nserviced, at any particular time\n\n\u2022 result in periodic shutdowns of the U.S.\ngovernment\n\n\u2022 influence investor perceptions concerning\ngovernment support of certain sectors of the\neconomy or the economy as a whole\n\n\u2022 influence monetary policy actions of the Federal\nReserve to moderate the economic impact of\npolitical developments, including decisions on\ninterest rate levels and asset purchases and sales\n\n\u2022 adversely affect the financial condition or\ncredit ratings of clients and counterparties with\nwhich JPMorganChase does business, or\n\n\u2022 cause JPMorganChase to refrain from engaging in\nbusiness opportunities that it might otherwise\npursue.\n\nThese factors could lead to:\n\n\u2022 slower growth rates, rising inflation

higher net\ncharge-offs, hamper its ability to deliver products\nand services to its clients and customers, and\nweaken its results of operations and financial\ncondition or credit rating.\n

JPMorganChase\u2019s businesses and\ninvestment and market-making positions.\n\nJPMorganChase\u2019s results of operations can be\nnegatively affected by adverse changes in any of\nthe following:\n\n\u2022 investor, consumer and business sentiment\n\n\u2022 events that reduce confidence in the financial\nmarkets\n\n\u2022 inflation, deflation or recession\n\n\u2022 high unemployment or, conversely, a tightening\nlabor market\n\n\u2022 the availability and cost of capital, liquidity\nand credit\n\n\u2022 levels and volatility of interest rates, credit\nspreads and market prices for currencies, debt and\nequity securities and commodities, as well as the\nduration of any such changes\n\n\u2022 the economic effects of an outbreak or escalation\nof war, hostilities, terrorism or other\ngeopolitical instabilities, cyber attacks, climate\nchange, natural disasters, severe weather\nconditions, health emergencies, the spread of\ninfectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics or\nother extraordinary events beyond JPMorganChase\u2019s\ncontrol, and\n\n\u2022 the state of the U.S. and global economies.\n\nAll of these are affected by global economic,\nmarket and political events and conditions,\nincluding monetary policies and actions taken by\ncentral banks or other governmental authorities, as\nwell as by the regulatory environment.\n\nIn addition, JPMorganChase\u2019s investment portfolio\nand market-making businesses can suffer losses due\nto unanticipated market events, including:\n\n\u2022 severe declines in asset values\n\n\u2022 unexpected credit events\n\n\u2022 unforeseen events or conditions that may cause\npreviously uncorrelated factors to become\ncorrelated (and vice versa)\n\n\u2022 the inability to effectively hedge risks related\nto market-making and investment portfolio\npositions, or\n\n\u2022 other market risks that may not have been\nappropriately taken into account in the\ndevelopment, structuring or pricing of a financial\ninstrument.\n\nIf JPMorganChase experiences significant losses in\nits investment portfolio or from market-making\nactivities, this could reduce JPMorganChase\u2019s\nprofitability and its liquidity and capital levels,\nand thereby constrain the growth of its businesses.\n\nJPMorganChase\u2019s consumer businesses can be\nnegatively affected by adverse economic conditions\nand governmental policies.\n\nJPMorganChase\u2019s consumer businesses are\nparticularly affected by U.S. and global economic\nconditions, including:\n\n\u2022 personal and household income distribution\n\n\u2022 unemployment or underemployment\n\n\u2022 prolonged periods of exceptionally high or low\ninterest rates, or significant changes to interest\nrates\n\n\u2022 changes in the value of collateral such as\nresidential real estate and vehicles\n\n\u2022 changes in housing prices\n\n\u2022 the level of inflation and its effect on prices\nfor goods and services\n\n\u2022 consumer and small business confidence levels,\nand\n\n\u2022 changes in consumer spending or in the level of\nconsumer debt.\n\nHeightened levels of unemployment or\nunderemployment that result in reduced personal and\nhousehold income could negatively affect consumer\ncredit performance to the extent that consumers are\nless able to service their debts. In addition,\nsustained low growth, low or negative interest\nrates, inflationary pressures or recessionary\nconditions could diminish customer demand for the\nproducts and services offered by JPMorganChase\u2019s\nconsumer businesses.\n      \n  16  \n      \nAdverse economic conditions could also lead to an\nincrease in delinquencies, additions to the\nallowance for credit losses and higher net charge-\noffs, which can reduce JPMorganChase\u2019s earnings.\nThese consequences could be significantly worse in\ncertain geographies, including where declining\nindustrial or manufacturing activity has resulted\nin or could result in higher levels of\nunemployment, or where high levels of consumer\ndebt, such as outstanding student loans, could\nimpair the ability of customers to pay their other\nconsumer loan obligations.\n\nJPMorganChase\u2019s earnings from its consumer\nbusinesses could also be adversely affected by\ngovernmental policies and actions that affect\nconsumers, including:\n\n\u2022 policies and initiatives relating to medical\ninsurance, education, immigration and housing, or\nthat may impact employment status\n\n\u2022 laws, rules and regulations relating specifically\nto the financial services industry, such as\nlimitations on late payment, overdraft and\ninterchange fees, and\n\n\u2022 policies aimed at the economy more broadly, such\nas higher taxes and increased regulation, which\ncould result in reductions in consumer disposable\nincome.\n\nUnfavorable market and economic conditions can have\nan adverse effect on JPMorganChase\u2019s wholesale\nbusinesses.\n\nIn JPMorganChase\u2019s wholesale businesses, market and\neconomic factors can affect the volume of\ntransactions that JPMorganChase executes for its\nclients or for which it advises clients, and,\ntherefore, the revenue that JPMorganChase receives\nfrom those transactions. These factors can also\ninfluence the willingness of other financial\ninstitutions and investors to participate in\ncapital markets transactions that JPMorganChase\nmanages, such as loan syndications or securities\nunderwriting. Furthermore, if a significant and\nsustained deterioration in market conditions were\nto occur, the profitability of JPMorganChase\u2019s\nbusinesses engaged in capital markets activities,\nincluding loan syndication, securities underwriting\nand leveraged lending activities, could be reduced\nto the extent that those businesses:\n\n\u2022 earn less fee revenue due to lower transaction\nvolumes, including when clients are unwilling or\nunable to refinance their outstanding debt\nobligations in unfavorable market conditions, or\n\n\u2022 dispose of portions of credit commitments at a\nloss, or hold larger residual positions in credit\ncommitments that cannot be sold at favorable\nprices.\n\nThe fees that JPMorganChase earns from managing\nclient assets or holding assets under custody for\nclients could be diminished by declining asset\nvalues\n\nor other adverse macroeconomic conditions. For\nexample, higher interest rates or a downturn in\nfinancial markets could affect the valuation of\nclient assets that JPMorganChase manages or holds\nunder custody, which, in turn, could affect\nJPMorganChase\u2019s revenue from fees that are based on\nthe amount of assets under management or custody.\nSimilarly, adverse macroeconomic or market\nconditions could prompt outflows from JPMorganChase\nfunds or accounts, or cause clients to invest in\nproducts that generate lower revenue. Substantial\nand unexpected withdrawals from a JPMorganChase\nfund can also hamper the investment performance of\nthe fund, particularly if the outflows create the\nneed for the fund to dispose of fund assets at\ndisadvantageous times or prices, and could lead to\nfurther withdrawals based on the weaker investment\nperformance.\n\nAn adverse change in market conditions in\nparticular segments of the economy, such as a\nsudden and severe downturn in oil and gas prices or\nan increase in commodity prices, severe declines in\ncommercial real estate values, or sustained changes\nin consumer behavior that affect specific economic\nsectors, could have a material adverse effect on\nclients of JPMorganChase whose operations or\nfinancial condition are directly or indirectly\ndependent on the health or stability of those\nmarket segments or economic sectors, as well as\nclients that are engaged in related businesses.\nJPMorganChase could incur credit losses on its\nloans and other commitments to clients that operate\nin, or are dependent on, any sector of the economy\nthat is or comes under stress.\n\nAn economic downturn or sustained changes in\nconsumer behavior that results in shifts in\nconsumer and business spending could also have a\nnegative impact on certain of JPMorganChase\u2019s\nwholesale clients, and thereby diminish\nJPMorganChase\u2019s earnings from its wholesale\noperations. For example, the businesses of certain\nof JPMorganChase\u2019s wholesale clients are dependent\non consistent streams of rental income from\ncommercial real estate properties, including\noffices, which are owned or being built by those\nclients. Sustained adverse economic conditions or\nhybrid work models could result in reductions in\nthe rental cash flows that owners or developers\nreceive from their tenants which, in turn, could\ndepress the values of the properties, impair the\nability of borrowers to service or refinance their\ncommercial real estate loans and lead to an\nincrease in foreclosures. These consequences could\nresult in JPMorganChase experiencing increases in\nthe allowance for credit losses, higher\ndelinquencies, defaults and charge-offs within its\ncommercial real estate loan portfolio and incurring\nhigher costs for servicing a larger volume of\ndelinquent loans in that portfolio. An increase in\nforeclosures could result in higher operational\nrisk associated with JPMorganChase owning and\nmanaging real property,\n      \n  17  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                                                  \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\nand any inadequacy in governance or control over\nthe foreclosed properties could result in\nregulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.\n\nChanges in interest rates and credit spreads can\nadversely affect JPMorganChase\u2019s earnings, its\nliquidity or its capital levels.\n\nWhen interest rates are high or increasing,\nJPMorganChase can generally be expected to earn\nhigher net interest income. However, higher\ninterest rates can also lead to:\n\n\u2022 fewer originations of commercial and residential\nreal estate loans\n\n\u2022 losses on underwriting exposures or incremental\nclient-specific downgrades, or increases in the\nallowance for credit losses and net charge-offs due\nto higher financing costs for clients\n\n\u2022 the loss of deposits, particularly if customers\nwithdraw deposits because they believe that\ninterest rates offered by JPMorganChase are lower\nthan those of competitors or if JPMorganChase makes\nincorrect assumptions about depositor behavior\n\n\u2022 losses on available-for-sale (\u201cAFS\u201d) securities\nheld in the investment securities portfolio\n\n\u2022 lower net interest income if central banks\nintroduce interest rate increases more quickly than\nanticipated and this results in a misalignment in\nthe pricing of short-term and long-term borrowings\n\n\u2022 less liquidity in the financial markets, and\n\n\u2022 higher funding costs.\n\nAll of these outcomes could adversely affect\nJPMorganChase\u2019s earnings or its liquidity and\ncapital levels, and any negative outcomes could be\nmore severe in a prolonged period of high interest\nrates. Higher interest rates can also negatively\naffect the payment performance on loans within\nJPMorganChase\u2019s consumer and wholesale loan\nportfolios that are linked to variable interest\nrates. If borrowers of variable rate loans are\nunable to afford higher interest payments, those\nborrowers may reduce or stop making payments,\nthereby causing JPMorganChase to incur losses and\nincreased operational costs related to servicing a\nhigher volume of delinquent loans.\n\nOn the other hand, a low or negative interest rate\nenvironment may cause:\n\n\u2022 net interest margins to be compressed, which\ncould reduce the amounts that JPMorganChase earns\non its investment securities portfolio to the\nextent that it is unable to reinvest\ncontemporaneously in higher-yielding instruments\n\n\u2022 unanticipated or adverse changes in depositor\nbehavior, which could negatively affect\nJPMorganChase\u2019s broader asset and liability\nmanagement strategy, and\n\n\u2022 a reduction in the value of JPMorganChase\u2019s\nmortgage servicing rights (\u201cMSRs\u201d) asset, resulting\nin decreased revenues.\n\nWhen credit spreads widen, it becomes more\nexpensive for JPMorganChase to borrow.\nJPMorganChase\u2019s credit spreads may widen or narrow\nnot only in response to events and circumstances\nthat are specific to JPMorganChase but also as a\nresult of general economic and geopolitical events\nand conditions. Changes in JPMorganChase\u2019s credit\nspreads will affect, positively or negatively,\nJPMorganChase\u2019s earnings on certain liabilities,\nsuch as derivatives, that are recorded at fair\nvalue.\n\nJPMorganChase\u2019s results may be materially affected\nby market fluctuations and significant changes in\nthe valuation of financial instruments.\n\nThe value of securities, derivatives and other\nfinancial instruments which JPMorganChase owns or\nin which it makes markets can be materially\naffected by market fluctuations. Market volatility,\nilliquid market conditions and other disruptions in\nthe financial markets may make it extremely\ndifficult to value certain financial instruments.\nSubsequent valuations of financial instruments in\nfuture periods, in light of factors then\nprevailing, may result in significant changes in\nthe value of these instruments. In addition, at the\ntime of any disposition of these financial\ninstruments, the price that JPMorganChase\nultimately realizes will depend on the demand and\nliquidity in the market at that time and may be\nmaterially lower than their current fair value. Any\nof these factors could cause a decline in the value\nof financial instruments that JPMorganChase owns or\nin which it makes markets, which may have an\nadverse effect on JPMorganChase\u2019s results of\noperations.\n\nJPMorganChase\u2019s risk management and monitoring\nprocesses, including its stress testing framework,\nseek to quantify and manage JPMorganChase\u2019s\nexposure to more extreme market moves. However,\nJPMorganChase\u2019s hedging and other risk management\nstrategies may not be effective, and it could incur\nsignificant losses, if extreme market events were\nto occur.\n                                                                                                            \n  Credit                                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nJPMorganChase can be negatively affected by adverse\nchanges in the financial condition of clients,\ncounterparties, custodians and CCPs.\n\nJPMorganChase routinely executes transactions with\nclients and counterparties such as corporations,\nfinancial institutions, asset managers, hedge\nfunds, securities exchanges and government entities\nwithin and outside the U.S. Many of these\ntransactions expose JPMorganChase to the credit\nrisk of its clients and counterparties, and can\ninvolve JPMorganChase in disputes and litigation if\na client or counterparty defaults. JPMorganChase\ncan also be subject to losses\n      \n  18  \n      \nor liability where a financial institution that it\nhas appointed to provide custodial services for\nclient assets or funds becomes insolvent as a\nresult of fraud or the failure to abide by existing\nlaws and obligations, or where clients are unable\nto access assets held by JPMorganChase as custodian\ndue to governmental actions or other factors.\n\nA default by, or the financial or operational\nfailure of, a CCP through which JPMorganChase\nexecutes contracts would require JPMorganChase to\nreplace those contracts, thereby increasing its\noperational costs and potentially resulting in\nlosses. In addition, JPMorganChase can be exposed\nto losses if a member of a CCP in which\nJPMorganChase is also a member defaults on its\nobligations to the CCP because of requirements that\neach member of the CCP absorb a portion of those\nlosses. Furthermore, JPMorganChase can be subject\nto bearing its share of non-default losses incurred\nby a CCP, including losses from custodial,\nsettlement or investment activities or due to cyber\nor other security breaches.\n\nAs part of its clearing services activities,\nJPMorganChase is exposed to the risk of\nnonperformance by its clients, which it seeks to\nmitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate\ncollateral. JPMorganChase is also exposed to intra-\nday credit risk of its clients in connection with\nproviding cash management, clearing, custodial and\nother transaction services to those clients. If a\nclient for which JPMorganChase provides these\nservices becomes bankrupt or insolvent,\nJPMorganChase may incur losses, become involved in\ndisputes and litigation with one or more CCPs, the\nclient\u2019s bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or\nbe subject to regulatory investigations. All of the\nforegoing events can increase JPMorganChase\u2019s\noperational and litigation costs, and JPMorganChase\nmay suffer losses to the extent that any collateral\nthat it has received is insufficient to cover those\nlosses.\n\nTransactions with government entities, including\nnational, state, provincial, municipal and local\nauthorities, can expose JPMorganChase to enhanced\nsovereign, credit, operational and reputation\nrisks. Government entities may, among other things,\nclaim that actions taken by government officials\nwere beyond the legal authority of those officials\nor repudiate transactions authorized by a previous\nincumbent government. These types of actions have\nin the past caused, and could in the future cause,\nJPMorganChase to suffer losses or hamper its\nability to conduct business in the relevant\njurisdiction.\n\nIn addition, local laws, rules and regulations\ncould limit JPMorganChase\u2019s ability to resolve\ndisputes and litigation in the event of a\ncounterparty default or unwillingness to make\npreviously agreed-upon payments, which could\nsubject JPMorganChase to losses.\n\nDisputes may arise with counterparties to\nderivatives contracts with regard to the terms, the\nsettlement procedures or the value of underlying\ncollateral. The disposition of those disputes could\ncause JPMorganChase to incur unexpected\ntransaction, operational and legal costs, or result\nin credit losses. These consequences can also\nimpair JPMorganChase\u2019s ability to effectively\nmanage its credit risk exposure from its market\nactivities, or cause harm to JPMorganChase\u2019s\nreputation.\n\nThe financial or operational failure of a\nsignificant market participant, such as a major\nfinancial institution or a CCP, or concerns about\nthe creditworthiness of such a market participant\nor its ability to fulfill its obligations, can\ncause substantial and cascading disruption within\nthe financial markets, including in circumstances\nwhere coordinated action by multiple other market\nparticipants is required to address the failure or\ndisruption. JPMorganChase\u2019s businesses could be\nsignificantly disrupted by such an event,\nparticularly if it leads to other market\nparticipants incurring significant losses,\nexperiencing liquidity issues or defaulting, and\nJPMorganChase is likely to have significant\ninterrelationships with, and credit exposure to,\nsuch a significant market participant.\n\nJPMorganChase may suffer losses if the value of\ncollateral declines in stressed market conditions.\n\nDuring periods of market stress or illiquidity,\nJPMorganChase\u2019s credit risk may be further\nincreased when:\n\n\u2022 JPMorganChase fails to realize the estimated\nvalue of the collateral it holds\n\n\u2022 collateral is liquidated at prices that are not\nsufficient to recover the full amount owed to it,\nor\n\n\u2022 counterparties are unable to post collateral,\nwhether for operational or other reasons.\n\nFurthermore, disputes with counterparties\nconcerning the valuation of collateral may increase\nin times of significant market stress, volatility\nor illiquidity, and JPMorganChase could suffer\nlosses during these periods if it is unable to\nrealize the fair value of collateral or to manage\ndeclines in the value of collateral.\n\nJPMorganChase could incur significant losses\narising from concentrations of credit and market\nrisk.\n\nJPMorganChase is exposed to greater credit and\nmarket risk to the extent that groupings of its\nclients or counterparties, or obligors on\nsecurities and other financial instruments:\n\n\u2022 engage in similar or related businesses, or in\nbusinesses in related industries\n\n\u2022 do business in the same geographic region, or\n      \n  19  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                                                  \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\n\u2022 have business profiles, models or strategies that\ncould cause their ability to meet their obligations\nto be similarly affected by changes in economic\nconditions.\n\nFor example, a significant deterioration in the\ncredit quality of a counterparty, borrower or other\nobligor could lead to concerns about the\ncreditworthiness of other counterparties, borrowers\nor obligors in similar, related or dependent\nindustries. This type of interrelationship could\nexacerbate JPMorganChase\u2019s credit, liquidity and\nmarket risk exposure and potentially cause it to\nincur losses, including fair value losses in its\nmarket-making businesses and investment portfolios.\nIn addition, JPMorganChase may be required to\nincrease the allowance for credit losses or\nestablish other reserves with respect to certain\nclients, industries or country exposures in order\nto align with directives or expectations of its\nbanking regulators.\n\nSimilarly, challenging economic conditions that\naffect a particular industry or geographic area\ncould lead to concerns about the credit quality of\ncounterparties, borrowers or other obligors not\nonly in that particular industry or geography but\nin related or dependent industries, wherever\nlocated. These conditions could also heighten\nconcerns about the ability of customers of\nJPMorganChase\u2019s consumer businesses who live in\nthose areas or work in those affected industries or\nrelated or dependent industries to meet their\nobligations to JPMorganChase. JPMorganChase\nregularly monitors various segments of its credit\nand market risk exposures to assess the potential\nrisks of concentration or contagion, but its\nability to diversify or hedge its exposure against\nthose risks may be limited.\n\nJPMorganChase\u2019s consumer businesses can also be\nharmed by an excessive expansion of consumer credit\nby bank or non-bank competitors. Heightened\ncompetition for certain types of consumer loans\ncould prompt industry-wide reactions such as\nsignificant reductions in the pricing or margins of\nthose loans or the making of loans to less-\ncreditworthy borrowers. If large numbers of\nconsumers subsequently default on their loans,\nwhether due to weak credit profiles, an economic\ndownturn or other factors, this could impair their\nability to repay obligations owed to JPMorganChase\nand result in higher charge-offs and other credit-\nrelated losses. More broadly, widespread defaults\non consumer debt could lead to recessionary\nconditions in the U.S. economy, and JPMorganChase\u2019s\nconsumer businesses may earn lower revenues in such\nan environment.\n\nIf JPMorganChase is unable to reduce positions\neffectively during a market dislocation, this can\nincrease both the market and credit risks\nassociated with those positions and the level of\nrisk-weighted-assets (\u201cRWA\u201d) that JPMorganChase\nholds on its\n\nbalance sheet. These factors could adversely affect\nJPMorganChase\u2019s capital position, funding costs and\nthe profitability of its businesses.\n                                                                                                            \n  Liquidity                                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \nJPMorganChase\u2019s ability to operate its businesses\ncould be impaired if its liquidity is constrained.\n\nJPMorganChase\u2019s liquidity can be impacted at any\ngiven time as a result of factors such as:\n\n\u2022 market-wide illiquidity or disruption\n\n\u2022 changes in liquidity or capital requirements\nresulting from changes in laws, rules and\nregulations, including those in response to\neconomic effects of systemic events\n\n\u2022 actions taken by the U.S. government or by the\nFederal Reserve to reduce its balance sheet, which\nmay reduce deposits held by JPMorganChase and other\nfinancial institutions\n\n\u2022 inability to sell assets, or to sell assets at\nfavorable times or prices\n\n\u2022 default by a CCP or other significant market\nparticipant\n\n\u2022 unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral\n\n\u2022 unexpected loss of deposits or higher than\nanticipated draws on lending-related commitments,\nand\n\n\u2022 lack of market or customer confidence in\nJPMorganChase or financial institutions in general.\n\nA reduction in JPMorganChase\u2019s liquidity may be\ncaused by events over which it has little or no\ncontrol. For example, periods of market stress, low\ninvestor confidence and significant market\nilliquidity could result in higher funding costs\nfor JPMorganChase and could limit its access to\nsome of its traditional sources of liquidity.\n\nJPMorganChase may need to raise funding from\nalternative sources if its access to stable and\nlower-cost sources of funding, such as deposits and\nborrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks, is\nreduced. Alternative sources of funding could be\nmore expensive or limited in availability.\nJPMorganChase\u2019s funding costs could also be\nnegatively affected by actions that JPMorganChase\nmay take in order to:\n\n\u2022 satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and\nnet stable funding ratio requirements\n\n\u2022 address obligations under its resolution plan, or\n\n\u2022 satisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions\noutside the U.S. relating to the pre-positioning of\nliquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal\nentities.\n\nMore generally, if JPMorganChase fails to\neffectively manage its liquidity, this could\nconstrain its ability to fund or invest in its\nbusinesses and subsidiaries, and thereby adversely\naffect its results of operations.\n      \n  20  \n      \nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company and\ndepends on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to\nmake payments on its outstanding securities.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company that\nholds the stock of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and an\nintermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase\nHoldings LLC (the \u201cIHC\u201d). The IHC in turn generally\nholds the stock of JPMorganChase\u2019s subsidiaries\nother than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its\nsubsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and\nprovides intercompany lending to the Parent\nCompany.\n\nThe Parent Company is obligated to contribute to\nthe IHC substantially all the net proceeds received\nfrom securities issuances (including issuances of\nsenior and subordinated debt securities and of\npreferred and common stock).\n\nThe ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the\nIHC to make payments to the Parent Company is also\nlimited. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to\nregulatory restrictions on its dividend\ndistributions, as well as capital adequacy\nrequirements, such as the Supplementary Leverage\nRatio (\u201cSLR\u201d), and liquidity requirements and other\nregulatory restrictions on its ability to make\npayments to the Parent Company. The IHC is\nprohibited from paying dividends or extending\ncredit to the Parent Company if certain capital or\nliquidity thresholds are breached, or if limits are\notherwise imposed by the Parent Company\u2019s\nmanagement or Board of Directors.\n\nAs a result of these arrangements, the ability of\nthe Parent Company to make various payments is\ndependent on its receiving dividends from JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. and dividends and borrowings from\nthe IHC. These limitations could affect the Parent\nCompany\u2019s ability to:\n\n\u2022 pay interest on its debt securities\n\n\u2022 pay dividends on its equity securities\n\n\u2022 redeem or repurchase outstanding securities, and\n\n\u2022 fulfill its other payment obligations.\n\nThese arrangements could also result in the Parent\nCompany seeking protection under bankruptcy laws or\notherwise entering into resolution proceedings at a\ntime earlier than would have been the case absent\nthe existence of the capital and liquidity\nthresholds to which JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and\nthe IHC are subject.\n\nReductions in JPMorganChase\u2019s credit ratings may\nadversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its principal\nsubsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies.\nRating agencies evaluate general, firm-specific and\nindustry-specific factors when determining credit\nratings for a particular financial institution,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 expected future profitability\n\n\u2022 risk management practices\n\n\u2022 legal expenses\n\n\u2022 ratings differentials between bank holding\ncompanies and their bank and non-bank subsidiaries\n\n\u2022 regulatory developments\n\n\u2022 assumptions about government support, and\n\n\u2022 economic and geopolitical developments.\n\nJPMorganChase closely monitors and manages, to the\nextent that it is able, factors that could\ninfluence its credit ratings. However, there is no\nassurance that JPMorganChase\u2019s credit ratings will\nnot be downgraded in the future. Furthermore, any\nsuch downgrade could occur at times of broader\nmarket instability when JPMorganChase\u2019s options for\nresponding to events may be more limited and\ngeneral investor confidence is low.\n\nA reduction in JPMorganChase\u2019s credit ratings could\ncurtail JPMorganChase\u2019s business activities and\nreduce its profitability in a number of ways,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 reducing its access to capital markets\n\n\u2022 materially increasing its cost of issuing and\nservicing securities\n\n\u2022 triggering additional collateral or funding\nrequirements, and\n\n\u2022 decreasing the number of investors and\ncounterparties that are willing or permitted to do\nbusiness with or lend to JPMorganChase.\n\nAny rating reduction could also increase the credit\nspreads charged by the market for taking credit\nrisk on JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries.\nThis could, in turn, adversely affect the value of\ndebt and other obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co.\nand its subsidiaries.\n                                                                                                            \n  Capital                                                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \nMaintaining the required level and composition of\ncapital may impact JPMorganChase\u2019s ability to\nsupport business activities, meet evolving\nregulatory requirements and distribute capital to\nshareholders.\n\nJPMorganChase is subject to various regulatory\ncapital requirements, including leverage- and risk-\nbased capital requirements. In addition, as a\nGlobal Systemically Important Bank (\u201cGSIB\u201d),\nJPMorganChase is required to hold additional\ncapital buffers, including a GSIB surcharge, a\nStress Capital Buffer (\u201cSCB\u201d), and a\ncountercyclical buffer, each of which is reassessed\nat least annually. The amount of capital that\nJPMorganChase is required to hold in order to\nsatisfy these leverage- and risk-based requirements\ncould increase at any given time due to factors\nsuch as:\n\n\u2022 actions by banking regulators, including changes\nin laws, rules and regulations\n      \n  21  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                                                  \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\n\u2022 changes in the composition of JPMorganChase\u2019s\nbalance sheet or developments that could increase\nRWA, such as increased market risk, customer\ndelinquencies, client credit rating downgrades or\nother factors, and\n\n\u2022 increases in estimated stress losses as\ndetermined by the Federal Reserve under the\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, which\ncould increase JPMorganChase\u2019s SCB.\n\nAny failure by or inability of JPMorganChase to\nmaintain the required level and composition of\ncapital, or unfavorable changes in applicable\ncapital requirements, could have an adverse impact\non JPMorganChase\u2019s shareholders, such as:\n\n\u2022 reducing the amount of common stock that\nJPMorganChase is permitted to repurchase\n\n\u2022 requiring the issuance of, or prohibiting the\nredemption of, capital instruments in a manner\ninconsistent with JPMorganChase\u2019s capital\nmanagement strategy\n\n\u2022 constraining the amount of dividends that may be\npaid on common stock, or\n\n\u2022 curtailing JPMorganChase\u2019s business activities or\noperations.\n\nIn 2023, U.S. banking regulators released a\nproposal to implement the final Basel III reforms\nwhich would have significantly revised the risk-\nbased capital requirements for banks with assets of\n$100 billion or more, including JPMorganChase. In\naddition, in 2023 the Federal Reserve released a\nproposal to amend the calculation of the GSIB\nsurcharge. Uncertainty remains regarding the\ncontent of the final versions of these rule\nproposals and how they might ultimately apply to\nJPMorganChase.

In\naddition to proper design, installation,\nmaintenance and training, the effective functioning\nof JPMorganChase\u2019s operational systems depends on:\n\n\u2022 the quality of the information contained in those\nsystems, as inaccurate, outdated, incomplete or\ncorrupted data can significantly compromise the\n\nfunctionality or reliability of a particular system\nand other systems to which it transmits or from\nwhich it receives information, and\n\n\u2022 JPMorganChase\u2019s ability to continue to maintain\nand upgrade its systems on a regular and timely\nbasis in line with technological advancements and\nevolving security requirements, maintain security\nand operational continuity of its systems,\nincluding by carefully managing any changes\nintroduced to its systems, prevent unauthorized\naccess and the misuse of access to its systems, and\nadhere to all applicable legal and regulatory\nrequirements, particularly in regions where\nJPMorganChase may face a heightened risk of\nmalicious activity.\n\nJPMorganChase has experienced and expects that it\nwill continue to experience failures and\ndisruptions in the stability of its operational\nsystems, including degraded performance of data\nprocessing systems, data quality issues,\ndisruptions of network connectivity and\nmalfunctioning software, as well as disruptions in\nits ability to access and use the operational\nsystems of third parties and interruptions in\nservice from third-party service providers. These\nincidents have resulted in various negative effects\nfor customers, including the inability to access\naccount information or transact through ATM,\ninternet or mobile channels, the exfiltration of\ncustomer personal data, the recording of\nduplicative transactions and extended delays for\ncustomers requiring services from call centers.\nThere can be no assurance that these and other\ntypes of operational failures or disruptions will\nnot occur in the future.\n\nJPMorganChase\u2019s ability to effectively manage the\nstability of its operational systems and\ninfrastructure could be hindered by many factors,\nany of which could have a negative impact on\nJPMorganChase and its clients, customers and\ncounterparties, including:\n\n\u2022 JPMorganChase\u2019s ability to effectively maintain\nand upgrade systems and infrastructure can become\nmore challenging as the speed, frequency, volume,\ninterconnectivity and complexity of transactions\ncontinue to increase\n\n\u2022 attempts by third parties to defraud\nJPMorganChase or its clients and customers continue\nto increase, evolve and become more complex, and\nduring periods of market disruption or economic\nuncertainty, these attempts can be expected to\nfurther increase in volume\n\n\u2022 errors made by JPMorganChase or another market\nparticipant, whether inadvertent or malicious,\ncould cause widespread system disruption\n\n\u2022 failure to detect weaknesses or shortcomings in\noperational systems in a timely manner\n\n\u2022 isolated or seemingly insignificant errors in\noperational systems could compound, or migrate to\nother systems over time, to become larger issues\n      \n  22  \n      \n\u2022 disruptions in operational systems or in the\nability of systems to communicate with each other\ncould be caused by failures in synchronization or\nencryption software, or degraded performance of\nmicroprocessors, and\n\n\u2022 attempts by third parties to block the use of key\ntechnology solutions by claiming that the use\ninfringes on their intellectual property rights.\n\nJPMorganChase also depends on its ability to access\nand use the operational systems of third parties,\nincluding its custodians, vendors (such as those\nthat provide data and cloud computing services, and\nsecurity and technology services) and other market\nparticipants (such as clearing and payment systems,\nCCPs and securities exchanges). These external\noperational systems with which JPMorgan is\nconnected, whether directly or indirectly, can be\nsources of operational risk to JPMorganChase.\nJPMorganChase may be exposed not only to a systems\nfailure or cyber attack that may be experienced by\na vendor or market infrastructure with which\nJPMorganChase is directly connected, but also to a\nsystems breakdown or cyber attack involving another\nparty to which such a vendor or infrastructure is\nconnected. Similarly, retailers, payment systems\nand processors, data aggregators and other external\nparties with which JPMorganChase\u2019s customers do\nbusiness can increase JPMorganChase\u2019s operational\nrisk. This is particularly the case where\nactivities of customers or other parties are beyond\nJPMorganChase\u2019s security and control systems,\nincluding through the use of the internet, cloud\ncomputing services, and personal smart phones and\nother mobile devices or services.\n\nIf an external party obtains access to customer\naccount data on JPMorganChase\u2019s systems, whether\nauthorized or unauthorized, and that party\nmisappropriates that data, this could result in\nnegative outcomes for JPMorganChase and its clients\nand customers, including a heightened risk of\nfraudulent transactions using JPMorganChase\u2019s\nsystems, losses from fraudulent transactions and\nreputational harm arising from the perception that\nJPMorganChase\u2019s systems may not be secure.\n\nAs JPMorganChase\u2019s interconnectivity with clients,\ncustomers and other external parties continues to\nexpand, JPMorganChase increasingly faces the risk\nof operational failure or cyber attacks with\nrespect to the systems of those parties. Security\nbreaches affecting JPMorganChase\u2019s clients or\ncustomers, or systems breakdowns or failures,\nsecurity breaches or human error or misconduct\naffecting other external parties, may require\nJPMorganChase to take steps to protect the\nintegrity of its own operational systems or to\nsafeguard confidential information, including\nrestricting the access of customers to their\naccounts. These actions can increase\nJPMorganChase\u2019s\n\noperational costs and potentially diminish customer\nsatisfaction and confidence in JPMorganChase.\n\nFurthermore, the widespread and expanding\ninterconnectivity among financial institutions,\nclearing banks, CCPs, payments processors,\nfinancial technology companies, securities\nexchanges, clearing houses and other financial\nmarket infrastructures increases the risk that the\ndisruption of an operational system involving one\ninstitution or entity, including due to a cyber\nattack, may cause industry-wide operational\ndisruptions that could materially affect\nJPMorganChase\u2019s ability to conduct business. In\naddition, the risks associated with the disruption\nof an operational system of a third party could be\nexacerbated to the extent that the services\nprovided by that system are used by a significant\nnumber or proportion of market participants.\n\nThe ineffectiveness, failure or other disruption of\noperational systems upon which JPMorganChase\ndepends, including due to a systems malfunction,\ncyber incident or other systems failure, could\nresult in unfavorable ripple effects in the\nfinancial markets and for JPMorganChase and its\nclients and customers, including:\n\n\u2022 delays or other disruptions in providing\nservices, including the provision of liquidity or\ninformation to clients and customers\n\n\u2022 impairment of JPMorganChase\u2019s ability to execute\ntransactions, including delays or failures in the\nconfirmation or settlement of transactions or in\nobtaining access to funds or other assets required\nfor settlement\n\n\u2022 the possibility that funds transfers, capital\nmarkets trades or other transactions are executed\nerroneously\n\n\u2022 financial losses, including due to loss-sharing\nrequirements of CCPs, payment systems or other\nmarket infrastructures, or as possible restitution\nto clients and customers\n\n\u2022 higher operational costs associated with\nreplacing services provided by a system that has\nexperienced a failure or other disruption\n\n\u2022 limitations on JPMorganChase's ability to collect\ndata needed for its business and operations\n\n\u2022 loss of confidence in the ability of\nJPMorganChase, or financial institutions generally,\nto protect against and withstand operational\ndisruptions\n\n\u2022 dissatisfaction among JPMorganChase\u2019s clients or\ncustomers\n\n\u2022 significant exposure to litigation and regulatory\nfines, penalties or other sanctions, and\n\n\u2022 harm to JPMorganChase\u2019s reputation.\n\nIf JPMorganChase\u2019s operational systems, or those of\nacquired businesses or of external parties on which\n      \n  23  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                                                  \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\nJPMorganChase\u2019s businesses depend, are unable to\nmeet the requirements of JPMorganChase\u2019s businesses\nand operations or bank regulatory standards, or if\nthey fail or have other significant shortcomings,\nJPMorganChase could be materially and adversely\naffected.\n\nA successful cyber attack affecting JPMorganChase\ncould cause significant harm to JPMorganChase and\nits clients and customers.\n\nJPMorganChase experiences numerous cyber attacks on\nits computer systems, software, networks and other\ntechnology assets on a daily basis from various\nactors, including groups acting on behalf of\nhostile countries, cyber-criminals, \u201chacktivists\u201d\n(i.e., individuals or groups that use technology to\npromote a political agenda or social change) and\nothers. These cyber attacks can take many forms,\nincluding attempts to introduce computer viruses or\nmalicious code, which are commonly referred to as\n\u201cmalware,\u201d into JPMorganChase\u2019s systems. These\nattacks are often designed to:\n\n\u2022 obtain unauthorized access to JPMorganChase's\nsystems or to confidential information belonging to\nJPMorganChase or its clients, customers,\ncounterparties or employees\n\n\u2022 manipulate data\n\n\u2022 destroy data or systems with the aim of rendering\nservices unavailable\n\n\u2022 disrupt, sabotage or degrade service on\nJPMorganChase\u2019s systems\n\n\u2022 steal money, or\n\n\u2022 extort money through the use of so-called\n\u201cransomware.\u201d\n\nJPMorganChase also experiences:\n\n\u2022 distributed denial-of-service attacks intended to\ndisrupt JPMorganChase\u2019s websites, including those\nthat provide online banking and other services,\n\n\u2022 a higher volume and complexity of cyber attacks\nagainst the backdrop of heightened geopolitical\ntensions, and\n\n\u2022 a high volume of disruptions to internet-based\nservices used by JPMorganChase that are provided by\nthird parties.\n\nJPMorganChase has experienced security breaches due\nto cyber attacks in the past, and it is inevitable\nthat additional breaches will occur in the future.\nAny such breach could result in serious and harmful\nconsequences for JPMorganChase or its clients and\ncustomers.\n\nA principal reason that JPMorganChase cannot\nprovide absolute security against cyber attacks is\nthat it may not always be possible to anticipate,\ndetect or recognize threats to JPMorganChase\u2019s\nsystems, or to\n\nimplement effective preventive measures against all\nbreaches due to evolving risks, including:\n\n\u2022 the techniques used in cyber attacks evolve\nfrequently and increase in sophistication, and\ntherefore may not be recognized until launched or\nmay go undetected for extended periods\n\n\u2022 cyber attacks can originate from a wide variety\nof sources, including JPMorganChase\u2019s own\nemployees, cyber-criminals, hacktivists, groups\nlinked to terrorist organizations or hostile\nnation-states that can sustain malicious activities\nfor extended periods, or third parties whose\nobjective is to disrupt the operations of financial\ninstitutions more generally\n\n\u2022 JPMorganChase does not have control over the\ncybersecurity of the systems of the large number of\nclients, customers, counterparties and third-party\nservice providers with which it does business, and\n\n\u2022 it is possible that a third party, after\nestablishing a foothold on an internal network\nwithout being detected, may gain access to other\nnetworks and systems.\n\nThe risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack\ncould increase in the future due to factors such\nas:\n\n\u2022 JPMorganChase\u2019s ongoing expansion of its digital\nbanking and other internet-based product offerings\nand its internal use of internet-based products and\napplications, including those that use cloud\ncomputing services\n\n\u2022 advances in artificial intelligence, such as the\nuse of machine learning, generative artificial\nintelligence and quantum computing by malicious\nactors to develop more advanced social engineering\nattacks, including targeted phishing attacks\n\n\u2022 the inability to maintain the security of\ninformation transmitted by JPMorganChase due to\nadvances in quantum computing that may counteract\nor nullify existing information protections, and\n\n\u2022 the acquisition and integration of new\nbusinesses.\n\nIn addition, a third party could misappropriate\nconfidential information obtained by intercepting\nsignals or communications from mobile devices used\nby JPMorganChase\u2019s employees.\n\nThe dynamic nature of the cyber threat landscape,\nincluding the pace of innovation and increased\nthreat of novel attack methods, necessitates\nongoing investment in, as well as enhancement and\nadaptation of, cybersecurity controls, including\nthe adoption of enhanced security measures in\ncertain jurisdictions. Failure to discover or\naddress emerging threats, known vulnerabilities or\nshortcomings in cybersecurity controls, or to\nprioritize or complete enhancements to address\nthem, in each case in a timely manner, may leave\nJPMorganChase vulnerable to cyber attacks,\npotentially resulting in data breaches, financial\nlosses,\n      \n  24  \n      \nreputational damage and regulatory penalties,\nincluding the failure to prioritize or complete\nenhancements relating to:\n\n\u2022 preventing unauthorized access and protecting\nagainst the misuse of access, including the\nmaintenance and enhancement of controls related to\nsecure software development practices and identity\nand access management, such as those relating to\nthe management of administrative access to systems\n\n\u2022 detecting, escalating and addressing effectively\nand in a timely manner any vulnerabilities that may\nbe present either in internally-developed software\nor externally-provided software or services,\nincluding vulnerabilities that could allow\nattackers to exploit unknown security flaws in\nsoftware and hardware (\u201czero-day vulnerabilities\u201d)\n\n\u2022 oversight of third-party vendors and early\ndetection of attacks against those vendors,\nincluding ransomware attacks and attacks targeting\nvulnerabilities in third-party open-source\nsoftware, in support of the secure development and\nmaintenance of internal systems\n\n\u2022 maintaining and enhancing controls related to\ntechnology asset management and inventory systems\nto prevent the risk of undetected vulnerabilities\nthat could undermine JPMorganChase\u2019s ability to\noperate an effective control process\n\n\u2022 upgrading the coverage and capabilities of\nsystems and controls to protect JPMorganChase and\nits clients and customers from the impact of\ndistributed denial-of-service attacks, or to\nrecover from outages that could be caused by a\nmalware or ransomware attack\n\n\u2022 the continuing migration of client-facing\nservices to the cloud, and modernization of those\nservices\n\n\u2022 strengthening network security and managing\noutbound connections to reduce the risk of data\nloss\n\n\u2022 identifying, assessing and mitigating insider\nthreat activities that could lead to the misuse of\nJPMorganChase\u2019s systems or client and customer\ninformation, and\n\n\u2022 integrating acquired businesses where system\nintegration may be complex or may require extensive\nand lengthy remediation or enhancement of controls.\n\nA successful penetration or circumvention of the\nsecurity of JPMorganChase\u2019s systems or the systems\nof a vendor, governmental body or another market\nparticipant could cause serious negative\nconsequences, including:\n\n\u2022 significant disruption of JPMorganChase\u2019s\noperations and those of its clients, customers and\n\ncounterparties, including losing access to\noperational systems\n\n\u2022 misappropriation of confidential information of\nJPMorganChase or that of its clients, customers,\ncounterparties, employees or regulators\n\n\u2022 disruption of or damage to JPMorganChase\u2019s\nsystems and those of its clients, customers and\ncounterparties\n\n\u2022 the inability, or extended delays in the ability,\nto fully recover and restore data that has been\nstolen, manipulated or destroyed, or the inability\nto prevent systems from processing fraudulent\ntransactions\n\n\u2022 demands that JPMorganChase pay a ransom to a\nmalicious actor that has perpetrated a\ncybersecurity breach\n\n\u2022 unintended violations by JPMorganChase of\napplicable privacy and other laws\n\n\u2022 financial loss to JPMorganChase or to its\nclients, customers, counterparties or employees\n\n\u2022 losses to JPMorganChase in excess of cyber\ninsurance policy coverage\n\n\u2022 loss of confidence in JPMorganChase\u2019s\ncybersecurity and business resiliency measures\n\n\u2022 dissatisfaction among JPMorganChase\u2019s clients,\ncustomers or counterparties\n\n\u2022 significant exposure to litigation and regulatory\nfines, penalties or other sanctions, and\n\n\u2022 harm to JPMorganChase\u2019s reputation.\n\nThe extent of a particular cyber attack, the\nmethods and tools used by various actors, and the\nsteps that JPMorganChase may need to take to\ninvestigate the attack may not be immediately\nclear, and it may take a significant amount of time\nbefore such an investigation can be completed.\nWhile such an investigation is ongoing,\nJPMorganChase may not necessarily know the full\nextent of the harm caused by the cyber attack, and\nthat damage may continue to spread. These factors\nmay inhibit JPMorganChase\u2019s ability to provide\nrapid, full and reliable information about the\ncyber attack to its clients, customers,\ncounterparties and regulators, as well as the\npublic. Furthermore, it may not be clear how best\nto contain and remediate the harm caused by the\ncyber attack, and certain errors or actions could\nbe repeated or compounded before they are\ndiscovered and remediated. Any or all of these\nfactors could further increase the costs and\nconsequences of a cyber attack.\n\nJPMorganChase can be negatively affected if it\nfails to identify and address operational risks\nassociated with the introduction of or changes to\nproducts, services and delivery platforms or the\nadoption of new technologies.\n\nWhen JPMorganChase launches a new product or\nservice, introduces a new platform for the delivery\nor\n      \n  25  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                                                  \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\ndistribution of products or services (including\nmobile connectivity, electronic trading and cloud\ncomputing), acquires or invests in a business,\nmakes changes to an existing product, service or\ndelivery platform, or adopts a new technology, it\nmay not fully appreciate or identify new\noperational risks that may arise from those\nchanges, including increased reliance on third\nparty providers, or may fail to implement adequate\ncontrols to mitigate the risks associated with\nthose changes. Any significant failure in this\nregard could diminish JPMorganChase\u2019s ability to\noperate one or more of its businesses or result in:\n\n\u2022 potential liability to clients, counterparties\nand customers\n\n\u2022 higher compliance, operational or integration\ncosts\n\n\u2022 higher litigation costs, including regulatory\nfines, penalties and other sanctions\n\n\u2022 damage to JPMorganChase\u2019s reputation\n\n\u2022 impairment of JPMorganChase\u2019s liquidity\n\n\u2022 regulatory intervention, or\n\n\u2022 weaker competitive standing.\n\nAny of the foregoing consequences could materially\nand adversely affect JPMorganChase\u2019s businesses and\nresults of operations.\n\nJPMorganChase\u2019s business and operations rely on its\nability, and the ability of key external parties,\nto maintain appropriately-staffed workforces, and\non the competence, trustworthiness, health and\nsafety of employees.\n\nJPMorganChase\u2019s ability to operate its businesses\nefficiently and profitably, to offer products and\nservices that meet the expectations of its clients\nand customers, and to maintain an effective risk\nmanagement framework is highly dependent on its\nability to staff its operations appropriately and\non the competence, trustworthiness, health and\nsafety of its employees. JPMorganChase's businesses\nand operations similarly rely on the workforces of\nthird parties, including employees of vendors,\ncustodians and financial markets infrastructures,\nand of businesses that it may seek to acquire.\nJPMorganChase\u2019s businesses could be materially and\nadversely affected by:\n\n\u2022 the ineffective implementation of business\ndecisions\n\n\u2022 any failure to institute controls that\nappropriately address risks associated with\nbusiness activities, or to appropriately train\nemployees with respect to those risks and controls\n\n\u2022 staffing shortages, particularly in tight labor\nmarkets\n\n\u2022 the possibility that significant portions of\nJPMorganChase\u2019s workforce are unable to work\neffectively, including because of illness,\nquarantines, shelter-in-place arrangements,\ngovernment actions or other restrictions in\nconnection with health\n\nemergencies, the spread of infectious diseases,\nepidemics or pandemics, or due to extraordinary\nevents beyond JPMorganChase\u2019s control such as\nnatural disasters or an outbreak or escalation of\nhostilities\n\n\u2022 a significant operational breakdown or failure,\ntheft, fraud or other unlawful conduct, or\n\n\u2022 other negative outcomes caused by human error or\nmisconduct by an employee of JPMorganChase or of\nanother party on which JPMorganChase\u2019s businesses\nor operations rely.\n\nJPMorganChase\u2019s operations could also be impaired\nif the measures taken by it or by governmental\nauthorities to protect the health and safety of its\nemployees are ineffective, or if any external party\non which JPMorganChase relies fails to take\nappropriate and effective actions to protect the\nhealth and safety of its employees.\n\nJPMorganChase faces substantial legal and\noperational risks in the processing and\nsafeguarding of personal information.\n\nJPMorganChase\u2019s businesses and operations are\nsubject to complex and evolving laws, rules and\nregulations, both within and outside the U.S.,\ngoverning the privacy and protection of personal\ninformation of individuals. Governmental\nauthorities around the world have adopted and are\nconsidering the adoption of numerous legislative\nand regulatory initiatives concerning privacy, data\nprotection and security. Litigation or enforcement\nactions relating to these laws, rules and\nregulations could result in fines or orders\nrequiring that JPMorganChase change its data-\nrelated practices, which could have an adverse\neffect on JPMorganChase\u2019s ability to provide\nproducts and otherwise harm its business\noperations.\n\nImplementing processes relating to JPMorganChase\u2019s\ncollection, use, sharing and storage of personal\ninformation to comply with all applicable laws,\nrules and regulations in all relevant\njurisdictions, including where the laws of\ndifferent jurisdictions are in conflict, can:\n\n\u2022 increase JPMorganChase\u2019s compliance and operating\ncosts\n\n\u2022 hinder the development of new products or\nservices, curtail the offering of existing products\nor services, or affect how products and services\nare offered to clients and customers\n\n\u2022 demand significant oversight by JPMorganChase\u2019s\nmanagement, and\n\n\u2022 require JPMorganChase to structure its\nbusinesses, operations and systems in less\nefficient ways.\n\nNot all of JPMorganChase\u2019s clients, customers,\nvendors, counterparties and other external parties\nmay have appropriate controls in place to protect\nthe confidentiality, integrity or availability of\nthe\n      \n  26  \n      \ninformation exchanged between them and\nJPMorganChase, particularly where information is\ntransmitted by electronic means. JPMorganChase\ncould be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines,\npenalties or other sanctions if personal\ninformation of clients, customers, employees or\nothers were to be mishandled or misused, such as\nsituations where such information is:\n\n\u2022 erroneously provided to parties who are not\npermitted to have the information, or\n\n\u2022 intercepted or otherwise compromised by\nunauthorized third parties.\n\nThe increasing sophistication of artificial\nintelligence technologies poses a greater risk of\nidentity fraud, as malicious actors may exploit\nartificial intelligence to create convincing false\nidentities or manipulate verification processes.\nThis challenge necessitates ongoing enhancements to\nclient verification systems and security protocols\nto prevent unauthorized access and protect\nsensitive client information. Failure to manage\nthese risks or to implement effective\ncountermeasures could lead to unauthorized\ntransactions, financial losses, reputational damage\nand increased regulatory scrutiny.\n\nConcerns regarding the effectiveness of\nJPMorganChase\u2019s measures to safeguard personal\ninformation, or the perception that those measures\nare inadequate, could cause JPMorganChase to lose\nexisting or potential clients and customers or\nemployees, and thereby reduce JPMorganChase\u2019s\nrevenues. Furthermore, any failure or perceived\nfailure by JPMorganChase to comply with applicable\nprivacy or data protection laws, rules and\nregulations, or any failure to appropriately\ncalibrate, manage and monitor access by employees\nor third parties to personal information, could\nsubject JPMorganChase to inquiries, examinations\nand investigations that could result in\nrequirements to modify or cease certain operations\nor practices, significant liabilities or regulatory\nfines, penalties or other sanctions. Any of these\ncould damage JPMorganChase\u2019s reputation and\notherwise adversely affect its businesses.\n\nIn recent years, well-publicized incidents\ninvolving the inappropriate collection, use,\nsharing or storage of personal information have led\nto expanded governmental scrutiny of practices\nrelating to the processing or safeguarding of\npersonal information by companies in the U.S. and\nother countries. That scrutiny has in some cases\nresulted in, and could in the future lead to, the\nadoption of stricter laws, rules and regulations\nrelating to the collection, use, sharing and\nstorage of personal information. These types of\nlaws, rules and regulations can prohibit or\nsignificantly restrict financial services firms\nsuch as JPMorganChase from transferring information\nacross national borders or sharing information\namong affiliates or with third parties such as\nvendors, thereby\n\nincrease compliance costs and operational risk, or\nrestrict JPMorganChase\u2019s use of personal\ninformation when developing or offering products or\nservices to customers. Some countries are\nconsidering or have adopted legislation\nimplementing data protection requirements or\nrequiring local storage and processing of data\nwhich could increase the cost and complexity of\nJPMorganChase\u2019s delivery of products and services.\nThese restrictions could also inhibit\nJPMorganChase\u2019s development or marketing of certain\nproducts or services, or increase the costs of\noffering them to customers.\n\nJPMorganChase\u2019s operations, results and reputation\ncould be harmed by occurrences of extraordinary\nevents beyond its control.\n\nJPMorganChase\u2019s business and operational systems\ncould be seriously disrupted, and its reputation\ncould be harmed, by events or contributing factors\nthat are wholly or partially beyond its control,\nincluding material instances of:\n\n\u2022 cyber attacks\n\n\u2022 security breaches of its physical premises,\nincluding threats to health and safety\n\n\u2022 power, telecommunications or internet outages, or\nshutdowns of mass transit\n\n\u2022 failure of, or loss of access to, technology or\noperational systems, including any resulting loss\nof critical data\n\n\u2022 interruption of service from third-party service\nproviders\n\n\u2022 damage to or loss of property or assets of\nJPMorganChase or third parties, and any consequent\ninjuries, including in connection with any\nconstruction projects undertaken by JPMorganChase\n\n\u2022 effects of climate change\n\n\u2022 natural disasters or severe weather conditions\n\n\u2022 accidents such as explosions or structural\nfailures\n\n\u2022 health emergencies, the spread of infectious\ndiseases, epidemics or pandemics, or\n\n\u2022 events arising from local or larger-scale civil\nor political unrest, any outbreak or escalation of\nhostilities, or terrorist acts.\n\nJPMorganChase operates a Firmwide resiliency\nframework that is intended to enable it to prepare\nfor and adapt to changing conditions and withstand\nand recover from, and address any adverse effects\non its operations caused by, disruptions that may\nimpact critical business functions and supporting\nassets, including its staff, technology, data and\nfacilities and those of third-party service\nproviders.\n\nAlthough not every form of disruption can be\nanticipated or defended against, JPMorganChase\n      \n  27  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                                                  \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\nstrives for resiliency or recovery in a range of\nscenarios in the event of a disruption, including\ndue to the occurrence of an extraordinary event\nbeyond its control. There can be no assurance that\nJPMorganChase\u2019s Firmwide resiliency framework will\nfully mitigate all potential resiliency risks to\nJPMorganChase, its clients, and customers and third\nparties with which it does business, or that its\nresiliency framework will be adequate to address\nthe effects of simultaneous occurrences of multiple\nor extended disruption events. In addition,\nJPMorganChase\u2019s ability to respond effectively to a\ndisruption event could be hampered to the extent\nthat the members of its workforce, physical assets,\nsystems and other support infrastructure, or those\nof its third-party service providers, that are\nneeded to address the event are geographically\ndispersed, or conversely, if such an event were to\noccur in an area in which they are concentrated.\nFurther, should extraordinary events or the factors\nthat cause or contribute to those events become\nmore chronic, the disruptive effects of those\nevents on JPMorganChase\u2019s business and operations,\nand on its clients, customers, counterparties and\nemployees, could become more significant and long-\nlasting.\n\nAny significant failure or disruption of\nJPMorganChase\u2019s operations or operational systems,\nor the occurrence of one or more extraordinary\nevents that are beyond its control, could:\n\n\u2022 hinder JPMorganChase\u2019s ability to provide\nservices to its clients and customers or to\ntransact with its counterparties\n\n\u2022 require it to expend significant resources to\ncorrect the failure or disruption or to address the\nevent\n\n\u2022 cause it to incur losses or liabilities,\nincluding from loss of revenue, damage to or loss\nof property, or injuries\n\n\u2022 disrupt market infrastructure systems on which\nJPMorganChase\u2019s businesses rely\n\n\u2022 expose it to litigation or regulatory fines,\npenalties or other sanctions, and\n\n\u2022 harm its reputation.\n\nThe occurrence of one or more extraordinary events\ncould also negatively impact the financial\ncondition or creditworthiness of JPMorganChase\u2019s\nclients and customers, and could lead to an\nincrease in delinquencies, additions to the\nallowance for credit losses and higher net charge-\noffs, which can reduce JPMorganChase\u2019s earnings.\n\nData quality is essential to JPMorganChase\u2019s\nbusiness and operations, and if JPMorganChase fails\nto maintain adequate data management processes,\nthis could adversely affect its ability to\neffectively manage its businesses, comply with\napplicable laws, rules and regulations, or remain\ncompetitive.\n\nJPMorganChase relies on accurate, timely and\ncomplete data to effectively operate its systems\nand processes, including:\n\n\u2022 assessing risk exposures and limits\n\n\u2022 monitoring and detecting fraudulent transactions\nand cyber threats\n\n\u2022 developing or maintaining models and other\nanalytical and judgment-based estimations,\nincluding those that use machine learning or\nartificial intelligence\n\n\u2022 implementing and maintaining compliance programs,\nand\n\n\u2022 preparing financial statements, disclosures and\nregulatory reports, as well as internal reporting\n\nAny deficiencies in JPMorganChase\u2019s data management\nprocesses, including with respect to the accuracy\nor completeness of data, the timeliness of data\ncollection, the analysis or validation of data, or\nthe safeguarding of data could undermine the\nreliability and effectiveness of its operations,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 risk management practices, including inaccurate\nor untimely risk reporting\n\n\u2022 delivery of regulatory reporting or internal or\nexternal financial reporting\n\n\u2022 compliance practices, such as those relating to\ntransaction monitoring, customer screening,\nblocking and rejecting transactions, recordkeeping\nor reporting\n\n\u2022 business activities, such as those related to\nmanaging JPMorganChase's market-making positions\nand liquidity and capital levels, including\nreliance on timely data for informed decision-\nmaking\n\n\u2022 providing services to clients and customers,\nincluding transaction processing, lending services,\naccount management and customer support, or\n\n\u2022 fraud detection and prevention processes.\n\nAny or all of these factors could impair the\nability of JPMorganChase to make sound business\ndecisions, cause it to incur higher operational and\ncompliance costs, result in operational breakdowns\nor failure to meet its regulatory requirements,\nnegatively affect clients and customers, or lead to\nreputational harm.\n\nEnhanced regulatory and other standards for the\noversight of vendors and other service providers\ncan result in higher costs and other potential\nexposures.\n\nJPMorganChase must comply with enhanced regulatory\nand other standards associated with doing\n      \n  28  \n      \nbusiness with vendors and other service providers,\nincluding standards relating to the outsourcing of\nfunctions as well as the performance of significant\nbanking and other functions by subsidiaries.\nJPMorganChase incurs significant costs and expenses\nin connection with its initiatives to address the\nrisks associated with oversight of its internal and\nexternal service providers. JPMorganChase\u2019s failure\nto appropriately assess and manage these\nrelationships, especially those involving\nsignificant banking functions, shared services or\nother critical activities, could materially\nadversely affect JPMorganChase. Specifically, any\nsuch failure could result in:\n\n\u2022 potential harm to clients and customers, and any\nliability associated with that harm\n\n\u2022 regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions\n\n\u2022 lower revenues, and the opportunity cost from\nlost revenues\n\n\u2022 increased operational costs, or\n\n\u2022 harm to JPMorganChase\u2019s reputation.\n\nJPMorganChase\u2019s risk management framework and\ncontrol environment will not be effective in\nidentifying and mitigating every risk to\nJPMorganChase.\n\nAny inadequacy or lapse in JPMorganChase\u2019s risk\nmanagement framework, governance structure,\npractices, models or reporting systems, or in its\ncontrol environment, could expose it to unexpected\nlosses, and its financial condition or results of\noperations could be materially and adversely\naffected. Any such inadequacy or lapse could:\n\n\u2022 hinder the timely escalation of material risk\nissues to JPMorganChase\u2019s senior management and\nBoard of Directors\n\n\u2022 lead to business decisions that have negative\noutcomes for JPMorganChase\n\n\u2022 require significant resources and time to\nremediate\n\n\u2022 lead to non-compliance with laws, rules and\nregulations\n\n\u2022 attract heightened regulatory scrutiny\n\n\u2022 expose JPMorganChase to litigation, regulatory\ninvestigations or regulatory fines, penalties or\nother sanctions\n\n\u2022 lead to potential harm to customers and clients,\nand any liability associated with that harm\n\n\u2022 harm its reputation, or\n\n\u2022 otherwise diminish confidence in JPMorganChase.\n\nMany of JPMorganChase\u2019s risk management strategies\nand techniques consider historical market behavior\nand to some degree are based on management\u2019s\nsubjective judgment or assumptions. For example,\nmany models used by JPMorganChase are based on\nassumptions regarding historical\n\ncorrelations among prices of various asset classes\nor other market indicators. In times of market\nstress, including difficult or less liquid market\nenvironments, or in the event of other unforeseen\ncircumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators\nmay become correlated. Conversely, previously-\ncorrelated indicators may become uncorrelated at\nthose times. Sudden market movements and\nunanticipated market or economic events could, in\nsome circumstances, limit the effectiveness of\nJPMorganChase\u2019s risk management strategies, causing\nit to incur losses.\n\nJPMorganChase could recognize unexpected losses,\nits capital levels could be reduced and it could\nface greater regulatory scrutiny if its models,\nestimations or judgments, including those used in\nits financial statements, are inadequate or\nincorrect.\n\nJPMorganChase has developed and uses a variety of\nmodels and other analytical and judgment-based\nestimations to measure, monitor and implement\ncontrols over its market, credit, capital,\nliquidity, operational and other risks.\nJPMorganChase also uses internal models and\nestimations as a basis for its stress testing and\nin connection with the preparation of its financial\nstatements under U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d).\n\nThese models and estimations are based on a variety\nof assumptions and historical trends, and are\nperiodically reviewed and modified as necessary.\nThe models and estimations that JPMorganChase uses,\nincluding those that use machine learning or\nartificial intelligence, may not be effective in\nall cases to identify, observe and mitigate risk\ndue to a variety of factors, such as:\n\n\u2022 reliance on historical trends that may not\npersist in the future, including assumptions\nunderlying the models and estimations such as\ncorrelations among certain market indicators or\nasset prices\n\n\u2022 inherent limitations associated with forecasting\nuncertain economic and financial outcomes\n\n\u2022 historical trend information may be incomplete,\nor may not be indicative of severely negative\nmarket conditions such as extreme volatility,\ndislocation or lack of liquidity\n\n\u2022 sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in\nprices of certain loans and securities may make it\nmore difficult to value certain financial\ninstruments\n\n\u2022 technology that is introduced to run models or\nestimations may not perform as expected, or may not\nbe well understood by the personnel using the\ntechnology\n\n\u2022 models and estimations may contain erroneous\ndata, valuations, formulas or algorithms\n\n\u2022 review processes may fail to detect flaws in\nmodels and estimations, and\n      \n  29  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                                                  \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\n\u2022 models may inadvertently incorporate biases\npresent in data used in the models.\n\nJPMorganChase may experience unexpected losses if\nmodels, estimates or judgments used or applied in\nconnection with its risk management activities or\nthe preparation of its financial statements are\ninadequate or incorrect. For example, where quoted\nmarket prices are not available for certain\nfinancial instruments that require a determination\nof their fair value, JPMorganChase may make fair\nvalue determinations based on internally developed\nmodels or other means which ultimately rely to some\ndegree on management estimates and judgment. In\naddition, JPMorganChase may experience increased\nuncertainty in its estimates if assets acquired\ndiffer from those used to develop those models,\nwhich may lead to unexpected losses.\n\nSimilarly, JPMorganChase establishes an allowance\nfor expected credit losses related to its credit\nexposures which requires significant judgments,\nincluding forecasts of how macroeconomic conditions\nmight impair the ability of JPMorganChase\u2019s clients\nand customers to repay their loans or other\nobligations. These types of estimates and judgments\nmay not prove to be accurate due to a variety of\nfactors, including when the current and forecasted\nenvironments are significantly different from the\nhistorical environments upon which the models were\ndeveloped. The increased uncertainty may\nnecessitate a greater degree of judgment and\nanalytics to inform any adjustments that\nJPMorganChase may make to model outputs than would\notherwise be the case.\n\nSome of the models and other analytical and\njudgment-based estimations used by JPMorganChase in\nmanaging risks are subject to review by, and\nrequire the approval of, JPMorganChase\u2019s\nregulators. These reviews are required before\nJPMorganChase may use those models and estimations\nfor calculating market risk RWA, credit risk RWA\nand operational risk RWA under Basel III. If\nJPMorganChase\u2019s models or estimations are not\napproved by its regulators, it may be subject to\nhigher capital charges, which could adversely\naffect its financial results or limit the ability\nto expand its businesses.\n\nLapses, weaknesses or deficiencies in controls over\ndisclosure or financial reporting could materially\naffect JPMorganChase\u2019s profitability or reputation.\n\nJPMorganChase\u2019s businesses and operations are\nsubject to complex and evolving laws, rules and\nregulations, both within and outside the U.S.,\nrequiring continuous enhancements to various\ndisclosures in its financial statements and\nregulatory reports.\n\nThere can be no assurance that JPMorganChase\u2019s\ndisclosure controls and procedures will be\neffective in every circumstance, or that a material\nweakness or significant deficiency in internal\ncontrol over financial reporting will not occur.\nAny such lapse, weakness or\n\ndeficiency could result in inaccurate financial\nreporting which, in turn, could:\n\n\u2022 materially and adversely affect JPMorganChase\u2019s\nbusiness and results of operations or financial\ncondition\n\n\u2022 restrict its ability to access the capital\nmarkets\n\n\u2022 require it to expend significant resources to\ncorrect the lapse, weakness or deficiency\n\n\u2022 expose it to litigation or regulatory fines,\npenalties or other sanctions\n\n\u2022 harm its reputation, or\n\n\u2022 otherwise diminish investor confidence in\nJPMorganChase.\n                                                                                                            \n  Strategic                                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \nJPMorganChase\u2019s results or competitive standing\ncould suffer if its management fails to develop and\nexecute effective business strategies, and to\nanticipate changes affecting those strategies.\n\nThe development and execution of effective business\nstrategies by JPMorganChase\u2019s management, along\nwith the ability to anticipate and respond to\nshifts in the competitive environment, are critical\nto JPMorganChase's competitive standing and to\nachieving its strategic objectives. These\nstrategies relate to:\n\n\u2022 the products and services that JPMorganChase\noffers\n\n\u2022 the geographies in which it operates\n\n\u2022 the types of clients and customers that it serves\n\n\u2022 the businesses that it acquires or in which it\ninvests\n\n\u2022 the counterparties with which it does business\n\n\u2022 the technologies that it adopts or in which it\ninvests, which may include new and currently\nunproven technologies, and\n\n\u2022 the methods, distribution channels and third\nparty service providers by or through which it\noffers products and services.\n\nIf management makes choices about these strategies\nand goals that prove to be incorrect, are based on\nincomplete, inaccurate or fraudulent information,\ndo not accurately assess the competitive landscape\nand industry trends, or fail to address changing\nregulatory and market environments or the\nexpectations of clients, customers, investors,\nemployees and other stakeholders, then the\nfranchise values and growth prospects of\nJPMorganChase\u2019s businesses may suffer and its\nearnings could decline.\n\nJPMorganChase\u2019s growth prospects also depend on\nmanagement\u2019s ability to develop and execute\neffective business plans to address these strategic\npriorities, both in the near term and over longer\ntime horizons. Management\u2019s effectiveness in this\nregard will affect\n      \n  30  \n      \nJPMorganChase\u2019s ability to develop and enhance its\nresources, control expenses and return capital to\nshareholders. Each of these objectives could be\nadversely affected by any failure on the part of\nmanagement to:\n\n\u2022 devise effective business plans and strategies\n\n\u2022 offer products and services that meet changing\nexpectations of clients and customers\n\n\u2022 allocate capital in a manner that promotes long-\nterm stability to enable JPMorganChase to build and\ninvest in market-leading businesses, even in a\nhighly stressed environment\n\n\u2022 allocate capital appropriately due to imprecise\nmodeling or subjective judgments made in connection\nwith those allocations\n\n\u2022 appropriately assess and monitor principal\ninvestments made to enhance or accelerate\nJPMorganChase's business strategies\n\n\u2022 conduct appropriate due diligence on prospective\nbusiness acquisitions or investments, or\neffectively integrate newly-acquired businesses\n\n\u2022 appropriately address concerns of clients,\ncustomers, investors, employees and other\nstakeholders, including with respect to climate and\nother ESG matters\n\n\u2022 react quickly to changes in market conditions or\nmarket structures, or\n\n\u2022 develop and enhance the operational, technology,\nrisk, financial and managerial resources and\ncapabilities necessary to grow and manage\nJPMorganChase\u2019s businesses.\n\nFurthermore, JPMorganChase may incur costs in\nconnection with disposing of excess properties,\npremises and facilities, and those costs could be\nmaterial to its results of operations.\n\nJPMorganChase faces significant and increasing\ncompetition in the rapidly evolving financial\nservices industry.\n\nJPMorganChase operates in a highly competitive\nenvironment in which it must evolve and adapt to\nchanges in financial regulation, technological\nadvances, increased public scrutiny and changes in\neconomic conditions. JPMorganChase expects that\ncompetition in the U.S. and global financial\nservices industry will continue to be intense.\nCompetitors include:\n\n\u2022 other banks and financial institutions\n\n\u2022 trading, advisory and investment management firms\n\n\u2022 finance companies\n\n\u2022 technology companies, and\n\n\u2022 other non-bank firms that are engaged in\nproviding similar as well as new products and\nservices.\n\nJPMorganChase cannot provide assurance that the\nsignificant competition in the financial services\nindustry will not materially and adversely affect\nits future results of operations. For example,\naggressive or less disciplined lending practices by\nnon-bank competitors could lead to a loss of market\nshare for traditional banks, and in an economic\ndownturn could result in instability in the\nfinancial services industry and adversely impact\nother market participants, including JPMorganChase.\n\nNew competitors in the financial services industry\ncontinue to emerge. For example, technological\nadvances and the growth of e-commerce have made it\npossible for non-depository institutions to offer\nproducts and services that traditionally were\nbanking products. These advances have also allowed\nfinancial institutions and other companies to\nprovide electronic and internet-based financial\nsolutions, including electronic securities and\ncryptocurrency trading, lending and other\nextensions of credit to consumers, payments\nprocessing and online automated algorithmic-based\ninvestment advice. Furthermore, both financial\ninstitutions and their non-banking competitors face\nthe risk that payments processing and other\nproducts and services, including deposits and other\ntraditional banking products, could be\nsignificantly disrupted by the use of new\ntechnologies, such as cryptocurrencies and other\napplications using secure distributed ledgers, that\nmay not require intermediation. New technologies\nhave required and could require JPMorganChase to\nspend more to modify or adapt its products to\nattract and retain clients and customers or to\nmatch products and services offered by its\ncompetitors, including technology companies. In\naddition, new technologies may be used by\ncustomers, or breached or infiltrated by third\nparties, in unexpected ways, which can increase\nJPMorganChase\u2019s costs for complying with laws,\nrules and regulations that apply to the offering of\nproducts and services through those technologies\nand reduce the income that JPMorganChase earns from\nproviding products and services through those\ntechnologies.\n\nOngoing or increased competition may put pressure\non the pricing for JPMorganChase\u2019s products and\nservices or may cause JPMorganChase to lose market\nshare, particularly with respect to traditional\nbanking products. This competition may be based on\nquality and variety of products and services\noffered, transaction execution, innovation,\nreputation and price. The failure of any of\nJPMorganChase\u2019s businesses to meet the expectations\nof clients and customers, whether due to general\nmarket conditions, under-performance, a decision\nnot to offer a particular product or service,\nchanges in client and customer expectations or\nother factors, could affect JPMorganChase\u2019s ability\nto attract or retain clients and customers. Any\nsuch impact could, in turn, reduce\n      \n  31  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                                                  \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\nJPMorganChase\u2019s revenues. Increased competition\nalso may require JPMorganChase to make additional\ncapital investments in its businesses, or to extend\nmore of its capital on behalf of its clients to\nremain competitive.\n\nThe effects of climate change could adversely\naffect JPMorganChase\u2019s business and operations,\nboth directly and as a result of impacts on its\nclients and customers.\n\nJPMorganChase operates in many regions, countries\nand communities around the world where its\nbusiness, and the activities of its clients and\ncustomers, could be adversely affected by climate\nchange. Climate change could manifest as a\nfinancial risk to JPMorganChase either through\nchanges in the physical climate or from the process\nof transitioning to a lower-carbon economy. Both\nphysical risks and transition risks associated with\nclimate change could have negative impacts on the\nfinancial condition or creditworthiness of\nJPMorganChase\u2019s clients and customers, on\nJPMorganChase's exposure to affected companies and\nmarkets, and on the effectiveness of\nJPMorganChase\u2019s existing business strategy with\nrespect to its operations, clients and customers.\n\nPhysical risks include the increased frequency or\nseverity of acute weather events, such as floods,\nwildfires and tropical cyclones, and chronic shifts\nin the climate, such as rising sea levels,\npersistent changes in precipitation levels, or\nincreases in average ambient temperatures.\nPotential adverse impacts of climate-related\nphysical risks to JPMorganChase, its clients or\ncustomers include:\n\n\u2022 declines in asset values, including due to the\ndestruction or degradation of property\n\n\u2022 reduced availability or increased cost of\ninsurance for clients of JPMorganChase\n\n\u2022 interruptions to business operations, including\nsupply chain disruption, and\n\n\u2022 population migration or unemployment in affected\nregions.\n\nTransition risks arise from the financial and\neconomic consequences of society\u2019s shift towards a\nlower-carbon economy, such as changes in public\npolicy, adoption of new technologies or changes in\nconsumer preferences towards low-carbon goods and\nservices. These risks could also be influenced by\nchanges in the physical climate. Potential adverse\nimpacts of transition risks to JPMorganChase, its\nclients or customers include:\n\n\u2022 sudden devaluation of assets, including\nunanticipated write-downs (\u201cstranded assets\u201d)\n\n\u2022 increased operational and compliance costs driven\nby changes in climate policy\n\n\u2022 increased energy costs driven by governmental\nactions and initiatives such as emission pricing\nand accelerated decarbonization policies\n\n\u2022 negative consequences to business models, and the\nneed to make changes in response to those\nconsequences, and\n\n\u2022 damage to JPMorganChase\u2019s reputation, including\ndue to any perception that its business practices\nare contrary to public policy or the preferences of\ndifferent stakeholders.\n\nClimate risks can also arise from inconsistencies\nand conflicts in the manner in which climate policy\nand financial regulations are implemented in the\nmany regions where JPMorganChase operates,\nincluding initiatives to apply and enforce policy\nand regulation with extraterritorial effect.\nAdditionally, internal models and estimations used\nin climate risk assessments have an increased level\nof uncertainty due to limited historical trend\ninformation and the absence of standardized,\nreliable and comprehensive greenhouse gas emissions\ndata, which could lead to inaccurate disclosures or\nfinancial reporting.\n                                                                                                            \n  Conduct                                                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \nConduct failure by JPMorganChase employees can harm\nclients and customers, impact market integrity,\ndamage JPMorganChase\u2019s reputation and trigger\nlitigation and regulatory action.\n\nJPMorganChase\u2019s employees interact with clients,\ncustomers, counterparties and other market and\nindustry participants, and with each other, every\nday. All employees are expected to demonstrate\nvalues and exhibit the behaviors that are an\nintegral part of JPMorganChase\u2019s Code of Conduct\nand Business Principles. JPMorganChase endeavors to\nembed conduct risk management throughout an\nemployee\u2019s life cycle, including recruiting,\nonboarding, training and development, and\nperformance management. Conduct risk management is\nalso an integral component of JPMorganChase\u2019s\npromotion and compensation processes.\n\nNotwithstanding these expectations, policies and\npractices, certain employees have engaged in\nimproper or illegal conduct in the past. These\ninstances of misconduct have resulted in\nlitigation, and resolutions of governmental\ninvestigations or enforcement actions involving\nconsent orders, deferred prosecution agreements,\nnon-prosecution agreements and other civil or\ncriminal sanctions. There is no assurance that\nfurther inappropriate or unlawful actions by\nemployees have not occurred or will not occur, lead\nto a violation of the terms of these resolutions\n(and associated consequences), or that any such\nactions will always be detected, deterred or\nprevented.\n\nJPMorganChase\u2019s reputation could be harmed by, and\ncollateral consequences could result from, a\nfailure by\n      \n  32  \n      \none or more employees to conduct themselves in\naccordance with JPMorganChase\u2019s expectations,\npolicies and practices, including by acting in ways\nthat harm clients, customers, other market\nparticipants, employees or others. Some examples of\nthis include:\n\n\u2022 improperly selling and marketing JPMorganChase\u2019s\nproducts or services\n\n\u2022 engaging in insider trading, market manipulation\nor unauthorized trading\n\n\u2022 engaging in improper or fraudulent behavior in\nconnection with government relief programs\n\n\u2022 facilitating a transaction where a material\nobjective is to achieve a particular tax,\naccounting or financial disclosure treatment that\nmay be subject to scrutiny by governmental or\nregulatory authorities, or where the proposed\ntreatment is unclear or may not reflect the\neconomic substance of the transaction\n\n\u2022 failing to fulfill fiduciary obligations or other\nduties owed to clients or customers\n\n\u2022 violating antitrust or anti-competition laws by\ncolluding with other market participants\n\n\u2022 using electronic communications channels that\nhave not been approved by JPMorganChase\n\n\u2022 engaging in discriminatory behavior or harassment\nwith respect to clients, customers or employees, or\nacting contrary to JPMorganChase\u2019s goal of\nfostering an inclusive workplace\n\n\u2022 managing or reporting risks in ways that\nsubordinate JPMorganChase\u2019s risk appetite to\nbusiness performance goals or employee compensation\nobjectives, and\n\n\u2022 misappropriating property, confidential or\nproprietary information, or technology assets\nbelonging to JPMorganChase, its clients and\ncustomers or third parties.\n\nThe consequences of any failure by one or more\nemployees to conduct themselves in accordance with\nJPMorganChase\u2019s expectations, policies or practices\ncould include litigation, or regulatory or other\ngovernmental investigations or enforcement actions.\nAny of these proceedings or actions could result in\njudgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other\nsanctions, or lead to:\n\n\u2022 financial losses\n\n\u2022 increased operational and compliance costs\n\n\u2022 greater scrutiny by regulators and other parties\n\n\u2022 regulatory actions that require JPMorganChase to\nrestructure, curtail or cease certain of its\nactivities\n\n\u2022 the need for significant oversight by\nJPMorganChase\u2019s management\n\n\u2022 loss of clients or customers, and\n\n\u2022 harm to JPMorganChase\u2019s reputation.\n\nThe foregoing risks could be heightened with\nrespect to newly-acquired businesses if\nJPMorganChase fails to successfully integrate\nemployees of those businesses or any of those\nemployees do not conduct themselves in accordance\nwith JPMorganChase's expectations, policies and\npractices.\n                                                                                                            \n  Reputation                                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nDamage to JPMorganChase\u2019s reputation could harm its\nbusinesses.\n\nMaintaining trust in JPMorganChase is critical to\nits ability to attract and retain clients,\ncustomers, investors and employees. Damage to\nJPMorganChase\u2019s reputation can therefore cause\nsignificant harm to JPMorganChase\u2019s business and\nprospects, and can arise from numerous sources,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 employee misconduct, including discriminatory\nbehavior or harassment with respect to clients,\ncustomers or employees, or actions that are\ncontrary to JPMorganChase\u2019s goal of fostering an\ninclusive

counterparties or other parties,\nincluding newly-acquired businesses, companies in\nwhich JPMorganChase has made principal investments,\nparties to joint ventures with JPMorganChase, and\nvendors with which JPMorganChase does business.\n\nSocial and environmental activists have been\ntargeting JPMorganChase and other financial\nservices firms with public criticism concerning\ntheir business practices, including business\nrelationships with clients that are engaged in\ncertain sensitive industries, such as companies:\n\n\u2022 whose products are or are perceived to be harmful\nto human health, or\n\n\u2022 whose activities negatively affect or are\nperceived to negatively affect the environment,\nworkers\u2019 rights or communities.\n\nActivists have also taken actions intended to\nchange or influence JPMorganChase\u2019s business\npractices with respect to ESG matters, including\npublic protests at JPMorganChase\u2019s headquarters and\nother properties, and submitting specific ESG-\nrelated proposals for a vote by JPMorganChase\u2019s\nshareholders.\n\nIn addition, JPMorganChase has been and expects\nthat it will continue to be criticized by\nactivists, politicians and other members of the\npublic concerning business practices or positions\ntaken by JPMorganChase with respect to matters of\npublic policy (such as diversity, equity and\ninclusion initiatives) or regarding transactions or\nother business or interactions between\nJPMorganChase and governmental or regulatory\nbodies. Furthermore, JPMorganChase's relationships\nor ability to transact with clients and customers,\nand with governmental or regulatory bodies in\njurisdictions in which JPMorganChase does business,\ncould be adversely affected if its decisions with\nrespect to doing business with companies in certain\nsensitive industries are perceived to harm those\ncompanies or to align with particular political\nviewpoints. The foregoing types of criticism can be\nmore widespread during election years in various\njurisdictions, and could have the effect of\nfocusing attention on a company such as\nJPMorganChase as part of a wider public debate on\npublic policy matters. Furthermore, JPMorganChase's\nparticipation in or association with certain\nenvironmental and social industry groups or\ninitiatives could be viewed by activists or\ngovernmental authorities as boycotting or other\ndiscriminatory business behavior.\n\nThese and other types of criticism and actions\ndirected at JPMorganChase could potentially\nengender dissatisfaction among clients, customers,\ninvestors, employees, government officials and\nother stakeholders. In all of these cases,\nJPMorganChase\u2019s reputation and its business and\nresults of operations could be harmed by:\n\n\u2022 greater scrutiny from governmental or regulatory\nbodies, or further criticism from politicians and\nother members of the public, including in the form\nof governmental or regulatory investigations or\nlitigation\n\n\u2022 unfavorable coverage or commentary in the media,\nincluding through social media campaigns\n\n\u2022 certain clients and customers ceasing doing\nbusiness with JPMorganChase, and encouraging others\nto do so\n\n\u2022 impairment of JPMorganChase\u2019s ability to attract\nnew clients and customers, to expand its\nrelationships with existing clients and customers,\nor to hire or retain employees, or\n\n\u2022 certain investors opting to divest from\ninvestments in securities of JPMorganChase.\n\nActions by the financial services industry\ngenerally or individuals in the industry can also\naffect JPMorganChase\u2019s reputation. For example, the\nreputation of the industry as a whole can be\ndamaged by concerns that:\n\n\u2022 consumers have been treated unfairly by a\nfinancial institution, or\n\n\u2022 a financial institution has acted inappropriately\nwith respect to the methods used to offer products\nto customers.\n\nIf JPMorganChase is perceived to have engaged in\nthese types of behaviors, this could weaken its\nreputation among clients or customers, employees or\nother stakeholders.\n\nFailure to effectively manage potential conflicts\nof interest or to satisfy fiduciary obligations can\nresult in litigation and enforcement actions, as\nwell as damage JPMorganChase\u2019s reputation.\n\nJPMorganChase\u2019s ability to manage potential\nconflicts of interest is highly complex due to the\nbroad range of its business activities which\nencompass a variety of transactions, obligations\nand interests with and among JPMorganChase\u2019s\nclients and customers. JPMorganChase can become\nsubject to litigation, enforcement actions, and\nheightened regulatory scrutiny, and its reputation\ncan be damaged, by the failure or perceived failure\nto:\n\n\u2022 adequately address or appropriately disclose\nconflicts of interest, including potential\nconflicts of interest that may arise in connection\nwith providing multiple products and services in,\nor having one or more investments related to, the\nsame transaction\n\n\u2022 identify and address any conflict of interest\nthat a third party with which it is does business\nmay have with respect to a transaction involving\nJPMorganChase\n\n\u2022 deliver appropriate standards of service and\nquality\n      \n  34  \n      \n\u2022 treat clients and customers fairly and with the\nappropriate standard of care\n\n\u2022 use client and customer data responsibly and in a\nmanner that meets legal requirements and regulatory\nexpectations\n\n\u2022 provide fiduciary products or services in\naccordance with the applicable legal and regulatory\nstandards, or\n\n\u2022 handle or use confidential information of\ncustomers or clients appropriately and in\ncompliance with applicable data protection and\nprivacy laws, rules and regulations.\n\nA failure or perceived failure to appropriately\naddress conflicts of interest or fiduciary\nobligations could result in customer\ndissatisfaction, litigation and regulatory fines,\npenalties or other sanctions, and heightened\nregulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions, all of\nwhich can lead to lost revenue and higher operating\ncosts and cause serious harm to JPMorganChase\u2019s\nreputation.\n                                                                                                            \n  Country                                                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \nAn outbreak or escalation of hostilities between\ncountries or within a country or region could have\na material adverse effect on the global economy and\non JPMorganChase\u2019s businesses within the affected\nregion or globally.\n\nAggressive actions by hostile governments or\ngroups, including armed conflict or intensified\ncyber attacks, could expand in unpredictable ways\nby drawing in other countries or escalating into\nfull-scale war with potentially catastrophic\nconsequences, particularly if one or more of the\ncombatants possess nuclear weapons. Depending on\nthe scope of the conflict, the hostilities could\nresult in:\n\n\u2022 worldwide economic disruption\n\n\u2022 heightened volatility in financial markets\n\n\u2022 severe declines in asset values, accompanied by\nwidespread sell-offs of investments\n\n\u2022 sudden increases in prices in the energy and\ncommodity markets or for certain safe haven\ncurrencies\n\n\u2022 substantial depreciation of local currencies,\npotentially leading to defaults by borrowers and\ncounterparties in the affected region\n\n\u2022 disruption of global trade\n\n\u2022 diminished consumer, business and investor\nconfidence\n\n\u2022 refugee and humanitarian crises, and\n\n\u2022 new economic sanctions or other regulatory\nrequirements, including those that introduce\nexceptional compliance challenges for multinational\ncompanies such as JPMorganChase.\n\nAny of the above consequences could have\nsignificant negative effects on JPMorganChase\u2019s\noperations and earnings, both in the countries or\nregions directly affected by the hostilities or\nglobally. Further, if the U.S. were to become\ndirectly involved in such a conflict, this could\nlead to a curtailment of any operations that\nJPMorganChase may have in the affected countries or\nregion, as well as in any nation that is aligned\nagainst the U.S. in the hostilities. JPMorganChase\ncould also experience more numerous and aggressive\ncyber attacks launched by or under the sponsorship\nof one or more of the adversaries in such a\nconflict.\n\nJPMorganChase\u2019s business and operations in certain\ncountries can be adversely affected by local\neconomic, political, regulatory and social factors.\n\nSome of the countries in which JPMorganChase\nconducts business have economies or markets that\nare less developed and more volatile or may have\npolitical, legal and regulatory regimes that are\nless established or predictable than other\ncountries in which JPMorganChase operates. In\naddition, in some jurisdictions in which\nJPMorganChase conducts business, the local economy\nand business activities are subject to substantial\ngovernment influence or control. Some of these\ncountries have in the past experienced economic\ndisruptions, including:\n\n\u2022 extreme currency fluctuations\n\n\u2022 high inflation\n\n\u2022 low or negative growth\n\n\u2022 defaults or reduced ability to service sovereign\ndebt and\n\n\u2022 increased fraud or other misrepresentation of\nvalue.\n\nThe governments in these countries have sometimes\nreacted to these developments by imposing\nrestrictive policies that adversely affect the\nlocal and regional business environment, such as:\n\n\u2022 price, capital or exchange controls, including\nimposition of punitive transfer and convertibility\nrestrictions or forced currency exchange\n\n\u2022 expropriation or nationalization of assets,\nincluding client assets, or confiscation of\nproperty, including intellectual property, and\n\n\u2022 changes in laws, rules and regulations.\n\nThe impact of these actions could be accentuated in\ntrading markets that are smaller, less liquid and\nmore volatile than more-developed markets. These\ntypes of government actions can negatively affect\nJPMorganChase\u2019s operations in the relevant country,\neither directly or by suppressing the business\nactivities of local clients or multi-national\nclients that conduct business in the jurisdiction.\n\nIn addition, emerging markets countries, as well as\nmore developed countries, have been susceptible to\n      \n  35  \n      \n\u2554\u2550 \u00a7 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u2551  Part I                                                                                                  \u2551\n\u2551                                                                                                          \u2551\n\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\nunfavorable social developments arising from poor\neconomic conditions or governmental actions,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 widespread demonstrations, civil unrest or\ngeneral strikes\n\n\u2022 crime and corruption\n\n\u2022 security and personal safety issues\n\n\u2022 an outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or\nother geopolitical instabilities\n\n\u2022 overthrow of incumbent governments\n\n\u2022 terrorist attacks, and\n\n\u2022 other forms of internal discord.\n\nThese economic, political, regulatory and social\ndevelopments have in the past resulted in, and in\nthe future could lead to, conditions that can\nadversely affect JPMorganChase\u2019s operations in\nthose countries and impair the revenues, growth and\nprofitability of those operations. In addition, any\nof these events or circumstances in one country can\naffect JPMorganChase\u2019s operations and investments\nin another country or countries, including in the\nU.S.\n                                                                                                            \n  People                                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nJPMorganChase\u2019s ability to attract and retain\nqualified employees is critical to its success.\n\nJPMorganChase\u2019s employees are its most important\nresource, and in many areas of the financial\nservices industry, competition for qualified\npersonnel is intense. JPMorganChase endeavors to\nattract talented new employees from a variety of\nbackgrounds and retain, develop and motivate its\nexisting employees. JPMorganChase's efforts to hire\nand retain talented employees could be hindered by\nfactors such as:\n\n\u2022 the emerging need for more-skilled workers in an\nevolving labor and workplace environment, including\ndue to changes in technology\n\n\u2022 targeted recruitment of JPMorganChase employees\nby competitors, and\n\n\u2022 modifications to or discontinuation of\nJPMorganChase's hybrid work models.\n\nJPMorganChase's performance and competitive\nposition could be materially and adversely affected\nif it is unable to attract or retain qualified\nemployees for its workforce or to devise and\nexecute effective succession planning for key\nleadership roles, such as the Chief Executive\nOfficer, members of the Operating Committee and\nother senior leaders.\n\nIn addition, advances in technology, such as\nautomation and artificial intelligence, may lead to\nworkforce displacement. This could require\nJPMorganChase to invest in additional employee\ntraining, manage impacts on morale and retention,\nand compete for employment candidates who possess\nmore advanced technological skills, all of which\ncould\n\nhave a negative impact on JPMorganChase's business\nand operations.\n\nUnfavorable changes in immigration or travel\npolicies could adversely affect JPMorganChase\u2019s\nbusinesses and operations.\n\nJPMorganChase relies on the skills, knowledge and\nexpertise of employees located throughout the\nworld. Changes in immigration or travel policies in\nthe U.S. and other countries that unduly restrict\nor otherwise make it more difficult for employees\nor their family members to work in, or travel to or\ntransfer between, jurisdictions in which\nJPMorganChase has operations or conducts its\nbusiness could inhibit JPMorganChase\u2019s ability to\nattract and retain qualified employees, and thereby\ndilute the quality of its workforce, or could\nprompt JPMorganChase to make structural changes to\nits worldwide or regional operating models that\ncause its operations to be less efficient or more\ncostly.\n                                                                                                            \n  Legal                                                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \nJPMorganChase faces significant legal risks from\nlitigation and formal and informal regulatory and\ngovernment investigations.\n\nJPMorganChase is named as a defendant or is\notherwise involved in many legal proceedings,\nincluding class actions, derivative actions and\nother litigation or disputes with third parties, as\nwell as criminal proceedings. Actions currently\npending against JPMorganChase may result in\njudgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other\nsanctions adverse to JPMorganChase. Any of these\nmatters could materially and adversely affect\nJPMorganChase\u2019s business, financial condition or\nresults of operations, or cause serious\nreputational harm. As a participant in the\nfinancial services industry, it is likely that\nJPMorganChase will continue to experience a high\nlevel of litigation and regulatory and government\ninvestigations related to its businesses and\noperations.\n\nRegulators and other government agencies conduct\nexaminations of JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries\nboth on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and\nJPMorganChase\u2019s businesses and operations are\nsubject to heightened regulatory oversight. This\nheightened regulatory scrutiny, or the results of\nsuch an investigation or examination, may lead to\nadditional regulatory investigations or enforcement\nactions. There is no assurance that those actions\nwill not result in resolutions or other enforcement\nactions against JPMorganChase. Furthermore, a\nsingle event involving a potential violation of law\nor regulation may give rise to numerous and\noverlapping investigations and proceedings, either\nby multiple federal, state or local agencies and\nofficials in the U.S. or, in some instances,\nregulators and other governmental officials in\nnon-U.S. jurisdictions.\n      \n  36  \n      \nIn addition, if another financial institution\nviolates a law or regulation relating to a\nparticular business activity or practice, this will\noften give rise to an investigation by regulators\nand other governmental agencies of the same or\nsimilar activity or practice by JPMorganChase.\n\nJPMorganChase could become subject to a significant\nregulatory investigation and be unable to disclose\nspecific information concerning that investigation\nto the public if such a disclosure would violate\nJPMorganChase\u2019s obligations under applicable rules\nand regulations to maintain the confidentiality of\nconfidential supervisory information, even if the\nresolution of that investigation could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on JPMorganChase\u2019s\nbusiness, operations, results or financial\ncondition.\n\nRegulatory investigations, examinations or other\ninitiatives by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental\nauthorities may subject JPMorganChase to judgments,\nsettlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions,\nand may require JPMorganChase to restructure its\noperations and activities or to cease offering\ncertain products or services. All of these\npotential outcomes could harm JPMorganChase\u2019s\nreputation or lead to higher operational costs,\nthereby reducing JPMorganChase\u2019s profitability, or\nresult in collateral consequences. In addition, the\nextent of JPMorganChase\u2019s exposure to legal and\nregulatory matters can be unpredictable and could,\nin some cases, exceed the amount of reserves that\nJPMorganChase has established for those matters.\n      \n  37  \n      \n                                                                                                            \n  Parts I and II                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                                                                                          \u2502\n\u2502  Item 1B.

Refer to Notes 6 and 34 for additional information. 2024 compared with 2023 Investment\nbanking fees increased, reflecting in CIB the benefit of favorable market conditions, which resulted in: \u2022\nhigher debt underwriting fees predominantly driven by higher industry-wide issuances in leveraged loans, and\nin high-grade and high-yield bonds, \u2022 higher equity underwriting fees driven by higher industry-wide fees\nand wallet share gains in IPOs, and in follow-on and convertible securities offerings, and \u2022 higher advisory\nfees driven by higher industry-wide mergers and acquisitions (\u201cM&A\u201d) activity and wallet share gains.\n\nRefer to CIB segment results on pages 77\u201383 and Note 6 for additional information. Principal transactions\nrevenue increased driven by CIB, reflecting: \u2022 higher Equity Markets revenue in Prime Finance and Equity\nDerivatives, predominantly offset by \u2022 lower Fixed Income Markets revenue, reflecting the net impact of\ndeclines in revenue across macro businesses and higher revenue in Securitized Products. Principal\ntransactions revenue in CIB generally has offsets across other revenue lines, including net interest income.\nThe Firm assesses the performance of its Markets business on a total net revenue basis. The increase in CIB\nwas partially offset by a net decrease in Corporate, reflecting lower revenue in Treasury and CIO, and gains\ncompared with a net loss on certain legacy private equity investments in the prior year. Refer to CIB\nsegment and Corporate results on pages 77\u201383 and pages 88\u201390, respectively, and Note 6 for additional\ninformation. Lending- and deposit-related fees increased, reflecting, in CIB, higher deposit-related fees,\nincluding cash management fees in Payments, on higher volume; and higher lending-related fees, including\nloan commitment fees. These factors were largely offset by a decline in the amortization of the fair value\ndiscount on certain acquired lending-related commitments associated with First Republic, primarily in AWM,\nas certain of the commitments have expired. Refer to CIB and AWM segment results on pages 77\u201383 and pages\n84\u201387, respectively, and Note 6 for additional information.

Refer to\nCorporate results on pages 88\u201390 and Note 10 for\nadditional information.\n\nMortgage fees and related income increased in Home\nLending, reflecting higher production revenue,\nwhich included the timing impact of First Republic.\nRefer to CCB segment results on pages 73\u201376, and\nNote 6 and 15 for additional information.\n\nCard income increased, reflecting higher net\ninterchange on increased debit and credit card\nsales volume, as well as higher annual fees in CCB,\npartially offset by an increase in amortization\nrelated to new account origination costs. Refer to\nCCB segment results on pages 73\u201376 and Note 6 for\nadditional information.\n\nOther income increased, reflecting:\n\n\u2022 in Corporate:\n\n\u2013 the $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares\nrecorded in the second quarter of 2024,\n\npartially offset by\n\n\u2013 the absence of the prior-year $2.8 billion\nestimated bargain purchase gain associated with the\nFirst Republic acquisition, and\n\n\u2022 in CIB:\n\n\u2013 the impact of the adoption of updates to the\nAccounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures\nguidance effective January 1, 2024, resulting in\nthe amortization of certain of the Firm's\nalternative energy tax-oriented investments\npreviously recognized in other income which is now\nrecognized in income tax expense.\n\nBoth periods included impairment losses related to\ncertain equity investments.\n\nThe prior year included a gain of $339 million on\nthe original minority interest in China\nInternational Fund Management (\"CIFM\"), partially\noffset by net investment valuation losses, both in\nAWM.\n\nRefer to AWM segment results on pages 84\u201387 for\nadditional information on CIFM; Notes 1, 6, 14 and\n25 for additional information on the adoption of\nupdates to the Accounting for Investments in Tax\nCredit Structures guidance; Notes 2 and 6 for\nadditional information on Visa shares; and Notes 6\nand 34 for additional information on the First\nRepublic acquisition.\n\nNet interest income increased driven by the impact\nof balance sheet actions, primarily reinvestments\nin the investment securities portfolio, higher\nrevolving balances in Card Services, the timing\nimpact of First Republic, higher wholesale deposit\nbalances and higher Markets net interest income.\nThese factors were largely offset by deposit margin\ncompression across the lines of business and lower\naverage deposit balances in CCB.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s average interest-earning assets were\n$3.5 trillion, up $212 billion, and the yield was\n5.50%, up 36 bps. The net yield on these assets, on\nan FTE basis, was 2.63%, a decrease of 7 bps.

Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional\ninformation.\n\nInvestment securities increased due to:\n\n\u2022 higher available-for-sale (\"AFS\") securities,\nreflecting net purchases, primarily U.S. Treasuries\nand non-U.S. government debt securities, partially\noffset by maturities and paydowns, and\n\n\u2022 lower held to-maturity (\u201cHTM\u201d) securities driven\nby maturities and paydowns.\n\nRefer to Corporate results on pages 88\u201390,\n\nInvestment Portfolio Risk Management on page 140,\nand Notes 2 and 10 for additional information.\n\nLoans increased, reflecting:\n\n\u2022 higher outstanding balances in Card Services\ndriven by growth in new accounts and normalization\nof revolving balances,\n\n\u2022 higher wholesale loans in CIB, and\n\n\u2022 higher securities-based lending in AWM due to\nhigher client demand,\n\npartially offset by\n\n\u2022 a decline in Home Lending as paydowns and loan\nsales outpaced originations.\n\nThe allowance for loan losses increased, reflecting\na net addition to the allowance for loan losses of\n$1.9 billion, consisting of:\n\n\u2022 $2.1 billion net addition in consumer , primarily\nin Card Services, predominantly driven by loan\ngrowth, reflecting higher revolving balances,\nincluding the seasoning of vintages originated in\nrecent years, partially offset by a net reduction\nin Home Lending in the first quarter of 2024, and\n\n\u2022 a net reduction of $176 million in wholesale ,\nreflecting:\n\n\u2013 changes in certain macroeconomic variables, an\nupdate to loss assumptions on certain loans in\n                                             \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    63  \n                                             \nMarkets, and a reduction due to charge-offs largely\nfrom collateral-dependent loans,\n\npredominantly offset by\n\n\u2013 net downgrade activity, primarily in Real Estate,\nand the impact of incorporating the First Republic\nportfolio into the Firm\u2019s modeled credit loss\nestimates in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nThere was also a $128 million net addition to the\nallowance for lending-related commitments\nrecognized in other liabilities on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets.\n\nRefer to Consolidated Results of Operations and\nCredit and Investment Risk Management on pages\n59\u201362 and pages 117\u2013140, respectively, Critical\nAccounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages\n161\u2013164, and Notes 2, 3, 12 and 13 for additional\ninformation on loans and the total allowance for\ncredit losses.\n\nAccrued interest and accounts receivable decreased\nprimarily driven by lower receivables in Payments\nrelated to the timing of processing payment\nactivities, due to December 31, 2023 falling on a\nweekend, as well as lower client receivables\nrelated to client-driven activities in Markets .\n\nPremises and equipment increased primarily as a\nresult of the construction-in-process associated\nwith the Firm's headquarters, and purchases of\nproperties. Refer to Notes 16 and 18 for additional\ninformation.\n\nGoodwill, MSRs and other intangibles : Refer to\nNote 15 for additional information.\n\nOther assets increased primarily due to higher cash\ncollateral placed with central counterparties\n(\"CCP\") in Markets, the impact of the adoption of\nupdates to the Accounting for Investments in Tax\nCredit Structures guidance effective January 1,\n2024, and higher auto operating lease assets in\nCCB.

These assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the normal course of\nbusiness due to the amount and timing of cash flows, which are affected by client-driven and risk management\nactivities and market conditions. The Firm believes that cash flows from operations, available cash and\nother liquidity sources, and its capacity to generate cash through secured and unsecured sources, are\nsufficient to meet its operating liquidity needs. \u2022 In 2024, cash used resulted from higher trading assets\nand higher securities borrowed, largely offset by net income. \u2022 In 2023, cash provided primarily reflected\nnet income, lower other assets, and accrued interest and accounts receivable, predominantly offset by higher\ntrading assets, lower accounts payable and other liabilities, and higher securities borrowed.\n\nInvesting activities The Firm\u2019s investing activities predominantly include originating held-for-investment\nloans, investing in the investment securities portfolio and other short-term instruments. \u2022 In 2024, cash\nused resulted from net purchases of investment securities, net loan originations and higher securities\npurchased under resale agreements, partially offset by proceeds from sales and securitizations of loans\nheld-for-investment. \u2022 In 2023, cash provided resulted from net proceeds from investment securities,\nproceeds from sales and securitizations of loans held-for-investment, and lower securities purchased under\nresale agreements, largely offset by net originations of loans and net cash used in the First Republic Bank\nacquisition. Financing activities The Firm\u2019s financing activities include acquiring customer deposits and\nissuing long-term debt and preferred stock. \u2022 In 2024, cash provided primarily reflected higher securities\nloaned or sold under repurchase agreements and net proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings, partially\noffset by net redemption of preferred stock. \u2022 In 2023, cash used reflected lower deposits, which included\nthe impact of the repayment of the deposits provided to First Republic Bank by the consortium of large U.S.\nbanks that the Firm assumed as part of the First Republic acquisition, partially offset by higher securities\nloaned under repurchase agreements and net proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings. \u2022 For both\nperiods, cash was used for repurchases of common stock and cash dividends on common and preferred stock. * *\n* Refer to Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 63\u201365, Capital Risk Management on pages 97\u2013107, and\nLiquidity Risk Management on pages 108\u2013115, and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows on page 176 for a\nfurther discussion of the activities affecting the Firm\u2019s cash flows.\n                                             \n  66    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                             \n                                                    \n  EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM\u2019S USE  \n  OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES                    \n                                                    \n                                                                                                            \n  Non-GAAP financial measures                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial\nStatements in accordance with U.S. GAAP; these\nfinancial statements appear on pages 172\u2013176.

The Firm\u2019s definition of\nmanaged basis starts, in each case, with the\nreported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain\nreclassifications to present total net revenue for\nthe Firm as a whole, and for each of the reportable\nbusiness segments and Corporate, on an FTE basis.\nAccordingly, revenue from investments that receive\ntax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented\nin the managed results on a basis comparable to\ntaxable investments and securities. These financial\nmeasures\n\nallow management to assess the comparability of\nrevenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable\nand tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income\ntax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded\nwithin income tax expense. These adjustments have\nno impact on net income as reported by the Firm as\na whole or by each of the lines of business and\nCorporate.\n\nManagement also uses certain non-GAAP financial\nmeasures at the Firm and business-segment levels\nbecause these other non-GAAP financial measures\nprovide information to investors about the\nunderlying operational performance and trends of\nthe Firm or of the particular business segment, as\nthe case may be, and therefore facilitate a\ncomparison of the Firm or the business segment with\nthe performance of its relevant competitors. Refer\nto Business Segment & Corporate Results on pages\n70\u201390 for additional information on these non-GAAP\nmeasures. Non-GAAP financial measures used by the\nFirm may not be comparable to similarly named non-\nGAAP financial measures used by other companies.\n\nThe following summary table provides a\nreconciliation from the Firm\u2019s reported U.S. GAAP\nresults to managed basis.\n                                                                                                            \n                         \u2026                                   \u2026                               F\u2026             \n         \u2026               \u2026               \u2026        \u2026          \u2026            M\u2026                 t\u2026       \u2026     \n         \u2026               \u2026               \u2026        \u2026          \u2026    \u2026       b\u2026        \u2026        a\u2026       \u2026     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026       \u2026    $  \u2026       \u2026    $  \u2026     $  \u2026       $  \u2026         $  9\u2026     $  \u2026     $  3\u2026    $  \u2026     \n         \u2026               \u2026               \u2026        \u2026          \u2026            7\u2026        \u2026        3\u2026       \u2026     \n         \u2026               \u2026               \u2026        \u2026          \u2026            8\u2026        \u2026        4\u2026       \u2026     \n         \u2026               \u2026               \u2026        \u2026          \u2026            1\u2026        \u2026        3\u2026       \u2026     \n         \u2026                  \u2026            \u2026        \u2026          \u2026            8\u2026        \u2026        NA       \u2026     \n         \u2026               \u2026               \u2026        \u2026          \u2026            7\u2026        \u2026        3\u2026       \u2026     \n         \u2026                  \u2026            \u2026        \u2026          \u2026            9\u2026        \u2026        NA       \u2026     \n         \u2026               \u2026               \u2026        \u2026          \u2026            6\u2026        \u2026        3\u2026       \u2026     \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026        \u2026          \u2026            1\u2026        \u2026        3\u2026       \u2026     \n      $  \u2026                  \u2026         $  \u2026     $  \u2026          \u2026         $  4\u2026     $  \u2026        NA    $  \u2026     \n         \u2026  %               \u2026            \u2026  %     \u2026  %       \u2026            54  %     \u2026  %     NM       \u2026  %  \n                                                                                                            \n(a) Effective January 1, 2024, the Firm adopted updates to the Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit\nStructures guidance, under the modified retrospective method.

\nThe Firm is managed on an LOB basis. Effective in the second quarter of 2024, the Firm reorganized its\nreportable business segments by combining the former Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking\nbusiness segments to form one reportable segment, the Commercial & Investment Bank (\u201cCIB\u201d). As a result of\nthe reorganization, the Firm has three reportable business segments \u2013 Consumer & Community Banking,\nCommercial & Investment Bank, and Asset & Wealth Management \u2013 with the remaining activities in Corporate.\n\nThe business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer\nserved, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Firm\u2019s Operating\nCommittee, whose members act collectively as the Firm\u2019s chief operating decision maker. Segment results are\npresented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm\u2019s use of Non-GAAP\nFinancial Measures, on pages 67\u201369 for a definition of managed basis.\n\nThe following table depicts the Firm\u2019s reportable business segments.\n                                                                                                            \n   Description of business segment reporting methodology                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nResults of the reportable business segments are\nintended to present each segment as if it were a\nstand-alone business. The management reporting\nprocess that derives business segment results\nincludes the allocation of certain income and\nexpense items. The Firm periodically assesses the\nassumptions, methodologies and reporting\nclassifications used for segment reporting, and\ntherefore further refinements may be implemented in\nfuture periods. The Firm also assesses the level of\ncapital required for each LOB on at least an annual\nbasis. The Firm\u2019s LOBs also provide various\nbusiness metrics which are utilized by the Firm and\nits investors and analysts in assessing\nperformance.\n\nRevenue sharing\n\nWhen business segments or businesses within each\nsegment join efforts to sell products and services\nto the Firm\u2019s clients and customers, the\nparticipating businesses may agree to share revenue\nfrom those transactions. Revenue is generally\nrecognized in the segment responsible for the\nrelated product or service, with allocations to the\nother segments or businesses involved in the\ntransaction. The segment and business results\nreflect these revenue-sharing agreements.\n                                             \n  70    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                             \nExpense allocation\n\nWhere business segments use services provided by\nCorporate support units, or another business\nsegment, the costs of those services are allocated\nto the respective business segments. The expense is\ngenerally allocated based on the actual cost and\nuse of services provided. In contrast, certain\ncosts and investments related to Corporate that are\nnot currently utilized by any LOB are not allocated\nto the business segments and are retained in\nCorporate. Expense retained in Corporate generally\nincludes costs that would not be incurred if the\nsegments were stand-alone businesses, and other\nitems not solely aligned with a particular\nreportable business segment.\n\nFunds transfer pricing\n\nFunds transfer pricing (\u201cFTP\u201d) is the process by\nwhich the Firm allocates interest income and\nexpense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and\ntransfers the primary interest rate risk and\nliquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.\n\nThe funds transfer pricing process considers the\ninterest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of\nassets and liabilities and off-balance sheet\nproducts. Periodically, the methodology and\nassumptions utilized in the FTP process are\nadjusted to reflect economic conditions and other\nfactors, which may impact the allocation of net\ninterest income to the segments. Effective in the\nfourth quarter of 2024, the Firm updated its FTP\nwith respect to consumer deposits, which resulted\nin an increase in the funding benefit reflected\nwithin CCB\u2019s net interest income that is fully\noffset in Corporate, with no effect on the Firm\u2019s\nnet interest income.\n\nAs a result of higher average interest rates, the\ncost of funds for assets and the FTP benefit earned\nfor liabilities have generally increased in the\ncurrent year, impacting the net interest income of\nthe business segments. During the period ended\nDecember 31, 2024, this has resulted in a higher\ncost of funds for loans and Markets activities. In\naddition, rates paid to deposit holders increased\nmore than the FTP benefit increase during the year,\nresulting in deposit margin compression.\n\nForeign exchange risk\n\nForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs\nand Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain\nrevenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages\nthese risks centrally and reports the impact of\nforeign exchange rate movements related to the\ntransferred risk in its results. Refer to Market\nRisk Management on page 149 for additional\ninformation.\n\nDebt expense and preferred stock dividend\nallocation\n\nAs part of the FTP process, almost all of the cost\nof the credit spread component of outstanding\nunsecured long-term debt and preferred stock\ndividends is allocated to the reportable business\nsegments, while the balance of the cost is retained\nin Corporate. The methodology to allocate the cost\nof unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock\ndividends to the business segments is aligned with\nthe relevant regulatory capital requirements and\nfunding needs of the LOBs, as applicable. The\nallocated cost of unsecured long-term debt is\nincluded in a business segment\u2019s net interest\nincome, and net income is reduced by preferred\nstock dividends, to arrive at a business segment\u2019s\nnet income applicable to common equity. Refer to\nCapital Risk Management on pages 97\u2013107 for\nadditional information.\n\nCapital allocation\n\nThe amount of capital assigned to each LOB and\nCorporate is referred to as equity. The Firm\u2019s\ncurrent equity allocation methodology incorporates\nBasel III Standardized risk-weighted assets (\u201cRWA\u201d)\nand the global systemically important banks\n(\u201cGSIB\u201d) surcharge, both under rules currently in\neffect, as well as a simulation of capital\ndepletion in a severe stress environment. At least\nannually, the assumptions, judgments and\nmethodologies used to allocate capital are\nreassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated\nto the LOBs and Corporate may change. Refer to Line\nof business and Corporate equity on page 104 for\nadditional information on capital allocation.\n                                             \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

17%.\n\nNet revenue was $71.5 billion, up 2%.\n\nNet interest income was $54.9 billion, flat when\ncompared with the prior year, reflecting:\n\n\u2022 lower NII in Banking & Wealth Management (\"BWM\"),\npredominantly driven by deposit margin compression\nand lower average deposits,\n\noffset by\n\n\u2022 higher Card Services NII, predominantly driven by\nhigher revolving balances, and\n\n\u2022 the timing impact of First Republic in Home\nLending.\n\nNoninterest revenue was $16.6 billion, up 10%,\npredominantly driven by:\n\n\u2022 higher asset management fees reflecting higher\naverage market levels, including the timing impact\nof First Republic and, to a lesser extent, net\ninflows, as well as higher commissions from annuity\nsales in BWM,\n\n\u2022 higher card income, driven by higher net\ninterchange reflecting increased debit and credit\ncard sales volume, and higher annual fees,\npartially offset by an increase in amortization\nrelated to new account

Overview on page 54 and Note 34\nfor additional information on First Republic.\n\nNoninterest expense was $38.0 billion, up 9%,\nreflecting First Republic-related expense that was\naligned to CCB from Corporate starting in the third\nquarter of 2023, impacting both compensation and\nnoncompensation expense.\n\nThe increase in expense also reflected:\n\n\u2022 higher compensation expense, largely driven by\nhigher revenue-related compensation predominantly\nfor advisors and bankers, and an increase in the\nnumber of employees, including in technology, and\n\n\u2022 higher noncompensation expense, largely driven by\ncontinued investments in technology and marketing,\nas well as higher operating losses, partially\noffset by lower legal expense.\n\nThe provision for credit losses was $10.0 billion,\nreflecting:\n\n\u2022 net charge-offs of $7.9 billion, up $2.6 billion,\nincluding $2.4 billion in Card Services, reflecting\nthe seasoning of vintages originated in recent\nyears, credit normalization and balance growth, and\n\n\u2022 a $2.0 billion net addition to the allowance for\ncredit losses, consisting of:\n\n\u2013 $2.2 billion in Card Services, predominantly\ndriven by loan growth, reflecting higher revolving\nbalances, including the seasoning of vintages\noriginated in recent years,\n\npartially offset by\n\n\u2013 a $125 million net reduction in Home Lending,\nprimarily due to improvements in the outlook for\nhome prices in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe provision in the prior year was $6.9 billion,\nreflecting net charge-offs of $5.3 billion, a $1.2\nbillion net addition to the allowance for credit\nlosses, predominantly driven by Card Services, and\na $408 million net addition to the allowance for\ncredit losses to establish the allowance

losses, driven by\n\n\u2013 net downgrade activity, primarily in Real Estate,\nand the impact of incorporating the First Republic\nportfolio into the Firm's modeled credit loss\nestimates in the second quarter of 2024,\n\npredominantly offset by\n\n\u2013 changes in certain macroeconomic variables, an\nupdate to loss assumptions on certain loans in\nMarkets, and a reduction due to

Markets\nincludes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity\nMarkets. Markets revenue consists of principal\ntransactions, fees, commissions and other income,\nas well as net interest income. The Firm assesses\nits Markets business performance on a total revenue\nbasis, as offsets generally occur across revenue\nline items. For example, securities that generate\nnet interest income may be risk-managed by\nderivatives that are reflected at fair value in\nprincipal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 6\nand 7 for a description of the composition of these\nincome statement line items.\n\nPrincipal transactions reflects revenue on\nfinancial instruments and commodities transactions\nthat arise from client-driven market-making\nactivity. Principal transactions revenue includes\namounts recognized upon executing new transactions\nwith market participants, as well as \u201cinventory-\nrelated revenue,\u201d which is revenue recognized from\ngains and losses on derivatives and other\ninstruments that the Firm has been holding in\nanticipation of, or in response to, client demand,\nand changes in the fair value of instruments\n\nused by the Firm to actively manage the risk\nexposure arising from such inventory. Principal\ntransactions revenue recognized upon executing new\ntransactions with market participants is affected\nby many factors including the level of client\nactivity, the bid-offer spread (which is the\ndifference between the price at which a market\nparticipant is willing and able to sell an\ninstrument to the Firm and the price at which\nanother market participant is willing and able to\nbuy it from the Firm, and vice versa), market\nliquidity and volatility. These factors are\ninterrelated and sensitive to the same factors that\ndrive inventory-related revenue, which include\ngeneral market conditions, such as interest rates,\nforeign exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity\nand commodity prices, as well as other\nmacroeconomic conditions.\n                                             \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    81  \n

Loss days represent the number of days for\nwhich Markets recorded losses in total net revenue, which includes revenue related to both trading and non-\ntrading positions. The loss days determined under this measure differ from the measure used to determine\nbacktesting gains and losses. Daily backtesting gains and losses include positions in the Firm\u2019s Risk\nManagement value-at-risk (\"VaR\") measure and exclude certain components of total net revenue, which may more\nthan offset backtesting gains or losses on a particular day. For more information on daily backtesting gains\nand losses, refer to the VaR discussion on pages 143\u2013145.\n\n(c) In the fourth quarter of 2024, certain net funding costs that were previously allocated to Fixed Income\nMarkets were reclassified to Equity Markets. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the\ncurrent presentation.\n                                                                                                           \n

When the Firm extends a\nconsumer or wholesale loan, advises customers and\nclients on their investment decisions, makes\nmarkets in securities, or offers other products or\nservices, the Firm takes on some degree of risk.\nThe Firm\u2019s overall objective is to manage its\nbusiness, and the associated risks, in a manner\nthat balances serving the interests of its clients,\ncustomers and investors, and protecting the safety\nand soundness of the Firm.\n\nThe Firm believes that effective risk management\nrequires, among other things:\n\n\u2022 Acceptance of responsibility, including\nidentification and escalation of risks by all\nindividuals within the Firm;\n\n\u2022 Ownership of risk identification, assessment,\ndata and management within each of the LOBs and\nCorporate; and\n\n\u2022 A Firmwide risk governance and oversight\nstructure.\n\nThe Firm follows a disciplined and balanced\ncompensation framework with strong internal\ngovernance and independent oversight by the Board\nof Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d). The impact of risk and\ncontrol issues is carefully considered in the\nFirm\u2019s performance evaluation and incentive\ncompensation processes.\n                                                                                                            \n  Risk governance framework                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm\u2019s risk governance framework involves\nunderstanding drivers of risks, types of risks and\nimpacts of risks.\n\nDrivers of risks are factors that cause a risk to\nexist. Drivers of risks include the economic\nenvironment, regulatory or government policy,\ncompetitor or market evolution, business decisions,\nprocess or judgment error, deliberate wrongdoing,\ndysfunctional markets and natural disasters.\n\nTypes of risks are categories by which risks\nmanifest themselves. The Firm\u2019s risks are generally\ncategorized in the following four risk types:\n\n\u2022 Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital,\nliquidity or reputation associated with poorly-\ndesigned or failed business plans or an inadequate\nresponse to changes in the operating environment.\n\n\u2022 Credit and investment risk is the risk associated\nwith the default or change in credit profile of a\nclient, counterparty or customer; or loss of\nprincipal or a reduction in expected returns on\ninvestments, including consumer credit risk,\nwholesale credit risk and investment portfolio\nrisk.\n\n\u2022 Market risk is the risk associated with the\neffect of changes in market factors, such as\ninterest and foreign exchange rates, equity and\ncommodity prices, credit spreads or implied\nvolatilities, on the value of assets and\nliabilities held for both the short and long term.\n\n\u2022 Operational risk is the risk of an adverse\noutcome resulting from inadequate or failed\ninternal processes or systems; human factors; or\nexternal events impacting the Firm\u2019s processes or\nsystems. Operational risk includes cybersecurity,\ncompliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and\nmodel risk.\n\nImpacts of risks are consequences of risks, both\nquantitative and qualitative. There may be many\nconsequences when risks manifest themselves,\nincluding quantitative impacts such as a reduction\nin earnings and capital, liquidity outflows, and\nfines or penalties, or qualitative impacts such as\ndamage to the Firm\u2019s reputation, loss of clients\nand customers, and regulatory and enforcement\nactions.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s risk governance framework is managed on\na Firmwide basis. The Firm has an Independent Risk\nManagement (\u201cIRM\u201d) function, which is comprised of\nRisk Management and Compliance. The Firm\u2019s Chief\nExecutive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) appoints, subject to\napproval by the Risk Committee of the Board of\nDirectors (the \u201cBoard Risk Committee\u201d), the Firm\u2019s\nChief Risk Officer (\u201cCRO\u201d) to lead the IRM function\nand maintain the risk governance framework of the\nFirm. The framework is subject to approval by the\nBoard Risk Committee through its review and\napproval of the Risk Governance and Oversight\nPolicy.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s CRO oversees and delegates authority to\nthe Firmwide Risk Executives (\u201cFREs\u201d), the Chief\nRisk Officers of the LOBs and Corporate (\u201cLOB\nCROs\u201d), and the Firm\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer\n(\u201cCCO\u201d), who, in turn, establish Risk Management\nand Compliance organizations, develop the Firm\u2019s\nrisk governance policies and standards, and define\nand oversee the implementation of the Firm\u2019s risk\ngovernance framework. The LOB CROs oversee risks\nthat arise in their LOBs and Corporate, while FREs\noversee risks that span across the LOBs and\nCorporate, as well as functions and regions. Each\narea of the Firm that gives rise to risk is\nexpected to operate within the parameters\nidentified by the IRM function, and within the risk\nand control standards established by its own\nmanagement.\n                                             \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    91  \n                                             \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Three lines of defense                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm\u2019s \u201cthree lines of defense\u201d are as follows:\n\nThe first line of defense consists of each LOB,\nTreasury and CIO, and certain Other Corporate\ninitiatives, including their aligned Operations,\nTechnology and Control Management. The first line\nof defense owns the risks, and identification of\nrisks, associated with their respective activities\nand the design and execution of controls to manage\nthose risks. Responsibilities also include\nadherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations\nand implementation of the risk governance framework\nestablished by IRM, which may include policies,\nstandards, limits, thresholds and controls.\n\nThe second line of defense is the IRM function,\nwhich is separate from the first line of defense\nand is responsible for independently measuring\nrisk, as well as assessing and challenging the risk\nmanagement activities of the first line of defense.\nIRM is also responsible for the identification of\nrisks within its organization, its own adherence to\napplicable laws, rules and regulations and for the\ndevelopment and implementation of policies and\nstandards with respect to its own processes.\n\nThe third line of defense is Internal Audit, an\nindependent function that provides objective\nassessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of\nFirmwide processes, controls, governance and risk\nmanagement. The Internal Audit function is led by\nthe General Auditor, who reports to the Audit\nCommittee and administratively to the CEO.\n\nIn addition, there are other functions that\ncontribute to the Firmwide control environment but\nare not considered part of a particular line of\ndefense, including Corporate Finance, Human\nResources and Legal. These other functions are\nresponsible for the identification of risks within\ntheir respective organizations, adherence to\napplicable laws, rules and regulations and\nimplementation of the risk governance framework\nestablished by IRM.\n                                                                                                            \n  Risk identification and ownership                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the\nidentification of risks within their respective\norganizations, as well as the design and execution\nof controls, including IRM-specified controls, to\nmanage those risks. To support this activity, the\nFirm has a risk identification framework designed\nto facilitate the responsibility of each LOB and\nCorporate to identify material risks inherent to\nthe Firm\u2019s businesses and operational activities,\ncatalog them in a central repository and review\nmaterial risks on a regular basis. The IRM function\nreviews and challenges the risks identified by each\nLOB and Corporate, maintains the central repository\nand provides the consolidated Firmwide results to\nthe Firmwide Risk Committee (\u201cFRC\u201d) and the Board\nRisk Committee.\n                                                                                                            \n  Risk appetite                                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm\u2019s overall appetite for risk is governed by\nRisk Appetite frameworks for quantitative and\nqualitative risks.

In addition to CCAR and other periodic\nstress testing, management also considers tailored\nstress scenarios and sensitivity analyses, as\nnecessary.\n                                                                                                            \n  Contingency Capital Plan                                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm\u2019s Contingency Capital Plan establishes the\ncapital management framework for the Firm and\nspecifies the principles underlying the Firm\u2019s\napproach towards capital management in normal\neconomic conditions and in stressed environments.\nThe Contingency Capital Plan defines how the Firm\ncalibrates its targeted capital levels and meets\nminimum capital requirements, monitors the ongoing\nappropriateness of planned capital distributions,\nand sets out the capital contingency actions that\nare expected to be taken or considered at various\nlevels of capital depletion during a period of\nstress.\n                                                                                                            \n  Regulatory capital                                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \nThe Federal Reserve establishes capital\nrequirements, including well-capitalized standards,\nfor the Firm as a consolidated financial holding\ncompany. The Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency (\"OCC\") establishes similar minimum\ncapital requirements and standards for the Firm\u2019s\nprincipal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nThe U.S. capital requirements generally follow the\nCapital Accord of the Basel Committee, as amended\nfrom time to time.\n\nBasel III Overview\n\nThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum\ncapital ratios and overall capital adequacy\nstandards for large and internationally active U.S.\nBHCs and banks, including the Firm and JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of regulatory\ncapital that must be held by BHCs and banks is\ndetermined by calculating RWA, which are on-balance\nsheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures,\nweighted according to risk. Under the rules\ncurrently in effect, two comprehensive approaches\nare prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized\napproach (\u201cBasel III Standardized\u201d), and an\nadvanced approach (\u201cBasel III Advanced\u201d).\n\nFor each of these risk-based capital ratios, the\ncapital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against\nthe lower of the Standardized or Advanced\napproaches compared to their respective regulatory\ncapital ratio requirements.\n\nThe current Basel III rules establish capital\nrequirements for calculating credit risk RWA and\nmarket risk RWA, and in the case of Basel III\nAdvanced, operational risk RWA. Key differences in\nthe calculation of credit risk RWA between the\nStandardized and Advanced approaches are that for\nBasel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on\nrisk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the\nuse of internal credit models and parameters,\nwhereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA\nis generally based on supervisory risk-weightings\nwhich vary primarily by counterparty type and asset\nclass. Market risk RWA is generally calculated\nconsistently between Basel III Standardized and\nBasel III Advanced. In addition to the RWA\ncalculated under these approaches, the Firm may\nsupplement such amounts to incorporate management\njudgment and feedback from its regulators.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Firm\u2019s Basel III\nStandardized ratios risk-based ratios were more\nbinding than the Basel III Advanced risk-based\nratios.\n\nAdditionally, Basel III requires that Advanced\nApproaches banking organizations, including the\nFirm, calculate their SLRs.\n\nRefer to page 104 for additional information on\nSLR.\n                                             \n  98    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                             \nKey Regulatory Developments\n\nU.S. Basel III Finalization\n\nIn July 2023, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the\nFDIC released a proposal to amend the risk-based\ncapital framework, entitled \"Regulatory capital\nrule: Amendments applicable to large banking\norganizations and to banking organizations with\nsignificant trading activity\", which is referred to\nin this Form 10-K as the \"U.S. Basel III proposal\".\nUnder this proposal, changes to the framework would\ninclude replacement of the Advanced approach with\nan expanded risk-based approach for the calculation\nof RWA. In addition, the stress capital buffer\nrequirement would be applicable to both the\nexpanded risk-based approach and the Standardized\napproach.\n\nGSIB Surcharge and TLAC and Eligible LTD\nRequirements\n\nIn July 2023, the Federal Reserve released a\nproposal to amend the calculation of the GSIB\nsurcharge. Under the proposal, the annual GSIB\nsurcharge would be based on an average of the\nquarterly surcharge calculations throughout the\ncalendar year, with daily averaging required for\ncertain measures. The proposal would also reduce\nsurcharge increments from 50 bps to 10 bps and\nincludes other technical amendments to the \u201cMethod\n2\u201d calculation. The proposed changes would revise\nrisk-based capital requirements for the Firm and\nother U.S. GSIBs. Refer to Risk-based Capital\nRegulatory Requirements on page 100 for further\ninformation on the GSIB surcharge.\n\nAdditionally, in August 2023, the Federal Reserve,\nthe FDIC and the OCC released a proposal to expand\nthe eligible long-term debt (\"eligible LTD\") and\nclean holding company requirements under the\nexisting total loss-absorbing capacity (\"TLAC\")\nrule to apply to non-GSIB banks with $100 billion\nor more in total consolidated assets. The proposal\nwould also reduce the amount of LTD with remaining\nmaturities of less than two years that count\ntowards a U.S. GSIB's TLAC requirement and expand\nthe existing capital deduction framework for LTD\nissued by GSIBs to include LTD issued by non-GSIB\nbanks subject to the LTD requirements.\n\nFinalization of the above proposals, including the\nrequired implementation dates, is uncertain. The\nFirm continues to monitor developments and\npotential impacts.\n                                             \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    99  \n                                             \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nRisk-based Capital Regulatory Requirements\n\nThe following chart presents the Firm\u2019s Basel III\nCET1 capital ratio requirements under the Basel III\nrules currently in effect.\n\nAll banking institutions are currently required to\nhave a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-\nweighted assets. Certain banking organizations,\nincluding the Firm, are required to hold additional\nlevels of capital to serve as a \u201ccapital\nconservation buffer\u201d. The capital conservation\nbuffer incorporates a GSIB surcharge, a\ndiscretionary countercyclical capital buffer and a\nfixed capital conservation buffer of 2.5% for\nAdvanced regulatory capital requirements, as well\nas a variable SCB requirement, floored at 2.5%, for\nStandardized regulatory capital requirements. Under\nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s GSIB rule, the Firm is\nrequired to assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual\nbasis under two separately prescribed methods based\non data for the previous fiscal year-end, and is\nsubject to the higher of the two. \u201cMethod 1\u201d\nreflects the GSIB surcharge as prescribed by the\nBasel Committee\u2019s assessment methodology, and is\ncalculated across five criteria: size, cross-\njurisdictional activity, interconnectedness,\ncomplexity and substitutability. \u201cMethod 2\u201d\nmodifies the Method 1 requirements to include a\nmeasure of short-term wholesale funding in place of\nsubstitutability, and introduces a GSIB score\n\u201cmultiplication factor\u201d. The following table\npresents the Firm\u2019s effective GSIB surcharge for\nthe years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. For\n2025, the Firm\u2019s effective regulatory minimum GSIB\nsurcharge calculated under both\n\nMethod 1 and Method 2 remains unchanged at 2.5% and\n4.5%, respectively.\n                                      \n                   2024         2023  \n  Method 1    2.5     %    2.5     %  \n  Method 2    4.5     %    4.0     %  \n                                      \nThe U.S. federal regulatory capital standards\ninclude a framework for setting a discretionary\ncountercyclical capital buffer taking into account\nthe macro financial environment in which large,\ninternationally active banks function. As of\nDecember 31, 2024, the U.S. countercyclical capital\nbuffer remained at 0%. The Federal Reserve will\ncontinue to review the buffer at least annually.\nThe buffer can be increased if the Federal Reserve,\nthe FDIC and the OCC determine that systemic risks\nare meaningfully above normal and can be calibrated\nup to an additional 2.5% of RWA subject to a\n12-month implementation period. Failure to maintain\nregulatory capital equal to or in excess of the\nrisk-based regulatory capital minimum plus the\ncapital conservation buffer (inclusive of the GSIB\nsurcharge) and any countercyclical buffer will\nresult in limitations to the amount of capital that\nthe Firm may distribute, such as through dividends\nand common share repurchases, as well as on\ndiscretionary bonus payments for certain executive\nofficers.\n                                              \n  100    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nTotal Loss-Absorbing Capacity\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s TLAC rule requires the U.S.\nGSIB top-tier holding companies, including the\nFirm, to maintain minimum levels of external TLAC\nand eligible LTD. Refer to TLAC on page 106 for\nadditional information.\n\nLeverage-based Capital Regulatory Requirements\n\nSupplementary leverage ratio\n\nBanking organizations subject to the Basel III\nAdvanced approach are currently required to have a\nminimum SLR of 3.0%. Certain banking organizations,\nincluding the Firm, are also required to hold an\nadditional 2.0% leverage buffer. The SLR is defined\nas Tier 1 capital under Basel III divided by the\nFirm\u2019s total leverage exposure. Total leverage\nexposure is calculated by taking the Firm\u2019s total\naverage on-balance sheet assets, less amounts\npermitted to be deducted for Tier 1 capital, and\nadding certain off-balance sheet exposures, as\ndefined in regulatory capital rules. Refer to SLR\non page 104 for additional information.\n\nFailure to maintain an SLR equal to or greater than\nthe regulatory requirement will result in\nlimitations on the amount of capital that the Firm\nmay distribute such as through dividends and common\nshare repurchases, as well as on discretionary\nbonus payments for certain executive officers.\n\nOther regulatory capital\n\nIn addition to meeting the capital ratio\nrequirements of Basel III, the Firm and its\nprincipal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A., must also maintain minimum capital and\nleverage ratios in order to be \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d\nunder the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve\nand the Prompt Corrective Action requirements of\nthe FDIC Improvement Act, respectively. Refer to\nNote 27 for additional information.\n\nAdditional information regarding the Firm\u2019s capital\nratios, as well as the U.S. federal regulatory\ncapital standards to which the Firm is subject, is\npresented in Note 27.

Line of business and\nCorporate equity Each LOB and Corporate is\nallocated capital by taking into consideration a\nvariety of factors including capital levels of\nsimilarly rated peers and applicable regulatory\ncapital requirements. ROE is measured and internal\ntargets for expected returns are established as key\nmeasures of an LOB\u2019s performance.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s current equity allocation methodology\nincorporates Basel III Standardized RWA and the\nGSIB surcharge, both under rules currently in\neffect, as well as a simulation of capital\ndepletion in a severe stress environment. At least\nannually, the assumptions, judgments and\nmethodologies used to allocate capital are\nreassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated\nto the LOBs and Corporate may change.

The CFP also identifies the alternative\ncontingent funding and liquidity resources\navailable to the Firm and its legal entities in a\nperiod of stress. LCR and HQLA The LCR rule\nrequires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is\nsufficient to meet their respective estimated total\nnet cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-\nday period of significant stress. Eligible HQLA,\nfor purposes of calculating the LCR, is the amount\nof unencumbered HQLA that satisfy certain\noperational considerations as defined in the LCR\nrule. HQLA primarily consist of cash and certain\nhigh-quality liquid securities as defined in the\nLCR rule. Under the LCR rule, the amount of\neligible HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nthat is in excess of its stand-alone 100% minimum\nLCR requirement, and that is not transferable to\nnon-bank affiliates, must be excluded from the\nFirm\u2019s reported eligible HQLA. Estimated net cash\noutflows are based on standardized stress outflow\nand inflow rates prescribed in the LCR rule, which\nare applied to the balances of the Firm\u2019s assets,\nsources of funds, and obligations. The LCR for both\nthe Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required\nto be a minimum of 100%.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Firm and\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s average LCR for the\nthree months ended December 31, 2024, September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023 based on the Firm\u2019s\ninterpretation of the LCR framework.\n                                                                                                            \n  Average amount                  Three months ended                                                        \n  (in millions)                    December 31, 2024        September 30, 2024        December 31, 2023     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co.:                                                                                     \n  HQLA                                                                                                      \n  Eligible cash(a)             $             396,123     $             412,389     $            485,263     \n  Eligible securities(b)(c)                  464,877                   453,899                  313,365     \n  Total HQLA(d)                $             861,000     $             866,288     $            798,628     \n  Net cash outflows            $             763,648     $             762,072     $            704,857     \n  LCR                                            113  %                    114  %                   113  %  \n  Net excess eligible          $              97,352     $             104,216     $             93,771     \n  HQLA(d)                                                                                                   \n  JPMorgan Chase Bank,                                                                                      \n  N.A.:                                                                                                     \n  LCR                                            124  %                    121  %                   129  %  \n  Net excess eligible HQLA     $             193,682     $             168,137     $            215,190     \n                                                                                                            \n(a) Represents cash on deposit at central banks,\nprimarily the Federal Reserve Banks.

JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A.'s average LCR increased during the three\nmonths ended December 31, 2024, compared with the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024, driven by\nactivities in CIB Markets, partially offset by\nlower market values of HQLA-eligible investment\nsecurities and funding maturities. JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A.\u2019s average LCR for the three months ended\nDecember 31, 2024 decreased compared with the three\nmonths ended December 31, 2023, driven by dividend\npayments to the Parent Company and lending\nactivity, largely offset by higher market values of\nHQLA-eligible investment securities, a reduction in\nunencumbered non-HQLA AFS securities, activities in\nCIB Markets, and long-term debt issuances.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    109  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nEach of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s\naverage LCR may fluctuate from period to period due\nto changes in their respective eligible HQLA and\nestimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing\nbusiness activity and from the impacts of Federal\nReserve actions as well as other factors.

This includes\nexcess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank\naffiliates. The fair value of these securities was\napproximately $594 billion and $649 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, although\nthe amount of liquidity that could be raised at any\nparticular time would be dependent on prevailing\nmarket conditions. The decrease compared to\nDecember 31, 2023, was driven by reductions in\nunencumbered AFS securities in Treasury and CIO,\nexcess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A., and unencumbered CIB trading assets.\n\nThe Firm had approximately $1.4 trillion of\navailable cash and securities as of both December\n31, 2024 and 2023. For each respective period, the\namount was comprised of eligible end-of-period\nHQLA, excluding the impact of regulatory haircuts,\nof approximately $834 billion and $798 billion, and\nunencumbered marketable securities with a fair\nvalue of approximately $594 billion and $649\nbillion.\n\nThe Firm also had available borrowing capacity at\nthe Federal Home Loan Banks (\u201cFHLBs\u201d) and the\ndiscount window at the Federal Reserve Banks as a\nresult of collateral pledged by the Firm to such\nbanks of approximately $413 billion and $340\nbillion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the\nbenefit of cash and securities reported in the\nFirm\u2019s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered\nsecurities that are currently pledged at the\nFederal Reserve Banks discount window and other\ncentral banks. Available borrowing capacity\nincreased from December 31, 2023 primarily due to a\nhigher amount of commercial loans and credit card\nreceivables pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks.\nAlthough available, the Firm does not view this\nborrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Banks\ndiscount window and the other central banks as a\nprimary source of liquidity.\n                                                                                                            \n  NSFR                                                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nThe net stable funding ratio (\u201cNSFR\u201d) is a\nliquidity requirement for large banking\norganizations that is intended to measure the\nadequacy of \u201cavailable\u201d stable funding that is\nsufficient to meet their \u201crequired\u201d amounts of\nstable funding over a one-year horizon.\n\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2024, both\nthe Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were\ncompliant with the 100% minimum NSFR requirement,\nbased on the Firm\u2019s interpretation of the final\nNSFR rule.

A significant\nportion of the Firm\u2019s deposits are consumer\ndeposits and wholesale operating deposits, which\nare both considered to be stable sources of\nliquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are\ngenerally considered to be stable sources of\nliquidity because they are generated from customers\nthat maintain operating service relationships with\nthe Firm.\n\nThe Firm believes that average deposit balances are\ngenerally more representative of deposit trends\nthan period-end deposit balances. However, during\nperiods of market disruption, average deposit\ntrends may be impacted.\n\nThe following discussion excludes the impact of the\ntransfer of certain First Republic deposits in the\nfourth quarter of 2023 from CCB to the other LOBs\nas the transfers had no net impact on Firmwide\ndeposits.\n\nAverage deposits increased for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2024 compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, reflecting:\n\n\u2022 an increase in CIB due to net inflows\npredominantly in Payments and net issuances of\nstructured notes as a result of client demand in\nMarkets, partially offset by deposit attrition,\nwhich included actions taken to reduce certain\ndeposits,\n\n\u2022 the timing impact of First Republic,\n\n\u2022 an increase in AWM as a result of growth in\nbalances in new and existing client accounts,\nreflecting the impact of higher-yielding product\nofferings, largely offset by continued migration\ninto other investments, and\n\n\u2022 a decline in CCB primarily driven by a decrease\nin balances in existing accounts due to increased\ncustomer spending, largely offset by new accounts.\n\nPeriod-end deposits increased from December 31,\n2023, reflecting:\n\n\u2022 an increase in CIB due to net inflows\npredominantly in Payments, largely offset by net\nmaturities of structured notes in Markets,\n\n\u2022 an increase in AWM as a result of growth in\nbalances in new and existing client accounts,\nreflecting the impact of higher-yielding product\nofferings, largely offset by continued migration\ninto other investments, and\n\n\u2022 a decline in CCB primarily driven by a decrease\nin balances in existing accounts due to increased\ncustomer spending and migration into higher-\nyielding investments, predominantly offset by new\naccounts.\n\nRefer to the Firm\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets\nAnalysis and the Business Segment & Corporate\nResults on pages 63\u201365 and pages 70\u201390,\nrespectively, for further information on deposit\nand liability balance trends, as well as Executive\nOverview\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    111  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \non pages 54\u201358 and Note 34 for additional\ninformation on the First Republic acquisition.\nRefer to Note 3 for further information on\nstructured notes. Certain deposits are covered by\ninsurance protection that provides additional\nfunding stability and results in a benefit to the\nLCR. Deposit insurance protection may be available\nto depositors in the countries in which the\ndeposits are placed. For example, the FDIC provides\ndeposit insurance protection for deposits placed in\na U.S. depository institution. At December 31, 2024\nand 2023 (a) , the Firmwide estimated uninsured\ndeposits were $1,414.0 billion and $1,347.8\nbillion, respectively, primarily reflecting\nwholesale operating deposits.\n\nTotal uninsured deposits include time deposits. The\ntable below presents an estimate of uninsured U.S.\nand non-U.S. time deposits, and their remaining\nmaturities. The Firm\u2019s estimates of its uninsured\nU.S. time deposits are based on data that the Firm\ncalculates periodically under applicable FDIC\nregulations.

These instruments are secured\npredominantly by high-quality securities\ncollateral, including government-issued debt and\nU.S. GSE and government agency MBS. Securities sold\nunder agreements to repurchase increased at\nDecember 31, 2024, compared with December 31, 2023,\ndriven by Markets, reflecting higher client-driven\nmarket-making activities and higher secured\nfinancing of trading assets.\n\nThe increase in secured other borrowed funds at\nDecember 31, 2024 from December 31, 2023, as well\nas the increase for the average year ended December\n31, 2024, compared to the prior year period, were\nboth due to higher financing requirements in\nMarkets, partially offset by FHLB maturities in\nTreasury and CIO.\n\nThe balances associated with securities loaned or\nsold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over\ntime due to investment and financing activities of\nclients,\n\nthe Firm\u2019s demand for financing, the ongoing\nmanagement of the mix of the Firm\u2019s liabilities,\nincluding its secured and unsecured financing (for\nboth the investment securities and market-making\nportfolios), and other market and portfolio\nfactors.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s primary sources of short-term unsecured\nfunding consist of issuances of wholesale\ncommercial paper and other borrowed funds.\n\nThe decrease in average commercial paper for the\nyear ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior\nyear period was due to lower issuances primarily as\na result of short-term liquidity management.\n\nThe increase in unsecured other borrowed funds at\nDecember 31, 2024 from December 31, 2023, was\npredominantly driven by net issuances of structured\nnotes in Markets.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    113  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Long-term funding                                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \nLong-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm\u2019s\nlong-term funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations and\nregulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification,\nmaximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors\nand currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan.\n\nUnsecured funding and issuance\n\nThe significant majority of the Firm\u2019s total outstanding long-term debt has been issued by the Parent\nCompany to provide flexibility in support of the funding needs of both bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The\nParent Company advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not\nissue debt to external counterparties. The increase in structured notes at December 31, 2024 from December\n31, 2023, and for the average year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year period, was primarily\ndriven by net issuances of structured notes in Markets due to client demand.\n\nThe following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the years\nended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

The Firm believes that it\nmaintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a\npotential decrease in funding capacity due to\nratings downgrades.\n\nAdditionally, the Firm\u2019s funding requirements for\nVIEs and other third-party commitments may be\nadversely affected by a decline in credit ratings.\nRefer to Notes 5 and 14 for additional information.\n\nThe credit ratings of the Parent Company and\ncertain of its principal subsidiaries as of\nDecember 31, 2024 were as follows:\n                                                                                                            \n                                                                              J.P.                          \n                                                                              Morgan                        \n                                                                              Securi\u2026                       \n                                                                              LLC                           \n                                                                              J.P.                          \n                                                                              Morgan                        \n                                                                              Securi\u2026                       \n                                             JPMorg\u2026                          plc                           \n            JPMorg\u2026                          Chase                            J.P.                          \n            Chase &                          Bank,                            Morgan                        \n  Decem\u2026    Co.

The Firm provides credit\nto a variety of clients and customers, ranging from\nlarge corporate and institutional clients to\nindividual consumers and small businesses. In its\nconsumer businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit\nrisk primarily through its home lending, credit\ncard, auto, and business banking businesses. In its\nwholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit\nrisk through its underwriting, lending, market-\nmaking, and hedging activities with and for clients\nand counterparties, as well as through its\noperating services activities (such as cash\nmanagement and clearing activities), and securities\nfinancing activities. The Firm is also exposed to\ncredit risk through its investment securities\nportfolio and cash placed with banks.\n\nCredit Risk Management monitors and measures credit\nrisk throughout the Firm, and defines credit risk\npolicies, procedures and limits. The Firm\u2019s credit\nrisk management governance includes the following\nactivities:\n\n\u2022 Maintaining a credit risk policy framework\n\n\u2022 Monitoring and measuring credit risk across all\nportfolio segments, including transaction and\nexposure approval\n\n\u2022 Setting industry and geographic concentration\nlimits, as appropriate, and setting guidelines for\ncredit review and analysis\n\n\u2022 Assigning and maintaining credit approval\nauthorities in connection with the approval of\ncredit exposure\n\n\u2022 Monitoring and independent assessment of\ncriticized exposures and delinquent loans, and\n\n\u2022 Estimating credit losses and supporting\nappropriate credit risk-based capital management\n                                                                                                            \n  Risk identification and measurement                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \nTo measure credit risk, the Firm employs several\nmethodologies for estimating the likelihood of\nobligor or counterparty default. Methodologies for\nmeasuring credit risk vary depending on several\nfactors, including type of asset (e.g., consumer\nversus wholesale), risk measurement parameters\n(e.g., delinquency status and borrower\u2019s credit\nscore versus wholesale risk-rating) and risk\nmanagement and collection processes (e.g., retail\ncollection center versus centrally managed workout\ngroups). Credit risk measurement is based on the\nprobability of default of an obligor or\ncounterparty, the loss severity given a default\nevent and the exposure at default.\n\nBased on these factors and the methodology and\nestimates described in Note 13 and Note 10, the\nFirm estimates credit losses for its exposures. The\nallowance for loan losses reflects estimated credit\nlosses related to the consumer and wholesale held-\nfor-investment loan portfolios, the allowance for\nlending-related commitments reflects estimated\ncredit losses related to the Firm\u2019s lending-related\ncommitments and the allowance for investment\nsecurities reflects estimated credit losses related\nto the investment securities portfolio. Refer to\nNote 13, Note 10 and Critical Accounting Estimates\nused by the Firm on pages 161\u2013164 for further\ninformation.\n\nIn addition, potential and unexpected credit losses\nare reflected in the allocation of credit risk\ncapital and represent the potential volatility of\nactual losses relative to the established\nallowances for loan losses and lending-related\ncommitments. The analyses for these losses include\nstress testing that considers alternative economic\nscenarios as described below.\n                                                                                                            \n  Stress testing                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \nStress testing is important in measuring and\nmanaging credit risk in the Firm\u2019s credit\nportfolio. The stress testing process assesses the\npotential impact of alternative economic and\nbusiness scenarios on estimated credit losses for\nthe Firm. Economic scenarios and the underlying\nparameters are defined centrally, articulated in\nterms of macroeconomic factors and applied across\nthe businesses. The stress test results may\nindicate credit migration, changes in delinquency\ntrends and potential losses in the credit\nportfolio. In addition to the periodic stress\ntesting processes, management also considers\nadditional stresses outside these scenarios,\nincluding industry and country- specific stress\nscenarios, as appropriate. The Firm uses stress\ntesting to inform decisions on setting risk\nappetite both at a Firm and LOB level, as well as\nto assess the impact of stress on individual\ncounterparties.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    117  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Risk monitoring and management                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm has developed policies and practices that\nare designed to preserve the independence and\nintegrity of the approval and decision-making\nprocess for extending credit so that credit risks\nare assessed accurately, approved properly,\nmonitored regularly and managed actively at both\nthe transaction and portfolio levels.

The following discussions\nprovide information concerning individual loan\nproducts.

Residential real estate: The\nresidential real estate portfolio, including loans\nheld-for-sale and loans at fair value,\npredominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and\nhome equity lines of credit. Retained loans\ndecreased compared to December 31, 2023,\npredominantly driven by paydowns and loan sales,\nnet of originations. Retained nonaccrual loans\ndecreased compared to December 31, 2023,\npredominantly driven by loan sales. Net recoveries\nwere higher for the year ended December 31, 2024\ncompared to the prior year, driven by loan sales.\nLoans held-for-sale and nonaccrual loans held-for-\nsale increased from December 31, 2023,\npredominantly driven by transfers of certain\nretained loans in anticipation of securitization\nand loan sales, respectively. Loans at fair value\nincreased from December 31, 2023, predominantly\ndriven by higher Home Lending loans, as\noriginations outpaced warehouse loan sales.\nNonaccrual loans at fair value increased compared\nto December 31, 2023, driven by CIB. At December\n31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying values of retained\ninterest-only residential mortgage loans were $88.9\nbillion and $90.6 billion, respectively. These\nloans have an interest-only payment period\ngenerally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-\nrate fully amortizing payment period to maturity\nand are typically originated as higher-balance\nloans to higher-income borrowers. The credit\nperformance of this portfolio is comparable to the\nperformance of the broader prime mortgage\nportfolio. The carrying value of retained home\nequity lines of credit outstanding was $14.5\nbillion at December 31, 2024, including $3.8\nbillion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-\nonly to fully amortizing payments or have been\nmodified, and $3.6 billion of interest-only balloon\nHELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm\nmanages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving\nperiod by reducing or canceling the undrawn line in\naccordance with the contract or to the extent\notherwise permitted by law, including when there\nhas been a demonstrable decline in the\ncreditworthiness of the borrower or significant\ndecrease in the value of the underlying property.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the\nFirm\u2019s residential mortgage portfolio insured\nand/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies,\npredominantly loans held-for-sale and loans at fair\nvalue.

Net charge-offs increased for the\nyear ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior\nyear reflecting the seasoning of vintages\noriginated in recent years, credit normalization\nand balance growth.\n\nConsistent with the Firm\u2019s policy, all credit card\nloans typically remain on accrual status until\ncharged off.

A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm\u2019s wholesale businesses is\ngenerally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it\noriginates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations\nand credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth\nreviews of client credit quality and transaction structure, inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of\nindustry, product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 128\u2013131 for further\ninformation. The Firm\u2019s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, AWM and Corporate, and\nrisk-rated exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the\nallowance for loan losses. As of December 31, 2024, loans increased $19.8 billion, driven by higher loans in\nCIB and higher securities-based lending in AWM. Lending-related commitments decreased $5.3 billion, with\ndecreases in AWM and CCB, largely offset by higher commitments in CIB. As of December 31, 2024,\nnonperforming exposure increased by $2.3 billion, predominantly driven by Real Estate, concentrated in\nOffice, Healthcare and Consumer & Retail, in each case resulting from downgrades. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2024, wholesale net charge-offs were $822 million, largely driven by Real Estate, concentrated\nin Office, and client-specific charge-offs across multiple industries including Consumer & Retail and\nIndividuals.\n                                                                                                            \n  Wholesale

Total criticized\nexposure, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $44.7 billion and $41.4 billion at\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, representing approximately 3.5% and 3.3% of total wholesale credit exposure,\nrespectively; of the $44.7 billion, $39.9 billion was performing. The increase in criticized exposure was\ndriven by Real Estate resulting from downgrades, primarily in Multifamily and Office, and new commitments in\nTechnology and Media, partially offset by Consumer & Retail resulting from net portfolio activity and\nupgrades.\n\nThe table below summarizes by industry the Firm\u2019s exposures as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

               \nThe Firm uses lending-related financial\ninstruments, such as commitments (including\nrevolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to\naddress the financing needs of its clients. The\ncontractual amounts of these financial instruments\nrepresent the maximum possible credit risk should\nthe clients draw down on these commitments or when\nthe Firm fulfills its obligations under these\nguarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to\nperform according to the terms of these contracts.\nMost of these commitments and guarantees have\nhistorically been refinanced, extended, cancelled,\nor expired without being drawn upon or a default\noccurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe\nthat the total contractual amount of these\nwholesale lending-related commitments is\nrepresentative of the Firm\u2019s expected future credit\nexposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28\nfor further information on wholesale lending-\nrelated commitments.\n                                                                                                            \n  Receivables from customers                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nReceivables from customers reflect held-for-\ninvestment margin loans to brokerage clients in\nCIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets\nmaintained in the clients\u2019 brokerage accounts\n(including cash on deposit, and primarily liquid\nand readily marketable debt or equity securities).\nTo manage its credit risk, the Firm establishes\nmargin requirements and monitors the required\nmargin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires\nclients to deposit additional cash or other\ncollateral, or to reduce positions, when\nappropriate. Credit risk arising from lending\nactivities subject to collateral maintenance\nrequirements is generally mitigated by factors such\nas the short-term nature of the activity, the fair\nvalue of collateral held and the Firm\u2019s right to\ncall for, and the borrower\u2019s obligation to provide,\nadditional margin when the fair value of the\ncollateral declines. Because of these mitigating\nfactors, these receivables generally do not require\nan allowance for credit losses. However, if in\nmanagement\u2019s judgment, an allowance for credit\nlosses is required, the Firm estimates expected\ncredit losses based on the value of the collateral\nand probability of borrower default. These\nreceivables are reported within accrued interest\nand accounts receivable on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated\nbalance sheets.\n\nRefer to Note 13 for further information on the\nFirm\u2019s accounting policies for the allowance for\ncredit losses.\n                                                                                                            \n  Derivative contracts                                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to\nmanage risk, including credit risk and risks\narising from fluctuations in interest rates,\nforeign exchange and equities and commodities\nprices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in\norder to meet these needs and uses derivatives to\nmanage certain risks associated with net open risk\npositions from its market-making activities,\nincluding the counterparty credit risk arising from\nderivative receivables. The Firm also uses\nderivative instruments to manage its own credit\nrisk and other market risk exposure. The nature of\nthe counterparty and the settlement mechanism of\nthe\n\nderivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm\nis exposed. For over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d)\nderivatives, the Firm is exposed to the credit risk\nof the derivative counterparty. For exchange-traded\nderivatives (\u201cETD\u201d), such as futures and options,\nand cleared over-the-counter (\u201cOTC-cleared\u201d)\nderivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the\ncredit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible,\nthe Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk\nexposures arising from derivative contracts through\nthe use of legally enforceable master netting\narrangements and collateral agreements. The\npercentage of the Firm\u2019s OTC derivative\ntransactions subject to collateral agreements \u2014\nexcluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are\nnot typically covered by collateral agreements due\nto their short maturity and centrally cleared\ntrades that are settled daily \u2014 was approximately\n86% and 87% at December 31, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. Refer to Note 5 for additional\ninformation on the Firm\u2019s use of collateral\nagreements and for a further discussion of\nderivative contracts, counterparties and settlement\ntypes.\n\nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported\non the Consolidated balance sheets was $61.0\nbillion and $54.9 billion at December 31, 2024 and\n2023, respectively. The increase was primarily as a\nresult of market movements. Derivative receivables\nrepresent the fair value of the derivative\ncontracts after giving effect to legally\nenforceable master netting agreements and the\nrelated cash collateral held by the Firm.\n\nIn addition, the Firm holds liquid securities and\nother cash collateral that may be used as security\nwhen the fair value of the client\u2019s exposure is in\nthe Firm\u2019s favor. For these purposes, the\ndefinition of liquid securities is consistent with\nthe definition of high quality liquid assets as\ndefined in the LCR rule.\n\nIn management\u2019s view, the appropriate measure of\ncurrent credit risk should also take into\nconsideration other collateral, which generally\nrepresents securities that do not qualify as high\nquality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The\nbenefits of these additional collateral amounts for\neach counterparty are subject to a legally\nenforceable master netting agreement and limited to\nthe net amount of the derivative receivables for\neach counterparty.\n\nThe Firm also holds additional collateral\n(primarily cash, G7 government securities, other\nliquid government agency and guaranteed securities,\nand corporate debt and equity securities) delivered\nby clients at the initiation of transactions, as\nwell as collateral related to contracts that have a\nnon-daily call frequency and collateral that the\nFirm has agreed to return but has not yet settled\nas of the reporting date.

To capture this\nvariability, the Firm calculates, on a client-by-\nclient basis, three measures of potential\nderivatives-related credit loss: Peak, Derivative\nRisk Equivalent (\u201cDRE\u201d), and Average exposure\n(\u201cAVG\u201d). These measures all incorporate netting and\ncollateral benefits, where applicable.\n\nPeak represents a conservative measure of potential\nderivative exposure, including the benefit of\ncollateral, to a counterparty calculated in a\nmanner that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5%\nconfidence level over the life of the transaction.\nPeak is the primary measure used by the Firm for\nsetting credit limits for derivative contracts,\nsenior management reporting and derivatives\nexposure management.\n\nDRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk\nof derivative exposure, including the benefit of\ncollateral, on a basis intended to be equivalent to\nthe risk of loan exposures. DRE is a less extreme\nmeasure of potential credit loss than Peak.\n\nFinally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair\nvalue of the Firm\u2019s derivative exposures, including\nthe benefit of collateral, at future time periods.\nAVG over the total life of the derivative contract\nis used as the primary metric for pricing purposes\nand is used to calculate credit risk capital and\nCVA, as further described below.\n\nThe fair value of the Firm\u2019s derivative receivables\nincorporates CVA to reflect the credit quality of\ncounterparties. CVA is based on the Firm\u2019s AVG to a\ncounterparty and the counterparty\u2019s credit spread\nin the credit derivatives market. The Firm believes\nthat active risk management is essential to\ncontrolling the dynamic credit risk in the\nderivatives portfolio. In addition, the Firm\u2019s risk\nmanagement process for derivatives exposures takes\ninto consideration the potential impact of wrong-\nway risk, which is broadly\n\ndefined as the risk that exposure to a counterparty\nis positively correlated with the impact of a\ndefault by the same counterparty, which could cause\nexposure to increase at the same time as the\ncounterparty\u2019s capacity to meet its obligations is\ndecreasing. Many factors may influence the nature\nand magnitude of these correlations over time. To\nthe extent that these correlations are identified,\nthe Firm may adjust the CVA associated with a\nparticular counterparty\u2019s AVG. The Firm risk\nmanages exposure to changes in CVA by entering into\ncredit derivative contracts, as well as interest\nrate, foreign exchange, equity and commodity\nderivative contracts.\n\nThe below graph shows exposure profiles to the\nFirm\u2019s current derivatives portfolio over the next\n10 years as calculated by the Peak, DRE and AVG\nmetrics. The three measures generally show that\nexposure will decline after the first year, if no\nnew trades are added to the portfolio.\n                                                                                                            \n  Exposure profile of derivatives measures                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \nDecember 31, 2024\n\n(in billions)\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    135  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nCredit derivatives The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in its capacity as a\nmarket-maker, and second, as an end-user to manage the Firm\u2019s own credit risk associated with various\nexposures.

The credit derivatives used in credit\nportfolio management activities do not qualify for\nhedge accounting under U.S. GAAP; these derivatives\nare reported at fair value, with gains and losses\nrecognized in principal transactions revenue. In\ncontrast, the loans and lending-related commitments\nbeing risk-managed are accounted for on an accrual\nbasis. This asymmetry in accounting treatment,\nbetween loans and lending-related commitments and\nthe credit derivatives used in credit portfolio\nmanagement activities, causes earnings volatility\nthat is not representative, in the Firm\u2019s view, of\nthe true changes in value of the Firm\u2019s overall\ncredit exposure. The effectiveness of credit\ndefault swaps (\u201cCDS\u201d) as a hedge against the Firm\u2019s\nexposures may vary depending on a number of\nfactors, including the named reference entity\n(i.e., the Firm may experience losses on specific\nexposures that are different than the named\nreference entities in the purchased CDS); the\ncontractual terms of the CDS (which may have a\ndefined credit event that does not align with an\nactual loss realized by the Firm); and the maturity\nof the Firm\u2019s CDS protection (which in some cases\nmay be shorter than the Firm\u2019s exposures). However,\nthe Firm generally seeks to purchase credit\nprotection with a maturity date that is the same or\nsimilar to the maturity date of the exposure for\nwhich the protection was purchased, and remaining\ndifferences in maturity are actively monitored and\nmanaged by the Firm.

The net\naddition to the allowance for credit losses\nincluded: \u2022 $2.1 billion in consumer , reflecting:\n\u2013 a $2.2 billion net addition in Card Services,\npredominantly driven by loan growth, reflecting\nhigher revolving balances, including the seasoning\nof vintages originated in recent years, partially\noffset by \u2013 a $125 million net reduction in Home\nLending in the first quarter of 2024, and \u2022 a net\nreduction of $30 million in wholesale , reflecting:\n\u2013 changes in certain macroeconomic variables, an\nupdate to loss assumptions on certain loans in\nMarkets, and a reduction due to charge-offs largely\nfrom collateral-dependent loans, predominantly\noffset by \u2013 net downgrade activity, primarily in\nReal Estate, and the impact of incorporating the\nFirst Republic portfolio into the Firm\u2019s modeled\ncredit loss estimates in the second quarter of\n2024. The Firm\u2019s qualitative adjustments continued\nto include additional weight placed on the adverse\nscenarios to reflect ongoing uncertainties and\ndownside risks related to the geopolitical and\nmacroeconomic environment. The Firm's allowance for\ncredit losses is estimated using a weighted average\nof five internally developed macroeconomic\nscenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more\npunitive macroeconomic factors than the central\ncase assumptions provided in the table below,\nresulting in:\n\n\u2022 a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking\nat 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2025, and \u2022 a\nweighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 1.9%\nlower than the central case at the end of the\nsecond quarter of 2026.

The investment securities portfolio is\npredominantly held by Treasury and CIO in\nconnection with the Firm's balance sheet and asset-\nliability management objectives. Principal\ninvestments are predominantly privately-held\nfinancial instruments and are managed in the LOBs\nand Corporate. Investments are typically intended\nto be held over extended periods and, accordingly,\nthe Firm has no expectation for short-term realized\ngains with respect to these investments. Investment\nsecurities risk Investment securities risk includes\nthe exposure associated with a default in the\npayment of principal and interest. This risk is\nmitigated given that the investment securities\nportfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly\nconsists of high-quality securities. At December\n31, 2024, the Treasury and CIO investment\nsecurities portfolio, net of the allowance for\ncredit losses, was $678.3 billion, and the average\ncredit rating of the securities comprising the\nportfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings\nwhere available, and where not available, based\nprimarily upon internal risk ratings). Refer to\nCorporate results on pages 88\u201390 and Note 10 for\nfurther information on the investment securities\nportfolio and internal risk ratings. Refer to\nLiquidity Risk Management on pages 108\u2013115 for\nfurther information on related liquidity risk.\nRefer to Market Risk Management on pages 141\u2013149\nfor further information on the market risk inherent\nin the portfolio. Governance and oversight\nInvestment securities risks are governed by the\nFirm\u2019s Risk Appetite framework, and reviewed at the\nCTC Risk Committee with regular updates provided to\nthe Board Risk Committee. The Firm\u2019s independent\ncontrol functions are responsible for reviewing the\nappropriateness of the carrying value of investment\nsecurities in accordance with relevant policies.\nApproved levels for investment securities are\nestablished for each risk category, including\ncapital and credit risks.\n\nPrincipal investment risk Principal investments are\ntypically privately-held financial instruments\nrepresenting ownership interests or other forms of\njunior capital. In general, principal investments\ninclude tax-oriented investments and investments\nmade to enhance or accelerate the Firm\u2019s business\nstrategies and exclude those that are consolidated\non the Firm's balance sheets. These investments are\nmade by dedicated investing businesses or as part\nof a broader business strategy. The Firm\u2019s\nprincipal investments are managed by the LOBs and\nCorporate and are reflected within their respective\nfinancial results. The Firm\u2019s investments will\ncontinue to evolve based on market circumstances\nand in line with its strategic initiatives.

Governance and\noversight The Firm\u2019s approach to managing principal\ninvestment risk is consistent with the Firm\u2019s risk\ngovernance structure. The Firm has established a\nFirmwide risk policy framework for all principal\ninvesting activities that includes approval by\nexecutives who are independent from the investing\nbusinesses, as appropriate.

Market Risk\nManagement maintains different levels of limits.\nFirm level limits include VaR and stress limits.\nSimilarly, LOB and Corporate limits include VaR and\nstress limits and may be supplemented by certain\nnonstatistical risk measures such as profit and\nloss drawdowns. Limits may also be set within the\nLOBs and Corporate, as well as at the legal entity\nlevel.\n\nMarket Risk Management sets limits and regularly\nreviews and updates them as appropriate. Senior\nmanagement is responsible for reviewing and\napproving certain of these risk limits on an\nongoing basis. Limits that have not been reviewed\nwithin specified time periods by Market Risk\nManagement are reported to senior management. The\nLOBs and Corporate are responsible for adhering to\nestablished limits against which exposures are\nmonitored and reported.\n\nLimit breaches are required to be reported in a\ntimely manner to limit approvers, which include\nMarket Risk Management and senior management. In\nthe event of a breach, Market Risk Management\nconsults with senior members of appropriate groups\nwithin the Firm to determine the suitable course of\naction required to return the applicable positions\nto compliance, which may include a reduction in\nrisk in order to remedy the breach or granting a\ntemporary increase in limits to accommodate an\nexpected increase in client activity and/or market\nvolatility. Firm, Corporate or LOB-level limit\nbreaches are escalated as appropriate.\n\nModels used to measure market risk are inherently\nimprecise and are limited in their ability to\nmeasure certain risks or to predict losses. This\nimprecision may be heightened when sudden or severe\nshifts in market conditions occur. For additional\ndiscussion on model uncertainty refer to\nEstimations and Model Risk Management on page 160.\n\nMarket Risk Management periodically reviews the\nFirm\u2019s existing market risk measures to identify\nopportunities for enhancement, and to the extent\nappropriate, will calibrate those measures\naccordingly over time.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    141  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nThe following table summarizes the predominant business activities and related market risks, as well as\npositions which give rise to market risk and certain measures used to capture those risks, for each LOB and\nCorporate.\n\nIn addition to the predominant business activities, each LOB and Corporate may engage in principal investing\nactivities.

The Firm has a single VaR\nframework used as a basis for calculating Risk\nManagement VaR and Regulatory VaR.\n\nThe framework is employed across the Firm using\nhistorical simulation based on data for the\nprevious 12 months. The framework\u2019s approach\nassumes that historical changes in market values\nare representative of the distribution of potential\noutcomes in the immediate future. The Firm believes\nthe use of Risk Management VaR provides a daily\nmeasure of risk that is closely aligned to risk\nmanagement decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate\nand, along with other market risk measures,\nprovides the appropriate information needed to\nrespond to risk events.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR is calculated\nassuming a one-day holding period and an expected\ntail-loss methodology which approximates a 95%\nconfidence level. Risk Management VaR provides a\nconsistent framework to measure risk profiles and\nlevels of diversification across product types and\nis used for aggregating risks and monitoring limits\nacross businesses. VaR results are reported as\nappropriate to various groups including senior\nmanagement, the Board Risk Committee and\nregulators.\n\nUnderlying the overall VaR model framework are\nindividual VaR models that simulate historical\nmarket returns for individual risk factors and/or\nproduct types. To capture material market risks as\npart of the Firm\u2019s risk management framework,\ncomprehensive VaR model calculations are performed\ndaily for businesses whose activities give rise to\nmarket risk. These VaR models are granular and\nincorporate numerous risk factors and inputs to\nsimulate daily changes in market values over the\nhistorical period; inputs are selected based on the\nrisk profile of each portfolio, as sensitivities\nand historical time series used to generate daily\nmarket values may be different across product types\nor risk management systems. The VaR model results\nacross all portfolios are aggregated at the Firm\nlevel.\n\nAs VaR is based on historical data, it is an\nimperfect measure of market risk exposure and\npotential future losses. In addition, based on\ntheir reliance on available historical data,\nlimited time horizons, and other factors, VaR\nmeasures are inherently limited in their ability to\nmeasure certain risks and to predict losses,\nparticularly those associated with market\nilliquidity and sudden or severe shifts in market\nconditions.\n\nFor certain products, specific risk parameters are\nnot captured in VaR due to the lack of liquidity\nand availability of appropriate historical data.\nThe Firm uses proxies to estimate the VaR for these\nand other products when daily time series are not\navailable. It is likely that using an actual price-\nbased time series for these products, if available,\nwould affect the VaR results presented. The Firm\ntherefore considers other nonstatistical measures\nsuch as stress testing, in addition to VaR, to\ncapture and manage its market risk positions.\n\nAs VaR model calculations require daily data and a\nconsistent source for valuation, the daily market\ndata used may be different than the independent\nthird-party data collected for VCG price testing in\nits monthly valuation process. For example, in\ncases where market prices are not observable, or\nwhere proxies are used in VaR historical time\nseries, the data sources may differ. Refer to\nValuation process in Note 2 for further information\non the Firm\u2019s valuation process.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s VaR model calculations are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in response to changes in\nthe composition of the Firm\u2019s portfolios, changes\nin market conditions, improvements in the Firm\u2019s\nmodeling techniques and measurements, and other\nfactors. Such changes may affect historical\ncomparisons of VaR results. Refer to Estimations\nand Model Risk Management on page 160 for\ninformation regarding model reviews and approvals.\n\nThe Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated\nVaR in accordance with regulatory rules\n(\u201cRegulatory VaR\u201d), which is used to derive the\nFirm\u2019s regulatory VaR-based capital requirements\nunder Basel III capital rules. This Regulatory VaR\nmodel framework currently assumes a ten business-\nday holding period and an expected tail-loss\nmethodology which approximates a 99% confidence\nlevel. Regulatory VaR is applied to \u201ccovered\u201d\npositions as defined by Basel III capital rules,\nwhich may be different than the positions included\nin the Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR. For example,\ncredit derivative hedges of accrual loans are\nincluded in the Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR, while\nRegulatory VaR excludes these credit derivative\nhedges. In addition, in contrast to the Firm\u2019s Risk\nManagement VaR, Regulatory VaR currently excludes\nthe diversification benefit for certain VaR models.\n\nRefer to JPMorganChase\u2019s Basel III Pillar 3\nRegulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are\navailable on the Firm\u2019s website, for additional\ninformation on Regulatory VaR and the other\ncomponents of market risk regulatory capital for\nthe Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-\nbased measure and the respective backtesting).\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    143  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nThe table below shows the results of the Firm\u2019s Risk Management VaR measure using a 95% confidence level.\nVaR can vary significantly as positions change, market volatility fluctuates, and diversification benefits\nchange.\n                                                                                                            \n  Total VaR                                                                                                 \n  As of or for the year                                                                                     \n  ended December 31,               2024                                   2023                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (in millions)                    Avg.

Prior periods have not been revised. Refer to Business Segment & Corporate Results on pages\n70\u201390 for additional information.\n\n(b) Diversification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its\nindividual components. This reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across\nLOBs, Corporate, and risk types. For maximum and minimum VaR, diversification benefit is not meaningful as\nthe maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the\ncomponents.\n\n(c) Includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and credit protection purchased against certain retained\nloans and lending-related commitments, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does\nnot include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value. In line with the Firm's\ninternal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed\nfrom Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated\nlevels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now reflected in\nother sensitivity-based measures.\n\n(d) In the second quarter of 2024, the presentation of Corporate and other LOB VaR was updated to\ndisaggregate AWM VaR due to the increase associated with credit protection purchased against certain\nretained loans and lending-related commitments. The VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which\nis not reported at fair value.\n\n(e) Includes a legacy private equity position which is publicly traded, as well as Visa C shares which the\nFirm disposed of in the second and third quarters of 2024. The impact of Visa C shares resulted in elevated\naverage and maximum Corporate VaR, Other VaR and Total VaR.

The increase was predominantly driven\nby the impact of the Firm\u2019s receipt of Visa C\nshares on Corporate VaR and increases associated\nwith credit\n\nprotection purchased against certain retained loans\nand lending-related commitments within Credit\nPortfolio VaR and AWM VaR, largely offset by market\nvolatility rolling out of the one-year historical\nlook-back period impacting the Fixed income risk\ntype.\n\nThe following graph presents daily Risk Management\nVaR for the four trailing quarters. The increase in\nVaR and subsequent decline observed in the second\nquarter of 2024 was primarily driven by changes in\nVisa C share exposure in the Firm's Corporate VaR.\n                                                                                                            \n                                         Daily Risk Management VaR                                          \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                      \n  First Quarter    Second Quarter    Third Quarter    Fourth Quarter  \n  2024             2024              2024             2024            \n                                                                      \n                                              \n  144    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  VaR backtesting                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting,\nwhich compares the daily Risk Management VaR\nresults with the daily gains and losses that are\nutilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains\nand losses depicted in the chart below do not\nreflect the Firm\u2019s reported revenue as they exclude\ncertain components of total net revenue, such as\nthose associated with the execution of new\ntransactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading\nand intraday risk management activities), fees,\ncommissions, other valuation adjustments and net\ninterest income. These excluded components of total\nnet revenue may more than offset the backtesting\ngain or loss on a particular day. The definition of\nbacktesting gains and losses above is consistent\nwith the requirements for backtesting under Basel\nIII capital rules.\n\nA backtesting exception occurs when the daily\nbacktesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management\nVaR for the prior day. Under the Firm\u2019s Risk\nManagement VaR methodology, assuming current\nchanges in market values are consistent with the\nhistorical changes used in the simulation, the Firm\nwould expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions\nfive times every 100 trading days on average. The\nnumber of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can\ndiffer from the statistically expected number of\nbacktesting exceptions if the current level of\nmarket volatility is materially different from the\nlevel of market volatility during the 12 months of\nhistorical data used in the VaR calculation.\n\nFor the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Firm\nposted backtesting gains on 179 of the 260 days,\nand observed eight VaR backtesting exceptions, of\nwhich three were in the three months ended December\n31, 2024. Firmwide backtesting loss days can differ\nfrom the loss days for which Fixed Income Markets\nand Equity Markets posted losses, as disclosed in\nCIB Markets revenue, as the population of positions\nwhich comprise each metric are different and due to\nthe exclusion of certain components of total net\nrevenue in backtesting gains and losses as\ndescribed above.\n\nThe following chart presents the distribution of\nFirmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the\ntrailing 12 months and three months ended December\n31, 2024. The daily backtesting losses are\ndisplayed as a percentage of the corresponding\ndaily Risk Management VaR.

While VaR reflects the risk of\nloss due to adverse changes in markets using recent\nhistorical market behavior, stress testing reflects\nthe risk of loss from hypothetical changes in the\nvalue of market risk sensitive positions applied\nsimultaneously. Stress testing measures the Firm\u2019s\nvulnerability to losses under a range of stressed\nbut possible economic and market scenarios. The\nresults are used to understand the exposures\nresponsible for those potential losses and are\nmeasured against limits.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s stress framework covers market risk\nsensitive positions in the LOBs and Corporate. The\nframework is used to calculate multiple magnitudes\nof potential stress for both market rallies and\nmarket sell-offs, assuming significant changes in\nmarket factors such as credit spreads, equity\nprices, interest rates, currency rates and\ncommodity prices, and combines them in multiple\nways to capture an array of hypothetical economic\nand market scenarios.\n\nThe Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus\non tail events in specific asset classes and\ngeographies, including how the event may impact\nmultiple market factors simultaneously. Scenarios\nalso incorporate specific idiosyncratic risks and\nstress basis risk between different products. The\nflexibility in the stress framework allows the Firm\nto construct new scenarios that can test the\noutcomes against possible future stress events.\nStress testing results are reported periodically to\nsenior management of the Firm, as appropriate.\n\nStress methodologies are governed by the overall\nstress framework, under the oversight of Market\nRisk Management. The Firmwide Market Risk Stress\nMethodology Committee reviews and approves changes\nto stress testing methodology and scenarios across\nthe Firm. Significant changes to the framework are\nescalated to senior management, as appropriate. In\naddition, stress methodology and the models to\ncalculate the stress results are subject to the\nFirm\u2019s Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy\n\nThe Firm\u2019s stress testing framework is utilized in\ncalculating the Firm\u2019s CCAR and other stress test\nresults, which are reported periodically to the\nBoard of Directors. In addition, stress testing\nresults are incorporated into the Firm\u2019s Risk\nAppetite framework, and are reported periodically\nto the Board Risk Committee.\n                                                                                                            \n  Profit and loss drawdowns                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \nProfit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight\ntrading losses above certain levels of risk\ntolerance. A profit and loss drawdown is a decline\nin revenue from its year-to-date peak level.\n                                                                                                            \n  Structural interest rate risk management                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \nThe effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm\u2019s\nreported net income is important as interest rate\nrisk represents one of the Firm\u2019s significant\nmarket risks. Interest rate risk arises not only\nfrom trading activities which are included in VaR,\nbut also from the Firm\u2019s traditional banking\nactivities, which include extension of loans and\ncredit facilities, taking deposits, issuing debt,\nas well as the investment securities portfolio, and\nassociated derivative instruments.

Treasury and CIO, working in\npartnership with the LOBs, calculates the Firm\u2019s\nstructural interest rate risk profile and reviews\nit with senior management, including the CTC Risk\nCommittee. In addition, oversight of structural\ninterest rate risk is managed through a dedicated\nrisk function reporting to the CTC CRO. This risk\nfunction is responsible for providing independent\noversight and governance around assumptions and\nestablishing and monitoring limits for structural\ninterest rate risk, including limits related to\nEarnings-at-Risk and Economic Value Sensitivity.\nThe Firm manages structural interest rate risk\ngenerally through its investment securities\nportfolio and interest rate derivatives.\n                                                                                                            \n  Key risk drivers and risk management process                                                              \n                                                                                                            \nStructural interest rate risk can arise due to a\nvariety of factors, including:\n\n\u2022 Differences in timing among the maturity or\nrepricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance\nsheet instruments\n\n\u2022 Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities\nand off-balance sheet instruments that are maturing\nor repricing at the same time\n\n\u2022 Differences in the amounts by which short-term\nand long-term market interest rates change (for\nexample, changes in the slope of the yield curve)\n\n\u2022 The impact of changes in the maturity of various\nassets, liabilities or off-balance sheet\ninstruments as interest rates change\n\nThe Firm manages interest rate exposure related to\nits assets and liabilities on a consolidated,\nFirmwide basis. Business units transfer their\ninterest rate risk to Treasury and CIO through\nfunds transfer pricing, which takes into account\nthe elements of interest rate exposure that can be\nrisk-managed in financial markets. These elements\ninclude asset and liability balances and\ncontractual rates of interest, contractual\nprincipal payment schedules, expected prepayment\n                                              \n  146    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nexperience, interest rate reset dates and\nmaturities, rate indices used for repricing, and\nany interest rate ceilings or floors for adjustable\nrate products.\n                                                                                                            \n  Earnings-at-Risk                                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \nOne way that the Firm evaluates its structural\ninterest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk.\nEarnings-at-risk estimates the Firm\u2019s interest rate\nexposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is\npresented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which\nincludes net interest income and certain interest\nrate sensitive fees. The baseline uses market\ninterest rates and, in the case of deposits,\npricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations\nof changes to this baseline for interest rate-\nsensitive assets and liabilities denominated in\nU.S. dollars and other currencies (\u201cnon-U.S.\ndollar\u201d currencies). These simulations primarily\ninclude retained and held-for-sale loans, deposits,\ndeposits with banks and financing activities,\ninvestment securities, long-term debt, related\ninterest rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of\nother positions in risk management VaR and other\nsensitivity-based measures as described on page\n142. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024, these\nsimulations also include hedges of non-U.S. dollar\nforeign exchange exposures arising from capital\ninvestments. Refer to non-U.S. dollar foreign\nexchange risk on page 149 for more informa tion.\n\nEarnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential\nchange to a baseline over the following 12 months\nutilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios\ninclude a parallel shift involving changes to both\nshort-term and long-term rates by an equal amount;\na steeper yield curve involving holding short-term\nrates constant and increasing long-term rates; and\na flatter yield curve involving increasing short-\nterm rates and holding long-term rates constant or\nholding short-term rates constant and decreasing\nlong-term rates. These scenarios consider many\ndifferent factors, including:\n\n\u2022 The impact on exposures as a result of\ninstantaneous changes in interest rates from\nbaseline rates.\n\n\u2022 Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled\nprepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding\nassumptions about actions that could be taken by\nthe Firm or its clients and customers in response\nto instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment\nassumptions are based on the interest rates used in\nthe scenarios compared with underlying contractual\nrates, the time since origination, and other\nfactors which are updated periodically based on\nhistorical experience. Deposit forecasts are a key\nassumption in the Firm\u2019s earnings-at-risk. The\nbaseline reflects certain assumptions relating to\nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet policy (e.g.,\nquantitative tightening and usage at the Reverse\nRepurchase Facility) that\n\nrequire management judgment. The amount of deposits\nthat the Firm holds at any given time may be\ninfluenced by Federal Reserve actions, as well as\nbroader monetary conditions and competition for\ndeposits.\n\n\u2022 The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as\ndeposit betas, represent the amount by which\ndeposit rates paid could change upon a given change\nin market interest rates. Actual deposit rates paid\nmay differ from the modeled assumptions, primarily\ndue to customer behavior and competition for\ndeposits.\n\nThe Firm performs sensitivity analyses of the\nassumptions used in earnings-at-risk scenarios,\nincluding with respect to deposit betas and\nforecasts of deposit balances, both of which are\nespecially significant in the case of consumer\ndeposits. The results of these sensitivity analyses\nare reported to the CTC Risk Committee and the\nBoard Risk Committee.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s earnings-at-risk scenarios are\nperiodically evaluated and enhanced in response to\nchanges in the composition of the Firm\u2019s balance\nsheet, changes in market conditions, improvements\nin the Firm\u2019s simulation and other factors. In the\nsecond quarter of 2024, the Firm updated certain\ndeposit rates paid assumptions which take into\naccount observed pricing and client and customer\nbehavior during the most recent economic cycle.\nThese updated deposit rates paid assumptions\nimpacted the U.S. dollar scenarios, resulting in an\nincrease in positive sensitivity in higher interest\nrate scenarios, and an increase in negative\nsensitivity in lower interest rate scenarios.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s earnings-at-risk sensitivities are\nmeasures of the Firm\u2019s interest rate exposure. The\nFirm\u2019s actual net interest income for the rate\nchanges presented may differ as the earnings-at-\nrisk scenarios are modelled as instantaneous\nchanges and exclude any actions that could be taken\nby the Firm or its clients or customers in response\nto rate changes. Other significant assumptions in\nthe earnings-at-risk scenarios, including mortgage\nprepayments and deposit rates paid, may also differ\nfrom actual results. The Firm\u2019s forecast for net\ninterest income is included in the Firm\u2019s outlook\non page 57.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    147  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm\u2019s sensitivities are presented in the table\nbelow.\n                                                                  \n  December 31,                                                    \n  (in billions)                                                   \n  Parallel shift:                          2024(a)       2023(b)  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  +100 bps shift in rates               $      2.3    $      3.1  \n  -100 bps shift in rates                     -2.5          -2.8  \n  +200 bps shift in rates                      4.6           6.2  \n  -200 bps shift in rates                     -4.9          -6.1  \n  Steeper yield curve:                                            \n  +100 bps shift in long-term rates            1.0           0.6  \n  -100 bps shift in short-term rates          -1.4          -2.2  \n  Flatter yield curve:                                            \n  +100 bps shift in short-term rates           1.2           2.5  \n  -100 bps shift in long-term rates           -1.1          -0.6  \n                                                                  \n(a) Reflects the simultaneous shift of U.S. dollar\nand non-U.S. dollar rates, and the inclusion of the\nhedges of non-U.S. dollar capital investments. This\ninclusion had no impact on total sensitivities but\nincreased U.S. dollar and decreased non-U.S. dollar\nsensitivities. Subsequent to this change, non-U.S.\ndollar sensitivities were insignificant. (b) At\nDecember 31, 2023, represents the total of the\nFirm\u2019s U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar\nsensitivities as previously reported. The change in\nthe Firm\u2019s sensitivities as of December 31, 2024,\ncompared to December 31, 2023, were primarily\ndriven by Treasury and CIO balance sheet actions\nwhere the Firm added duration through investment\nsecurities activity, cash flow hedges of retained\nloans and fair value hedges of Firm debt. The\nimpact on the sensitivities of the Treasury and CIO\nbalance sheet actions were largely offset by the\nimpact of deposits, primarily from the second\nquarter of 2024 update of the deposit rates paid\nassumptions for certain consumer and wholesale\ndeposit products. Additionally, the results as of\nDecember 31, 2024 reflected the update to include\nhedges of the Firm\u2019s non-U.S. dollar capital\ninvestments. Although total results were not\nimpacted, these hedges increase U.S. dollar\nsensitivities and decrease non-U.S. dollar\nsensitivities. In the absence of these updates the\nFirm\u2019s sensitivities as of December 31, 2024, would\nhave been different by the amounts reported in the\nfollowing table:\n                                                                                                            \n                                                 Amounts by which reported                                  \n                                             sensitivities would have been                                  \n                                                                 different                                  \n  December 31, 2024                       Impact from update in the second       Impact from update in the  \n  (in billions)                                            quarter of 2024          fourth quarter of 2024  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. dollar:                                                                                              \n  Parallel shift:                                                                                           \n  +100 bps shift in rates             $                               -1.0    $                       -0.6  \n  -100 bps shift in rates                                              0.9                             0.6  \n  +200 bps shift in rates                                             -1.9                            -1.3  \n  -200 bps shift in rates                                              1.5                             1.3  \n  Steeper yield curve:                                                                                      \n  +100 bps shift in long-term                                            \u2014                               \u2014  \n  rates                                                                                                     \n  -100 bps shift in short-term                                         0.9                             0.6  \n  rates                                                                                                     \n  Flatter yield curve:                                                                                      \n  +100 bps shift in short-term                                        -1.0                            -0.6  \n  rates                                                                                                     \n  -100 bps shift in long-term                                            \u2014                               \u2014  \n  rates                                                                                                     \n  Non-U.S. dollar:                                                                                          \n  Parallel shift:                                                                                           \n  +100 bps shift in rates                                                \u2014                             0.6  \n  -100 bps shift in rates                                                \u2014                            -0.6  \n                                                                                                            \nEconomic Value Sensitivity In addition to earnings-\nat-risk, which is measured as a sensitivity to a\nbaseline of earnings over the next 12 months, the\nFirm also measures Economic Value Sensitivity\n(\u201cEVS\u201d). EVS stress tests the longer-term economic\nvalue of equity by measuring the sensitivity of the\nFirm\u2019s current balance sheet, primarily retained\nloans, deposits, debt and investment securities as\nwell as related hedges, under various interest rate\nscenarios. The Firm's pricing and cash flow\nassumptions associated with deposits, as well as\nprepayment assumptions for loans and securities,\nare significant factors in the EVS measure. In\naccordance with the CTC interest rate risk\nmanagement policy, the Firm has established limits\non EVS as a percentage of TCE. Certain assumptions\nused in the EVS measure may differ from those\nrequired in the fair value measurement note to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements. For example,\ncertain assets and liabilities with no stated\nmaturity, such as credit card receivables and\ndeposits, have longer assumed durations in the EVS\nmeasure.

The Firm has structural non-U.S. dollar FX exposures arising from\ncapital investments, forecasted expense and revenue, the investment securities portfolio and non-U.S.\ndollar-denominated debt issuance. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership with the LOBs, primarily manage\nthese risks on behalf of the Firm. Treasury and CIO may hedge certain of these risks using derivatives.\nRefer to Business Segment & Corporate Results on page 71 for additional information.\n                                                                                                            \n  Other sensitivity-based measures                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by\nassessing the potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (\u201cOCI\u201d) and noninterest expense\ndue to changes in relevant market variables.

               \nThe Firm is exposed to country risk through its\nlending and deposits, investing, and market-making\nactivities, whether cross-border or locally funded.\nCountry exposure includes activity with both\ngovernment and private-sector entities in a\ncountry.\n\nUnder the Firm\u2019s internal country risk management\napproach, attribution of exposure to an individual\ncountry is based on the country where the largest\nproportion of the assets of the counterparty,\nissuer, obligor or guarantor are located or where\nthe largest proportion of its revenue is derived,\nwhich may be different than the domicile (i.e.\nlegal residence) or country of incorporation.\n\nIndividual country exposures reflect an aggregation\nof the Firm\u2019s risk to an immediate default, with\nzero recovery, of the counterparties, issuers,\nobligors or guarantors attributed to that country.\nActivities which result in contingent or indirect\nexposure to a country are not included in the\ncountry exposure measure (for exa mple, providing\nclearing services or secondary exposure to\ncollateral on securities financing receivables).\n\nAssumptions are sometimes required in determining\nthe measurement and allocation of country exposure,\nparticularly in the case of certain non-linear or\nindex products, or where the nature of the\ncounterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor is not\nsuitable for attribution to an individual country.\nThe use of different measurement approaches or\nassumptions could affect the amount of reported\ncountry exposure.\n\nUnder the Firm\u2019s internal country risk measurement\nframework:\n\n\u2022 Deposits with banks are measured as the cash\nbalances placed with central banks, commercial\nbanks, and other financial institutions\n\n\u2022 Lending exposures are measured at the total\ncommitted amount (funded and unfunded), net of the\nallowance for credit losses and eligible cash and\nmarketable securities collateral received\n\n\u2022 Securities financing exposures are measured at\ntheir receivable balance, net of eligible\ncollateral received\n\n\u2022 Debt and equity securities are measured at the\nfair value of all positions, including both long\nand short positions\n\n\u2022 Counterparty exposure on derivative receivables\nis measured at the derivative\u2019s fair value, net of\nthe fair value of the eligible collateral received\n\n\u2022 Credit derivatives exposure is measured at the\nnet notional amount of protection purchased or sold\nfor the same underlying reference entity, inclusive\nof the fair value of the derivative receivable or\npayable, reflecting the manner in which the Firm\nmanages these exposures\n\nThe Firm\u2019s internal country risk reporting differs\nfrom the reporting provided under the FFIEC bank\nregulatory requirements.\n                                              \n  150    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nStress testing Stress testing is an important component of the Firm\u2019s country risk management framework,\nwhich aims to estimate and limit losses arising from a country crisis by measuring the impact of adverse\nasset price movements to a country based on market shocks combined with counterparty specific assumptions.\nCountry Risk Management periodically designs and runs tailored stress scenarios to test vulnerabilities to\nindividual countries or sets of countries in response to specific or potential market events, sector\nperformance concerns, sovereign actions and geopolitical risks. These tailored stress results are used to\ninform potential risk reduction across the Firm, as necessary. Risk reporting Country exposure and stress\nare measured and reported regularly, and used by Country Risk Management to identify trends and monitor high\nusages and breaches against limits. For country risk management purposes, the Firm may report exposure to\njurisdictions that are not fully autonomous, including dependent territories and Special Administrative\nRegions (\u201cSAR\u201d) such as Hong Kong SAR, separately from the independent sovereign states with which they are\nassociated. The following table presents the Firm\u2019s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of\nDecember 31, 2024, and their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2023. The top 20 country exposures\nrepresent the Firm\u2019s largest total exposures by individual country. Country exposures may fluct uate from\nperiod to period due to a variety of factors, including client activity, market flows and liquidity\nmanagement activities undertaken by the Firm. The increase in exposure to Germany when compared to December\n31, 2023, was driven by an increase in cash placed with the central bank of Germany, predominantly due to\nclient-driven market-making activities and higher client deposits. The increase in exposure to Japan when\ncompared to December 31, 2023, was driven by an increase in cash placed with the central bank of Japan as a\nresult of client-driven market-making activities. The Firm continues to monitor its exposure to Russia,\nwhich corresponds to cash placed with the central bank, but which excludes deposits placed on behalf of\nclients at the Deposit Insurance Agency of Russia. The Firm currently believes that its remaining exposure\nto Russia is not material.

Acute physical\nrisk drivers include the increased frequency or\nseverity of climate and weather events, such as\nfloods, wildfires and tropical cyclones. Chronic\nphysical risk drivers include more gradual shifts\nin the climate, such as sea level rise, persistent\nchanges in precipitation levels and increases in\naverage ambient temperatures.\n\nTransition risk involves the financial and economic\nconsequences of society\u2019s shift toward a lower-\ncarbon economy. Transition risk drivers include\npossible changes in public policy, adoption of new\ntechnologies and shifts in consumer preferences.\nTransition risks may also be influenced by changes\nin the physical climate.\n                                                                                                            \n   Organization and management                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm has a Climate Risk Management function\nthat is responsible for establishing and\nmaintaining the Firmwide framework and strategy for\nmanaging climate risks that may impact the Firm.\n\nOther responsibilities of Climate Risk Management\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 Setting policies, standards, procedures and\nprocesses to support identification, escalation,\nmonitoring and management of climate risk across\nthe Firm\n\n\u2022 Developing metrics, scenarios and stress testing\nmechanisms designed to assess the range of\npotential climate-related financial and economic\nimpacts to the Firm\n\n\u2022 Establishing a Firmwide climate risk data\nstrategy and the supporting climate risk technology\ninfrastructure\n\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the\nidentification, assessment and management of\nclimate risks present in their business activities\nand for the adherence to applicable climate-related\nlaws, rules and regulations.\n                                                                                                            \n  Governance and oversight                                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm\u2019s framework and strategy for managing\nclimate risk is integrated into the Firm\u2019s risk\ngovernance structure.

The Control\nManagement Organization, which consists of control\nmanagers within each LOB and Corporate, is\nresponsible for the day-to-day execution of the\nCCOR Framework.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s Global Chief Compliance Officer (\u201cCCO\u201d)\nand FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk\nAppetite is responsible for defining the CCOR\nManagement Framework and establishing the minimum\nstandards for its execution. The LOB and Corporate\naligned CCOR Lead Officers report to the Global CCO\nand FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk\nAppetite and are independent of the respective\nbusinesses or functions they oversee. The CCOR\nManagement Framework is included in the Risk\nGovernance and Oversight Policy that is reviewed\nand approved by the Board Risk Committee\nperiodically.\n\nOperational Risk Identification\n\nThe Firm utilizes a structured risk and control\nself-assessment process that is executed by the\nLOBs and Corporate. As part of this process, the\nLOBs and Corporate evaluate the effectiveness of\ntheir respective control environment to assess\ncircumstances in which controls have failed, and to\ndetermine where remediation efforts may be\nrequired. The Firm\u2019s Operational Risk and\nCompliance organization (\u201cOperational Risk and\nCompliance\u201d)\n\nprovides oversight of and challenge to these\nevaluations and may also perform independent\nassessments of significant operational risk events\nand areas of concentrated or emerging risk.\n\nOperational Risk Measurement\n\nOperational Risk and Compliance performs an\nindependent assessment of the operational risks\ninherent within the LOBs and Corporate, which\nincludes evaluating the effectiveness of the\ncontrol environments and reporting the results to\nsenior management.\n\nIn addition, Operational Risk and Compliance\nassesses operational risks through quantitative\nmeans, including operational risk-based capital and\nestimation of operational risk losses under both\nbaseline and stressed conditions.\n\nThe primary component of the operational risk-based\ncapital estimate is the Loss Distribution Approach\n(\u201cLDA\u201d) statistical model, which simulates the\nprojected frequency and severity of operational\nrisk losses based on historical data. The LDA model\nis used to estimate an aggregate operational risk\nloss over a one-year time horizon, at a 99.9%\nconfidence level. The LDA model incorporates actual\ninternal operational risk losses in the quarter\nfollowing the period in which those losses were\nrealized, and the calculation generally continues\nto reflect such losses even after the issues or\nbusiness activities giving rise to the losses have\nbeen remediated or reduced.\n\nAs required under the Basel III capital framework,\nthe Firm\u2019s operational risk capital methodology,\nwhich uses the Advanced Measurement Approach\n(\u201cAMA\u201d), incorporates internal and external losses\nas well as management\u2019s view of tail risk captured\nthrough operational risk scenario analysis, and\nevaluation of key business environment and internal\ncontrol metrics. The Firm does not reflect the\nimpact of insurance in its AMA estimate of\noperational risk capital.\n\nThe Firm considers the impact of stressed economic\nconditions on operational risk losses and develops\na forward looking view of material operational risk\nevents that may occur in a stressed environment.\nThe Firm\u2019s operational risk stress testing\nframework is utilized in calculating results for\nthe Firm\u2019s CCAR and other stress testing processes.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 97\u2013107\nfor information related to operational risk RWA,\nand CCAR.\n\nOperational Risk Monitoring and Testing\n\nThe results of risk assessments performed by\nOperational Risk and Compliance are used in\nconnection with their independent monitoring and\ntesting compliance of the LOBs and Corporate with\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    153  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nlaws, rules and regulations. Through monitoring and\ntesting, Operational Risk and Compliance\nindependently identify areas of heightened\noperational risk and tests the effectiveness of\ncontrols within the LOBs and Corporate.\n\nManagement of Operational Risk\n\nThe operational risk areas or issues identified\nthrough monitoring and testing are escalated to the\nLOBs and Corporate to be remediated through action\nplans, as needed, to mitigate operational risk.\nOperational Risk and Compliance may advise the LOBs\nand Corporate in the development and implementation\nof action plans.\n\nOperational Risk Reporting\n\nAll employees of the Firm are expected to escalate\nrisks appropriately. Risks identified by\nOperational Risk and Compliance are escalated to\nthe appropriate LOB and Corporate Control\nCommittees, as needed. Operational Risk and\nCompliance has established standards designed to\nensure that consistent operational risk reporting\nand operational risk reports are produced on a\nFirmwide basis as well as by the LOBs and\nCorporate. Reporting includes the evaluation of key\nrisk and performance indicators against established\nthresholds as well as the assessment of different\ntypes of operational risk against stated risk\nappetite. The standards establish escalation\nprotocols to senior management and to the Board of\nDirectors.\n                                                                                                            \n  Insurance                                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \nOne of the ways in which operational risk may be\nmitigated is through insurance maintained by the\nFirm. The Firm purchases insurance from commercial\ninsurers and maintains a wholly-owned captive\ninsurer, Park Assurance Company.

The estimation methods are of varying\nlevels of sophistication and are used for many\npurposes, such as the valuation of positions and\nmeasurement of risk, assessing regulatory capital\nrequirements, conducting stress testing, evaluating\nthe allowance for credit losses and making business\ndecisions. A dedicated independent function, Model\nRisk Governance and Review (\u201cMRGR\u201d), defines and\ngoverns the Firm\u2019s policies relating to the\nmanagement of model risk and risks associated with\ncertain analytical and judgment-based estimations,\nsuch as those used in risk management, budget\nforecasting and capital planning and analysis.\n\nModel risks are owned by the users of the models\nwithin the LOBs and Corporate based on the specific\npurposes of such models. Users and developers of\nmodels are responsible for developing, implementing\nand testing their models, as well as referring\nmodels to MRGR for review and approval. Once models\nhave been approved, model users and developers are\nresponsible for maintaining a robust operating\nenvironment, and must monitor and evaluate the\nperformance of the models on an ongoing basis.\nModel users and developers may seek to enhance\nmodels in response to changes in the relevant\nportfolios and in product and market developments,\nas well as to capture improvements in available\nmodeling techniques and systems capabilities.\n\nModels are tiered based on an internal standard\naccording to their complexity, the exposure\nassociated with the model and the Firm\u2019s reliance\non the model. This tiering is subject to the\napproval of MRGR. In its review of a model, MRGR\nconsiders whether the model is suitable for the\nspecific purposes for which it will be used. When\nreviewing a model, MRGR analyzes and challenges the\nmodel methodology and the reasonableness of model\nassumptions, and may perform or require additional\ntesting, including back-testing of model outcomes.\nModel reviews are approved by the appropriate level\nof management within MRGR based on the relevant\nmodel tier.\n\nUnder the Firm\u2019s Estimations and Model Risk\nManagement Policy, MRGR reviews and approves new\nmodels, as well as material changes to existing\nmodels, prior to their use. In certain\ncircumstances, exceptions may be granted to the\nFirm\u2019s policy to allow a model to be used prior to\nreview or approval. MRGR may also require the user\nto take appropriate actions to mitigate the model\nrisk if it is to be used in the interim. These\nactions will depend on the model and may include,\nfor example, limitation of trading activity.\n\nWhile models are inherently imprecise, the degree\nof imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by\nthe market or economic environment. This is\nparticularly true when the current and forecasted\nenvironments are significantly different from the\nhistorical environments upon which the models were\ndeveloped. This increased uncertainty may\nnecessitate a greater degree of judgment and\nanalytics to inform any adjustments that the Firm\nmay make to model outputs than would otherwise be\nthe case. In addition, the Firm may experience\nincreased uncertainty in its estimates if assets\nacquired differ from those used to develop the\nmodels.\n\nRefer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the\nFirm on pages 161\u2013164 and Note 2 for a summary of\nmodel-based valuations and other valuation\ntechniques.\n                                              \n  160    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                                                  \n  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM  \n                                                  \nJPMorganChase\u2019s accounting policies and use of\nestimates are integral to understanding its\nreported results. The Firm\u2019s most complex\naccounting estimates require management\u2019s judgment\nto ascertain the appropriate carrying value of\nassets and liabilities. The Firm has established\npolicies and control procedures intended to ensure\nthat estimation methods, including any judgments\nmade as part of such methods, are well-controlled,\nindependently reviewed and applied consistently\nfrom period to period. The methods used and\njudgments made reflect, among other factors, the\nnature of the assets or liabilities and the related\nbusiness and risk management strategies, which may\nvary across the Firm\u2019s businesses and portfolios.\nIn addition, the policies and procedures are\nintended to ensure that the process for changing\nmethodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The\nFirm believes its estimates for determining the\ncarrying value of its assets and liabilities are\nappropriate. The following is a brief description\nof the Firm\u2019s critical accounting estimates\ninvolving significant judgments.\n                                                                                                            \n  Allowance for credit losses                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement\u2019s estimate of expected credit losses\nover the remaining expected life of the Firm\u2019s\nfinancial assets measured at amortized cost and\ncertain off-balance sheet lending-related\ncommitments. The allowance for credit losses\ngenerally comprises:\n\n\u2022 The allowance for loan losses, which covers the\nFirm\u2019s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-\nrated),\n\n\u2022 The allowance for lending-related commitments,\nand\n\n\u2022 The allowance for credit losses on investment\nsecurities.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses involves\nsignificant judgment on a number of matters\nincluding development and weighting of\nmacroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of\nhistorical loss experience, assessment of risk\ncharacteristics, assignment of risk ratings,\nvaluation of collateral, and the determination of\nremaining expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note\n13 for further information on these judgments as\nwell as the Firm\u2019s policies and methodologies used\nto determine the Firm\u2019s allowance for credit\nlosses.\n\nOne of the most significant judgments involved in\nestimating the Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses\nrelates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to\nestimate credit losses over the eight-quarter\nforecast period within the Firm\u2019s methodology. The\neight-quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of\nmacroeconomic variables (\u201cMEVs\u201d) that are relevant\nfor exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit\n\nlosses being driven primarily by a subset of less\nthan twenty variables. The specific variables that\nhave the greatest effect on the modeled losses vary\nby portfolio and geography.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include\nregional U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. HPI.\n\n\u2022 Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S.\nunemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices,\nU.S. interest rates, U.S. corporate credit spreads,\noil prices, U.S. commercial real estate prices and\nU.S. HPI.\n\nChanges in the Firm\u2019s assumptions and forecasts of\neconomic conditions could significantly affect its\nestimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio\nat the balance sheet date or lead to significant\nchanges in the estimate from one reporting period\nto the next.\n\nAs a result of the First Republic acquisition, the\nFirm recorded an allowance for credit losses for\nthe loans acquired and lending-related commitments\nassumed as of May 1, 2023. Due to differences in\nrisk rating methodologies for the First Republic\nportfolio and the ongoing integration of products\nand systems, the allowance for credit losses for\nthe acquired wholesale portfolio was initially\nmeasured based on similar risk characteristics from\nother facilities underwritten by the Firm. Starting\nin the second quarter of 2024, the acquired\nportfolio was incorporated into the Firm's modeled\ncredit loss estimates and is now reflected in the\nwholesale sensitivity analysis below. Refer to Note\n34 for additional information on the First Republic\nacquisition.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes\nin any one factor or input might affect the overall\nallowance for credit losses because management\nconsiders a wide variety of factors and inputs in\nestimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes\nin the factors and inputs considered may not occur\nat the same rate and may not be consistent across\nall geographies or product types, and changes in\nfactors and inputs may be directionally\ninconsistent, such that improvement in one factor\nor input may offset deterioration in others.\n\nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate\nmacroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the\nmodeled credit losses determined using its central\nand relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which\nare two of the five scenarios considered in\nestimating the allowances for loan losses and\nlending-related commitments. The central and\nrelative adverse scenarios each included a full\nsuite of MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths\nand peaks/troughs of those variables over the\neight-quarter forecast period.\n\nFor example, compared to the Firm\u2019s central\nscenario shown on page 137 and in Note 13, the\nFirm\u2019s relative adverse scenario assumes an\nelevated U.S.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    161  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nunemployment rate, averaging approximately 2.1%\nhigher over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak\ndifference of approximately 3.0% in the fourth\nquarter of 2025. This analysis is not intended to\nestimate expected future changes in the allowance\nfor credit losses, for a number of reasons,\nincluding: \u2022 The allowance as of December 31, 2024,\nreflects credit losses beyond those estimated under\nthe central scenario due to the weight placed on\nthe adverse scenarios. \u2022 The impacts of changes in\nmany MEVs are both interrelated and nonlinear, so\nthe results of this analysis cannot be simply\nextrapolated for more severe changes in\nmacroeconomic variables. \u2022 Expectations of future\nchanges in portfolio composition and borrower\nbehavior can significantly affect the allowance for\ncredit losses. To demonstrate the sensitivity of\ncredit loss estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as\nof December 31, 2024, the Firm compared the modeled\nestimates under its relative adverse scenario to\nits central scenario. Without considering\noffsetting or correlated effects in other\nqualitative components of the Firm\u2019s allowance for\ncredit losses, the comparison between these two\nscenarios for the exposures below reflect the\nfollowing differences: \u2022 An increase of\napproximately $850 million for residential real\nestate loans and lending-related commitments \u2022 An\nincrease of approximately $3.7 billion for credit\ncard loans \u2022 An increase of approximately $4.1\nbillion for wholesale loans and lending-related\ncommitments This analysis relates only to the\nmodeled credit loss estimates and is not intended\nto estimate changes in the overall allowance for\ncredit losses as it does not reflect any potential\nchanges in other adjustments to the quantitative\ncalculation, which would also be influenced by the\njudgment management applies to the modeled lifetime\nloss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and\nimprecision of these modeled lifetime loss\nestimates based on then-current circumstances and\nconditions. Recognizing that forecasts of\nmacroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain,\nthe Firm believes that its process to consider the\navailable information and associated risks and\nuncertainties is appropriately governed and that\nits estimates of expected credit losses were\nreasonable and appropriate for the period ended\nDecember 31, 2024 .\n\nFair value JPMorganChase carries a portion of its\nassets and liabilities at fair value.

Estimating fair\nvalue requires the application of judgment. The\ntype and level of judgment required is largely\ndependent on the amount of observable market\ninformation available to the Firm. For instruments\nvalued using internally developed valuation models\nand other valuation techniques that use significant\nunobservable inputs and are therefore classified\nwithin level 3 of the fair value hierarchy,\njudgments used to estimate fair value are more\nsignificant than those required when estimating the\nfair value of instruments classified within levels\n1 and 2.\n\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an\ninstrument within level 3, management must first\ndetermine the appropriate valuation model or other\nvaluation technique to use. Second, the lack of\nobservability of certain significant inputs\nrequires management to assess relevant empirical\ndata in deriving valuation inputs including, for\nexample, transaction details, yield curves,\ninterest rates, prepayment speeds, default rates,\nvolatilities, correlations, prices (such as\ncommodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of\ncomparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and\ncredit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further\ndiscussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments,\nincluding unobservable inputs used.\n\nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3,\nmanagement judgment must be applied to assess the\nappropriate level of valuation adjustments to\nreflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm\u2019s\ncreditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity\nconsiderations, unobservable parameters, and for\nportfolios that meet specified criteria, the size\nof the net open risk position. The judgments made\nare typically affected by the type of product and\nits specific contractual terms, and the level of\nliquidity for the product or within the market as a\nwhole. In periods of heightened market volatility\nand uncertainty judgments are further affected by\nthe wider variation of reasonable valuation\nestimates, particularly for positions that are less\nliquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of\nvaluation adjustments applied by the Firm.\n\nImprecision in estimating unobservable market\ninputs or other factors can affect the amount of\ngain or loss recorded for a particular position.\nFurthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation\nmethods are appropriate and consistent with those\nof other market participants, the methods and\nassumptions used reflect management judgment and\nmay vary across the Firm\u2019s businesses and\nportfolios.\n\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions\nin the determination of fair value. The use of\nmethodologies or assumptions different than those\nused by the Firm could result in a different\nestimate of fair value at the reporting date. Refer\nto Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm\u2019s\nvaluation process and\n\nhierarchy, and its determination of fair value for\nindividual financial instruments.\n                                                                                                            \n  Goodwill impairment                                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \nUnder U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to\nreporting units and tested for impairment at least\nannually. The Firm\u2019s process and methodology used\nto conduct goodwill impairment testing is described\nin Note 15.\n\nManagement applies significant judgment when\ntesting goodwill for impairment. The goodwill\nassociated with each business combination is\nallocated to the related reporting units for\ngoodwill impairment testing.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the Firm\nreviewed current economic conditions, estimated\nmarket cost of equity, as well as actual business\nresults and projections of business performance.\nBased on such reviews, the Firm has concluded that\ngoodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2024.\nFor each of the reporting units, fair value\nexceeded carrying value by at least 10% and there\nwas no indication of a significant risk of goodwill\nimpairment based on current projections and\nvaluations.\n\nThe projections for the Firm\u2019s reporting units are\nconsistent with management\u2019s current business\noutlook assumptions in the short term, and the\nFirm\u2019s best estimates of long-term growth and\nreturn on equity in the longer term. Where\npossible, the Firm uses third-party and peer data\nto benchmark its assumptions and estimates.\n\nRefer to Note 15 for additional information on\ngoodwill, including the goodwill impairment\nassessment as of December 31, 2024.\n                                                                                                            \n  Credit card rewards liability                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \nJPMorganChase offers credit cards with various\nrewards programs which allow cardholders to earn\nrewards points based on their account activity and\nthe terms and conditions of the rewards program.\nGenerally, there are no limits on the points that\nan eligible cardholder can earn, nor do the points\nexpire, and the points can be redeemed for a\nvariety of rewards, including cash (predominantly\nin the form of account credits), gift cards and\ntravel. The Firm maintains a rewards liability\nwhich represents the estimated cost of rewards\npoints earned and expected to be redeemed by\ncardholders. The liability is accrued as the\ncardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when\nthe cardholder redeems points. This liability was\n$14.4 billion and $13.2 billion at December 31,\n2024 and 2023, respectively, and is recorded in\naccounts payable and other liabilities on the\nConsolidated balance sheets. The increase in the\nliability was driven by continued growth in rewards\npoints earned on higher spend and promotional\noffers outpacing redemptions throughout 2024.\n\nThe rewards liability is sensitive to redemption\nrate (\u201cRR\u201d) and cost per point (\u201cCPP\u201d) assumptions.\nThe RR\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    163  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Management\u2019s discussion and analysis                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nassumption is used to estimate the number of points\nearned by customers that will be redeemed over the\nlife of the account. The CPP assumption is used to\nestimate the cost of future point redemptions.\nThese assumptions are evaluated periodically\nconsidering historical actuals, cardholder\nredemption behavior and management judgment.\nUpdates to these assumptions will impact the\nrewards liability. As of December 31, 2024, a\ncombined increase of 25 basis points in RR and 1\nbasis point in CPP would increase the rewards\nliability by approximately $442 million.\n                                                                                                            \n  Income taxes                                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \nJPMorganChase is subject to the income tax laws of\nthe various jurisdictions in which it operates,\nincluding U.S. federal, state and local, and\nnon-U.S. jurisdictions. These laws are often\ncomplex and may be subject to different\ninterpretations. To determine the financial\nstatement impact of accounting for income taxes,\nincluding the provision for income tax expense and\nunrecognized tax benefits, JPMorganChase must make\nassumptions and judgments about how to interpret\nand apply these complex tax laws to numerous\ntransactions and business events, as well as make\njudgments regarding the timing of when certain\nitems may affect taxable income in the U.S. and\nnon-U.S. tax jurisdictions.\n\nJPMorganChase\u2019s interpretations of tax laws around\nthe world are subject to review and examination by\nthe various taxing authorities in the jurisdictions\nwhere the Firm operates, and disputes may occur\nregarding its view on a tax position. These\ndisputes over interpretations with the various\ntaxing authorities may be settled by audit,\nadministrative appeals or adjudication in the court\nsystems of the tax jurisdictions in which the Firm\noperates. JPMorganChase regularly reviews whether\nit may be assessed additional income taxes as a\nresult of the resolution of these matters, and the\nFirm records additional unrecognized tax benefits,\nas appropriate. In addition, the Firm may revise\nits estimate of income taxes due to changes in\nincome tax laws, legal interpretations, and\nbusiness strategies. It is possible that revisions\nin the Firm\u2019s estimate of income taxes may\nmaterially affect the Firm\u2019s results of operations\nin any reporting period.\n\nDeferred taxes arise from differences between\nassets and liabilities measured for financial\nreporting versus income tax return purposes.\nDeferred tax assets are recognized if, in\nmanagement\u2019s judgment, their realizability is\ndetermined to be more likely than not. Deferred\ntaxes are measured using enacted tax rates expected\nto apply to taxable income in the years in which\nthose temporary differences are expected to be\nrecovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes\nof a change in tax rates is recognized within the\nprovision for income taxes in the period enacted.\n\nThe Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in\nconnection with certain tax attributes, including\nnet operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards and\nforeign tax\n\ncredit (\u201cFTC\u201d) carryforwards. The Firm performs\nregular reviews to ascertain whether its deferred\ntax assets are realizable. These reviews include\nmanagement\u2019s estimates and assumptions regarding\nfuture taxable income, including foreign source\nincome, and may incorporate various tax planning\nstrategies, including strategies that may be\navailable to utilize NOLs and FTCs before they\nexpire. In connection with these reviews, if it is\ndetermined that a deferred tax asset is not\nrealizable, a valuation allowance is established.\nThe valuation allowance may be reversed in a\nsubsequent reporting period if the Firm determines\nthat, based on revised estimates of future taxable\nincome or changes in tax planning strategies, it is\nmore likely than not that all or part of the\ndeferred tax asset will become realizable. As of\nDecember 31, 2024, management has determined it is\nmore likely than not that the Firm will realize its\ndeferred tax assets, net of the existing valuation\nallowance.\n\nThe Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as\nnecessary when new information becomes available,\nincluding changes in tax law and regulations, and\ninteractions with taxing authorities. Uncertain tax\npositions that meet the more-likely-than-not\nrecognition threshold are measured to determine the\namount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax\nposition is measured at the largest amount of\nbenefit that management believes is more likely\nthan not to be realized upon settlement. It is\npossible that the reassessment of JPMorganChase\u2019s\nunrecognized tax benefits may have a material\nimpact on its effective income tax rate in the\nperiod in which the reassessment occurs. Although\nthe Firm believes that its estimates are\nreasonable, the final tax amount could be different\nfrom the amounts reflected in the Firm\u2019s income tax\nprovisions and accruals. To the extent that the\nfinal outcome of these amounts is different than\nthe amounts recorded, such differences will\ngenerally impact the Firm\u2019s provision for income\ntaxes in the period in which such a determination\nis made.\n\nThe Firm\u2019s provision for income taxes is composed\nof current and deferred taxes. The current and\ndeferred tax provisions are calculated based on\nestimates and assumptions that could differ from\nthe actual results reflected in income tax returns\nfiled during the subsequent year.

(\u201cJPMorganChase\u201d\nor the \u201cFirm\u201d) is responsible for establishing and\nmaintaining adequate internal control over\nfinancial reporting. Internal control over\nfinancial reporting is a process designed by, or\nunder the supervision of, the Firm\u2019s principal\nexecutive and principal financial officers, or\npersons performing similar functions, and effected\nby JPMorganChase\u2019s Board of Directors, management\nand other personnel, to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial\nstatements for external purposes in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d).\n\nJPMorganChase\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures\nthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records,\nthat, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly\nreflect the transactions and dispositions of the\nFirm\u2019s assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to\npermit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the Firm are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of JPMorganChase\u2019s\nmanagement and directors; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use or\ndisposition of the Firm\u2019s assets that could have a\nmaterial effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not prevent or\ndetect misstatements. Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are\nsubject to the risk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or\nthat the degree of compliance with the policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate. Management has\ncompleted an assessment of the effectiveness of the\nFirm\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as\nof December 31, 2024. In making the assessment,\nmanagement used the \u201cInternal Control \u2014 Integrated\nFramework\u201d (\u201cCOSO 2013\u201d) promulgated by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d).\n\nBased upon the assessment performed, management\nconcluded that as of December 31, 2024,\nJPMorganChase\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting was effective based upon the COSO 2013\nframework. Additionally, based upon management\u2019s\nassessment, the Firm determined that there were no\nmaterial weaknesses in its internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2024.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Firm\u2019s internal control\nover financial reporting as of December 31, 2024,\nhas been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an\nindependent registered public accounting firm, as\nstated in their report which appears herein.\n\nJames Dimon\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nJeremy Barnum\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial\nOfficer\n\nFebruary 14, 2025\n                                              \n  168    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.:\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal\nControl over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated\nbalance sheets of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its\nsubsidiaries (the \u201cFirm\u201d) as of December 31, 2024\nand 2023, and the related consolidated statements\nof income, comprehensive income, changes in\nstockholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for each of the\nthree years in the period ended December 31, 2024,\nincluding the related notes (collectively referred\nto as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d).

Our responsibility is to\nexpress opinions on the Firm\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial statements and on the Firm\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting based on our\naudits. We are a public accounting firm registered\nwith the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Firm in accordance\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities\nand Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the\nstandards of the PCAOB. Those standards require\nthat we plan and perform the audits to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether the consolidated\nfinancial\n\nstatements are free of material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and whether\neffective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements\nincluded performing procedures to assess the risks\nof material misstatement of the consolidated\nfinancial statements, whether due to error or\nfraud, and performing procedures that respond to\nthose risks. Such procedures included examining, on\na test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the\naccounting principles used and significant\nestimates made by management, as well as evaluating\nthe overall presentation of the consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our audit of internal control\nover financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial\nreporting, assessing the risk that a material\nweakness exists, and testing and evaluating the\ndesign and operating effectiveness of internal\ncontrol based on the assessed risk. Our audits also\nincluded performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis\nfor our opinions.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over\nFinancial Reporting\n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting is a process designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and\nprocedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of\nrecords that, in reasonable detail, accurately and\nfairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of\nthe assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded as\nnecessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and\ndirectors of the company; and (iii) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have\na material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not prevent or\ndetect misstatements. Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are\nsubject to the risk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or\nthat the degree of compliance with the policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate.\n                                                  \n  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\u2022 300 Madison Avenue  \n  \u2022New York, NY 10017                             \n                                                  \n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    169  \n                                              \nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n                                                                                                            \n  Critical Audit Matters                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nThe critical audit matters communicated below are\nmatters arising from the current period audit of\nthe consolidated financial statements that were\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the\naudit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated\nfinancial statements and (ii) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex\njudgments.

The Firm\u2019s allowance\nfor loan losses represents management\u2019s estimate of\nexpected credit losses over the remaining expected\nlife of the Firm's loan portfolios and considers\nexpected future changes in macroeconomic\nconditions. The portfolio-based component of the\nFirm\u2019s allowance for loan losses for the wholesale\nand credit card retained loan portfolios begins\nwith a quantitative calculation of expected credit\nlosses over the expected life of the loan by\napplying credit loss factors to the estimated\nexposure at default. The credit loss factors\napplied are determined based on the weighted\naverage of five internally developed macroeconomic\nscenarios that take into consideration the Firm's\neconomic outlook as derived through forecast\nmacroeconomic variables, the most significant of\nwhich are U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross\ndomestic product.

These procedures\nincluded testing the effectiveness of controls\nrelating to the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses,\nincluding controls over model validation and\ngeneration of macroeconomic scenarios. These\nprocedures also included, among others, testing\nmanagement\u2019s process for estimating the allowance\nfor loan losses, which involved (i) evaluating the\nappropriateness of the models and methodologies\nused in quantitative calculations; (ii) evaluating\nthe reasonableness of forecasts of U.S.\nunemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product;\n(iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of data\nused in the estimate; and (iv) evaluating the\nreasonableness of management\u2019s adjustments to the\nquantitative output for the impacts of model\nimprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and\nother subjective factors that are not yet otherwise\nreflected in the credit loss estimate. These\nprocedures also included the use of professionals\nwith specialized skill and knowledge to assist in\nevaluating the appropriateness of certain models,\nmethodologies and macroeconomic variables.\n\nFair Value of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments\n\nAs described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, the Firm carries $1.5\ntrillion of its assets and $586.2 billion of its\nliabilities at fair value on a recurring basis.\nIncluded in these balances are $10.9 billion of\ntrading assets and $51.8 billion of liabilities\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring basis,\ncollectively financial instruments, which are\nclassified as level 3 as they contain one or more\ninputs to valuation which are unobservable and\nsignificant to their fair value measurement. The\nFirm utilized internally developed valuation models\nand unobservable inputs to estimate fair value of\nthe level 3 financial instruments. The unobservable\ninputs used by management to estimate the fair\nvalue of certain of these financial instruments\ninclude interest rate volatility, equity\nvolatility, Bermudan switch value and correlation\nrelating to interest rates, interest rate-to-\nforeign exchange,\n                                              \n  170    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting\nFirm\n\nequity prices, equity-to-foreign exchange and\nequity-to-interest rate.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination\nthat performing procedures relating to the fair\nvalue of certain level 3 financial instruments is a\ncritical audit matter are (i) the significant\njudgment and estimation by management in\ndetermining the inputs to estimate fair value,\nwhich in turn led to a high degree of auditor\njudgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing\nprocedures and in evaluating audit evidence\nobtained related to the fair value of these\nfinancial instruments, and (ii) the audit effort\ninvolved the use of professionals with specialized\nskill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing\nprocedures and evaluating audit evidence in\nconnection with forming our overall opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements.

These procedures also included, among others,\nthe involvement of professionals with specialized\nskill and knowledge to assist in developing an\nindependent estimate of fair value for a sample of\nthese financial instruments and comparing\nmanagement\u2019s estimate to the independently\ndeveloped estimate of fair value. Developing the\nindependent estimate involved testing the\ncompleteness and accuracy of data provided by\nmanagement, developing independent inputs and, as\nappropriate, evaluating and utilizing

(\u201cJPMorganChase\u201d or the \u201cFirm\u201d), a financial holding company incorporated under\nDelaware law in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The\nFirm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial\nbanking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 32 for further discussion of\nthe Firm's reportable business segments. The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorganChase\nand its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the\naccounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. Consolidation The Consolidated\nFinancial Statements include the accounts of JPMorganChase and other entities in which the Firm has a\ncontrolling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nAssets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorganChase and\nare not included on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm determines whether it has a controlling\nfinancial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a\nvariable interest entity. Voting interest entities Voting interest entities are entities that have\nsufficient equity and provide the equity investors voting rights that enable them to make significant\ndecisions relating to the entity\u2019s operations. For these types of entities, the Firm\u2019s determination of\nwhether it has a controlling interest is primarily based on the amount of voting equity interests held.\nEntities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest, through ownership of the majority of the\nentities\u2019 voting equity interests, or through other contractual rights that give the Firm control, are\nconsolidated by the Firm. Investments in companies in which the Firm has significant influence over\noperating and financing decisions (but does not own a majority of the voting equity interests) are accounted\nfor (i) in accordance with the equity method of accounting, or (ii) at fair value if the fair value option\nwas elected. These investments are generally included in other assets, with income or loss included in\nnoninterest revenue. Certain Firm-sponsored asset management funds are structured as limited partnerships or\nlimited liability companies. For many of these entities, the Firm is the general partner or managing member,\nbut the non-affiliated partners or members have the ability to remove the Firm as the general partner or\nmanaging member without cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on a simple majority vote, or the non-\naffiliated partners or members have rights to participate in important decisions. Accordingly, the Firm does\nnot consolidate these voting interest entities. However, in the limited cases where the non-managing\npartners or members do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights, the Firm evaluates the funds\nas VIEs and consolidates the funds if the Firm is the general partner or managing member and has both power\nand a potentially significant interest. The Firm\u2019s investment companies and asset management funds have\ninvestments in both publicly-held and privately-held entities, including investments in buyouts, growth\nequity and venture opportunities. These investments are accounted for under investment company guidelines\nand, accordingly, irrespective of the percentage of equity ownership interests held, are carried on the\nConsolidated balance sheets at fair value, and are recorded in other assets, with income or loss included in\nnoninterest revenue. If consolidated, the Firm retains the accounting under such specialized investment\ncompany guidelines. Variable interest entities VIEs are entities that, by design, either (1) lack sufficient\nequity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from\nother parties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions\nrelating to the entity\u2019s operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the\nexpected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The most common\ntype of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are commonly used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain\nassets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to investors. The basic SPE structure involves a\ncompany selling assets to the SPE; the SPE funds the purchase of those assets by issuing securities to\ninvestors. The legal documents that govern the transaction specify how the cash earned on the assets must be\nallocated to the SPE\u2019s investors and other parties that have rights to those cash flows. SPEs are generally\nstructured to insulate investors from claims on the SPE\u2019s assets by creditors of other entities, including\nthe creditors of the seller of the assets. The primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has a\ncontrolling financial interest) is required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. The\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    177  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nprimary beneficiary is the party that has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance; and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the\nobligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be\nsignificant to the VIE. To assess whether the Firm has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance, the Firm considers all the facts and circumstances,\nincluding its role in establishing the VIE and its ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment\nincludes, first, identifying the activities that most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance;\nand second, identifying which party, if any, has power over those activities. In general, the parties that\nmake the most significant decisions affecting the VIE (such as asset managers, collateral managers,\nservicers, or owners of call options or liquidation rights over the VIE\u2019s assets) or have the right to\nunilaterally remove those decision-makers are deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE. To\nassess whether the Firm has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from\nthe VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Firm considers all of its economic interests,\nincluding debt and equity investments, servicing fees, and derivatives or other arrangements deemed to be\nvariable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires that the Firm apply judgment in determining whether\nthese interests, in the aggregate, are considered potentially significant to the VIE. Factors considered in\nassessing significance include: the design of the VIE, including its capitalization structure; subordination\nof interests; payment priority; relative share of interests held across various classes within the VIE\u2019s\ncapital structure; and the reasons why the interests are held by the Firm. The Firm performs on-going\nreassessments of: (1) whether entities previously evaluated under the majority voting-interest framework\nhave become VIEs, based on certain events, and are therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework; and\n(2) whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding the Firm\u2019s involvement with a VIE cause the\nFirm\u2019s consolidation conclusion to change. Refer to Note 14 for further discussion of Firm-sponsored VIEs.\nRevenue recognition Interest income The Firm recognizes interest income on loans, debt securities, and other\ndebt instruments, generally on a level-yield basis, based on the underlying contractual rate. Refer to Note\n7 for further information. Revenue from contracts with customers JPMorganChase recognizes noninterest\nrevenue from certain contracts with customers , in investment banking fees, deposit-related fees, asset\nmanagement fees, commissions and other fees, and components of card income, when the Firm\u2019s related\nperformance obligations are satisfied. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion of the Firm\u2019s revenue from\ncontracts with customers. Principal transactions revenue JPMorganChase carries a portion of its assets and\nliabilities at fair value. Changes in fair value are reported primarily in principal transactions revenue.\nRefer to Notes 2 and 3 for further discussion of fair value measurement. Refer to Note 6 for further\ndiscussion of principal transactions revenue. Use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated financial\nstatements The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expense, and\ndisclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates.\nForeign currency translation JPMorganChase revalues assets, liabilities, revenue and expense denominated in\nnon-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars using applicable exchange rates. Gains and losses relating to\ntranslating functional currency financial statements for U.S. reporting are included in the Consolidated\nstatements of comprehensive income. Gains and losses relating to nonfunctional currency transactions,\nincluding non-U.S. operations where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, are reported in the\nConsolidated statements of income. Offsetting assets and liabilities U.S. GAAP permits entities to present\nderivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral\nreceivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master\nnetting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities sold and purchased under repurchase agreements\nand securities borrowed or loaned under securities loan agreements to be presented net when specified\nconditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has\nelected to net such balances where it has determined that the specified conditions are met. The Firm uses\nmaster netting agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk in certain transactions, including derivative\ncontracts, resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned\n                                              \n  178    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nagreements. A master netting agreement is a single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple\ntransactions governed by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment\nin a single currency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or\nsecurities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due). Upon the exercise of derivatives termination\nrights by the non-defaulting party (i) all transactions are terminated, (ii) all transactions are valued and\nthe positive values of \u201cin the money\u201d transactions are netted against the negative values of \u201cout of the\nmoney\u201d transactions and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the\nnetted termination amount. Upon exercise of default rights under repurchase agreements and securities loan\nagreements in general (i) all transactions are terminated and accelerated, (ii) all values of securities or\ncash held or to be delivered are calculated, and all such sums are netted against each other and (iii) the\nonly remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount. Typical\nmaster netting agreements for these types of transactions also often contain a collateral/margin agreement\nthat provides for a security interest in, or title transfer of, securities or cash collateral/margin to the\nparty that has the right to demand margin (the \u201cdemanding party\u201d). The collateral/margin agreement typically\nrequires a party to transfer collateral/margin to the demanding party with a value equal to the amount of\nthe margin deficit on a net basis across all transactions governed by the master netting agreement, less any\nthreshold. The collateral/margin agreement grants to the demanding party, upon default by the counterparty,\nthe right to set-off any amounts payable by the counterparty against any posted collateral or the cash\nequivalent of any posted collateral/margin. It also grants to the demanding party the right to liquidate\ncollateral/margin and to apply the proceeds to an amount payable by the counterparty.

Statements of cash flows For JPMorganChase\u2019s Consolidated statements\nof cash flows, cash is defined as those amounts included in cash and due from banks and deposits with banks\non the Consolidated balance sheets. Accounting standard adopted January 1, 2024 Equity Method and Joint\nVentures: Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method The\nguidance expanded the types of tax-oriented investments, beyond affordable housing tax credit investments,\nthat the Firm can elect on a program by program basis, to be accounted for using the proportional\namortization method. This method requires the cost of eligible investments, within an elected program, to be\namortized in proportion to the tax benefits received with the resulting amortization reported directly in\nincome tax expense, which aligns with the associated tax credits and other tax benefits. Eligible\ninvestments must meet certain criteria, including that substantially all of the return is from income tax\ncredits and other income tax benefits. This guidance was adopted on January 1, 2024 under the modified\nretrospective method. The adoption of this guidance resulted in a change to the classification and timing of\nthe amortization associated with certain of the Firm's alternative energy tax-oriented investments. As a\nresult of the adoption, the amortization of these investments that was previously recognized in other income\nis now recognized in income tax expense. The change in accounting resulted in a decrease to retained\nearnings of $ 161million and increased the Firm\u2019s income tax expense and the effective tax rate by\napproximately $ 450million and twopercentage points, respectively, in the first quarter of 2024, with no\nmaterial impact to net income. The guidance requires additional disclosure for all investments that generate\nincome tax credits and other income tax benefits from a tax-oriented investment program for which the Firm\nhas elected to apply the proportional amortization method. The guidance also requires a reevaluation of\neligible investments when significant modifications or events occur that result in a change in the nature of\nthe investment or a change in the Firm's relationship with the underlying project. Refer to Notes 6, 14 and\n25 for additional information. Accounting standards adopted January 1, 2023 Derivatives and Hedging: Fair\nValue Hedging \u2013 Portfolio Layer Method The adoption of this guidance expanded the ability to hedge a\nportfolio of fixed-rate assets in a qualifying hedge accounting relationship. As permitted by the guidance,\nthe Firm elected to transfer HTM securities to AFS and designated those securities in a portfolio layer\nmethod hedge upon adoption. The adoption impact of the transfer on retained earnings was not material.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    179  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nFinancial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses: Troubled\nDebt Restructurings (\u201cTDRs\u201d) The adoption of this\nguidance eliminated the requirement to measure the\nallowance for TDRs using a discounted cash flow\n(\u201cDCF\u201d) methodology and allowed the option of a\nnon-DCF portfolio-based approach for modified loans\nto troubled borrowers. The Firm elected this option\nfor all portfolios of modified loans to troubled\nborrowers except collateral-dependent loans and\nnonaccrual risk-rated loans, for which the Firm\nelected to continue applying a DCF methodology. The\nadoption of this guidance under the modified\nretrospective method on January 1, 2023, resulted\nin a $ 446million increase to retained earnings.\n\nSignificant accounting policies\nThe following table identifies JPMorganChase\u2019s\nother significant accounting policies and the Note\nand page where a detailed description of each\npolicy can be found.\n                                                                   \n  Fair value measurement                      Note 2     page 181  \n  Fair value option                           Note 3     page 203  \n  Derivative instruments                      Note 5     page 209  \n  Noninterest revenue and noninterest         Note 6     page 225  \n  expense                                                          \n  Interest income and Interest expense        Note 7     page 229  \n  Pension and other postretirement            Note 8     page 230  \n  employee benefit plans                                           \n  Employee share-based incentives             Note 9     page 233  \n  Investment securities                       Note 10    page 235  \n  Securities financing activities             Note 11    page 240  \n  Loans                                       Note 12    page 243  \n  Allowance for credit losses                 Note 13    page 266  \n  Variable interest entities                  Note 14    page 271  \n  Goodwill, mortgage servicing rights, and    Note 15    page 280  \n  other intangible assets                                          \n  Premises and equipment                      Note 16    page 285  \n  Leases                                      Note 18    page 286  \n  Accounts payable & other liabilities        Note 19    page 288  \n  Long-term debt                              Note 20    page 289  \n  Earnings per share                          Note 23    page 294  \n  Income taxes                                Note 25    page 296  \n  Off\u2013balance sheet lending-related                                \n  financial instruments, guarantees and       Note 28    page 302  \n  other commitments                                                \n  Litigation                                  Note 30    page 309  \n                                                                   \n                                              \n  180    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Note 2 \u2013 Fair value measurement                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \nJPMorganChase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. These assets and liabilities\nare predominantly carried at fair value on a recurring basis (i.e., assets and liabilities that are measured\nand reported at fair value on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated balance sheets). Certain assets, liabilities and\nunfunded lending-related commitments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they are\nnot measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain\ncircumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). Fair value is defined as the price that\nwould be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants at the measurement date. Fair value is based on quoted market prices or inputs, where\navailable. If prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based on valuation models and other\nvaluation techniques that consider relevant transaction characteristics (such as maturity) and use, as\ninputs, observable or unobservable market parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities,\nprices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), correlations, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.\nFair value may also incorporate valuation adjustments. The level of precision in estimating unobservable\nmarket inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position.\nFurthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of\nother market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across\nthe Firm\u2019s businesses and portfolios. The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the\ndetermination of fair value. The use of different methodologies or assumptions by other market participants\ncompared with those used by the Firm could result in the Firm deriving a different estimate of fair value at\nthe reporting date. Valuation process Risk-taking functions are responsible for providing fair value\nestimates for assets and liabilities carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The Firm\u2019s\nValuation Control Group (\u201cVCG\u201d), which is part of the Firm\u2019s Finance function and independent of the risk-\ntaking functions, is responsible for verifying these estimates and determining any fair value adjustments\nthat may be required to ensure that the Firm\u2019s positions are recorded at fair value. In addition, the Firm\u2019s\nValuation Governance Forum (\u201cVGF\u201d), which is composed of senior finance and risk executives, is responsible\nfor overseeing the management of risks arising from valuation activities conducted across the Firm. The\nFirmwide VGF is chaired by the Firmwide head of the VCG (under the direction of the Firm\u2019s Controller), and\nincludes sub-forums covering the CIB, CCB, AWM and certain corporate functions including Treasury and CIO.\nPrice verification process The VCG verifies fair value estimates provided by the risk-taking functions by\nleveraging independently derived prices, valuation inputs and other market data, where available. Where\nindependent prices or inputs are not available, the VCG performs additional review to ensure the\nreasonableness of the estimates. The additional review may include evaluating the limited market activity\nincluding client unwinds, benchmarking valuation inputs to those used for similar instruments, decomposing\nthe valuation of structured instruments into individual components, comparing expected to actual cash flows,\nreviewing profit and loss trends, and reviewing trends in collateral valuation. There are also additional\nlevels of management review for more significant or complex positions. The VCG determines any valuation\nadjustments that may be required to the estimates provided by the risk-taking functions. No adjustments to\nquoted prices are applied for instruments classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy (refer to\nthe discussion of the fair value hierarchy on page 182 for further information). For other positions,\njudgment is required to assess the need for valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect liquidity\nconsiderations, unobservable parameters, and, for certain portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size\nof the net open risk position. The determination of such adjustments follows a consistent framework across\nthe Firm: \u2022 Liquidity valuation adjustments are considered where an observable external price or valuation\nparameter exists but is of lower reliability, potentially due to lower market activity. Liquidity valuation\nadjustments are made based on current market conditions. Factors that may be considered in determining the\nliquidity adjustment include analysis of: (1) the estimated bid-offer spread for the instrument being\ntraded; (2) alternative pricing points for similar instruments in active markets; and (3) the range of\nreasonable values that the price or parameter could take. \u2022 The Firm manages certain portfolios of financial\ninstruments on the basis of net open risk exposure and, as permitted by U.S. GAAP, has elected to estimate\nthe fair value of such portfolios on the basis of a transfer of the entire net open risk position in an\norderly transaction. Where this is the case, valuation adjustments may be necessary to reflect the cost of\nexiting a larger-than-normal market-size net open risk position. Where applied, such adjustments are\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    181  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nbased on factors that a relevant market participant would consider in the transfer of the net open risk\nposition, including the size of the adverse market move that is likely to occur during the period required\nto sufficiently reduce the net open risk position. \u2022 Uncertainty adjustments related to unobservable\nparameters may be made when positions are valued using prices or input parameters to valuation models that\nare unobservable due to a lack of market activity or because they cannot be implied from observable market\ndata. Such prices or parameters must be estimated and are, therefore, subject to management judgment.\nAdjustments are made to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the resulting valuation estimate. \u2022 Where\nappropriate, the Firm also applies adjustments to its estimates of fair value in order to appropriately\nreflect counterparty credit quality (CVA), the Firm\u2019s own creditworthiness (DVA) and the impact of funding\n(FVA), using a consistent framework across the Firm. Refer to Credit and funding adjustments on page 198 of\nthis Note for more information on such adjustments. Valuation model review and approval If prices or quotes\nare not available for an instrument or a similar instrument, fair value is generally determined using\nvaluation models that consider relevant transaction terms such as maturity and use as inputs market-based or\nindependently sourced parameters. Where this is the case the price verification process described above is\napplied to the inputs in those models. Under the Firm\u2019s Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy, MRGR\nreviews and approves new models, as well as material changes to existing models, prior to implementation in\nthe operating environment. In certain circumstances exceptions may be granted to the Firm\u2019s policy to allow\na model to be used prior to review or approval. MRGR may also require the user to take appropriate actions\nto mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model and\nmay include, for example, limitation of trading activity. Fair value hierarchy A three-level fair value\nhierarchy has been established under U.S. GAAP for disclosure of fair value measurements. The fair value\nhierarchy is based on the observability of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the\nmeasurement date. The three levels are defined as follows. \u2022 Level 1 \u2013 inputs to the valuation methodology\nare quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. \u2022 Level 2 \u2013 inputs to\nthe valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and\ninputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the\nfull term of the financial instrument. \u2022 Level 3 \u2013 one or more inputs to the valuation methodology are\nunobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. A financial instrument\u2019s categorization within\nthe fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement.\n

inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable\nvalue. \u201cNet realizable value\u201d is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell\n(\u201ctransaction costs\u201d). Transaction costs for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories are either not\napplicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair\nvalue for the Firm\u2019s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net\nrealizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because\nunder fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 5 for\na further discussion of the Firm\u2019s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value\ndisclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    187  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical\nsecurities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).\n\n(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its\nequivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At both\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private\nequity funds, real estate and other funds, were $ 1.0billion, primarily reported in other assets.\n\n(e) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables\nand the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement\nexists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit\nassociated with cash collateral.\n                                              \n  188    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nLevel 3 valuations\n\nThe Firm has established well-structured processes for determining fair value, including for instruments\nwhere fair value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). Refer to pages 181\u2013185 of\nthis Note for further information on the Firm\u2019s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the\ndetermination of fair value for individual financial instruments. Estimating fair value requires the\napplication of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of\nobservable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed\nvaluation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore\nclassified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more\nsignificant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and\n2. In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first\ndetermine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, due to the lack of\nobservability of significant inputs, management must assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation\ninputs including transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates,\nvolatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable\ninstruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. The following table presents the Firm\u2019s primary level\n3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial\ninstruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or\narithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is\nbased on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3\nfinancial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted\nand can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or\nlevel 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable\ncomponents of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified\nwithin levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is\nrepresentative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments\nwithin a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values\npresented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being\nused to value. In the Firm\u2019s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect\nthe degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm\u2019s estimates and\nassumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the\nrelative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts\nmay have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly\ndifferent implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or\nstrike prices. The input range and weighted and arithmetic average values will therefore vary from period-\nto-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at\neach balance sheet date.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    189  \n                                              \n

The impact of changes in inputs may not be\nindependent, as a change in one unobservable input may give rise to a change in another unobservable input.\nWhere relationships do exist between two unobservable inputs, those relationships are discussed below.\nRelationships may also exist between observable and unobservable inputs (for example, as observable interest\nrates rise, unobservable prepayment rates decline); such relationships have not been included in the\ndiscussion below. In addition, for each of the individual relationships described below, the inverse\nrelationship would also generally apply. The following discussion also provides a description of attributes\nof the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the\nvaluation of the Firm\u2019s positions. Yield \u2013 The yield of an asset is the interest rate used to discount\nfuture cash flows in a discounted cash flow calculation. An increase in the yield, in isolation, would\nresult in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Credit spread \u2013 The credit spread is the amount of\nadditional annualized return over the market interest rate that a market participant would demand for taking\nexposure to the credit risk of an instrument. The credit spread for an instrument forms part of the discount\nrate used in a discounted cash flow calculation. Generally, an increase in the credit spread would result in\na decrease in a fair value measurement. The yield and the credit spread of a particular mortgage-backed\nsecurity primarily reflect the risk inherent in the instrument. The yield is also impacted by the absolute\nlevel of the coupon paid by the instrument (which may not correspond directly to the level of inherent\nrisk). Therefore, the range of yield and credit spreads reflects the range of risk inherent in various\ninstruments owned by the Firm. The risk inherent in mortgage-backed securities is driven by the\nsubordination of the security being valued and the characteristics of the underlying mortgages within the\ncollateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores, LTV ratios for residential mortgages and the nature of\nthe property and/or any tenants for commercial mortgages. For corporate debt securities, obligations of U.S.\nstates and municipalities and other similar instruments, credit spreads reflect the credit quality of the\nobligor and the tenor of the obligation. Prepayment speed \u2013 The prepayment speed is a measure of the\nvoluntary unscheduled principal repayments of a prepayable obligation in a collateralized pool. Prepayment\nspeeds generally decline as borrower delinquencies rise. An increase in prepayment speeds, in isolation,\nwould result in a decrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a premium to par and an increase\nin a fair value measurement of assets valued at a discount to par. Prepayment speeds may vary from\ncollateral pool to collateral pool, and are driven by the type and location of the underlying borrower, and\nthe remaining tenor of the obligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or floating) of interest\nrate being paid by the borrower. Typically collateral pools with higher borrower credit quality have a\nhigher prepayment rate than those with lower borrower credit quality, all other factors being equal.\nConditional default rate \u2013 The conditional default rate is a measure of the reduction in the outstanding\ncollateral balance underlying a collateralized obligation as a result of defaults. While there is typically\nno direct relationship between conditional default rates and prepayment speeds, collateralized obligations\nfor which the underlying collateral has high prepayment speeds will tend to have lower conditional default\nrates. An increase in conditional default rates would generally be accompanied by an increase in loss\nseverity and an increase in credit spreads. An increase in the conditional default rate, in isolation, would\nresult in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Conditional default rates reflect the quality of the\ncollateral underlying a securitization and the structure of the securitization itself. Based on the types of\nsecurities owned in the Firm\u2019s market-making portfolios, conditional default rates are most typically at the\nlower end of the range presented. Loss severity \u2013 The loss severity (the inverse concept is the recovery\nrate) is the expected amount of future realized losses resulting from the ultimate liquidation of a\nparticular loan, expressed as the net amount of loss relative to the outstanding loan balance. An increase\nin loss severity is generally accompanied by an increase in conditional default rates. An increase in the\nloss severity, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The loss severity\napplied in valuing a mortgage-backed security depends on factors relating to the underlying mortgages,\nincluding the LTV ratio, the nature of the lender\u2019s lien on the property and other instrument-specific\nfactors.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    191  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nCorrelation \u2013 Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two variables.\nCorrelation is a pricing input for a derivative product where the payoff is driven by one or more underlying\nrisks. Correlation inputs are related to the type of derivative (e.g., interest rate, credit, equity,\nforeign exchange and commodity) due to the nature of the underlying risks. When parameters are positively\ncorrelated, an increase in one parameter will result in an increase in the other parameter. When parameters\nare negatively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in a decrease in the other parameter. An\nincrease in correlation can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement. Given a short\ncorrelation position, an increase in correlation, in isolation, would generally result in a decrease in a\nfair value measurement. The level of correlation used in the valuation of derivatives with multiple\nunderlying risks depends on a number of factors including the nature of those risks. For example, the\ncorrelation between two credit risk exposures would be different than that between two interest rate risk\nexposures. Similarly, the tenor of the transaction may also impact the correlation input, as the\nrelationship between the underlying risks may be different over different time periods. Furthermore,\ncorrelation levels are dependent on market conditions and could have a relatively wide range of levels\nwithin or across asset classes over time, particularly in volatile market conditions. Volatility \u2013\nVolatility is a measure of the variability in possible returns for an instrument, parameter or market index\ngiven how much the particular instrument, parameter or index changes in value over time. Volatility is a\npricing input for options, including equity options, commodity options, and interest rate options. Given a\nlong position in an option, an increase in volatility, in isolation, would generally result in an increase\nin a fair value measurement. The level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular option-based\nderivative depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the risk underlying the option (e.g., the\nvolatility of a particular equity security may be significantly different from that of a particular\ncommodity index), the tenor of the derivative as well as the strike price of the option. Bermudan switch\nvalue \u2013 The switch value is the difference between the overall value of a Bermudan swaption, which can be\nexercised at multiple points in time, and its most expensive European swaption and reflects the additional\nvalue that the multiple exercise dates provide the holder. Switch values are dependent on market conditions\nand can vary greatly depending on a number of factors, such as the tenor of the underlying swap as well as\nthe strike price of the option. An increase in switch value, in isolation, would generally result in an\nincrease in a fair value measurement. Interest rate curve \u2013 The interest rate curve represents the\nrelationship of interest rates over differing tenors. The interest rate curve is used to set interest rate\nand foreign exchange derivative cash flows and is also a pricing input used in the discounting of any\nderivative cash flow. Forward price \u2013 The forward price is the price at which the buyer agrees to purchase\nthe asset underlying a forward contract on the predetermined future delivery date, and is such that the\nvalue of the contract is zero at inception. The forward price is used as an input in the valuation of\ncertain derivatives and depends on a number of factors including interest rates, the current price of the\nunderlying asset, and the expected income to be received and costs to be incurred by the seller as a result\nof holding that asset until the delivery date. An increase in the forward can result in an increase or a\ndecrease in a fair value measurement. Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements The following\ntables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value)\nfor financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the years\nended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument\nwithin level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall\nfair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the\nunobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and\ncan be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes\nin fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. The Firm risk-\nmanages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions\nthat are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk\nmanagement instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect\nthe effect of the Firm\u2019s risk management activities

These market parameters generally do not consider factors such as\ncounterparty nonperformance risk, the Firm\u2019s own credit quality, and funding costs. Therefore, it is\ngenerally necessary to make adjustments to the base estimate of fair value to reflect these factors. CVA\nrepresents the adjustment, relative to the relevant benchmark interest rate, necessary to reflect\ncounterparty nonperformance risk. The Firm estimates CVA using a scenario analysis to estimate the expected\npositive credit exposure across all of the Firm\u2019s existing positions with each counterparty, and then\nestimates losses based on the probability of default and estimated recovery rate as a result of a\ncounterparty credit event considering contractual factors designed to mitigate the Firm\u2019s credit exposure,\nsuch as collateral and legal rights of offset. The key inputs to this methodology are (i) the probability of\na default event occurring for each counterparty, as derived from observed or estimated CDS spreads; and (ii)\nestimated recovery rates implied by CDS spreads, adjusted to consider the differences in recovery rates as a\nderivative creditor relative to those reflected in CDS spreads, which generally reflect senior unsecured\ncreditor risk. FVA represents the adjustment to reflect the impact of funding and is recognized where there\nis evidence that a market participant in the principal market would incorporate it in a transfer of the\ninstrument. The Firm\u2019s FVA framework, applied to uncollateralized (including partially collateralized) over-\nthe-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives incorporates key inputs such as: (i) the expected funding requirements\narising from the Firm\u2019s positions with each counterparty and collateral arrangements; and (ii) the estimated\nmarket funding cost in the principal market which, for derivative liabilities, considers the Firm\u2019s credit\nrisk (DVA). For collateralized derivatives, the fair value is estimated by discounting expected future cash\nflows at the relevant overnight indexed swap rate given the underlying collateral agreement with the\ncounterparty, and therefore a separate FVA is not necessary.\nThe following table provides the impact of credit\nand funding adjustments on principal transactions\nrevenue in the respective periods, excluding the\neffect of any associated hedging activities. The\nFVA presented below includes the impact of the\nFirm\u2019s own credit quality on the inception value of\nliabilities as well as the impact of changes in the\nFirm\u2019s own credit quality over time.\n                                                                                 \n  Year ended December 31,                                                        \n  (in millions)                             2024            2023           2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Credit and funding adjustments:                                                \n  Derivatives CVA                    $  29          $  221          $  22        \n  Derivatives FVA                       99             114             42        \n                                                                                 \nValuation adjustments on fair value option elected\nliabilities\n\nThe valuation of the Firm\u2019s liabilities for which\nthe fair value option has been elected requires\nconsideration of the Firm\u2019s own credit risk.

On April 8, 2024, Visa commenced an initial exchange offer for any and all outstanding Visa B-1\nshares. On May 6, 2024, the Firm announced that Visa had accepted the Firm\u2019s tender of its 37.2million Visa\nB-1 shares in exchange for a combination of Visa B-2 shares and Visa Class C common shares (\u201cVisa C\nshares\u201d), resulting in an initial gain of $ 8.0billion based on the fair value of the Visa C shares. In\naddition, the second quarter of 2024 also reflected other Visa-related activity, including the fair value\nchanges of the Visa C shares and derivative instruments, as well as dividends, resulting in the $ 7.9billion\nnet gain on Visa shares in the quarter. As of September 30, 2024, the Firm had disposed of all of its Visa C\nshares through sales in the second and third quarters of 2024 and through a $ 1.0billion contribution to the\nFirm\u2019s Foundation in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nThe Visa B-2 shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A\ncommon shares (\u201cVisa A shares\u201d) at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain litigation\nmatters involving Visa. The conversion rate of Visa B-2 shares to Visa A shares was 1.5430at December 31,\n2024 and may be adjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the litigation matters. The outcome of\nthose litigation matters, and the effect that the resolution of those matters may have on the conversion\nrate, is unknown. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2024, there is significant uncertainty regarding when the\ntransfer restrictions on Visa B-2 shares may be terminated and what the final conversion rate for the Visa\nB-2 shares will be. As a result of these considerations, as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B-2\nshares are not considered to be similar to Visa A shares, and are held at their nominal carryover basis.\n\nSeparately, in connection with sales of Visa B shares prior to 2024, the Firm has entered into derivative\ninstruments with the purchasers of the shares under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes\nin the conversion rate. Under the terms of the derivative instruments, the Firm will (a) make or receive\npayments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate and (b) make periodic interest payments to the\npurchasers of the Visa B shares. The payments under the derivative instruments will continue as long as the\nVisa B-2 shares associated with the previously sold Visa B shares remain subject to transfer restrictions.\nThe derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology based\nupon the Firm\u2019s estimate of the timing and magnitude of final resolution of the litigation matters. The\nderivative instruments are recorded in trading liabilities, and changes in fair value are recognized in\nother income. The notional amount of shares associated with those derivative instruments has been adjusted\nas a result of the Visa exchange offer. As of December 31, 2024, the Firm held derivative instruments\nassociated with 11.6million Visa B-2 shares related to Visa B share sales prior to 2024, which are all\nsubject to similar terms and conditions.\n                                              \n  200    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nAdditional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not carried on the\nConsolidated balance sheets at fair value U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of\ncertain financial instruments, which are included in the following table. However, this table does not\ninclude other items, such as nonfinancial assets, intangible assets, certain financial instruments, and\ncustomer relationships. In the opinion of management, these items, in the aggregate, add significant value\nto JPMorganChase. Financial instruments for which carrying value approximates fair value Certain financial\ninstruments that are not carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets are carried at amounts\nthat approximate fair value, due to their short-term nature and generally negligible credit risk. These\ninstruments include cash and due from banks, deposits with banks, federal funds sold, securities purchased\nunder resale agreements and securities borrowed, short-term receivables and accrued interest receivable,\nshort-term borrowings, federal funds purchased, securities loaned and sold under repurchase agreements,\naccounts payable, and accrued liabilities. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that the fair value of deposit\nliabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., demand, savings and certain money market deposits) be equal to\ntheir carrying value; recognition of the inherent funding value of these instruments is not permitted.\nThe following table presents, by fair value hierarchy classification, the carrying values and estimated fair\nvalues at December 31, 2024 and 2023, of financial assets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments\nthat are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, and their classification within the fair value\nhierarchy.\n                                                                                                            \n           De\u2026

of the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual\nfees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and\nprimary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the\nvalue of the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan\u2019s allowance for\nloan losses, which represents the loan\u2019s expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The\ndifference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to\nchanges in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that\naffect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value.\n(b) Excludes lending-related commitments disclosed in the table below.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    201  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nThe majority of the Firm\u2019s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets.

 \n(a) Unrealized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk (DVA) for liabilities for which the\nfair value option has been elected are recorded in OCI, while realized gains/(losses) are

Realized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk recorded in\nprincipal transactions revenue were not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n(b) Long-term debt measured at fair value predominantly relates to structured notes. Although the risk\nassociated with the structured notes is actively managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this table do not\ninclude the income statement impact of the risk management instruments used to manage such risk.\n(c) Reported in mortgage fees and related income.\n(d) Reported in other income.\n(e) Changes in fair value exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest\nexpense for all instruments other than certain hybrid financial instruments in CIB. Refer to Note 7 for\nfurther information regarding interest income and interest expense.\n                                              \n  204    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nDetermination of instrument-specific credit risk for items for which the fair value option was elected The\nfollowing describes how the gains and losses that are attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit\nrisk, were determined. \u2022 Loans and lending-related commitments: For floating-rate instruments, all changes\nin value are attributed to instrument-specific credit risk. For fixed-rate instruments, an allocation of the\nchanges in value for the period is made between those changes in value that are interest rate-related and\nchanges in value that are credit-related. Allocations are generally based on an analysis of borrower-\nspecific credit spread and recovery information, where available, or benchmarking to similar entities or\nindustries. \u2022 Long-term debt: Changes in value attributable to instrument-specific credit risk were derived\nprincipally from observable changes in the Firm\u2019s credit spread as observed in the bond market. \u2022 Securities\nfinancing agreements: Generally, for these types of agreements, there is a requirement that collateral be\nmaintained with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned; as a result, there\nwould be no adjustment or an immaterial adjustment for instrument-specific credit risk related to these\nagreements.\n\nDifference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding\nThe following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining\ncontractual principal balance outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, for loans, long-term debt and\nlong-term beneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected.\n

JPMorganChase regularly monitors various segments of its credit portfolios to assess\npotential credit risk concentrations and to obtain additional collateral when deemed necessary and permitted\nunder the Firm\u2019s agreements. Senior management is significantly involved in the credit approval and review\nprocess, and risk levels are adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm\u2019s risk appetite. In the Firm\u2019s consumer\nportfolio, concentrations are managed primarily by product and by U.S. geographic region, with a key focus\non trends and concentrations at the portfolio level, where potential credit risk concentrations can be\nremedied through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. Refer to Note 12 for additional\ninformation on the geographic composition of the Firm\u2019s consumer loan portfolios. In the wholesale\nportfolio, credit risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by industry and monitored regularly on both an\naggregate portfolio level and on an individual client or counterparty basis. The Firm\u2019s wholesale exposure\nis managed through loan syndications and participations, loan sales, securitizations, credit derivatives,\nmaster netting agreements, collateral and other risk-reduction techniques. Refer to Note 12 for additional\ninformation on loans.

JPMorganChase\nmakes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk\nexposures. Predominantly all of the Firm\u2019s derivatives are entered into for market-making or risk management\npurposes. Market-making derivatives The majority of the Firm\u2019s derivatives are entered into for market-\nmaking purposes. Clients use derivatives to mitigate or modify interest rate, credit, foreign exchange,\nequity and commodity risks. The Firm actively manages the risks from its exposure to these derivatives by\nentering into other derivative contracts or by purchasing or selling other financial instruments that\npartially or fully offset the exposure from client derivatives. Risk management derivatives The Firm manages\ncertain market and credit risk exposures using derivative instruments, including derivatives in hedge\naccounting relationships and other derivatives that are used to manage risks associated with specified\nassets and liabilities. The Firm generally uses interest rate derivatives to manage the risk associated with\nchanges in interest rates. Fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market value as\ninterest rates change. Similarly, interest income and expense increase or decrease as a result of variable-\nrate assets and liabilities resetting to current market rates, and as a result of the repayment and\nsubsequent origination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at current market rates. Gains and\nlosses on the derivative instruments related to these assets and liabilities are expected to substantially\noffset this variability. Foreign currency derivatives are used to manage the foreign exchange risk\nassociated with certain foreign currency\u2013denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and liabilities and\nforecasted transactions, as well as the Firm\u2019s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches\nwhose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. As a result of fluctuations in foreign currencies, the\nU.S. dollar\u2013equivalent values of the foreign currency\u2013denominated assets and liabilities or the forecasted\nrevenues or expenses increase or decrease. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments related to these\nforeign currency\u2013denominated assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions, are expected to\nsubstantially offset this variability. Commodities derivatives are used to manage the price risk of certain\ncommodities inventories. Gains or losses on these derivative instruments are expected to substantially\noffset the depreciation or appreciation of the related inventory. Credit derivatives are used to manage the\ncounterparty credit risk associated with loans and lending-related commitments. Credit derivatives\ncompensate the purchaser when the entity referenced in the contract experiences a credit event, such as\nbankruptcy or a failure to pay an obligation when due. Credit derivatives primarily consist of CDS. Refer to\nthe Credit derivatives section on pages 222\u2013224 of this Note for a further discussion of credit derivatives.\nRefer to the risk management derivatives gains and losses table on page 221 and the hedge accounting gains\nand losses tables on pages 218\u2013221 of this Note for more information about risk management derivatives.\nDerivative counterparties and settlement types The Firm enters into OTC derivatives, which are negotiated\nand settled bilaterally with the derivative counterparty. The Firm also enters into, as principal, certain\nETD such as futures and options, and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with CCPs. ETD contracts are generally\nstandardized contracts traded on an exchange and cleared by the CCP, which is the Firm\u2019s counterparty from\nthe inception of the transactions. OTC-cleared derivatives are traded on a bilateral basis and then novated\nto the CCP for clearing. Derivative clearing services The Firm provides clearing services for clients in\nwhich the Firm acts as a clearing member at certain exchanges and clearing houses. The Firm does not reflect\nthe clients\u2019 derivative contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 28 for further\ninformation on the Firm\u2019s clearing services. Accounting for derivatives All free-standing derivatives that\nthe Firm executes for its own account are required to be recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair\nvalue. As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets derivative assets and liabilities, and the related cash\ncollateral receivables and payables, when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists between the\nFirm and the derivative counterparty. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and\nliabilities. The accounting for changes in value of a derivative depends on whether or not the transaction\nhas been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are\nreported and measured at fair value through earnings. The tabular disclosures on pages 213\u2013221 of this Note\nprovide additional information on the amount of, and reporting for, derivative assets, liabilities, gains\nand losses. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for a further discussion of derivatives embedded in structured notes.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    209  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nDerivatives designated as hedges The Firm applies hedge accounting to certain derivatives executed for risk\nmanagement purposes \u2013 generally interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. However,\nJPMorganChase does not seek to apply hedge accounting to all of the derivatives associated with the Firm\u2019s\nrisk management activities. For example, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to purchased CDS used to\nmanage the credit risk of loans and lending-related commitments, because of the difficulties in qualifying\nsuch contracts as hedges. For the same reason, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to certain interest\nrate, foreign exchange, and commodity derivatives used for risk management purposes. To qualify for hedge\naccounting, a derivative must be highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being\nhedged. In addition, for a derivative to be designated as a hedge, the risk management objective and\nstrategy must be documented. Hedge documentation must identify the derivative hedging instrument, the asset\nor liability or forecasted transaction and type of risk to be hedged, and how the effectiveness of the\nderivative is assessed prospectively and retrospectively. To assess effectiveness, the Firm uses statistical\nmethods such as regression analysis, nonstatistical methods such as dollar-value comparisons of the change\nin the fair value of the derivative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item, and\nqualitative comparisons of critical terms and the evaluation of any changes in those terms. The extent to\nwhich a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in\nthe fair value or cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed and documented at least quarterly. If it is\ndetermined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is\ndiscontinued. There are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair value hedges, cash flow hedges\nand net investment hedges. JPMorganChase uses fair value hedges primarily to hedge fixed-rate long-term\ndebt, AFS securities and certain commodities inventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, the changes in\nthe fair value of the derivative, and in the value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are\nrecognized in earnings. Certain amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in OCI\nand recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then\nthe adjustment to the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the hedged item and, for\ninterest-bearing financial instruments, is amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment. Derivative amounts\naffecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item \u2013 primarily net\ninterest income and principal transactions revenue. The Firm employs the portfolio layer method to manage\nthe interest rate risk of portfolios of fixed-rate assets. Throughout the life of the open hedge, basis\nadjustments are maintained at the portfolio level and are only allocated to individual assets under certain\ncircumstances. These include instances where the portfolio amount falls below the hedged layer amounts, or\nin cases of voluntary de-designation. JPMorganChase uses cash flow hedges primarily to hedge the exposure to\nvariability in forecasted cash flows from floating-rate assets and liabilities and foreign\ncurrency\u2013denominated revenue and expense. For qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the\nderivative are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings as the hedged item affects earnings. Derivative\namounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item \u2013 primarily\nnoninterest revenue, net interest income and compensation expense. If the hedge relationship is terminated,\nthen the change in value of the derivative recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when the cash flows\nthat were hedged affect earnings. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted\ntransaction is expected to not occur according to the original hedge forecast, any related derivative values\nrecorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings. JPMorganChase uses net investment hedges to protect\nthe value of the Firm\u2019s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional\ncurrencies are not the U.S. dollar. For qualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the\nderivatives due to changes in spot foreign exchange rates are recorded in OCI as translation adjustments.\nAmounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded directly in earnings.\n                                              \n  210    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n

Where such a legal\nopinion has not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables.\nIn addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative\nreceivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and\ncash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm\u2019s derivative instruments,\nbut are not eligible for net presentation:\n\u2022 collateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians,\nwhich are shown separately as \"Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets\" in the tables, up\nto the fair value exposure amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities\nis consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule;\n\u2022 the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual\ncounterparty level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables; and\n\u2022 collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate\nlegal opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is\nexcluded from the

The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net\nderivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or\ntermination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm\nhas posted in the normal course of business, at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n                                                                                                            \n  OTC and OTC-cleared derivative                                                                            \n  payables containing downgrade                                                                             \n  triggers                                                                                                  \n  (in millions)                           December 31, 2024                 December 31, 2023               \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Aggregate fair value of net                                                                               \n  derivative                                                   $  15,371                         $  14,655  \n  payables                                                                                                  \n  Collateral posted                                               15,204                            14,673  \n                                                                                                            \nThe following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer\nratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at December\n31, 2024 and 2023, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or\ntermination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require\nadditional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined rating threshold is\nbreached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting\ncorresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional\ncollateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings\ndowngrade), nor in termination payment requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based\nupon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative\ncontract.\n                                                                                                            \n  Liquidity                                                                                                 \n  impact of                                                                                                 \n  downgrade                                                                                                 \n  triggers                                                                                                  \n  on OTC and                                                                                                \n  OTC-cleared             December 31,                                 December 31,                         \n  derivatives                     2024                                         2023                         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (in millions)           Single-notch              Two-notch          Single-notch              Two-notch  \n                             downgrade              downgrade             downgrade              downgrade  \n  Amount of                                                                                                 \n  additional                                                                                                \n  collateral to     $              119    $             1,205    $               75    $             1,153  \n  be                                                                                                        \n  posted upon                                                                                               \n  downgrade(a)                                                                                              \n  Amount                                                                                                    \n  required to                                                                                               \n  settle                                                                                                    \n  contracts with                    78                    458                    93                    592  \n  termination                                                                                               \n  triggers upon                                                                                             \n  downgrade(b)                                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \n(a) Includes the additional collateral to be posted for initial margin.\n\n(b) Amounts represent fair values of derivative payables, and do not reflect collateral posted.\n\nDerivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset\n\nIn certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains\nthe economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in\ncontemplation of the initial transfer.

Credit derivatives\nexpose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller, as the protection seller\nis required to make payments under the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event, such\nas a bankruptcy, a failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring. The seller of credit protection\nreceives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument referenced in\nthe contract will be subject to a credit event. The Firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the\ncredit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes. First, in its capacity as a\nmarket-maker, the Firm actively manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit\nprotection, predominantly on corporate debt obligations, to meet the needs of customers. Second, as an end-\nuser, the Firm uses credit derivatives to manage credit risk associated with lending exposures (loans and\nunfunded commitments) in its wholesale and consumer businesses and derivatives counterparty exposures in its\nwholesale businesses, and to manage the credit risk arising from certain financial instruments in the Firm\u2019s\nmarket-making businesses. Following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives. Credit default\nswaps Credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single reference entity (\u201csingle-name\u201d),\nbroad-based index or portfolio. The Firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-\nreference obligations. Single-name CDS and index CDS contracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared derivative\ncontracts. Single-name CDS are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity, while index CDS\ncontracts are used to manage the credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market\nsegments. Like the S&P 500 and other market indices, a CDS index consists of a portfolio of CDS across many\nreference entities. New series of CDS indices are periodically established with a new underlying portfolio\nof reference entities to reflect changes in the credit markets. If one of the reference entities in the\nindex experiences a credit event, then the reference entity that defaulted is removed from the index. CDS\ncan also be referenced against specific portfolios of reference names or against customized exposure levels:\nfor example, to provide protection against the first $ 1million of realized credit losses in a $ 10million\nportfolio of exposure. Such structures are commonly known as tranche CDS. For both single-name CDS contracts\nand index CDS contracts, upon the occurrence of a credit event, under the terms of a CDS contract neither\nparty to the CDS contract has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the\nprotection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value of the\nreference obligation at settlement of the credit derivative contract, also known as the recovery value. The\nprotection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order\nto receive amounts due under the CDS contract when a credit event occurs. Credit-related notes A credit-\nrelated note is a funded derivative with a credit risk component where the issuer of the credit-related note\npurchases from the note investor credit protection on a reference entity or an index. Under the contract,\nthe investor pays the issuer the par value of the note at the inception of the transaction, and in return,\nthe issuer makes periodic payments to the investor, based on the credit risk of the referenced entity. The\nissuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity (or one of\nthe entities that makes up a reference index) experiences a specified credit event. If a credit event\noccurs, the issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note, but rather, the issuer pays the\ninvestor the difference between the par value of the note and the fair value of the defaulted reference\nobligation at the time of settlement. Neither party to the credit-related note has recourse to the\ndefaulting reference entity. The following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit\nderivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Upon a\ncredit event, the Firm as a seller of protection would typically pay out a percentage of the full notional\namount of net protection sold, as the amount actually required to be paid on the contracts takes into\naccount the recovery value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement. The Firm manages the\ncredit risk on contracts to sell protection by purchasing protection with identical or similar underlying\nreference entities. Other purchased protection referenced in the following tables includes credit\nderivatives bought on related, but not identical, reference positions (including indices, portfolio coverage\nand other reference points) as well as protection purchased by CIB through credit-related notes. Other\npurchased protection also includes credit protection against certain loans in the retained lending portfolio\nthrough the issuance of credit derivatives and credit-related notes.\n

primary measure of risk management for\nsuch derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence\nof a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic\nhedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm\u2019s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.\n

in\ninvestment banking fees, deposit-related fees,\nasset management fees, commissions and other fees,\nand components of card income. The related\ncontracts are often terminable on demand and the\nFirm has no remaining obligation to deliver future\nservices. For arrangements with a fixed term, the\nFirm may commit to deliver services in the future.\nRevenue associated with these remaining performance\nobligations typically depends on the occurrence of\nfuture events or underlying asset values, and is\nnot recognized until the outcome of those events or\nvalues are known. Investment banking fees This\nrevenue category includes debt and equity\nunderwriting and advisory fees. As an underwriter,\nthe Firm helps clients raise capital via public\noffering and private placement of various types of\ndebt and equity instruments. Underwriting fees are\nprimarily based on the issuance price and quantity\nof the underlying instruments, and are recognized\nas revenue typically upon execution of the client\u2019s\ntransaction. The Firm also manages and syndicates\nloan arrangements. Credit arrangement and\nsyndication fees, included within debt underwriting\nfees, are recorded as revenue after satisfying\ncertain retention, timing and yield criteria.

In connection with its client-driven market-making activities, the Firm transacts\nin debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities, including physical commodities inventories and\nfinancial instruments that reference commodities. Principal transactions revenue also includes realized and\nunrealized gains and losses related to: \u2022 derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting\nrelationships, primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk; \u2022 derivatives used for\nspecific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit, foreign exchange and interest rate risks.\nRefer to Note 5 for further information on the income statement classification of gains and losses from\nderivatives activities. In the financial commodity markets, the Firm transacts in OTC derivatives (e.g.,\nswaps, forwards, options) and ETD that reference a wide range of underlying commodities. In the physical\ncommodity markets, the Firm primarily purchases and sells precious and base metals, natural gas, and may\nhold other commodities inventories under financing and other arrangements with clients.

Substantially all the defined benefit pension plans are closed to\nnew participants. The principal defined benefit pension plan in the U.S., which covered substantially all\nU.S. employees, was closed to new participants and frozen for existing participants on January 1, 2020, (and\nJanuary 1, 2019 for new hires on or after December 2, 2017). Interest credits continue to accrue to\nparticipants\u2019 accounts based on their accumulated balances. The Firm maintains funded and unfunded\npostretirement benefit plans that provide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees and\nretirees as well as their dependents covered under these programs. None of these plans have a material\nimpact on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Firm also provides a qualified defined\ncontribution plan in the U.S. and maintains other similar arrangements in certain non-U.S. locations. The\nmost significant of these plans is the JPMorgan Chase 401(k) Savings Plan (\u201cthe 401(k) Savings Plan\u201d), which\ncovers substantially all U.S. employees. Employees can contribute to the 401(k) Savings Plan on a pretax\nand/or Roth 401(k) after-tax basis. The Firm makes annual matching and pay credit contributions to the\n401(k) Savings Plan on behalf of eligible participants.\nThe following table presents the pretax benefit obligations, plan assets, the net funded status, and the\namounts recorded in AOCI on the Consolidated balance sheets for the Firm\u2019s significant defined benefit\npension and OPEB plans.\n                                                                                    \n  As of or for the year ended December 31,                                          \n  (in millions)                                           2024                2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Projected benefit obligations               $  -14,459          $  -14,740        \n  Fair value of plan assets                       22,201              22,013        \n  Net funded status                                7,742               7,273        \n  Accumulated other comprehensive                 -1,649              -1,517        \n  income/(loss)                                                                     \n                                                                                    \nThe weighted-average discount rate used to value the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2024 and 2023,\nwas 5.49% and 5.16%, respectively.\n\nGains and losses\n\nGains or losses resulting from changes in the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets are\nrecorded in OCI. Amortization of net gains or losses are recognized as part of the net periodic benefit cost\nover subsequent periods, if, as of the beginning of the year, the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the\ngreater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of the plan assets. Amortization is generally\nover the average expected remaining lifetime of plan participants, given the frozen status of most plans.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the net loss was attributable to lower than expected returns on plan\nassets, partially offset by projected benefit obligation net gains primarily related to changes in the\ndiscount rate. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the net gain was attributable to market-driven\nincreases in the fair value of plan assets, partially offset by changes in the discount rate and interest\ncrediting rate.\nThe following table presents the net periodic benefit costs reported in the Consolidated statements of\nincome for the Firm\u2019s defined benefit pension, defined contribution and OPEB plans, and in other\ncomprehensive income for the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.\n                                                                                                     \n  Year ended December 31, (in millions)                2024            2023              2022        \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Total net periodic defined benefit plan    $   -462        $   -393          $   -192          -b  \n  cost/(credit)(a)                                                                                   \n  Total defined contribution plans              1,733           1,609             1,408              \n  Total pension and OPEB cost included in    $  1,271        $  1,216          $  1,216              \n  noninterest expense                                                                                \n  Total recognized in other comprehensive    $    131        $   -421          $  1,459              \n  (income)/loss                                                                                      \n                                                                                                     \n(a) The service cost component of net periodic defined benefit cost is reported in compensation expense; all\nother components of net periodic defined benefit costs are reported in other expense in the Consolidated\nstatements of income.\n(b) Includes pension settlement losses of $ 92million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n                                              \n  230    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nThe following table presents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine the net periodic\nbenefit costs for the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.\n                                                                         \n  Year ended December 31,                 2024       2023       2022     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Discount rate                           5.16  %    5.14  %    2.54  %  \n  Expected long-term rate of return on    6.15  %    5.74  %    3.68  %  \n  plan assets                                                            \n                                                                         \nPlan assumptions The Firm\u2019s expected long-term rate\nof return is a blended weighted average, by asset\nallocation of the projected long-term returns for\nthe various asset classes, taking into\nconsideration local market conditions and the\nspecific allocation of plan assets. Returns on\nasset classes are developed using a forward-looking\napproach and are not strictly based on historical\nreturns, with consideration given to current market\nconditions and the portfolio mix of each plan. The\ndiscount rates used in determining the benefit\nobligations are generally provided by the Firm\u2019s\nactuaries, with the Firm\u2019s principal defined\nbenefit pension plan using a rate that was selected\nby reference to the yields on portfolios of bonds\nwith maturity dates and coupons that closely match\nthe plan\u2019s projected annual cash flows.\n\nInvestment strategy and asset allocation The assets\nof the Firm\u2019s defined benefit pension plans are\nheld in various trusts and are invested in well-\ndiversified portfolios of equity and fixed income\nsecurities, cash and cash equivalents, and\nalternative investments. The Firm regularly reviews\nthe asset allocations and asset managers, as well\nas other factors that could impact the portfolios,\nwhich are rebalanced when deemed necessary. As of\nDecember 31, 2024, the approved asset allocation\nranges by asset class for the Firm\u2019s principal\ndefined benefit plan are 41- 100% debt securities,\n0- 40% equity securities, 0- 1% real estate, and 0-\n8% alternatives. Assets held by the Firm\u2019s defined\nbenefit pension and OPEB plans do not include\nsecurities issued by JPMorganChase or its\naffiliates, except through indirect exposures\nthrough investments in exchange traded funds,\nmutual funds and collective investment funds\nmanaged by third-parties. The defined benefit\npension and OPEB plans hold investments that are\nsponsored or managed by affiliates of JPMorganChase\nin the amount of $ 1.8billion as of both December\n31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nFair value measurement of the plans\u2019 assets and\nliabilities\n\nRefer to Note 2 for information on fair value\nmeasurements, including descriptions of level 1, 2,\nand 3 of the fair

Under the terms of the LTIP, as of December 31, 2024, 81million shares of common\nstock were available for issuance through May 2028. The LTIP is the only active plan under which the Firm is\ncurrently granting share-based incentive awards. In the following discussion, the LTIP constitutes the\nFirm\u2019s share-based incentive plans. RSUs are awarded at no cost to the recipient upon their grant.\nGenerally, RSUs are granted annually and vest at a rate of 50% after two yearsand 50% after three yearsand\nare converted into shares of common stock as of the vesting date. In addition, RSUs typically include full-\ncareer eligibility provisions, which allow employees to continue to vest upon voluntary termination based on\nage and/or service-related requirements, subject to post-employment and other restrictions. All RSU awards\nare subject to forfeiture until vested and contain clawback provisions that may result in cancellation under\ncertain specified circumstances. Predominantly all RSUs entitle the recipient to receive cash payments\nequivalent to any dividends paid on the underlying common stock during the period the RSUs are outstanding.\nPerformance share units (\u201cPSUs\u201d) are granted annually, and approved by the Firm\u2019s Board of Directors, to\nmembers of the Firm\u2019s Operating Committee under the variable compensation program. PSUs are subject to the\nFirm\u2019s achievement of specified performance criteria over a three-yearperiod. The number of awards that vest\ncan range from zeroto 150% of the grant amount. In addition, dividends that accrue during the vesting period\nare reinvested in dividend equivalent share units. PSUs and the related dividend equivalent share units are\nconverted into shares of common stock after vesting. Once the PSUs and dividend equivalent share units have\nvested, the shares of common stock that are delivered, after applicable tax withholding, must be retained\nfor an additional holding period, for a total combined vesting and holding period of approximately fiveto\neight yearsfrom the grant date depending on regulations in certain countries. Under the LTI Plans, stock\nappreciation rights (\u201cSARs\u201d) were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of JPMorganChase\u2019s\ncommon stock on the grant date. SARs expire ten yearsafter the grant date. There were nogrants of SARs in\n2024, 2023 or 2022. The Firm separately recognizes compensation expense for each tranche of each award, net\nof estimated forfeitures, as if it were a separate award with its own vesting date. Generally, for each\ntranche granted, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the\nvesting date of the respective tranche, provided that the employees will not become full-career eligible\nduring the vesting period. For awards with full-career eligibility provisions and awards granted with no\nfuture substantive service requirement, the Firm accrues the estimated value of awards expected to be\nawarded to employees as of the grant date without giving consideration to the impact of post-employment\nrestrictions. For each tranche granted to employees who will become full-career eligible during the vesting\nperiod, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the earlier of\nthe employee\u2019s full-career eligibility date or the vesting date of the respective tranche. The Firm\u2019s policy\nfor issuing shares upon settlement of employee share-based incentive awards is to issue either new shares of\ncommon stock or treasury shares. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Firm settled all of its employee share-\nbased awards by issuing treasury shares.

AFS securities\nare carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and losses, after any\napplicable hedge accounting adjustments or allowance for credit losses, are reported in AOCI. The specific\nidentification method is used to determine realized gains and losses on AFS securities, which are included\nin investment securities gains/(losses) on the Consolidated statements of income. HTM securities, which the\nFirm has the intent and ability to hold until maturity, are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for\ncredit losses, on the Consolidated balance sheets. For both AFS and HTM securities, purchase discounts or\npremiums are generally amortized into interest income on a level-yield basis over the contractual life of\nthe security. However, premiums on certain callable debt securities are amortized to the earliest call date.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    235  \n

Under U.S. GAAP portfolio layer method basis adjustments are not allocated to individual\nsecurities, however the amounts impact the unrealized gains or losses in the table for the types of\nsecurities being hedged.

The Firm transferred obligations of U.S. states\nand municipalities with a carrying value of $ 7.1billion resulting in the recognition of $ 38million net\npre-tax unrealized losses in AOCI. This transfer was a non-cash transaction.

The\nFirm generally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable, consistent\nwith its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income. The Firm did\nnot reverse through interest income any accrued interest receivable for the years ended December 31, 2024\nand 2023.\n                                              \n  236    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nAt December 31, 2024 , the investment securities portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average\ncredit rating of AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily\nupon internal risk ratings). Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of securities and\ndifferentiate risk within the portfolio. The Firm\u2019s internal risk ratings generally align with the\nqualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to\nchanges in the economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody\u2019s, however the quantitative characteristics\n(e.g., probability of default (\u201cPD\u201d) and loss given default (\u201cLGD\u201d)) may differ as they reflect internal\nhistorical experiences and assumptions. Risk ratings are assigned at acquisition, reviewed on a regular and\nongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and adjusted as necessary over the life of the investment for\nupdated information affecting the issuer\u2019s ability to fulfill its obligations.\n\nAFS securities impairment\nThe following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses by aging category for AFS securities\nat December 31, 2024 and 2023.

The Firm\nrecognizes impairment losses in earnings if the\nFirm has the intent to sell the debt security, or\nif it is more likely than not that the Firm will be\nrequired to sell the debt security before recovery\nof its amortized cost. In these circumstances the\nimpairment loss is recognized in investment\nsecurities gains/(losses) in the Consolidated\nStatements of Income and is equal to the full\ndifference between the amortized cost (net of\nallowance if applicable) and the fair value of the\nsecurity. For impaired debt securities that the\nFirm has the intent and ability to hold, the\nsecurities are evaluated to determine if a credit\nloss exists. If it is determined that a credit loss\nexists, that loss is recognized as an allowance for\ncredit losses through the provision for credit\nlosses in the Consolidated Statements of Income,\nlimited by the amount of impairment. Any impairment\non debt securities that the Firm has the intent and\nability to hold not due to credit losses is\nrecorded in OCI. Factors considered in evaluating\ncredit losses include adverse conditions\nspecifically related to the industry, geographic\narea or financial condition of the issuer or\nunderlying collateral of a security; and payment\nstructure of the security. When assessing\nsecurities issued in a securitization for credit\nlosses, the Firm estimates cash flows considering\nrelevant market and economic data, underlying loan-\nlevel data, and structural features of the\nsecuritization, such as subordination, excess\nspread, overcollateralization or other forms of\ncredit enhancement, and compares the losses\nprojected for the underlying collateral (\u201cpool\nlosses\u201d) against the level of credit enhancement in\nthe securitization structure to determine whether\nthese features are sufficient to absorb the pool\nlosses, or whether a credit loss exists. For\nbeneficial interests in securitizations that are\nrated below \u201cAA\u201d at their acquisition, or that can\nbe contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in\nsuch a way that the Firm would not recover\nsubstantially all of its recorded investment, the\nFirm evaluates impairment for credit losses when\nthere is an adverse change in expected cash flows.\nHTM securities \u2013 credit risk Allowance for credit\nlosses The allowance for credit losses on HTM\nsecurities represents expected credit losses over\nthe remaining expected life of the securities. The\nallowance for credit losses on HTM obligations of\nU.S. states and municipalities and commercial\nmortgage-backed securities is calculated by\napplying statistical credit loss factors (estimated\nPD and LGD)\n\nto the amortized cost. The credit loss factors are\nderived using a weighted average of five internally\ndeveloped eight-quarter macroeconomic scenarios,\nfollowed by a single year straight-line\ninterpolation to revert to long run historical\ninformation for periods beyond the forecast period.\nRefer to Note 13 for further information on the\neight-quarter macroeconomic forecast. The allowance\nfor credit losses on HTM collateralized loan\nobligations and U.S. residential mortgage-backed\nsecurities is calculated as the difference between\nthe amortized cost and the present value of the\ncash flows expected to be collected, discounted at\nthe security\u2019s effective interest rate. These cash\nflow estimates are developed based on expectations\nof underlying collateral performance derived using\nthe eight-quarter macroeconomic forecast and the\nsingle year straight-line interpolation, as well as\nconsidering the structural features of the\nsecurity. The application of different inputs and\nassumptions into the calculation of the allowance\nfor credit losses is subject to significant\nmanagement judgment, and emphasizing one input or\nassumption over another, or considering other\ninputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of\nthe allowance for credit losses on HTM securities.\nCredit quality indicator The primary credit quality\nindicator for HTM securities is the risk rating\nassigned to each security.At both December 31, 2024\nand 2023, all HTM securities were rated investment\ngrade and were current and accruing, with\napproximately 99% rated at least AA+ (based upon\nexternal ratings where available, and where not\navailable, based primarily upon internal risk\nratings). Allowance for credit losses on investment\nsecurities The allowance for credit losses on\ninvestment securities was $ 152million, $\n128million and $ 96million as of December 31, 2024,\n2023 and 2022, respectively, which included a\ncumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings\nrelated to the transfer of HTM securities to AFS\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023.

The effective yield considers the contractual coupon,\namortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives,\nincluding closed portfolio hedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield\nexcludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from\ntheir contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable\ndebt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.\n(b) For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the allowance\nfor credit losses of $ 49million and the portfolio layer fair value hedge basis adjustments of $( 1.2)\nbillion at December 31, 2024. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities also excludes the allowance\nfor credit losses of $ 103million at December 31, 2024.\n(c) Substantially all of the Firm\u2019s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in\n10years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects\nanticipated future prepayments, is approximately eight yearsfor agency residential MBS, six yearsfor agency\nresidential collateralized mortgage obligations, and five yearsfor nonagency residential collateralized\nmortgage obligations.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    239  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Note 11 \u2013 Securities financing activities                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \nJPMorganChase enters into resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements\n(collectively, \u201csecurities financing agreements\u201d) primarily to finance the Firm\u2019s inventory positions,\nacquire securities to cover short sales, accommodate customers\u2019 financing needs, settle other securities\nobligations and to deploy the Firm\u2019s excess cash. Securities financing agreements are treated as\ncollateralized financings on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated balance sheets. Where appropriate under applicable\naccounting guidance, securities financing agreements with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis.\nRefer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. Fees received and paid\nin connection with securities financing agreements are recorded over the life of the agreement in interest\nincome and interest expense on the Consolidated statements of income. The Firm has elected the fair value\noption for certain securities financing agreements. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding the\nfair value option. The securities financing agreements for which the fair value option has been elected are\nreported within securities purchased under resale agreements, securities loaned or sold under repurchase\nagreements, and securities borrowed on the Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements carried at\nfair value, current-period interest accruals are recorded within interest income and interest expense, with\nchanges in fair value reported in principal transactions revenue. However, for financial instruments\ncontaining embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with accounting\nguidance for hybrid instruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest elements, are reported in\nprincipal transactions revenue. Securities financing agreements not elected under the fair value option are\nmeasured at amortized cost. As a result of the Firm\u2019s credit risk mitigation practices described below, the\nFirm did not hold any allowance for credit losses with respect to resale and securities borrowed\narrangements as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Credit risk mitigation practices Securities financing\nagreements expose the Firm primarily to credit and liquidity risk. To manage these risks, the Firm monitors\nthe value of the underlying securities (predominantly high-quality securities collateral, including\ngovernment-issued debt and U.S. GSEs and government agencies MBS) that it has received from or provided to\nits counterparties compared to the value of cash proceeds and exchanged collateral, and either requests\nadditional collateral or returns securities or collateral when appropriate. Margin levels are initially\nestablished based upon the counterparty, the type of underlying securities, and the permissible collateral,\nand are monitored on an ongoing basis. In resale and securities borrowed agreements, the Firm is exposed to\ncredit risk to the extent that the value of the securities received is less than initial cash principal\nadvanced and any collateral amounts exchanged. In repurchase and securities loaned agreements, credit risk\nexposure arises to the extent that the value of underlying securities advanced exceeds the value of the\ninitial cash principal received, and any collateral amounts exchanged. Additionally, the Firm typically\nenters into master netting agreements and other similar arrangements with its counterparties, which provide\nfor the right to liquidate the underlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged in the event of a\ncounterparty default. It is also the Firm\u2019s policy to take possession, where possible, of the securities\nunderlying resale and securities borrowed agreements. Refer to Note 29 for further information regarding\nassets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements.\n                                              \n  240    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nThe table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm\u2019s securities financing agreements, as of\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master\nnetting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the\nFirm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing\nagreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral\nwith its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not\neligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal\nopinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with securities\nfinancing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the\ntable below as \u201cAmounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,\u201d and reduces the \u201cNet amounts\u201d\npresented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances\nare presented gross in the \u201cNet amounts\u201d below. In transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a\nsecurities-for-securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as\ncollateral, the Firm recognizes the securities received at fair value within other assets and the obligation\nto return those securities within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n

These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing\ntransactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding\nliabilities are recorded primarily in short-term borrowings and long-term debt on the Consolidated balance\nsheets.\n                                              \n  242    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Note 12 \u2013 Loans                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \nLoan accounting framework The accounting for a loan depends on management\u2019s strategy for the loan. The Firm\naccounts for loans based on the following categories: \u2022 Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment\n(i.e., \u201cretained\u201d) \u2022 Loans held-for-sale \u2022 Loans at fair value The following provides a detailed accounting\ndiscussion of the Firm\u2019s loans by category: Loans held-for-investment Originated or purchased loans held-\nfor-investment, including PCD, are recorded at amortized cost, reflecting the principal amount outstanding,\nnet of the following: unamortized deferred loan fees, costs, premiums or discounts; charge-offs; collection\nof cash; and foreign exchange. Credit card loans also include billed finance charges and fees. Interest\nincome Interest income on performing loans held-for-investment is accrued and recognized as interest income\nat the contractual rate of interest. Purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees\nor costs, are recognized in interest income over the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment of yield.\nThe Firm classifies accrued interest on loans, including accrued but unbilled interest on credit card loans,\nin accrued interest and accounts receivables on the Consolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans,\naccrued interest once billed is then recognized in the loan balances, with the related allowance recorded in\nthe allowance for credit losses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses on accrued interest on credit\ncard loans are recognized in the provision for credit losses and charge-offs are recognized by reversing\ninterest income. For other loans, the Firm generally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on\naccrued interest receivables, consistent with its policy to write them off no later than 90days past due by\nreversing interest income. Nonaccrual loans Nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest has\nbeen suspended. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government\nagencies) are placed on nonaccrual status and considered nonperforming when full payment of principal and\ninterest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has been in\ndefault for a period of 90days or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of\ncollection. A loan is determined to be past due when the minimum payment is not received from the borrower\nby the contractually specified due date or for certain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), when a\nmonthly payment is due and unpaid for 30days or more. Finally, collateral-dependent loans are typically\nmaintained on nonaccrual status. On the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all interest accrued but\nnot collected is reversed against interest income. In addition, the amortization of deferred amounts is\nsuspended. Interest income on nonaccrual loans may be recognized as cash interest payments are received\n(i.e., on a cash basis) if the recorded loan balance is deemed fully collectible; however, if there is doubt\nregarding the ultimate collectibility of the recorded loan balance, all interest cash receipts are applied\nto reduce the carrying value of the loan (the cost recovery method). For consumer loans, application of this\npolicy typically results in the Firm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual consumer loans on a cash\nbasis. A loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is reasonably assured and there has been\ndemonstrated performance under the terms of the loan or, if applicable, the terms of the restructured loan.\nAs permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans are generally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual\nstatus; accordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans continue to accrue until the loan is\ncharged off or paid in full. Allowance for loan losses The allowance for loan losses represents the\nestimated expected credit losses in the held-for-investment loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and is\nrecognized on the balance sheet as a contra asset, which brings the amortized cost to the net carrying\nvalue. Changes in the allowance for loan losses resulting from lending-related activity, macroeconomic\nvariables, changes in credit and other inputs are recorded in the provision for credit losses on the Firm\u2019s\nConsolidated statements of income. Refer to Note 13 for further information on the Firm\u2019s accounting\npolicies for the allowance for loan losses. Charge-offs Consumer loans are generally charged off or charged\ndown to the lower of the amortized cost or the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair\nvalue less estimated costs to sell), with an offset to the allowance for loan losses, upon reaching\nspecified stages of delinquency in accordance with standards established by the FFIEC. Residential real\nestate loans, unmodified credit card loans and scored business banking loans are generally charged off no\nlater than 180days past due. Scored auto and closed-end consumer loans, including modified credit card\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    243  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \naccounts placed on a fixed payment plan, are charged off no later than 120days past due. Certain consumer\nloans are charged off or charged down to their net realizable value earlier than the FFIEC charge-off\nstandards in the following circumstances: \u2022 Loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty\nthat are determined to be collateral-dependent. \u2022 Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event that\nsuggests a loss is either known or highly certain are subject to accelerated charge-off standards (e.g.,\nresidential real estate and auto loans are charged off or charged down within 60days of receiving\nnotification of a bankruptcy filing). \u2022 Auto loans upon repossession of the automobile. Other than in\ncertain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not recognize charge-offs on the government-\nguaranteed portion of loans. Wholesale loans are charged off when it is highly certain that a loss has been\nrealized. The determination of whether to recognize a charge-off includes many factors, including the\nprioritization of the Firm\u2019s claim in bankruptcy, expectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and\nvaluation of the borrower\u2019s equity or the loan collateral. When a loan is charged down to the lower of its\namortized cost or the estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral, the determination of the\nfair value of the collateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g., securities, real estate). In cases\nwhere the collateral is in the form of liquid securities, the fair value is based on quoted market prices or\nbroker quotes. For illiquid securities or other financial assets, the fair value of the collateral is\ngenerally estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For residential real estate loans, collateral values\nare based upon external valuation sources. When it becomes likely that a borrower is either unable or\nunwilling to pay, the Firm utilizes a broker\u2019s price opinion, appraisal and/or an automated valuation model\nof the home based on an exterior-only valuation (\u201cexterior opinions\u201d), which is then updated at least every\n12months, or more frequently depending on various market factors. As soon as practicable after the Firm\nreceives the property in satisfaction of a debt (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession), the\nFirm generally obtains an appraisal based on an inspection that includes the interior of the home (\u201cinterior\nappraisals\u201d). Exterior opinions and interior appraisals are discounted based upon the Firm\u2019s experience with\nactual liquidation values as compared with the estimated values provided by exterior opinions and interior\nappraisals, considering state-specific factors. For commercial real estate loans, collateral values are\ngenerally based on appraisals from internal and external valuation sources. Collateral values are typically\nupdated every sixto twelve months, either by obtaining a new appraisal or by performing an internal\nanalysis, in accordance with the Firm\u2019s policies. The Firm also considers both borrower- and market-specific\nfactors, which may result in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price opinions at more frequent\nintervals. Loans held-for-sale Loans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value, with\nvaluation changes recorded in noninterest revenue. For consumer loans, the valuation is performed on a\nportfolio basis. For wholesale loans, the valuation is performed on an individual loan basis. Interest\nincome on loans held-for-sale is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Loan\norigination fees or costs and purchase price discounts or premiums are deferred in a contra loan account\nuntil the related loan is sold. The deferred fees or costs and discounts or premiums are an adjustment to\nthe basis of the loan and therefore are included in the periodic determination of the lower of cost or fair\nvalue adjustments and/or the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale. Because these loans are recognized\nat the lower of cost or fair value, the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not\napply to these loans. However, loans held-for-sale are subject to the Firm\u2019s nonaccrual policies. Loans at\nfair value Loans for which the fair value option has been elected are measured at fair value, with changes\nin fair value recorded in noninterest revenue. Interest income on these loans is accrued and recognized\nbased on the contractual rate of interest. Changes in fair value are recognized in noninterest revenue. Loan\norigination fees are recognized upfront in noninterest revenue. Loan origination costs are recognized in the\nassociated expense category as incurred. Because these loans are recognized at fair value, the Firm\u2019s\nallowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans at fair value\nare subject to the Firm\u2019s nonaccrual policies. Refer to Note 3 for further information on the Firm\u2019s\nelections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 and Note 3 for further\ninformation on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.\n                                              \n  244    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nLoan classification changes Loans in the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to sell are\ntransferred to the held-for-sale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer.\nCredit-related losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses; non-credit related losses such as\nthose due to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are recognized in noninterest\nrevenue. In the event that management decides to retain a loan in the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is\ntransferred to the held-for-investment portfolio at amortized cost on the date of transfer. These loans are\nsubsequently assessed for impairment based on the Firm\u2019s allowance methodology. Refer to Note 13 for a\nfurther discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses. Loan\nmodifications The Firm seeks to modify certain loans in conjunction with its loss mitigation activities.\nThrough the modification, JPMorganChase grants one or more concessions to a borrower who is experiencing\nfinancial difficulty in order to minimize the Firm\u2019s economic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession of\nthe collateral, and to ultimately maximize payments received by the Firm from the borrower. The concessions\ngranted vary by program and by borrower-specific characteristics, and may include interest rate reductions,\nterm extensions, other-than-insignificant payment delays or principal forgiveness. Loans, except for credit\ncard loans, reported as FDMs are generally placed on nonaccrual status, although in many cases such loans\nwere already on nonaccrual status prior to modification. These loans may be returned to performing status\n(the accrual of interest is resumed) if the following criteria are met: (i) the borrower has performed under\nthe modified terms for a minimum of six monthsand/or sixpayments, and (ii) the Firm has an expectation that\nrepayment of the modified loan is reasonably assured based on, for example, the borrower\u2019s debt capacity and\nlevel of future earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other current market considerations. In certain\nlimited and well-defined circumstances in which the loan is current at the modification date, such loans are\nnot placed on nonaccrual status at the time of modification. The allowance for credit losses associated with\nFDMs is measured using the Firm\u2019s established allowance methodology, which considers the expected default\nrates for the modified loans. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion. Foreclosed property The Firm acquires\nproperty from borrowers through loan restructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. Property acquired may\ninclude real property (e.g., residential real estate, land, and buildings) and other commercial and personal\nproperty (e.g., automobiles, aircraft, railcars, and ships). The Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon\nreceiving assets in satisfaction of a loan (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession). For loans\ncollateralized by real property, the Firm generally recognizes the asset received at foreclosure sale or\nupon the execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction with the borrower. Foreclosed assets are\nreported in other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets and initially recognized at fair value less\nestimated costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value of the acquired property is reviewed and adjusted, if\nnecessary, to the lower of cost or fair value.

Loans that are more than\n30days past due provide an early warning of borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and/or\nwho may be unable or unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues to age, it becomes more clear\nwhether the borrower is likely to be unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential real estate\nloans, late-stage delinquencies (greater than 150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will\nultimately result in a foreclosure or similar liquidation transaction. In addition to delinquency rates,\nother credit quality indicators for consumer loans vary based on the class of loan, as follows: \u2022 For\nresidential real estate loans, the current estimated LTV ratio, or the combined LTV ratio in the case of\njunior lien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss severity in the event of default. Additionally, LTV\nor combined LTV ratios can provide insight into a borrower\u2019s continued willingness to pay, as the\ndelinquency rate of high-LTV loans tends to be greater than that for loans where the borrower has equity in\nthe collateral. The geographic distribution of the loan collateral also provides insight as to the credit\nquality of the portfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, home price changes and specific events\nsuch as natural disasters, will affect credit quality. The borrower\u2019s current or \u201crefreshed\u201d FICO score is a\nsecondary credit quality indicator for certain loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower\u2019s\ncredit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a low FICO score (less than 660) is considered to be\nof higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a higher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high\nLTV ratio and a low FICO score is at greater risk of default than a loan to a borrower that has both a high\nLTV ratio and a high FICO score. \u2022 For scored auto and business banking loans, geographic distribution is an\nindicator of the credit performance of the portfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, geographic\ndistribution provides insights into the portfolio performance based on regional economic activity and\nevents.\n                                              \n  248    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nResidential real estate\n\nDelinquency is the primary credit quality indicator for retained residential real estate loans.

The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses. Revolving\nloans that have been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within\nthe revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for\nthose products is higher than the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving\nperiod.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    249  \n                                              \n

The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance,\nresidential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the\nborrower (\u201cChapter 7 loans\u201d) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual loans, regardless of their delinquency\nstatus. At December 31, 2024, approximately 8% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or\nmore past due.\n\n(b) Mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies excluded from nonaccrual loans were not material at\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n(c) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance,\ncertain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of\namortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the\nunderlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.\n\n(d) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $ 160million and $ 180million for the\nyears ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n(e) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property\nvalue. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using\nnationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available\nand forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home\nequity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.\n\n(f) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower\u2019s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm\non at least a quarterly basis.\n\n(g) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO\nscore. These loans have been included in a FICO band based on management\u2019s estimation of the borrower\u2019s\ncredit quality.\n\n(h) Included U.S. government-guaranteed loans as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.\n\n(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding\nloan balances at December 31, 2024.\n                                              \n  250    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nLoan modifications The Firm grants certain\nmodifications of residential real estate loans to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The\nFirm's proprietary modification programs as well as\ngovernment programs, including U.S. GSE programs,\nthat generally provide various modifications to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty\nincluding, but not limited to, interest rate\nreductions, term extensions, other-than-\ninsignificant payment deferral and principal\nforgiveness that would otherwise have been required\nunder the terms of the original agreement, are\nconsidered FDMs. In addition, the Firm offers trial\nmodifications of residential real estate loans,\nwhich generally include a three-monthtrial payment\nperiod during which the borrower makes monthly\npayments under the proposed modified loan terms.\nLoans in a trial payment period continue to age and\naccrue interest in accordance with the original\ncontractual terms. At the completion of a trial\nperiod, the loan modification is considered\npermanent. Financial effects of FDMs For the year\nended December 31, 2024, retained residential real\nestate FDMs were $ 206million. The financial\neffects of the FDMs, which were predominantly in\nthe form of term extensions and interest rate\nreductions, included extending the weighted-average\nlife of the loans by 15years, and reducing the\nweighted-average contractual interest rate from\n7.53% to 5.44% for the year ended December 31,\n2024. For the year ended December 31, 2023,\nretained residential real estate FDMs were $\n136million. The financial effects of the FDMs,\nwhich were predominantly in the form of term\nextensions and interest rate reductions, included\nextending the weighted-average life of the loans by\n20years, and reducing the weighted-average\ncontractual interest rate from 7.21% to 4.44% for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023. As of December\n31, 2024 and 2023, there were noadditional\ncommitments to lend to borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty whose loans have been modified\nas FDMs. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and\n2023, loans subject to a trial modification, where\nthe terms of the loans have not been permanently\nmodified, and Chapter 7 loans were not material.\n\nPayment status of FDMs\nThe following table provides information on the\npayment status of retained residential real estate\nFDMs during the years ended December 31, 2024 and\n2023.\n                                                                    \n  Year ended December 31,             Amortized cost                \n  (in millions)              2024              basis  2023          \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Current                          $             139        $  107  \n  30-149 days past due                            47            13  \n  150 or more days past due                       20            16  \n  Total                            $             206        $  136  \n                                                                    \nDefaults of FDMs Retained residential real estate\nFDMs that defaulted during the year ended December\n31, 2024 and that were reported as FDMs in the\ntwelve months prior to the default were $\n93million.

Loans with short-term or\nother insignificant modifications that were not\nconsidered concessions were not TDRs. For the year\nended December 31, 2022, new TDRs were $\n362million, and there were no additional\ncommitments to lend to borrowers whose residential\nreal estate loans were modified in TDRs. The Firm\u2019s\nproprietary modification programs as well as\ngovernment programs, including U.S. GSE programs,\ngenerally provide various concessions to\nfinancially troubled borrowers including, but not\nlimited to, interest rate reductions, term or\npayment extensions and delays of principal and/or\ninterest payments that would otherwise have been\nrequired under the terms of the original agreement.\nThe following table provides information about how\nresidential real estate loans were modified in TDRs\nduring the period presented.

                                      \n(a) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance,\ncertain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of\namortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the\nunderlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.\n\n(b) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n(c) The geographic regions presented in this table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding\nloan balances at December 31, 2024.\n\nLoan modifications The Firm grants certain modifications of auto and other loans to borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty.

Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that were not\nconsidered concessions were not TDRs. For the year ended December 31, 2022, auto and other TDRs were not\nmaterial.\n                                              \n  254    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nCredit card loan portfolio\n\nThe credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans originated and purchased by the Firm.\nDelinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans as they provide an early\nwarning that borrowers may be experiencing difficulties (30 days past due); information on those borrowers\nthat have been delinquent for a longer period of time (90 days past due) is also considered. In addition to\ndelinquency rates, the geographic distribution of the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the\nportfolio based on the regional economy. While the borrower\u2019s credit score is another general indicator of\ncredit quality, the Firm does not view credit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality because the\nborrower\u2019s credit score tends to be a lagging indicator. The distribution of such scores provides a general\nindicator of credit quality trends within the portfolio; however, the score does not capture all factors\nthat would be predictive of future credit performance. Refreshed FICO score information, which is obtained\nat least quarterly, for a statistically significant random sample of the credit card portfolio is indicated\nin other credit quality indicators. FICO is considered to be the industry benchmark for credit scores. The\nFirm generally originates new credit card accounts to prime consumer borrowers. However, certain\ncardholders\u2019 FICO scores may decrease over time, depending on the performance of the cardholder and changes\nin the credit score calculation.\n\nThe following tables provide

card loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.\nThese modifications may involve placing the customer\u2019s credit card account on a fixed payment plan,\ngenerally for 60months, which typically includes reducing the interest rate on the credit card account. If\nthe borrower does not make the contractual payments when due under the modified payment terms, the credit\ncard loan continues to age and will be charged-off in accordance with the Firm's standard

The primary credit quality indicator for\nwholesale loans is the internal risk rating assigned to each loan. Risk ratings are used to identify the\ncredit quality of loans and differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings on loans consider the PD\nand the LGD. The PD is the likelihood that a loan will default. The LGD is the estimated loss on the loan\nthat would be realized upon the default of the borrower and takes into consideration collateral and\nstructural support for each credit facility. Management considers several factors to determine an\nappropriate internal risk rating, including the obligor\u2019s debt capacity and financial flexibility, the level\nof the obligor\u2019s earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level and nature of contingencies,\nmanagement strength, and the industry and geography in which the obligor operates. The Firm\u2019s internal risk\nratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet financial\ncommitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody\u2019s, however\nthe quantitative characteristics (e.g., PD and LGD) may differ as they reflect internal historical\nexperiences and assumptions. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics\nequivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and these ratings have a lower PD and/or lower LGD\nthan non-investment grade ratings. Noninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as noncriticized and\ncriticized, and the criticized portion is further subdivided into performing and nonaccrual loans,\nrepresenting management\u2019s assessment of the collectibility of principal and interest. Criticized loans have\na higher PD than noncriticized loans. The Firm\u2019s definition of criticized aligns with the U.S. banking\nregulatory definition of criticized exposures, which consist of special mention, substandard and doubtful\ncategories. Refer to Note 1 for additional information. Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing\nbasis by Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary for updated information affecting the\nobligor\u2019s ability to fulfill its obligations. As noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the\nindustry in which the obligor conducts its operations. As part of the overall credit risk management\nframework, the Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry and client exposures, with\nparticular attention paid to industries with an actual or potential credit concern. Refer to Note 4 for\nfurther detail on industry concentrations.\n                                              \n  258    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nInternal risk rating is the primary credit quality indicator for retained wholesale loans.

days or more past due.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, additional unfunded commitments on modified loans to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty were $ 1.8billion at each period in Commercial and industrial, and $\n69million and $ 4million, respectively, in Other loan class. Additional commitments on modified loans to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty whose loans have been modified as FDMs in Secured by real estate\nwere not material at each period.\n\nNature and extent of TDRs\n\nPrior to January 1, 2023, certain loan modifications were considered TDRs. These loan modifications provided\nvarious concessions to borrower who were experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other\ninsignificant modifications that were not considered concessions were not TDRs nor were loans for which the\nFirm elected to suspend TDR accounting guidance under the option provided by the CARES Act.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, new TDRs were $ 801million. New TDRs for the year ended December 31,\n2022 reflected extended maturity dates and covenant waivers primarily in the Commercial and Industrial loan\nclass. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the impact of these modifications resulting in new TDRs was not\nmaterial to the Firm.\n\nAs a result of the elimination of the requirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or\ninvolves a concession, the population of loans considered FDMs is greater than the population previously\nconsidered TDRs.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    265  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Note 13 \u2013 Allowance for credit losses                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \nThe Firm\u2019s allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses over the\nremaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance\nsheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses generally comprises: \u2022 the allowance for\nloan losses, which covers the Firm\u2019s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated), \u2022 the allowance for\nlending-related commitments, which is presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts payable and\nother liabilities, and \u2022 the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which is reflected in\ninvestment securities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The income statement effect of all changes in the\nallowance for credit losses is recognized in the provision for credit losses. Determining the\nappropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is complex and requires significant judgment by\nmanagement about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. At least quarterly, the allowance for\ncredit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the Firm. Subsequent evaluations of\ncredit exposures, considering the macroeconomic conditions, forecasts and other factors then prevailing, may\nresult in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in future periods. The Firm\u2019s policies used\nto determine its allowance for loan losses and its allowance for lending-related commitments are described\nin the following paragraphs. Refer to Note 10 for a description of the policies used to determine the\nallowance for credit losses on investment securities. Methodology for allowances for loan losses and\nlending-related commitments The allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-related commitments\nrepresents expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of retained loans and lending-related\ncommitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. The Firm does not record an allowance for future draws\non unconditionally cancellable lending-related commitments (e.g., credit cards). Expected losses related to\naccrued interest on credit card loans are considered in the Firm\u2019s allowance for loan losses. However, the\nFirm does not record an allowance on other accrued interest receivables, due to its policy to write these\nreceivables off no later than 90days past due by reversing interest income. The expected life of each\ninstrument is determined by considering its contractual term, expected prepayments, cancellation features,\nand certain extension and call options. The expected life of funded credit card loans is generally estimated\nby considering expected future payments on the credit card account, and determining how much of those\namounts should be allocated to repayments of the funded loan balance (as of the balance sheet date) versus\nother account activity. This allocation is made using an approach that incorporates the payment application\nrequirements of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, generally paying\ndown the highest interest rate balances first. The estimate of expected credit losses includes expected\nrecoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off, even if such recoveries result\nin a negative allowance. Collective and Individual Assessments When calculating the allowance for loan\nlosses and the allowance for lending-related commitments, the Firm assesses whether exposures share similar\nrisk characteristics. If similar risk characteristics exist, the Firm estimates expected credit losses\ncollectively, considering the risk associated with a particular pool and the probability that the exposures\nwithin the pool will deteriorate or default. The assessment of risk characteristics is subject to\nsignificant management judgment. Emphasizing one characteristic over another or considering additional\ncharacteristics could affect the allowance. \u2022 Relevant risk characteristics for the consumer portfolio\ninclude product type, delinquency status, current FICO scores, geographic distribution, and, for\ncollateralized loans, current LTV ratios. \u2022 Relevant risk characteristics for the wholesale portfolio\ninclude risk rating, delinquency status, tenor, level and type of collateral, LOB, geography, industry,\ncredit enhancement, product type, facility purpose, and payment terms. The majority of the Firm\u2019s credit\nexposures share risk characteristics with other similar exposures, and as a result are collectively assessed\nfor impairment (\u201cportfolio-based component\u201d). The portfolio-based component covers consumer loans,\nperforming risk-rated loans and certain lending-related commitments. If an exposure does not share risk\ncharacteristics with other exposures, the Firm generally estimates expected credit losses on an individual\nbasis, considering expected repayment and conditions impacting that individual exposure (\u201casset-specific\ncomponent\u201d). The asset-specific component covers collateral-dependent loans and risk-rated loans that have\nbeen placed on nonaccrual status. Portfolio-based component The portfolio-based component begins with a\nquantitative calculation that considers the likelihood of the borrower changing delinquency status or moving\nfrom one risk rating to another. The quantitative calculation covers expected credit losses over an\ninstrument\u2019s expected life and is estimated by applying credit loss factors to the Firm\u2019s estimated exposure\nat default. The credit loss factors incorporate the\n                                              \n  266    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nprobability of borrower default as well as loss severity in the event of default. They are derived using a\nweighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios over an eight-quarter forecast period,\nfollowed by a single year straight-line interpolation to revert to long run historical information for\nperiods beyond the eight-quarter forecast period. The five macroeconomic scenarios consist of a central,\nrelative adverse, extreme adverse, relative upside and extreme upside scenario, and are updated by the\nFirm\u2019s central forecasting team. The scenarios take into consideration the Firm\u2019s macroeconomic outlook,\ninternal perspectives from subject matter experts across the Firm, and market consensus and involve a\ngoverned process that incorporates feedback from senior management across LOBs, Corporate Finance and Risk\nManagement. The quantitative calculation is adjusted to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging\nrisk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet reflected in the calculation. These\nadjustments are accomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss experience, including during stressed\nperiods, for each major product or model. Management applies judgment in making this adjustment, including\ntaking into account uncertainties associated with the economic and political conditions, quality of\nunderwriting standards, borrower behavior, credit concentrations or deterioration within an industry,\nproduct or portfolio, as well as other relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit quality\nof the portfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships between these factors create further\nuncertainties. The application of different inputs into the quantitative calculation, and the assumptions\nused by management to adjust the quantitative calculation, are subject to significant management judgment,\nand emphasizing one input or assumption over another, or considering other inputs or assumptions, could\naffect the estimate of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments.\nAsset-specific component To determine the asset-specific component of the allowance, collateral-dependent\nloans (including those loans for which foreclosure is probable) and nonaccrual risk-rated loans in the\nwholesale portfolio segment are generally evaluated individually. For collateral-dependent loans, the fair\nvalue of collateral less estimated costs to sell, as applicable, is used to determine the charge-off amount\nfor declines in value (to reduce the amortized cost of the loan to the fair value of collateral) or the\namount of negative allowance that should be recognized (for recoveries of prior charge-offs associated with\nimprovements in the fair value of the collateral). For non-collateral dependent loans, the Firm generally\nmeasures the asset-specific allowance as the difference between the amortized cost of the loan and the\npresent value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the loan\u2019s effective interest rate.\nSubsequent changes in impairment are generally recognized as an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses.\nThe asset-specific component of the allowance for non-collateral dependent loans incorporates the effect of\nthe modification on the loan\u2019s expected cash flows including changes in interest rates, principal\nforgiveness, and other concessions, as well as management\u2019s expectation of the borrower\u2019s ability to repay\nunder the modified terms. Estimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows is highly judgmental as\nthese cash flow projections rely upon estimates such as loss severities, asset valuations, the amounts and\ntiming of interest or principal payments (including any expected prepayments) or other factors that are\nreflective of current and expected market conditions. These estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors\nsuch as the duration of current overall economic conditions, industry, portfolio, or borrower-specific\nfactors, the expected outcome of insolvency proceedings as well as, in certain circumstances, other economic\nfactors. All of these estimates and assumptions require significant management judgment and certain\nassumptions are highly subjective. Other financial assets In addition to loans and investment securities,\nthe Firm holds other financial assets that are measured at amortized cost on the Consolidated balance\nsheets, including credit exposures arising from lending activities subject to collateral maintenance\nrequirements. Management estimates the allowance for other financial assets using various techniques\nconsidering historical losses and current economic conditions. Credit risk arising from lending activities\nsubject to collateral maintenance requirements is generally mitigated by factors such as the short-term\nnature of the activity, the fair value of collateral held and the Firm\u2019s right to call for, and the\nborrower\u2019s obligation to provide additional margin when the fair value of the collateral declines. Because\nof these mitigating factors, these exposures generally do not require an allowance for credit losses.\nHowever, management may also consider other factors such as the borrower\u2019s ongoing ability to provide\ncollateral to satisfy margin requirements, or whether collateral is significantly concentrated in an\nindividual issuer or in securities with similar risk characteristics. If in management\u2019s judgment, an\nallowance for credit losses for these exposures is required, the Firm estimates expected credit losses based\non the value of the collateral and probability of borrower default.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    267  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nAllowance for credit losses and related information\nThe table below summarizes information about the allowances for credit losses and includes a breakdown of\nloans and lending-related commitments by impairment methodology.

allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2024 was $ 26.9billion, reflecting a net addition of $\n2.1billion from December 31, 2023. The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included: \u2022 $\n2.1billion in consumer , reflecting: \u2013 a $ 2.2billion net addition in Card Services, predominantly driven by\nloan growth, reflecting higher revolving balances, including the seasoning of vintages originated in recent\nyears, partially offset by \u2013 a $ 125million net reduction in Home Lending in the first quarter of 2024, and\n\u2022 a net reduction of $ 30million in wholesale , reflecting: \u2013 changes in certain macroeconomic variables, an\nupdate to loss assumptions on certain loans in Markets, and a reduction due to charge-offs largely from\ncollateral-dependent loans, predominantly offset by \u2013 net downgrade activity, primarily in Real Estate, and\nthe impact of incorporating the First Republic portfolio into the Firm\u2019s modeled credit loss estimates in\nthe second quarter of 2024. The Firm\u2019s qualitative adjustments continued to include additional weight placed\non the adverse scenarios to reflect ongoing uncertainties and downside risks related to the geopolitical and\nmacroeconomic environment. The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of\nfive internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive\nmacroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in: \u2022 a\nweighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2025, and \u2022 a weighted\naverage U.S. real GDP level that is 1.9% lower than the central case at the end of the second quarter of\n2026.\nThe following table presents the Firm\u2019s central\ncase assumptions for the periods presented:\n                                                                                       \n                                    Central case assumptions                           \n                                        at December 31, 2024                           \n                                                        2Q25       4Q25       2Q26     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. unemployment rate(a)                              4.5  %     4.3  %     4.3  %  \n  YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                         2.0  %     1.9  %     1.8  %  \n                                                                                       \n                                                                                       \n                                    Central case assumptions                           \n                                        at December 31, 2023                           \n                                                        2Q24       4Q24       2Q25     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. unemployment rate(a)                              4.1  %     4.4  %     4.1  %  \n  YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                         1.8  %     0.7  %     1.0  %  \n                                                                                       \n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S.\nunemployment rate.\n(b) The year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in\nthe forecast horizon of the central scenario is\ncalculated as the percentage change in U.S. real\nGDP levels from the prior year.\nSubsequent changes to this forecast and related\nestimates will be reflected in the provision for\ncredit losses in future periods.

As asset manager\nof the funds, AWM earns a fee based on assets managed; the fee varies with each fund\u2019s investment objective\nand is competitively priced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AWM\u2019s interests are, in certain cases,\nconsidered to be significant variable interests that result in consolidation of the financial results of\nthese entities.\n\n\u2022 Corporate : Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of VIEs; however these\nentities are generally subject to specialized investment company accounting, which does not require the\nconsolidation of investments, including VIEs. In addition, Treasury and CIO invest in securities generally\nissued by third parties which may meet the definition of VIEs (e.g., issuers of asset-backed securities). In\ngeneral, the Firm does not have the power to direct the significant activities of these entities and\ntherefore does not consolidate these entities. Refer to Note 10 for further information on the Firm\u2019s\ninvestment securities portfolio.\n\nIn addition, CIB also invests in and provides financing, lending-related services and other services to VIEs\nsponsored by third parties. Refer to page 276 of this Note for more information on the VIEs sponsored by\nthird parties.\nSignificant Firm-sponsored VIEs\nCredit card securitizations CCB\u2019s Card Services business may securitize originated credit card loans,\nprimarily through the Chase Issuance Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d). The Firm\u2019s continuing involvement in credit card\nsecuritizations includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided seller\u2019s interest in the\nreceivables, retaining certain senior and subordinated securities and maintaining escrow accounts. The Firm\nconsolidates the assets and liabilities of its sponsored credit card trusts as it is considered to be the\nprimary beneficiary of these securitization trusts based on the Firm\u2019s ability to direct the activities of\nthese VIEs through its servicing responsibilities and other duties, including making decisions as to the\nreceivables that are transferred into those trusts and as to any related modifications and workouts.\nAdditionally, the nature and extent of the Firm\u2019s other continuing involvement with the trusts, as indicated\nabove, obligates the Firm to absorb losses and gives the Firm the right to receive certain benefits from\nthese VIEs that could potentially be significant. The underlying securitized credit card receivables and\nother assets of the securitization trusts are available only for payment of the beneficial interests issued\nby the securitization trusts; they are not available to pay the Firm\u2019s other obligations or the claims of\nthe Firm\u2019s creditors. The agreements with the credit card securitization trusts require the Firm to maintain\na minimum undivided interest in the credit card trusts (generally 5%). As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the\nFirm held undivided interests in Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts of $ 6.6billion and $\n4.9billion, respectively. The Firm maintained an average undivided interest in principal receivables owned\nby\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    271  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nthose trusts of approximately 45% and 65% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The\nFirm did not retain any senior securities and retained $ 1.5billion of subordinated securities in certain of\nits credit card securitization trusts at both December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Firm\u2019s undivided interests in\nthe credit card trusts and securities retained are eliminated in consolidation. Firm-sponsored mortgage and\nother securitization trusts The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential\nmortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB businesses. Depending\non the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer\nof the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts.\nThe following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-\nlabel securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that\nare consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests\nor subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules),\nrecourse or guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm\u2019s only\ncontinuing involvement is servicing the loans. The Firm\u2019s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased\ninterests is the carrying value of these interests.

risk\nretention rules, were risk-rated \u201cA\u201d or better, on an S&P-equivalent basis. The retained interests in prime\nresidential mortgages consisted of $ 2.9billion and $ 2.5billion of investment-grade retained interests at\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $ 216million and $ 88million of noninvestment-grade retained\ninterests at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The retained interests in commercial and other\nsecuritization trusts consisted of $ 6.0billion and $ 6.1billion of investment-grade retained interests, and\n$ 1.4billion and $ 1.7billion of noninvestment-grade retained interests at December 31, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\n                                              \n  272    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nResidential mortgage The Firm securitizes\nresidential mortgage loans originated by CCB, as\nwell as residential mortgage loans purchased from\nthird parties by either CCB or CIB. CCB generally\nretains servicing for all residential mortgage\nloans it originated or purchased, and for certain\nmortgage loans purchased by CIB. For\nsecuritizations of loans serviced by CCB, the Firm\nhas the power to direct the significant activities\nof the VIE because it is responsible for decisions\nrelated to loan modifications and workouts. CCB may\nalso retain an interest upon securitization. In\naddition, CIB engages in underwriting and trading\nactivities involving securities issued by Firm-\nsponsored securitization trusts. As a result, CIB\nat times retains senior and/or subordinated\ninterests (including residual interests and amounts\nrequired to be held pursuant to credit risk\nretention rules) in residential mortgage\nsecuritizations at the time of securitization,\nand/or reacquires positions in the secondary market\nin the normal course of business. In certain\ninstances, as a result of the positions retained or\nreacquired by CIB or held by Treasury and CIO or\nCCB, when considered together with the servicing\narrangements entered into by CCB, the Firm is\ndeemed to be the primary beneficiary of certain\nsecuritization trusts. The Firm does not\nconsolidate residential mortgage securitizations\n(Firm-sponsored or third-party-sponsored) when it\nis not the servicer (and therefore does not have\nthe power to direct the most significant activities\nof the trust) or does not hold a beneficial\ninterest in the trust that could potentially be\nsignificant to the trust. Commercial mortgages and\nother consumer securitizations CIB originates and\nsecuritizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages\nin underwriting and trading activities involving\nthe securities issued by securitization trusts. CIB\nmay retain unsold senior and/or subordinated\ninterests (including amounts required to be held\npursuant to credit risk retention rules) in\ncommercial mortgage securitizations at the time of\nsecuritization but, generally, the Firm does not\nservice commercial loan securitizations. Treasury\nand CIO may choose to invest in these\nsecuritizations as well. For commercial mortgage\nsecuritizations the power to direct the significant\nactivities of the VIE generally is held by the\nservicer or investors in a specified class of\nsecurities (\u201ccontrolling class\u201d). The Firm\ngenerally does not retain an interest in the\ncontrolling class in its sponsored commercial\nmortgage securitization transactions.\n\nRe-securitizations The Firm engages in certain re-\nsecuritization transactions in which debt\nsecurities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for\nnew beneficial interests. These transfers occur in\nconnection with both U.S. GSEs and government\nagency sponsored VIEs, which are backed by\nresidential mortgages. The Firm\u2019s consolidation\nanalysis is largely dependent on the Firm\u2019s role\nand interest in the re-securitization trusts.\nThe following table presents the principal amount\nof securities transferred to re-securitization\nVIEs.\n                                                                                              \n  Year ended December 31,                                                                     \n  (in millions)                                   2024               2023               2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Transfers of securities to VIEs                                                             \n  U.S. GSEs and government agencies    $  44,456          $  18,864          $  16,128        \n                                                                                              \nMost re-securitizations with which the Firm is\ninvolved are client-driven transactions in which a\nspecific client or group of clients is seeking a\nspecific return or risk profile. For these\ntransactions, the Firm has concluded that the\ndecision-making power of the entity is shared\nbetween the Firm and its clients, considering the\njoint effort and decisions in establishing the re-\nsecuritization trust and its assets, as well as the\nsignificant economic interest the client holds in\nthe re-securitization trust; therefore the Firm\ndoes not consolidate the re-securitization VIE. The\nFirm did not transfer any private label securities\nto re-securitization VIEs during 2024, 2023 and\n2022, and retained interests in any such Firm-\nsponsored VIEs as of December 31, 2024 and 2023\nwere not material. Additionally, the Firm may\ninvest in beneficial interests of third-party-\nsponsored re-securitizations and generally\npurchases these interests in the secondary market.\nIn these circumstances, the Firm does not have the\nunilateral ability to direct the most significant\nactivities of the re-securitization trust, either\nbecause it was not involved in the initial design\nof the trust, or the Firm was involved with an\nindependent third-party sponsor and demonstrated\nshared power over the creation of the trust;\ntherefore, the Firm does not consolidate the re-\nsecuritization VIE.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    273  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nThe following table presents information on the\nFirm's interests in nonconsolidated re-\nsecuritization VIEs.\n                                                                                        \n  December 31,                                                                          \n  (in millions)                                      Nonconsolidated                    \n  U.S. GSEs and government agencies  2024     re-securitization VIEs    2023            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Interest in VIEs                         $                   3,219          $  3,371  \n                                                                                        \nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Firm did not consolidate any U.S. GSE and government agency re-\nsecuritization VIEs or any Firm-sponsored private-label re-securitization VIEs. Multi-seller conduits Multi-\nseller conduit entities are separate bankruptcy remote entities that provide secured financing,\ncollateralized by pools of receivables and other financial assets, to customers of the Firm. The conduits\nfund their financing facilities through the issuance of highly rated commercial paper. The primary source of\nrepayment of the commercial paper is the cash flows from the pools of assets. In most instances, the assets\nare structured with deal-specific credit enhancements provided to the conduits by the customers (i.e.,\nsellers) or other third parties. Deal-specific credit enhancements are generally structured to cover a\nmultiple of historical losses expected on the pool of assets, and are typically in the form of\novercollateralization provided by the seller. The deal-specific credit enhancements mitigate the Firm\u2019s\npotential losses on its agreements with the conduits. To ensure timely repayment of the commercial paper,\nand to provide the conduits with funding to provide financing to customers in the event that the conduits do\nnot obtain funding in the commercial paper market, each asset pool financed by the conduits has a minimum\n100% deal-specific liquidity facility associated with it provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. also provides the multi-seller conduit vehicles with uncommitted program-wide liquidity\nfacilities and program-wide credit enhancement in the form of standby letters of credit. The amount of\nprogram-wide credit enhancement required is based upon commercial paper issuance and approximates 10% of the\noutstanding balance of commercial paper. The Firm consolidates its Firm-administered multi-seller conduits,\nas the Firm has both the power to direct the significant activities of the conduits and a potentially\nsignificant economic interest in the conduits. As administrative agent and in its role in structuring\ntransactions, the Firm makes decisions regarding asset types and credit quality, and manages the commercial\npaper funding needs of the conduits. The Firm\u2019s interests that could potentially be significant to the VIEs\ninclude the fees received as administrative agent and liquidity and program-wide\n\ncredit enhancement provider, as well as the potential exposure created by the liquidity and credit\nenhancement facilities provided to the conduits. In the normal course of business, JPMorganChase makes\nmarkets in and invests in commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm\nheld $ 2.9billion and $ 9.8billion of the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller\nconduits at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which have been eliminated in consolidation. The\nFirm\u2019s investments reflect the Firm\u2019s funding needs and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity.\nOther than the amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, the Firm is not\nobligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller\nconduits. Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the\nFirm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits provide\nlending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded\ncommitments were $ 10.3billion and $ 10.8billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are\nreported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments in other unfunded commitments to extend credit.\nRefer to Note 28 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. Municipal bond\nvehicles Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (\u201cTOB\u201d) trusts allow institutions to finance their\nmunicipal bond investments at short-term rates. In a typical TOB transaction, the trust purchases highly\nrated municipal bond(s) of a single issuer and funds the purchase by issuing two types of securities: (1)\nputtable floating-rate certificates (\u201cfloaters\u201d) and (2) inverse floating-rate residual interests\n(\u201cresiduals\u201d). The floaters are typically purchased by money market funds or other short-term investors and\nmay be tendered, with requisite notice, to the TOB trust. The residuals are retained by the investor seeking\nto finance its municipal bond investment. TOB transactions where the residual is held by a third-party\ninvestor are typically known as customer TOB trusts, and non-customer TOB trusts are transactions where the\nResidual is retained by the Firm. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party. The Firm serves as\nsponsor for all non-customer TOB transactions. The Firm may provide various services to a TOB trust,\nincluding remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider, and/or sponsor. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC\nmay serve as a remarketing agent on the floaters for TOB trusts. The remarketing agent is responsible for\nestablishing the periodic variable rate on the floaters, conducting the initial\n                                              \n  274    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nplacement and remarketing tendered floaters. The remarketing agent may, but is not obligated to, make\nmarkets in floaters. Floaters held by the Firm were not material during 2024 and 2023. JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. or J.P. Morgan Securities LLC often serves as the sole liquidity or tender option provider for the TOB\ntrusts. The liquidity provider\u2019s obligation to perform is conditional and is limited by certain events\n(\u201cTermination Events\u201d), which include bankruptcy or failure to pay by the municipal bond issuer or credit\nenhancement provider, an event of taxability on the municipal bonds or the immediate downgrade of the\nmunicipal bond to below investment grade. In addition, the liquidity provider\u2019s exposure is typically\nfurther limited by the high credit quality of the underlying municipal bonds, the excess collateralization\nin the vehicle, or, in certain transactions, the reimbursement agreements with the Residual holders. Holders\nof the floaters may \u201cput,\u201d or tender, their floaters to the TOB trust. If the remarketing agent cannot\nsuccessfully remarket the floaters to another investor, the liquidity provider either provides a loan to the\nTOB trust for the TOB trust\u2019s purchase of the floaters, or it directly purchases the tendered floaters. TOB\ntrusts are considered to be variable interest entities. The Firm consolidates non-customer TOB trusts\nbecause as the Residual holder, the Firm has the right to make decisions that significantly impact the\neconomic performance of the municipal bond vehicle, and it has the right to receive benefits and bear losses\nthat could potentially be significant to the municipal bond vehicle.\n\nConsolidated VIE assets and liabilities\nThe following table

These include, for example, acting as a\nderivative counterparty, liquidity provider,\ninvestor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing\nagent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are\nconducted at arm\u2019s-length, and individual credit\ndecisions are based on the analysis of the specific\nVIE, taking into consideration the quality of the\nunderlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the\npower to direct the activities of the VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic\nperformance, or a variable interest that could\npotentially be significant, the Firm generally does\nnot consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports\nthese positions on its Consolidated balance sheets\nin the same manner it would record and report\npositions in respect of any other third-party\ntransaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds\ninvestments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles,\nwhich are limited partnerships and similar entities\nthat own and operate affordable housing,\nalternative energy, and other projects. These\nentities are primarily considered VIEs. A third\nparty is typically the general partner or managing\nmember and has control over the significant\nactivities of the tax credit vehicles, and\naccordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax\ncredit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in\nthese partnerships as a limited partner and earns a\nreturn primarily through the receipt of tax credits\nallocated to the projects. The maximum loss\nexposure, represented by equity investments and\nfunding commitments, was $ 35.2billion and $\n35.1billion, of which $ 15.0billion and $\n14.7billion was unfunded at December 31, 2024 and\n2023, respectively. The Firm assesses each project\nand to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold\nvarying amounts of its capital investment until the\nproject qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 28\nfor more information on off-balance sheet lending-\nrelated commitments. Effective January 1, 2024, the\nFirm adopted updates to the Accounting for\nInvestments in Tax Credit Structures Using the\nProportional Amortization Method guidance which\nexpanded the types of tax-oriented investments,\nbeyond affordable housing tax credit investments,\nthat the Firm can elect on a program by program\nbasis, to be accounted for using the proportional\namortization method. Refer to Notes 1, 6 and 25 for\nfurther information. The proportional amortization\nmethod requires the cost of eligible investments,\nwithin an elected program, be amortized in\nproportion to the tax benefits received with the\nresulting amortization reported directly in income\ntax expense, which aligns with the associated tax\ncredits and other tax benefits. Investments must\nmeet certain criteria to be eligible,\n\nincluding that substantially all of the return is\nfrom income tax credits and other income tax\nbenefits. In addition, under this method deferred\ntaxes are generally not recorded as the investment\nis now amortized in proportion to the income tax\ncredits and other income tax benefits received.\nDelayed equity contributions that are unconditional\nand legally binding or conditional and probable of\noccurring are recorded in other liabilities with a\ncorresponding increase in the carrying value of the\ninvestment. The guidance also requires a\nreevaluation of eligible investments when\nsignificant modifications or events occur that\nresult in a change in the nature of the investment\nor a change in the Firm's relationship with the\nunderlying project. During the period, there were\nno significant modifications or events that\nresulted in a change in the nature of an eligible\ninvestment or a change in the Firm's relationship\nwith the underlying project.\nThe following table provides information on tax-\noriented investments for which the Firm elected to\napply the proportional amortization method.\n                                                                                                            \n                                                  Alternative energy and                                    \n  Year ended December 31,                             affordable housing                                    \n  (in millions)                  2024                        programs(d)  2023             2022             \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Programs for which the Firm                                                                               \n  elected                                                                                                   \n  proportional amortization:                                                                                \n  Carrying value(a)                    $                          31,978        $  14,644        $  12,052  \n  Tax credits and other tax                                        6,379            2,044            1,786  \n  benefits(b)                                                                                               \n  Investments that qualify to                                                                               \n  be accounted                                                                                              \n  for using proportional                                                                                    \n  amortization:                                                                                             \n  Amortization losses                                                                                       \n  recognized as a                                                 -5,018           -1,561           -1,353  \n  component of income tax                                                                                   \n  expense                                                                                                   \n  Non-income-tax-related                                                                                    \n  gains/(losses)                                                                                            \n  and other returns received                                                                                \n  that are                                                           142               -1               -1  \n  recognized outside of income                                                                              \n  tax                                                                                                       \n  expense(c)                                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n(a) Recorded in Other assetson the Consolidated\nbalance sheets.

In certain customer TOB transactions, the\nFirm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those\ntransactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders\nfor any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on\nany of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm\ndoes not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the\nmunicipal bond vehicle. The Firm\u2019s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, was $ 5.8billion and $ 5.1billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held\nby such VIEs at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $ 8.1billion and $ 7.3billion, respectively. Loan\nsecuritizations The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgages,\ncredit card receivables, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans. The purposes of these securitization\ntransactions were to satisfy investor demand and to generate liquidity for the Firm. For loan\nsecuritizations in which the Firm is not required to consolidate the trust, the Firm records the transfer of\nthe loan receivable to the trust as a sale when all of the following accounting criteria for a sale are met:\n(1) the transferred financial assets are legally isolated from the Firm\u2019s creditors; (2) the transferee or\nbeneficial interest holder can pledge or exchange the transferred financial assets; and (3) the Firm does\nnot maintain effective control over the transferred financial assets (e.g., the Firm cannot repurchase the\ntransferred assets before their maturity and it does not have the ability to unilaterally cause the holder\nto return the transferred assets). For loan securitizations accounted for as a sale, the Firm recognizes a\ngain or loss based on the difference between the value of proceeds received (including cash, beneficial\ninterests, or servicing assets received) and the carrying value of the assets sold. Gains and losses on\nsecuritizations are reported in noninterest revenue.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    277  \n

The\ngoodwill impairment test is generally performed by comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit\nwith its carrying value. If the fair value is in excess of the carrying value, then the reporting unit\u2019s\ngoodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, then an\nimpairment is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit\u2019s carrying value exceeds its fair value,\nup to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Firm uses the reporting units\u2019 allocated\ncapital plus goodwill and other intangible assets as a proxy for the carrying values of equity for the\nreporting units in the goodwill impairment testing. Reporting unit equity is determined on a similar basis\nas the allocation of capital to the LOBs which takes into consideration a variety of factors including\ncapital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. LOB\u2019s allocated\ncapital levels are incorporated into the Firm\u2019s annual budget process, which is reviewed by the Firm\u2019s Board\nof Directors and Operating Committee. The primary method the Firm uses to estimate the fair value of its\nreporting units is the income approach. This approach projects cash flows for the forecast period and uses\nthe perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values. These cash flows and terminal values, which are\nbased on the reporting units\u2019 annual budgets and forecasts are then discounted using an appropriate discount\nrate. The discount rate used for each reporting unit represents an estimate of the cost of equity for that\nreporting unit and is determined considering the Firm\u2019s overall estimated cost of equity (estimated using\nthe Capital Asset Pricing Model), as adjusted for the risk characteristics specific to each reporting unit\n(for example, for higher levels of risk or uncertainty associated with the business or management\u2019s\nforecasts and assumptions). To assess the reasonableness of the discount rates used for each reporting unit,\nmanagement compares the discount rate to the estimated cost of equity for publicly traded institutions with\nsimilar businesses and risk characteristics. In addition, the weighted average cost of equity (aggregating\nthe various reporting units) is compared with the Firm\u2019s overall estimated cost of equity for\nreasonableness. The valuations derived from the discounted cash flow analysis are then compared with market-\nbased trading and transaction multiples for relevant competitors. Trading and transaction comparables are\nused as general indicators to assess the overall reasonableness of the estimated fair values, although\nprecise conclusions generally cannot be drawn due to the differences that\n                                              \n  280    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nnaturally exist between the Firm\u2019s businesses and competitor institutions. The Firm also takes into\nconsideration a comparison between the aggregate fair values of the Firm\u2019s reporting units and\nJPMorganChase\u2019s market capitalization. In evaluating this comparison, the Firm considers several factors,\nincluding (i) a control premium that would exist in a market transaction, (ii) factors related to the level\nof execution risk that would exist at the Firmwide level that do not exist at the reporting unit level and\n(iii) short-term market volatility and other factors that do not directly affect the value of individual\nreporting units. Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in\ncapital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or\nlegislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair\nvalues of the Firm\u2019s reporting units to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment\nloss to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill. Mortgage servicing\nrights MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for\nothers. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated\ncosts to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received,\neffectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either\npurchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is\nretained. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to account for its MSRs at fair value. The Firm\ntreats its MSRs as a single class of servicing assets based on the availability of market inputs used to\nmeasure the fair value of its MSR asset and its treatment of MSRs as one aggregate pool for risk management\npurposes. The Firm estimates the fair value of MSRs using an option-adjusted spread (\u201cOAS\u201d) model, which\nprojects MSR cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios in conjunction with the Firm\u2019s prepayment\nmodel, and then discounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted rates. The model considers portfolio\ncharacteristics, contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, costs to\nservice, late charges and other ancillary revenue, and other economic factors. The Firm compares fair value\nestimates and assumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers recent market\nactivity and actual portfolio experience.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    281  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nThe fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest rates, including their effect on prepayment\nspeeds. MSRs typically decrease in value when interest rates decline because declining interest rates tend\nto increase prepayments and therefore reduce the expected life of the net servicing cash flows that comprise\nthe MSR asset. Conversely, securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities), and certain derivatives (e.g.,\nthose for which the Firm receives fixed-rate interest payments) increase in value when interest rates\ndecline. JPMorganChase uses combinations of derivatives and securities to manage the risk of changes in the\nfair value of MSRs. The intent is to offset any interest-rate related changes in the fair value of MSRs with\nchanges in the fair value of the related risk management instruments.\nThe following table summarizes MSR

However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if\nthey were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.\n                                              \n  282    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nThe following table presents the components of\nmortgage fees and related income (including the\nimpact of MSR risk management activities) for the\nyears ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n                                                                                                    \n  Year ended December 31,                                                                           \n  (in millions)                                         2024               2023               2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  CCB mortgage fees and related income                                                              \n  Production revenue                         $     627          $     421          $     497        \n  Net mortgage servicing revenue:                                                                   \n  Operating revenue:                                                                                \n  Loan servicing revenue                         1,659              1,634              1,582        \n  Changes in MSR asset fair value due to                                                            \n  collection/realization of expected cash       -1,067             -1,011               -936        \n  flows                                                                                             \n  Total operating revenue                          592                623                646        \n  Risk management:                                                                                  \n  Changes in MSR asset fair value due to           670                424              2,022        \n  market interest rates and other(a)                                                                \n  Other changes in MSR asset fair value                                                             \n  due to other inputs and assumptions in            92                 43                 17        \n  model(b)                                                                                          \n  Change in derivative fair value and             -603               -336             -1,946        \n  other                                                                                             \n  Total risk management                            159                131                 93        \n  Total net mortgage servicing revenue             751                754                739        \n  Total CCB mortgage fees and related            1,378              1,175              1,236        \n  income                                                                                            \n  All other                                         23                  1                 14        \n  Mortgage fees and related income           $   1,401          $   1,176          $   1,250        \n                                                                                                    \n(a) Represents both the impact of changes in\nestimated future prepayments due to changes in\nmarket interest rates, and the difference between\nactual and expected prepayments.

In the following table, the effect that a\nchange in a particular assumption may have on the\nfair value is calculated without changing any other\nassumption.

These leases generally have terms of 20years or less, determined based on the contractual maturity\nof the lease, and include periods covered by options to extend or terminate the lease when the Firm is\nreasonably certain that it will exercise those options. All leases with lease terms greater than twelve\nmonths are reported as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) asset. None of these\nlease agreements impose restrictions on the Firm\u2019s ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity\nfinancing transactions or enter into further lease agreements. Certain of these leases contain escalation\nclauses that will increase rental payments based on maintenance, utility and tax increases, which are non-\nlease components. The Firm elected not to separate lease and non-lease components of a contract for its real\nestate leases. As such, real estate lease payments represent payments on both lease and non-lease\ncomponents. Operating lease liabilities and ROU assets are recognized at the lease commencement date based\non the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The future lease payments are\ndiscounted at a rate that estimates the Firm\u2019s collateralized borrowing rate for financing instruments of a\nsimilar term and are included in accounts payable and other liabilities. The operating lease ROU assets,\npredominantly included in premises and equipment, also include any lease prepayments made, plus initial\ndirect costs incurred, less any lease incentives received.

The\nFirm\u2019s lease financings are predominantly auto\noperating leases. These assets subject to operating\nleases are recognized in other assets on the Firm\u2019s\nConsolidated balance sheets and are depreciated on\na straight-line basis over the lease term to reduce\nthe asset to its estimated residual value.\nDepreciation expense is included in technology,\ncommunications and equipment expense in the\nConsolidated statements of income. The Firm\u2019s lease\nincome is generally recognized on a straight-line\nbasis over the lease term and is included in other\nincome in the Consolidated statements of income. On\na periodic basis, the Firm assesses leased assets\nfor impairment, and if the carrying amount of the\nleased asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows\nfrom the lease payments and the estimated residual\nvalue upon disposition of the leased asset, an\nimpairment is recognized. The risk of loss on auto\nand equipment leased assets relating to the\nresidual value of the leased assets is monitored\nthrough projections of the asset residual values at\nlease origination and periodic review of residual\nvalues, and is mitigated through arrangements with\ncertain manufacturers or lessees.\nThe following table presents the carrying value of\nassets subject to leases

In order to\nmodify exposure to interest rate and currency exchange rate movements, JPMorganChase utilizes derivative\ninstruments, primarily interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps, in conjunction with some of its\ndebt issuances. The use of these instruments modifies the Firm\u2019s interest expense on the associated debt.\nThe modified weighted-average interest rates for total long-term debt, including the effects of related\nderivative instruments, were 5.15% and 5.20% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The amount of\nsuch guaranteed long-term debt and structured notes was $ 41.2billion and $ 41.1billion at December 31, 2024\nand 2023, respectively. The Firm\u2019s unsecured debt does not contain requirements that would call for an\nacceleration of payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any\nlimitations on future borrowings or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the\nFirm\u2019s credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings or stock price.\n                                              \n  290    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n  Note 21 \u2013 Preferred stock                                                                                 \n                                                                                                            \nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, JPMorganChase was authorized to issue 200million shares of preferred stock,\nin one or more series, with a par value of $ 1per share.

The $ 30billion common share repurchase\nprogram approved by the Board of Directors does not\nestablish specific price targets or timetables.\nManagement determines the amount and timing of\ncommon share repurchases based on various factors,\nincluding market conditions; legal and regulatory\nconsiderations affecting the amount and timing of\nrepurchase activity; the Firm\u2019s capital position\n(taking into account goodwill and intangibles);\norganic capital generation; current and proposed\nfuture capital requirements; and other investment\nopportunities. The amount of common shares that the\nFirm repurchases in any period may be substantially\nmore or less than the amounts estimated or actually\nrepurchased in prior periods, reflecting the\ndynamic nature of the decision-making process. The\nFirm\u2019s common share repurchases may be suspended by\nmanagement at any time; and may be executed through\nopen market purchases or privately negotiated\ntransactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 plans, which\nare written trading plans that the Firm may enter\ninto from time to time under Rule 10b5-1 of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 and which allow the\nFirm to repurchase its common shares during periods\nwhen it may otherwise not be repurchasing common\nshares \u2014 for example, during internal trading\nblackout periods.

Under the two-class method, all\nearnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to common stock and participating securities.\nJPMorganChase grants RSUs under its share-based compensation programs, predominantly all of which entitle\nrecipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to dividends\npaid to holders of the Firm\u2019s common stock. These unvested RSUs meet the definition of participating\nsecurities based on their respective rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends, and they are treated as a\nseparate class of securities in computing basic EPS. Participating securities are not included as\nincremental shares in computing diluted EPS; refer to Note 9 for additional information. Diluted EPS\nincorporates the potential impact of contingently issuable shares, including awards which require future\nservice as a condition of delivery of the underlying common stock. Diluted EPS is calculated under both the\ntwo-class and treasury stock methods, and the more dilutive amount is reported.

Similarly, certain non-U.S. NOL carryforwards will expire between 2026 and 2041 whereas others have\nan unlimited carryforward period. The state and local capital loss carryforwards will expire in 2026.

These\nunrecognized items include the tax effect of\ncertain temporary differences, the portion of gross\nstate and local unrecognized tax benefits that\nwould be offset by the benefit from associated U.S.\nfederal income tax deductions, and the portion of\ngross non-U.S. unrecognized tax benefits that would\nhave offsets in other jurisdictions. JPMorganChase\nevaluates the need for changes in unrecognized tax\nbenefits based on its anticipated tax return filing\npositions as part of its U.S. federal and state and\nlocal tax returns. In addition, the Firm is\npresently under audit by a number of taxing\nauthorities, most notably by the Internal Revenue\nService, as summarized in the Tax examination\nstatus table below. The evaluation of unrecognized\ntax benefits as well as the potential for audit\nsettlements make it reasonably possible that over\nthe next 12 months the gross balance of\nunrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease\nby as much as approximately $ 2.4billion.

(\u201cParent Company\u201d) and certain of its affiliates\nunless the loans are secured in specified amounts. Such secured loans provided by any banking subsidiary to\nthe Parent Company or to any particular affiliate, together with certain other transactions with such\naffiliate (collectively referred to as \u201ccovered transactions\u201d), must be made on terms and conditions that\nare consistent with safe and sound banking practices. In addition, unless collateralized with cash or US\nGovernment debt obligations, covered transactions are generally limited to 10% of the banking subsidiary\u2019s\ntotal capital, as determined by the risk-based capital guidelines; the aggregate amount of covered\ntransactions between any banking subsidiary and all of its affiliates is limited to 20% of the banking\nsubsidiary\u2019s total capital. The Parent Company\u2019s two principal subsidiaries are JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nand JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC, an intermediate holding company (the \u201cIHC\u201d). The IHC generally holds the\nstock of JPMorganChase\u2019s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC\nalso owns other assets and provides intercompany loans to the Parent Company. The Parent Company is\nobligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances\n(including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock). The\nprincipal sources of income and funding for the Parent Company are dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nand dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. In addition to dividend restrictions set forth in\nstatutes and regulations, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have authority under the Financial\nInstitutions Supervisory Act to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations\nthey supervise, including the Parent Company and its subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies,\nif, in the banking regulator\u2019s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice\nin light of the financial condition of the banking organization. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends\nor extending credit to the Parent Company if certain capital or liquidity \u201cthresholds\u201d are breached or if\nlimits are otherwise imposed by the Parent Company\u2019s management or Board of Directors. At January 1, 2025,\nthe Parent Company\u2019s banking subsidiaries could pay, in the aggregate, approximately $ 15.5billion in\ndividends to their respective bank holding companies without the prior approval of their relevant banking\nregulators. The capacity to pay dividends in 2025 will be supplemented by the banking subsidiaries\u2019 earnings\nduring the year.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    299  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Note 27 \u2013 Regulatory capital                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \nThe Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the Firm as\na consolidated financial holding company. The OCC establishes similar minimum capital requirements and\nstandards for the Firm\u2019s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The capital rules under Basel\nIII establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally\nactive U.S. bank holding companies and banks, including the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Under the\nrules currently in effect, two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized\napproach (\u201cBasel III Standardized\u201d), and an advanced approach (\u201cBasel III Advanced\u201d). For each of these\nrisk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is evaluated\nagainst the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital\nratio requirements. The three components of regulatory capital under the Basel III rules and their primary\ndrivers are as illustrated below: Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines of the Federal\nReserve, JPMorgan Chase & Co. is required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total\ncapital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal\nReserve to take action. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is also subject to these capital requirements established\nby its primary regulators .\nThe following table presents the risk-based\nregulatory capital ratio requirements and well-\ncapitalized ratios to which the Firm and JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. were subject as of December 31,\n2024 and 2023.\n                                                                                                            \n                Standardiz\u2026                       Advanced                                                  \n                    capital                        capital                    Well-capit\u2026                   \n                      ratio                          ratio                         ratios                   \n                requiremen\u2026                    requiremen\u2026                                                  \n                  BHC(a)(b)       IDI(c)         BHC(a)(b)       IDI(c)            BHC(d)        IDI(e)     \n  Risk-based                                                                                                \n  capital                                                                                                   \n  ratios                                                                                                    \n  CET1                 12.3  %       7.0  %           11.5  %       7.0  %                 NA       6.5  %  \n  capital                                                                                                   \n  Tier 1               13.8          8.5              13.0          8.5               6.0  %        8.0     \n  capital                                                                                                   \n  Total                15.8         10.5              15.0         10.5              10.0          10.0     \n  capital                                                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \nNote: The table above is as defined by the\nregulations issued by the Federal Reserve, OCC and\nFDIC and to which the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. are subject.

The contractual amount of these financial instruments\nrepresents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the\ncommitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or\nclient subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and\nguarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a\ndefault occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm\u2019s\nview, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. To provide for expected\ncredit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses\non lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 13 for further information regarding the\nallowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual\namounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other\ncommitments at December 31, 2024 and 2023. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and\ncertain scored business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these\nproducts. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for\nthese commitments will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments, in\naccordance with the contract, or to the extent otherwise permitted by law, including when there has been a\ndemonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower or significant decrease in the value of\nunderlying property.\n                                              \n  302    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n

The Firm also issues\ncommitments under multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance\nof a standby letter of credit. Guarantees U.S. GAAP requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of\na guarantee, a liability in an amount equal to the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the\nguarantee. U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a contract that contingently requires the guarantor to pay the\nguaranteed party based upon: (a) changes in an underlying asset, liability or equity security of the\nguaranteed party; or (b) a third party\u2019s failure to perform under a specified agreement. The Firm considers\nthe following off\u2013balance sheet arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: standby letters of credit and\nother financial guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, certain indemnification agreements included\nwithin third-party contractual arrangements, certain derivative contracts and the guarantees under the\nsponsored member repo program. As required by U.S. GAAP, the Firm initially records guarantees at the\ninception date fair value of the non-contingent obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of consideration\nreceived or the net present value of the premium receivable). For these obligations, the Firm records this\nfair value amount in other liabilities with an offsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums received), or\nother assets (for premiums receivable). Any premium receivable recorded in other assets is reduced as cash\nis received under the contract, and the fair value of the liability recorded at inception is amortized into\nincome as lending and deposit-related fees over the life of the guarantee contract. The lending-related\ncontingent obligation is recognized based on expected credit losses in addition to, and separate from, any\nnon-contingent obligation. Non-lending-related contingent obligations are recognized when the liability\nbecomes probable and reasonably estimable. These obligations are not recognized if the estimated amount is\nless than the carrying amount of any non-contingent liability recognized at inception (adjusted for any\namortization). Examples of non-lending-related contingent obligations include indemnifications provided in\nsales agreements, where a portion of the sale proceeds is allocated to the guarantee, which adjusts the gain\nor loss that would otherwise result from the transaction. For these indemnifications, the initial liability\nis amortized to income as the Firm\u2019s risk is reduced (i.e., over time or when the indemnification expires).\nThe contractual amount and carrying value of guarantees and indemnifications are included in the table on\npage 303.

Standby letters of credit and other\nfinancial guarantees Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional lending\ncommitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a third party under\ncertain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade\nfinancings and similar transactions.\nThe following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and\nother financial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nStandby letters of credit, other financial guarantees and other letters of credit\n                                                                                                            \n                2024                                           2023                                         \n                Standby                                        Standby                                      \n                letters of                                     letters of                                   \n  December      credit and                                     credit and                                   \n  31,           other                                 Other    other                                 Other  \n  (in           financial                           letters    financial                           letters  \n  millions)     guarantees                        of credit    guarantees                        of credit  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Investmen\u2026                   $  20,443    $         3,380                   $  19,694    $         3,552  \n  Noninvest\u2026                       8,233                974                       9,178                836  \n  Total                                                                                                     \n  contractu\u2026                   $  28,676    $         4,354                   $  28,872    $         4,388  \n  amount                                                                                                    \n  Allowance                                                                                                 \n  for                          $      94    $            37                   $     110    $            37  \n  lending-r\u2026                                                                                                \n  commitmen\u2026                                                                                                \n  Guarantee                          379                  \u2014                         369                  \u2014  \n  liability                                                                                                 \n  Total                                                                                                     \n  carrying                     $     473    $            37                   $     479    $            37  \n  value                                                                                                     \n  Commitmen\u2026                                                                                                \n  with                         $  16,805    $           357                   $  16,861    $           539  \n  collateral                                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \n(a) The ratings scale is based on the Firm\u2019s internal risk ratings. Refer to Note 12 for further information\non internal risk ratings.\n                                              \n  304    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nSecurities lending indemnifications Through the\nFirm\u2019s securities lending program, counterparties\u2019\nsecurities, via custodial and non-custodial\narrangements, may be lent to third parties. As part\nof this program, the Firm provides an\nindemnification in the lending agreements which\nprotects the lender against the failure of the\nborrower to return the lent securities. To minimize\nits liability under these indemnification\nagreements, the Firm obtains cash or other highly\nliquid collateral with a market value exceeding\n100% of the value of the securities on loan from\nthe borrower. Collateral is marked to market daily\nto help assure that collateralization is adequate.\nAdditional collateral is called from the borrower\nif a shortfall exists, or collateral may be\nreleased to the borrower in the event of\novercollateralization. If a borrower defaults, the\nFirm would use the collateral held to purchase\nreplacement securities in the market or to credit\nthe lending client or counterparty with the cash\nequivalent thereof. The cash collateral held by the\nFirm may be invested on behalf of the client in\nindemnified resale agreements, whereby the Firm\nindemnifies the client against the loss of\nprincipal invested. To minimize its liability under\nthese agreements, the Firm obtains collateral with\na market value exceeding 100% of the principal\ninvested. Derivatives qualifying as guarantees The\nFirm transacts in certain derivative contracts that\nhave the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S.\nGAAP. These contracts include written put options\nthat require the Firm to purchase assets upon\nexercise by the option holder at a specified price\nby a specified date in the future. The Firm may\nenter into written put option contracts in order to\nmeet client needs, or for other trading purposes.\nThe terms of written put options are typically five\nyearsor less. Derivatives deemed to be guarantees\nalso includes stable value contracts, commonly\nreferred to as \u201cstable value products\u201d, that\nrequire the Firm to make a payment of the\ndifference between the market value and the book\nvalue of a counterparty\u2019s reference portfolio of\nassets in the event that market value is less than\nbook value and certain other conditions have been\nmet. Stable value products are transacted in order\nto allow investors to realize investment returns\nwith less volatility than an unprotected portfolio.\nThese contracts are typically longer-term or may\nhave no stated maturity, but allow the Firm to\nelect to terminate the contract under certain\nconditions. The notional value of derivative\nguarantees generally represents the Firm\u2019s maximum\nexposure. However, exposure to certain stable value\nproducts is contractually limited to a\nsubstantially lower percentage of the notional\namount.\n\nThe fair value of derivative guarantees reflects\nthe probability, in the Firm\u2019s view, of whether the\nFirm will be required to perform under the\ncontract. The Firm reduces exposures to these\ncontracts by entering into offsetting transactions,\nor by entering into contracts that hedge the market\nrisk related to the derivative guarantees.\nThe following table summarizes the derivatives\nqualifying as guarantees as of December 31, 2024\nand 2023.\n                                                                                                        \n  (in millions)                                      December 31, 2024               December 31, 2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Notional amounts                                                                                      \n  Derivative guarantees                   $  49,628                       $  54,562                     \n  Stable value contracts with                32,939                          32,488                     \n  contractually limited exposure                                                                        \n  Maximum exposure of stable value                                                                      \n  contracts with contractually limited        1,740                           1,652                     \n  exposure                                                                                              \n  Fair value                                                                                            \n  Derivative payables                           113                              89                     \n                                                                                                        \nIn addition to derivative contracts that meet the\ncharacteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a\npurchaser and seller of credit protection in the\ncredit derivatives market. Refer to Note 5 for a\nfurther discussion of credit derivatives. Unsettled\nsecurities financing agreements In the normal\ncourse of business, the Firm enters into resale and\nsecurities borrowed agreements. At settlement,\nthese commitments result in the Firm advancing cash\nto and receiving securities collateral from the\ncounterparty. The Firm also enters into repurchase\nand securities loaned agreements. At settlement,\nthese commitments result in the Firm receiving cash\nfrom and providing securities collateral to the\ncounterparty. Such agreements settle at a future\ndate. These agreements generally do not meet the\ndefinition of a derivative, and therefore, are not\nrecorded on the Consolidated balance sheets until\nsettlement date. These agreements predominantly\nhave regular-way settlement terms. Refer to Note 11\nfor a further discussion of securities financing\nagreements. Loan sales- and securitization-related\nindemnifications Mortgage repurchase liability In\nconnection with the Firm\u2019s mortgage loan sale and\nsecuritization activities with U.S. GSEs the Firm\nhas made representations and warranties that the\nloans sold meet certain requirements, and that may\nrequire the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans\nand/or indemnify the loan purchaser if such\nrepresentations and warranties are breached by the\nFirm.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    305  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nPrivate label securitizations The liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label\nsecuritizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. Refer to Note\n30 for additional information regarding litigation. Loans sold with recourse The Firm provides servicing for\nmortgages and certain commercial lending products on both a recourse and nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse\nservicing, the principal credit risk to the Firm is the cost of temporary servicing advances of funds (i.e.,\nnormal servicing advances). In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner\nof the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses\non recourse servicing predominantly occur when foreclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a\ndefaulted loan are less than the sum of the outstanding principal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan\nand the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property. The Firm\u2019s securitizations are\npredominantly nonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the\npurchaser of the mortgage-backed securities issued by the trust. The unpaid principal balance of loans sold\nwith recourse as well as the carrying value of the related liability that the Firm has recorded in accounts\npayable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, which is representative of the Firm\u2019s view\nof the likelihood it will have to perform under its recourse obligations, are disclosed in the table on page\n303. Other off-balance sheet arrangements Indemnification agreements \u2013 general In connection with issuing\nsecurities to investors outside the U.S., the Firm may agree to pay additional amounts to the holders of the\nsecurities in the event that, due to a change in tax law, certain types of withholding taxes are imposed on\npayments on the securities. The terms of the securities may also give the Firm the right to redeem the\nsecurities if such additional amounts are payable. The Firm may also enter into indemnification clauses such\nas in connection with the licensing of software to clients (\u201csoftware licensees\u201d) or when it sells a\nbusiness or assets to a third party (\u201cthird-party purchasers\u201d), pursuant to which it indemnifies software\nlicensees for claims of liability or damages that may occur subsequent to the licensing of the software, or\nthird-party purchasers for losses they may incur due to actions taken by the Firm prior to the sale of the\nbusiness or assets. It is difficult to estimate the Firm\u2019s maximum exposure under these indemnification\narrangements, since this would require an assessment of future changes in tax law and future claims that may\nbe made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management\nexpects the risk of loss to be remote. Merchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment networks, in its\nrole as a merchant acquirer, the Firm\u2019s Merchant Services business in CIB Payments, retains a contingent\nliability for disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that result in a charge-back to the\nmerchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder\u2019s favor, the Firm will (through the cardholder\u2019s\nissuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge back the transaction to the\nmerchant. If the Firm is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, the Firm will bear the loss for the\namount credited or refunded to the cardholder. The Firm mitigates this risk by withholding future\nsettlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, the Firm recognizes\na valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk related to charge-backs. Clearing Services\n\u2013 Client Credit Risk The Firm provides clearing services for clients by entering into securities purchases\nand sales and derivative contracts with CCPs, including ETDs such as futures and options, as well as OTC-\ncleared derivative contracts. As a clearing member, the Firm stands behind the performance of its clients,\ncollects cash and securities collateral (margin) as well as any settlement amounts due from or to clients,\nand remits them to the relevant CCP or client in whole or part. There are two types of margin: variation\nmargin is posted on a daily basis based on the value of clients\u2019 derivative contracts and initial margin is\nposted at inception of a derivative contract, generally on the basis of the potential changes in the\nvariation margin requirement for the contract. As a clearing member, the Firm is exposed to the risk of\nnonperformance by its clients, but is not liable to clients for the performance of the CCPs. Where possible,\nthe Firm seeks to mitigate its risk to the client through the collection of appropriate amounts of margin at\ninception and throughout the life of the transactions. The Firm can also cease providing clearing services\nif clients do not adhere to their obligations under the clearing agreement. In the event of nonperformance\nby a client, the Firm would close out the client\u2019s positions and access available margin. The CCP would\nutilize any margin it holds to make itself whole, with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by the\nFirm as a clearing member.\n                                              \n  306    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nThe Firm reflects its exposure to nonperformance risk of the client through the recognition of margin\nreceivables from clients and margin payables to CCPs; the clients\u2019 underlying securities or derivative\ncontracts are not reflected in the Firm\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements. It is difficult to estimate the\nFirm\u2019s maximum possible exposure through its role as a clearing member, as this would require an assessment\nof transactions that clients may execute in the future. However, based upon historical experience, and the\ncredit risk mitigants available to the Firm, management believes it is unlikely that the Firm will have to\nmake any material payments under these arrangements and the risk of loss is expected to be remote. Refer to\nNote 5 for information on the derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account and records in its\nConsolidated Financial Statements. Exchange & Clearing House Memberships The Firm is a member of several\nsecurities and derivative exchanges and clearing houses, both in the U.S. and other countries, and it\nprovides clearing services to its clients. Membership in some of these organizations requires the Firm to\npay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization as a result of the default of another\nmember. Such obligations vary with different organizations. These obligations may be limited to the amount\n(or a multiple of the amount) of the Firm\u2019s contribution to the guarantee fund maintained by a clearing\nhouse or exchange as part of the resources available to cover any losses in the event of a member default.\nAlternatively, these obligations may also include a pro rata share of the residual losses after applying the\nguarantee fund. Additionally, certain clearing houses require the Firm as a member to pay a pro rata share\nof losses that may result from the clearing house\u2019s investment of guarantee fund contributions and initial\nmargin, unrelated to and independent of the default of another member. Generally a payment would only be\nrequired should such losses exceed the resources of the clearing house or exchange that are contractually\nrequired to absorb the losses in the first instance. In certain cases, it is difficult to estimate the\nFirm\u2019s maximum possible exposure under these membership agreements, since this would require an assessment\nof future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical\nexperience, management expects the risk of loss to the Firm to be remote. Where the Firm\u2019s maximum possible\nexposure can be estimated, the amount is disclosed in the table on page 303, in the Exchange & clearing\nhouse guarantees and commitments line. Sponsored member repo program The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to\nclear eligible overnight and term resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities\nDivision of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (\u201cFICC\u201d) on behalf of clients that become sponsored\nmembers under the FICC\u2019s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment and\nperformance of its sponsored member clients\u2019 respective obligations under the FICC\u2019s rules. The Firm\nminimizes its liability under these guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the cash or high-quality\nsecurities collateral that the clients place with the clearing house; therefore, the Firm expects the risk\nof loss to be remote. The Firm\u2019s maximum possible exposure, without taking into consideration the associated\ncollateral, is included in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line on page 303. Refer\nto Note 11 for additional information on credit risk mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types\nof collateral pledged under repurchase agreements. Guarantees of subsidiaries In the normal course of\nbusiness, the Parent Company may provide counterparties with guarantees of certain of the trading and other\nobligations of its subsidiaries on a contract-by-contract basis, as negotiated with the Firm\u2019s\ncounterparties. The obligations of the subsidiaries are included on the Firm\u2019s Consolidated balance sheets\nor are reflected as off-balance sheet commitments; therefore, the Parent Company has not recognized a\nseparate liability for these guarantees. The Firm believes that the occurrence of any event that would\ntrigger payments by the Parent Company under these guarantees is remote. The Parent Company has guaranteed\ncertain long-term debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial Company\nLLC (\u201cJPMFC\u201d), a 100%-owned finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully and unconditionally\nguaranteed by the Parent Company and no other subsidiary of the Parent Company guarantees these securities.\nThese guarantees, which rank pari passu with the Firm\u2019s unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, are not\nincluded in the table on page 303 of this Note.

The litigations range from\nindividual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class\nmembers. Investigations and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by\nboth governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages\nof adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm\u2019s lines of business and several\ngeographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory\nantitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm\nbelieves the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves\nestablished, for its legal proceedings is from $ 0to approximately $ 1.4billion at December 31, 2024. This\nestimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date\nfor those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made.\nFor certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The\nFirm\u2019s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: \u2022\nthe number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary\nstages, \u2022 the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of\nliability (if any) has yet to be determined, \u2022 the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the\nproceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and \u2022 the\nuncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made\nassumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives\nof adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition, the\noutcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate\nbecause the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm\u2019s estimate of\nthe aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary\nsignificantly. Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm\u2019s material legal proceedings. 1MDB Litigation .\nJ.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by\n1Malaysia Development Berhad (\u201c1MDB\u201d), a Malaysian state-owned and controlled investment fund. The claim\nalleges \u201cdishonest assistance\u201d against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in relation to payments of $ 300million and $\n500million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan\n(Suisse) SA held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings\n(Cayman) Limited. In March 2024, the Court upheld the Firm's challenge to the validity of service and the\nMalaysian Court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear the claim. That decision has been appealed by 1MDB. In August 2023,\nthe Court denied an application by 1MDB to discontinue its claim with permission to re-file a new claim in\nthe future. That decision was appealed by both 1MDB and the Firm, and an appeals court is scheduled to hear\nboth appeals in November 2025. In its appeal, the Firm seeks to prevent any claim from continuing. In\naddition, in November 2023, the Federal Office of the Attorney General (OAG) in Switzerland notified J.P.\nMorgan (Suisse) SA that it is conducting an investigation into possible criminal liability in connection\nwith transactions arising from J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA\u2019s relationship with the 1MDB PetroSaudi joint venture\nand its related persons for the period September 2009 through August 2015. The OAG investigation is ongoing.\nAmrapali . India\u2019s Enforcement Directorate (\u201cED\u201d) is investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in\nconnection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by twooffshore funds formerly managed by JPMorganChase\nentities into residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (\u201cAmrapali\u201d) relating to delays\nin delivering or failure to deliver residential units. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P.\nMorgan India Private Limited approximately $ 31.5million, and the Firm is appealing that order. Relatedly,\nin July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other\nparties, including unspecified JPMorganChase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the\nprojects, violated certain criminal currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordered the ED to\nconduct a further inquiry. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the inquiry. Foreign Exchange\nInvestigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities\nrelating to its foreign exchange (\u201cFX\u201d) sales and trading activities and controls related to those\nactivities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal\nantitrust law. The Department of Labor (\"DOL\") granted the Firm exemptions that permit the Firm and its\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    309  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \naffiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee\nRetirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d) through the ten-yeardisqualification period following the antitrust\nplea. The only remaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter\nwhich is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal. With respect to civil litigation\nmatters, some FX-related individual and putative class actions filed outside the U.S., including in the\nU.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia, remain. In July 2023, the U.K. Court of Appeal\noverturned the Competition Appeal Tribunal's earlier denial of a request for class certification on an opt-\nout basis. The defendants have appealed this decision to the U.K. Supreme Court. In Israel, a settlement in\nprinciple has been reached on the putative class action, which remains subject to court approval.\nInterchange Litigation . Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action\ncomplaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit\nand debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In September 2018,\nthe parties settled the class action seeking monetary relief, with the defendants collectively contributing\napproximately $ 6.2billion. The settlement has been approved by the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of New York and affirmed on appeal. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of\nthe settlement, $ 700million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow. A separate\nclass action seeking injunctive relief continues, and in September 2021, the District Court granted\nplaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion in part. In June 2024, the\nDistrict Court denied preliminary approval of a settlement of the injunctive class action in which Visa and\nMastercard agreed to certain changes to their respective network rules and system-wide reductions in\ninterchange rates for U.S.-based merchants. The parties are considering next steps. Of the merchants who\nopted out of the damages class settlement, certain merchants filed individual actions raising similar\nallegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks. While some of those\nactions remain pending, the defendants have reached settlements with the merchants who opted out\nrepresenting over 70% of the combined Mastercard-branded and Visa-branded payment card sales volume. LIBOR\nand Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation . JPMorganChase has responded to inquiries from\nvarious governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers\nAssociation\u2019s (\u201cBBA\u201d) London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) for various currencies and the European\nBanking Federation\u2019s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cEURIBOR\u201d). The Swiss Competition Commission\u2019s\ninvestigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain subject, continues. The Firm\nappealed a December 2016 decision by the European Commission against the Firm and other banks finding an\ninfringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. In December 2023, the European General Court\nannulled the fine imposed by the European Commission, but exercised its discretion to re-impose a fine in an\nidentical amount. In March 2024, the Firm filed an appeal of this decision with the Court of Justice of the\nEuropean Union. In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in various\nindividual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions\nrelated to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York granted class certification of antitrust claims related\nto bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. The Firm has obtained\ndismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other actions, and as to all remaining actions has moved\nfor summary judgment. In addition, a lawsuit filed by a group of individual plaintiffs asserting antitrust\nclaims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar\nLIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards was dismissed\nin October 2023 and affirmed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in\nDecember 2024. The Firm has resolved all non-U.S. dollar LIBOR actions. Russian Litigation . The Firm is\nobligated to comply with international sanctions laws, which mandate the blocking of certain assets. These\nlaws apply when assets associated with individuals, companies, products or services are within the scope of\nthe sanctions. The Firm has faced actual and threatened litigation in Russia seeking payments that the Firm\ncannot make under, and is contractually excused from paying as a result of, relevant sanctions laws. In\nclaims involving the Firm and claims filed against other financial institutions, Russian courts have\ndisregarded the parties\u2019 contractual agreements concerning forum selection and did not recognize foreign\nsanctions laws as a basis for not making payment. Russian courts have entered judgment against the Firm in a\nnumber of claims, including one for $ 439million, and a judgment has been executed against assets held\nonshore by the Firm in Russia. The total amount of the judgments exceeds the total amount of available\nassets that the Firm holds in Russia. The Firm continues to appeal the Russian courts' decisions, and\njudgments may not be executed while on appeal. Russian courts have also ordered interim freezes of Firm\nassets in Russia (including, among other things, funds in bank accounts, securities, shares in authorized\ncapital, and certain trademarks, of the named defendants) pending a determination of\n                                              \n  310    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                              \ncertain underlying claims against the Firm. The Firm has challenged claims being pursued in the Russian\ncourts and related freeze orders in other jurisdictions provided for by the parties\u2019 contractual forum\nselections. If further claims are enforced despite the actions taken by the Firm to challenge the claims and\norders and to seek the proper application of law, the Firm\u2019s assets in Russia could be seized in full, and\ncertain client assets could also be seized, or the Firm could be prevented from complying with its\nobligations. SEC Inquiries . In October 2024, the Firm entered into settlements with the SEC to resolve\ninquiries related to, among other things, conflict disclosures concerning the selection of portfolio\nmanagers and the timing of the Firm\u2019s liquidation of shares distributed in-kind to certain investment\nvehicles that invest in third-party managed private funds and certain other matters. The resolutions\nrequired the Firm to pay a combined $ 151million in civil penalties and voluntary payments to customers. The\nFirm continues to cooperate in connection with SEC inquiries concerning the aggregation of accounts for fee\nbilling and various other matters. Shareholder Litigation . Several shareholder putative class actions, as\nwell as shareholder derivative actions purporting to act on behalf of the Firm, have been filed against the\nFirm, its Board of Directors and certain of its current and former officers. Certain of these shareholder\nsuits relate to historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries\nmarkets and related conduct which were the subject of the Firm\u2019s resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC in\nSeptember 2020, and fiduciary activities that were separately the subject of a resolution between JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in November 2020. One of these shareholder derivative suits was filed in the\nSupreme Court of the State of New York in May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment\nclaims relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct and fiduciary activities which were\nthe subject of the resolutions described above. In December 2022, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion to\ndismiss this action in full, and in July 2023, the plaintiff filed an appeal, which remains pending. A\nsecond shareholder derivative action relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct was\nfiled in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in December 2022. Defendants\nhave moved to dismiss the complaint. Zelle Network Litigation . In December 2024, the Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) filed a complaint against Early Warning Services, LLC (\u201cEWS\u201d), Bank of America,\nN.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Arizona. The CFPB alleges that EWS and the defendant banks have failed to take sufficient\nefforts to prevent fraud on the Zelle network. The defendants will file a response to the complaint. * * *\nIn addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries are named\nas defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm\nbelieves it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal\nproceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from\ntime to time in the future. The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently\noutstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm\naccrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and\nthe amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings\neach quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upward or downward,\nas appropriate, based on management\u2019s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm\u2019s legal\nexpense was $ 740million, $ 1.4billion and $ 266million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and\n2022, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm\u2019s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted\nin the future. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings,\nparticularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present\nnovel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot\nstate with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of\ntheir ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters.\nJPMorganChase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration\nof the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation\nreserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently\npending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm\u2019s consolidated financial condition.\nThe Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no\nassurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has\ncurrently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the\noutcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorganChase\u2019s operating results for a particular period,\ndepending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of\nJPMorganChase\u2019s income for that period.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    311  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Note 31 \u2013 International operations                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \nThe following table presents income statement and balance sheet-related information for JPMorganChase by\nmajor international geographic area. The Firm defines international activities for purposes of this footnote\npresentation as business transactions that involve clients residing outside of the U.S., and the information\npresented below is based predominantly on the domicile of the client, the location from which the client\nrelationship is managed, booking location or the location of the trading desk. However, many of the Firm\u2019s\nU.S. operations serve international businesses. As the Firm\u2019s operations are highly integrated, estimates\nand subjective assumptions have been made to apportion revenue and expense between U.S. and international\noperations. These estimates and assumptions are consistent with the allocations used for the Firm\u2019s segment\nreporting as set forth in Note 32. The Firm\u2019s long-lived assets for the periods presented are not considered\nby management to be significant in relation to total assets. The majority of the Firm\u2019s long-lived assets\nare located in the U.S.\n                                                                                                            \n  As of or

reorganized its\nreportable business segments by combining the former Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking\nbusiness segments to form one reportable segment, the Commercial & Investment Bank. As a result of the\nreorganization, the Firm has three reportable business segments \u2013 Consumer & Community Banking, Commercial &\nInvestment Bank, and Asset & Wealth Management \u2013 with the remaining activities in Corporate. Adoption of\naccounting standard \u2014 Segment Reporting \u2014 Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures: This guidance was\nadopted retrospectively for the Firm\u2019s annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December\n31, 2024. The adoption of this guidance requires additional reportable segment disclosures, primarily\nrelating to significant segment expenses and the chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d). Adoption of this\nguidance did not result in changes to the identification of the Firm\u2019s reportable business segments, or of\nits CODM. The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. The business segments are determined based on the products\nand services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial\ninformation is evaluated by the Firm\u2019s Operating Committee, whose members act collectively as the Firm\u2019s\nCODM. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Segment & Corporate results in this\nfootnote for a further discussion of JPMorganChase\u2019s reportable business segments and Corporate.

The management reporting process that\nderives business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm\nperiodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment\nreporting, and therefore further refinements may be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses\nthe level of capital required for each LOB on at least an annual basis. The Firm\u2019s LOBs also provide various\nbusiness metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing performance.\nRevenue sharing When business segments or businesses within each segment join efforts to sell products and\nservices to the Firm\u2019s clients and customers, the participating businesses may agree to share revenue from\nthose transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the segment responsible for the related product or\nservice, with allocations to the other segments or businesses involved in the transaction. The segment and\nbusiness results reflect these revenue-sharing agreements. Expense allocation Where business segments use\nservices provided by Corporate support units, or another business segment, the costs of those services are\nallocated to the respective business segments. The expense is generally allocated based on the actual cost\nand use of services provided. In contrast, certain costs and investments related to Corporate that are not\ncurrently utilized by any LOB are not allocated to the business segments and are retained in Corporate.\nExpense retained in Corporate generally includes costs that would not be incurred if the segments were\nstand-alone businesses, and other items not solely aligned with a particular reportable business segment.\nFunds transfer pricing Funds transfer pricing (\u201cFTP\u201d) is the process by which the Firm allocates interest\nincome and expense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk and\nliquidity risk to Treasury and CIO. The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and\nliquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically, the\nmethodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and\nother factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest income to the segments. Effective in the\nfourth quarter of 2024, the Firm updated its FTP with respect to consumer deposits, which resulted in an\nincrease in the funding benefit reflected within CCB\u2019s net interest income that is fully offset in\nCorporate, with no effect on the Firm\u2019s net interest income. Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk is\ntransferred from the LOBs and Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues and expenses.\nTreasury and CIO manages these risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate movements\nrelated to the transferred risk in its results. Debt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation As part\nof the FTP process, almost all of the cost of the credit spread component of outstanding unsecured long-term\ndebt and preferred stock dividends is allocated to the reportable business segments, while the balance of\nthe cost is retained in Corporate. The methodology to allocate the cost of unsecured long-term debt and\npreferred stock dividends to the business segments is aligned with the relevant regulatory capital\nrequirements and funding needs of the LOBs, as applicable. The allocated cost of unsecured long-term debt is\nincluded in a business segment\u2019s net interest income, and net income is reduced by preferred stock\ndividends, to arrive at a business segment\u2019s net income applicable to common equity. Capital allocation Each\nLOB and Corporate is allocated capital by taking into consideration a variety of factors including capital\nlevels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. ROE is measured and internal\ntargets for expected returns are established as key measures of an LOB\u2019s performance. The Firm\u2019s current\nequity allocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized RWA and the GSIB surcharge, both under\nrules currently in effect, as well as a simulation of capital depletion in a severe stress environment. At\nleast annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as\na result, the capital allocated to the LOBs and Corporate may change.\n                                              \n  314    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nSegment & Corporate results\nThe following table provides a summary of results for the Firm\u2019s reportable business segments and Corporate\nactivities as of or for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, on a managed basis. The Firm\u2019s\ndefinition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain\nreclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm as a whole (and for each of the reportable\nbusiness segments and Corporate) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax\ncredits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable\ninvestments and securities. This allows management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year\narising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt\nitems is recorded within income tax expense/(benefit). These adjustments have no impact on net income as\nreported by the Firm as a whole or by the each of the LOBs and Corporate. The Operating Committee reviews\nsegment results including net interest income, noninterest revenue, noninterest expense, provision for\ncredit losses and net income on a managed basis. The Operating Committee uses these measures to evaluate\nsegment performance and to make key operating decisions, including resource and capital allocations.\nSegment & Corporate results and

The\nacquisition resulted in a bargain purchase gain, which represents the excess of the estimated fair value of\nthe net assets acquired above the purchase price. The Firm has determined that this acquisition constitutes\na business combination under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the initial recognition of the assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed were generally measured at their estimated fair values as of May 1, 2023. The\ndetermination of those fair values required management to make certain market-based assumptions about\nexpected future cash flows, discount rates and other valuation inputs at the time of the acquisition. The\nFirm believes that the fair value estimates of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed provide a\nreasonable basis for determining the estimated bargain purchase gain. The First Republic acquisition\nresulted in a preliminary estimated bargain purchase gain of $ 2.7billion. The final bargain purchase gain\nof $ 2.9billion reflects adjustments of $ 103million and $ 63million for the years ended December 31, 2024\nand 2023, respectively, made during the one-year measurement period, as permitted by U.S. GAAP, to finalize\nmanagement's fair value estimates for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. As of December 31, 2024,\ncertain matters related to the final settlement remained outstanding between the Firm and the FDIC. On\nJanuary 17, 2025, the Firm reached an agreement with the FDIC with respect to certain outstanding items. As\na result of the agreement, the Firm made a payment of $ 609million to the FDIC on January 31, 2025 and\nreduced its additional payable to the FDIC, which will result in a gain of approximately $ 600million to be\nrecorded in other income in the first quarter of 2025. In connection with the First Republic acquisition,\nthe Firm and the FDIC entered into twoshared-loss agreements with respect to certain loans and lending-\nrelated commitments (the \"shared-loss assets\"): the Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement (\"CSLA\") and the\nSingle-Family Shared-Loss Agreement (\u201cSFSLA\u201d). The CSLA covers 80% of credit losses, on a pari passu basis,\nover 5years with a subsequent 3-yearrecovery period for certain acquired commercial loans and other real\nestate exposure. The SFSLA covers 80% of credit losses, on a pari passu basis, for 7years for certain\nacquired loans secured by mortgages on real property or shares in cooperative property constituting a\nprimary residence. The indemnification assets, which represent the fair value of the CSLA and SFSLA on the\nacquisition date, are reflected in the total assets acquired. As part of the consideration paid,\nJPMorganChase issued a five-year, $ 50billion secured note to the FDIC (the \"Purchase Money Note\"). The\nPurchase Money Note bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.4% and is secured by certain of the acquired loans.\nThe Purchase Money Note is prepayable upon notice to the holder. The Firm had placed a $ 5billion deposit\nwith First Republic Bank on March 16, 2023, as part of $ 30billion of deposits provided by a consortium of\nlarge U.S. banks. The Firm's $ 5billion deposit was effectively settled as part of the acquisition and the\nassociated allowance for credit losses was released upon closing. The Firm subsequently repaid the remaining\n$ 25billion of deposits to the consortium of banks, including accrued interest through the payment date on\nMay 9, 2023.\n                                              \n  JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K    319  \n                                              \n                                                                                                            \n   Notes to consolidated financial statements                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nThe computation of the purchase price, the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as\npart of the First Republic acquisition and the related bargain purchase gain are presented below, which\nreflects adjustments made during the measurement period to the acquisition-date fair value of the net assets\nacquired.

Other liabilities include the related tax-oriented investment liabilities of $ 669million and lease\nliabilities of $ 748million.\nThe following describes the accounting policies and fair value methodologies generally used by the Firm for\nthe following assets acquired and liabilities assumed: core deposit and customer relationship intangibles,\nshared-loss agreements and the related indemnification assets, Purchase Money Note, and FHLB advances.\n\nFor further discussion of the Firm\u2019s accounting policies and valuation methodologies, refer to Notes 2 and 3\nfor fair value measurement, Note 10 for investment securities, Note 12 for loans, Note 17 for deposits, and\nNote 28 for lending-related commitments.\nCore deposit and customer relationship intangibles Core deposit and certain wealth management customer\nrelationship intangibles were acquired as part of the First Republic acquisition. The core deposit\nintangible of $ 1.3billion was valued by discounting estimated after-tax cost savings over the remaining\nuseful life of the deposits using the favorable source of funds method. The after-tax cost savings were\nestimated based on the difference between the cost of maintaining the core deposit base relative to the cost\nof next best alternative funding sources available to market participants. The customer relationship\nintangibles of $ 180million were valued by discounting estimated after-tax earnings over their remaining\nuseful lives using the multi-period excess earnings method. Both intangible asset valuations utilized\nassumptions that the Firm believes a market participant would use to estimate fair values, such as growth\nand attrition rates, projected fee income as well as related costs to service the relationships, and\ndiscount rates. The core deposit and customer relationship intangibles are amortized over a projected period\nof future cash flows of approximately 7years. Refer to Note 15 for further discussion on other intangible\nassets.\n                                              \n  320    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K  \n                                              \nIndemnification assets - Shared-loss agreements The indemnification assets represent forecasted recoveries\nfrom the FDIC associated with the shared-loss assets over the respective shared-loss recovery periods. The\nindemnification assets were recorded at fair value in other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets on the\nacquisition date. The fair values of the indemnification assets were estimated based on the timing of the\nforecasted losses underlying the related allowance for credit losses. The subsequent quarterly remeasurement\nof the indemnification assets is based on changes in the amount and timing of forecasted losses in the\nallowance for credit losses associated with the shared-loss assets and is recorded in other income. Under\ncertain circumstances, the Firm may be required to make a payment to the FDIC upon termination of the\nshared-loss agreements based on the level of actual losses and recoveries on the shared-loss assets. The\nestimated potential future payment is reflected as contingent consideration as part of the purchase price\nconsideration. Purchase Money Note and FHLB advances The Purchase Money Note is recorded in long-term debt\non the Consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the Purchase Money Note was estimated based on a\ndiscounted cash flow methodology and incorporated estimated market discount rates. The FHLB advances assumed\nin the acquisition are recorded in short-term borrowings and in long-term debt. The fair values of the FHLB\nadvances were based on a discounted cash flow methodology and considered the observed FHLB advance issuance\nrates.\n\nLoans\n\nThe following table presents the unpaid principal balance (\"UPB\") and fair values of the loans acquired as\nof May 1, 2023, and reflects adjustments made during the measurement period to the acquisition-date fair\nvalue of the loans acquired .\n                                                              \n                                May 1, 2023                   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (in millions)                         UPB       Fair value  \n  Residential real estate    $      106,240    $      92,053  \n  Auto and other                      3,093            2,030  \n  Total consumer                    109,333           94,083  \n  Secured by real estate             37,117           33,602  \n  Commercial & industrial             4,332            3,932  \n  Other                              23,499           21,625  \n  Total wholesale                    64,948           59,159  \n  Total loans                $      174,281    $     153,242  \n                                                              \nUnaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information\nThe following table presents certain unaudited pro forma financial information for the year ended December\n31, 2023 and 2022 as if the First Republic acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2022, including\nrecognition of the estimated bargain purchase gain of $ 2.8billion and the provision for credit losses of $\n1.2billion . Additional adjustments include the interest on the Purchase Money Note and the impact of\namortizing and accreting certain estimated fair value adjustments related to intangible assets, loans and\nlending-related commitments.\nThe Firm expects to achieve operating cost savings and other business synergies resulting from the\nacquisition that are not reflected in the pro forma amounts.

                    \nThe table below presents an attribution of net interest income between volume and rate. The attribution\nbetween volume and rate is calculated using annual average balances for each category of assets and\nliabilities shown in the table and the corresponding annual rates (refer to pages 322-325 for more\ninformation on average balances and rates). In this analysis, when the change cannot be isolated to either\nvolume or rate, it has been allocated to volume. The annual rates include the impact of changes in market\nrates, as well as the impact of any change in composition of the various products within each category of\nasset or liability. This analysis is calculated separately for each category without consideration of the\nrelationship between categories (for example, the net spread between the rates earned on assets and the\nrates paid on liabilities that fund those assets). As a result, changes in the granularity or groupings\nconsidered in this analysis would produce a different attribution result, and due to the complexities\ninvolved, precise allocation of changes in

The\nminimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on\nthe interest rate charged during the introductory\nperiod. This introductory rate is usually\nsignificantly below the fully indexed rate. The\nfully indexed rate is calculated using an index\nrate plus a margin. Once the introductory period\nends, the contractual interest rate charged on the\nloan increases to the fully indexed rate and\nadjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index.\nThe minimum payment is typically insufficient to\ncover interest accrued in the prior month, and any\nunpaid interest is deferred and added to the\nprincipal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are\nsubject to payment recast, which converts the loan\nto a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon\nmeeting specified loan balance and anniversary date\ntriggers.\n\nPrime\n\nPrime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with\ngood credit records who meet specific underwriting\nrequirements, including prescriptive requirements\nrelated to income and overall debt levels.
