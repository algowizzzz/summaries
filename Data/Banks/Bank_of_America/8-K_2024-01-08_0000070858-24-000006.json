                                                            \nAs part of the global transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate as a\nbenchmark rate, various alternative reference rates were established, including\nthe Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index (\u201cBSBY\u201d) and Secured Overnight Financing\nRate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). Beginning in 2021, Bank of America Corporation (the \u201cCorporation\u201d)\nand other members of the banking industry began utilizing these rates in various\nlending agreements, including commercial loans.\n\nOn November 15, 2023, the Bloomberg Index Services Limited announced that the\npermanent cessation of BSBY and all its tenors will be effective on November 15,\n2024. After such announcement, and following the Corporation\u2019s internal and\nexternal consultations, it was determined that the accounting transition relief in\nASC 848, Reference Rate Reform , is not available for BSBY cessation .\n\nAccordingly, under U.S. GAAP, the Corporation was required to \u201cde-designate\u201d\ncertain interest rate swaps used in cash flow hedges of certain BSBY-indexe d\nloans, as of November 15, 2023, and reclassify into earnings any amounts\nrecognized in the accumulated other comprehensive income category of shareholders\u2019\nequity that relate to forecasted cash flows that are now no longer expected to\noccur. Therefore, the Corporation recognized a net non-cash, pretax charge of\napproximately $ 1.6 billion in the quarter ending December 31, 2023 (the \u201cCharge\u201d)\npresented in revenue through market making and similar activities . The $1.6\nbillion net impact is expected to be recognized back into the Corporation\u2019s\ninterest income in subsequent periods largely through 2026. The impact of such\naccounting treatment is solely due to the expectation that interest payments on\nthe BSBY-indexed loans will change to SOFR, which is expected to have a nominal\nimpact to the economics of these loans. The Charge reduced the Corporation\u2019s\ncommon equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio by eight basis points, as of December 31, 2023 .\n\nThe Corporation will report its fourth-quarter 2023 financial results on Friday,\nJanuary 12, 2024 .\n                                                                                  \n  Forward-Looking Statements                                                      \n                                                                                  \nCertain statements contained in this Report may constitute \u201cforward-looking\u201d\nstatements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of\n1995.
