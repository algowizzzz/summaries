Based on our\nresults, we will be subject to a preliminary 2.5 percent stress\ncapital buffer (SCB) for the period beginning October 1, 2020\nand ending on September 30, 2021. The Federal Reserve plans to\nfinalize the SCB for all BHCs by August 31, 2020. For more\ninformation on SCB, see Capital Management on page 23 . The\nFederal Reserve also announced that due to economic uncertainty\nresulting from the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic,\nall large banks will be required to suspend share repurchase\nprograms in the third quarter of 2020, except for repurchases to\noffset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans, and\nlimit dividends to existing rates that do not exceed the average\nof the last four quarters\u2019 net income. Large banks will also be\nrequired to resubmit and update their capital plans later this\nyear based on instructions that the Federal Reserve will\nprovide. The Federal Reserve plans to conduct additional\nanalysis to assess the Corporation's capital plans and will\nreview capital preservation measures on a quarter-by-quarter\nbasis. The Federal Reserve\u2019s directive regarding share\nrepurchases aligns with our decision to voluntarily suspend\nrepurchases in the first quarter of 2020 from the date of the\nannouncement on March 15, 2020 through the end of the second\nquarter of 2020. The suspension of our repurchases did not\ninclude repurchases to offset shares awarded under our equity-\nbased compensation plans, for which we repurchased $286 million\nof common stock during the second quarter of 2020 pursuant to\nthe Board's repurchase authorization under our 2019 CCAR capital\nplan. On July 22, 2020, the Board of Directors (the Board)\ndeclared a quarterly common stock dividend at the existing rate\nof $0.18 per share. We intend to maintain the quarterly common\nstock dividend at this rate until further notice, subject to\napproval by the Board. We will also continue our current\nsuspension of common stock repurchases in the third quarter of\n2020, except for repurchases to offset shares awarded under\nequity-based compensation plans. For more information on our\ncapital resources, see Capital Management on page 23 . COVID-19\nPandemic In the first quarter of 2020, the World Health\nOrganization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. In an\nattempt to contain the spread and impact of the COVID-19\npandemic, travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-\nplace orders and limitations on business activity have been\nimplemented. Additionally, there has been a sharp decline in\nglobal economic activity, reduced U.S. and global economic\noutput and a significant deterioration in macroeconomic\nconditions in the U.S. and globally. This has resulted in, among\nother things, high rates of unemployment and underemployment and\ncaused volatility and disruptions in the global financial\nmarkets, including the energy and commodity markets. Although\nsome restrictive measures have been eased in certain areas, many\nof the restrictive measures remain in place or have been\nreinstated, and in some cases additional restrictive measures\nare being implemented. Businesses, market participants, our\ncounterparties and clients, and the U.S. and global economies\nhave been negatively impacted and are likely to be so for an\nextended period of time, as there remains significant\nuncertainty about the timing and strength of an economic\nrecovery. In response to the pandemic, the Corporation has\nimplemented protocols and processes to execute its business\ncontinuity plans and help protect its employees and support its\nclients. The Corporation is managing its response to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic according to its Enterprise Response\nFramework, which invokes centralized management of the crisis\nevent and the integration of its response. The CEO and key\nmembers of the Corporation\u2019s management team meet daily with co-\nleaders of the Executive Response Team, which is composed of\nsenior executives across the Corporation, to help drive\ndecisions, communications, and consistency of response across\nall businesses and functions. We are also coordinating with\nglobal, regional and local authorities and health experts,\nincluding the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC) and the World Health Organization. Additionally, we have\nimplemented a number of measures to assist our employees,\nclients and the communities we serve, including the following:\n                    \n  3Bank of America  \n                    \nEmployees We are providing\nsupport to our teammates to\nhelp promote the health and\nsafety of our employees,\nincluding:\n                                                                \n     Monitoring guidance from the CDC, medical boards and       \n  \u25cf  health authorities and sharing such guidance with our      \n     employees.                                                 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Operating our businesses from remote locations and         \n     leveraging our business continuity plans and               \n     capabilities.

Loan Modifications\nThe Corporation has implemented\nvarious consumer and commercial\nloan modification programs to\nprovide its borrowers relief\nfrom the economic impacts of\nCOVID-19. Based on guidance in\nthe CARES Act that the\nCorporation adopted, COVID-19\nrelated modifications to\nconsumer and commercial loans\nthat were current as of\nDecember 31, 2019 are exempt\nfrom troubled debt\nrestructuring (TDR)\nclassification under accounting\nprinciples generally accepted\nin the United States of America\n(GAAP). In addition, the bank\nregulatory agencies issued\ninteragency guidance stating\nthat COVID-19 related short-\nterm modifications (i.e., six\nmonths or less) granted to\nconsumer or commercial loans\nthat were current as of the\nloan modification program\nimplementation date are not\nTDRs. For more information, see\nNote 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant\nAccounting Principles and Note\n5 \u2013 Outstanding Loans and\nLeases and Allowance for Credit\nLosses to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements . The\nfollowing table provides a\nsummary of the percentage of\nour loans and loan balances\nwith modifications in place as\nof July 23, 2020. The\nmodifications were made in\nresponse to COVID-19 under\npayment deferral or forbearance\nprograms, none of which are\nclassified as TDRs. As of the\ndate presented, loan balances\nof deferred consumer and small\nbusiness accounts totaled $28.5\nbillion.

The largest\nnumber of processed deferrals has been for consumer and small\nbusiness credit card holders, of which 85 percent were initiated\nin late March and April 2020. At the time the deferrals were\nrequested, more than 95 percent of these customers were current.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, approximately 61 percent of\nthese customers have made at least one payment, and 33 percent\nhave made a payment each month since being placed on deferral.\nOther Related Matters As part of our ongoing review of our\nfinancial condition in light of the pandemic, we evaluated\ngoodwill and other intangibles and equity investments for\npotential impairment. Based upon our review as of June 30, 2020,\nno impairments have been recorded. For more information on\ngoodwill, see Complex Accounting Estimates \u2013 Goodwill and\nIntangible Assets on page 50 and Note 7 \u2013 Goodwill and\nIntangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGiven the significant uncertainty regarding the duration and\nfurther spread of COVID-19 and rapidly evolving economic effects\nand social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the future direct\nand indirect impact on our businesses, results of operations and\nfinancial condition remain highly uncertain. Should current\neconomic conditions persist or continue to deteriorate, we\nexpect that this macroeconomic environment will have a continued\nadverse effect on our businesses and results of operations and\ncould have an effect on our financial condition. For more\ninformation on how the risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic\nmay adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and\nfinancial condition, see Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors on page\n104 . LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates As previously disclosed,\nto facilitate an orderly transition from Interbank Offered Rates\n(IBORs) and other benchmark rates to alternative reference rates\n(ARRs), the Corporation has established an enterprise-wide\nprogram to identify, assess and monitor risks associated with\nthe expected discontinuation or unavailability of benchmarks,\nincluding the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). As part of\nthis program, the Corporation continues to identify, assess and\nmonitor risks associated with the expected discontinuation or\nunavailability of LIBOR and other benchmarks, and evaluate and\naddress documentation and contractual mechanics of outstanding\nIBOR-based products and contracts that may mature after LIBOR is\nno longer deemed a representative benchmark and new and\npotential future ARR-based products and contracts to achieve\noperational readiness. This program, which is led by the\nCorporation's Chief Operating Officer, includes active\ninvolvement of senior management and regular reports to the\nEnterprise Risk Committee. The program is structured to address\nthe Corporation's industry and regulatory engagement, client and\nfinancial contract changes, internal and external\ncommunications, technology and operations modifications,\nintroduction of new products, migration of existing clients, and\nprogram strategy and governance. As the markets for ARRs\ncontinue to grow, the Corporation continues to monitor the\ndevelopment and usage of ARRs, including the Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate. Additionally, the Corporation continues to\nmonitor the impact of COVID-19 on the market and industry\ntransition to ARRs, including the readiness of other market\nparticipants and third-party vendors, and impacted clients and\ntheir operational readiness to transition to ARRs. For more\ninformation on the expected replacement of LIBOR and other\nbenchmark rates, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments -\nLIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates in the MD&A and Item 1A. Risk\nFactors - Other of the Corporation\u2019s 2019 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. For more information about the Corporation's risks related\nto the COVID-19 pandemic, see Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors on\npage 104 . Merchant Services Joint Venture Prior to the third\nquarter of 2020, a significant portion of our merchant\nprocessing activity was performed by a joint venture in which we\nhold a 49 percent ownership interest. In 2019, we delivered\nnotice of termination of the joint venture at the conclusion of\nits term in June 2020 to the joint venture partner.

Effective July 1, 2020, the\nCorporation received its share of the joint venture's merchant\ncontracts and began providing merchant services for the customer\nrelationships received. Beginning in the third quarter of 2020,\nmerchant revenue and the related noninterest expense will be\nrecorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income and are not\nexpected to be material.\n                    \n  5Bank of America  \n                    \nFinancial Highlights Effective January 1, 2020, we adopted the\nnew accounting standard on current expected credit losses\n(CECL), under which the allowance is measured based on\nmanagement\u2019s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses\n(ECL). Prior-year periods presented reflect measurement of the\nallowance based on management\u2019s estimate of probable incurred\ncredit losses.

The\ndecline in net income was largely due to an increase in the\nprovision for credit losses primarily due to the weaker economic\noutlook related to COVID\u201019, and to a lesser extent, lower\nrevenue and an increase in noninterest expense. Total assets\nincreased $307.6 billion from December 31, 2019 to $2.7 trillion\nprimarily driven by higher federal funds sold and securities\nborrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and higher cash\nand cash equivalents as a result of elevated deposit balances\nbeing deployed as short-term investments. Total liabilities\nincreased $306.8 billion from December 31, 2019 to $2.5 trillion\nprimarily driven by higher deposit inflows resulting from\ngovernment stimulus actions, lower consumer spending, and client\nresponses to market volatility as clients improved their\nliquidity positions. Additionally, long-term debt increased due\nto debt issuances and a debt basis adjustment primarily due to\nlower interest rates. Shareholders\u2019 equity increased $827\nmillion from December 31, 2019 primarily due to net income and\nmarket value increases on debt securities, partially offset by\nreturns of capital to shareholders through common stock\nrepurchases and common and preferred stock dividends as well as\nthe impact of the adoption of the new credit loss accounting\nstandard. Net Interest Income Net interest income decreased $1.3\nbillion to $10.8 billion , and $1.6 billion to $23.0 billion for\nthe three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the\nsame periods in 2019. Net interest yield on a fully taxable-\nequivalent (FTE) basis decreased 57 basis points (bps) to 1.87\npercent , and 39 bps to 2.09 percent for the same periods. The\ndecrease in net interest income was primarily driven by lower\nasset yields from the decline in interest rates, partially\noffset by reduced deposit and funding costs as well as\n                    \n  Bank of America6  \n                    \nloan and deposit growth. Based on the forward interest rate\ncurve and other relevant assumptions as of June 30, 2020, we\nexpect net interest income to decline modestly in the third\nquarter of 2020 as compared to the second quarter of 2020.

For  the six-month period, there was an increase    \n     of$350 millionprimarily due to higher client               \n     transactional activity, higher market valuations and AUM   \n     flows, partially offset by declines in AUM pricing.        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Investment banking feesincreased$788 millionand$912        \n  \u25cf  milliondue to higher debt and equity underwriting fees     \n     and higher advisory fees.                                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Market making and similar activitiesincreased$106          \n     millionand$145 million. For the three-month period the     \n     improvement was primarily due to increased client          \n     activity and market recoveries from the end of the prior   \n  \u25cf  quarter, partially offset by lower income in equity        \n     derivatives from a weaker trading performance. The         \n     increase in the six-month period was primarily driven by   \n     higher client activity, partially offset by valuation      \n     adjustments in credit-sensitive products.                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Other incomeincreased$275 millionfor the three-month       \n     period and decreased$239 millionfor the six-month period.  \n     The increase was primarily due to a $704 million gain on   \n  \u25cf  sales of certain mortgage loans, partially offset by       \n     certain valuation adjustments.

The\nsix-month effective rates also\nincluded tax benefits from\ndeductions associated with\nshare-based compensation. The\ndeclines in the effective tax\nrates for the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2020 were\ndriven by the impact of our\nrecurring tax preference\nbenefits on the lower levels of\npretax income. We expect the\neffective tax rate for the rest\nof 2020 to be approximately 11\npercent, excluding the change\nin U.K. tax law discussed below\nand other unusual items. Absent\nthese tax credits, we would\nexpect the effective tax rate\nto be approximately 25 percent.\nOn July 22, 2020, the U.K.\nenacted a change in its tax\nrates under which the\nCorporation will record an\nincome tax benefit of\napproximately $700 million in\nthe third quarter of 2020. For\nmore information, see Note 1 -\nSummary of Significant\nAccounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements. Supplemental\nFinancial Data Non-GAAP\nFinancial Measures In this Form\n10-Q, we present certain non-\nGAAP financial measures. Non-\nGAAP financial measures exclude\ncertain items or otherwise\ninclude components that differ\nfrom the most directly\ncomparable measures calculated\nin accordance with GAAP. Non-\nGAAP financial measures are\nprovided as additional useful\ninformation to assess our\nfinancial condition, results of\noperations (including period-\nto-period operating\nperformance) or compliance with\nprospective regulatory\nrequirements. These non-GAAP\nfinancial measures are not\nintended as a substitute for\nGAAP financial measures and may\nnot be defined or calculated\nthe same way as non-GAAP\nfinancial measures used by\nother companies. We view net\ninterest income and related\nratios and analyses on an FTE\nbasis, which when presented on\na consolidated basis are non-\nGAAP financial measures. To\nderive the FTE basis, net\ninterest income is adjusted to\nreflect tax-exempt income on an\nequivalent before-tax basis\nwith a corresponding increase\nin income tax expense. For\npurposes of this calculation,\nwe use the federal statutory\ntax rate of 21 percent and a\nrepresentative state tax rate.\nNet interest yield, which\nmeasures the basis points we\nearn over the cost of funds,\nutilizes net interest income on\nan FTE basis. We believe that\npresentation of these items on\nan FTE basis allows for\ncomparison of amounts from both\ntaxable and tax-exempt sources\nand is consistent with industry\npractices. We may present\ncertain key performance\nindicators and ratios excluding\ncertain items (e.g., debit\nvaluation adjustment (DVA)\ngains (losses)) which result in\nnon-GAAP financial measures. We\nbelieve that the presentation\nof measures that exclude these\nitems is useful because such\nmeasures provide additional\ninformation to assess the\nunderlying operational\nperformance and trends of our\nbusinesses and to allow better\ncomparison of period-to-period\noperating performance.\n\nWe also evaluate our business\nbased on certain ratios that\nutilize tangible equity, a non-\nGAAP financial measure.\nTangible equity represents\nshareholders\u2019 equity or common\nshareholders\u2019 equity reduced by\ngoodwill and intangible assets\n(excluding mortgage servicing\nrights (MSRs)), net of related\ndeferred tax liabilities\n(\"adjusted\" shareholders'\nequity or common shareholders'\nequity). These measures are\nused to evaluate our use of\nequity. In addition,\nprofitability, relationship and\ninvestment models use both\nreturn on average tangible\ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity and\nreturn on average tangible\nshareholders\u2019 equity as key\nmeasures to support our overall\ngrowth objectives. These ratios\nare as follows:\n                                                                \n     Return on average tangible common shareholders\u2019 equity     \n     measures our net income applicable to common shareholders  \n  \u25cf  as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders\u2019   \n     equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents        \n     adjusted ending common shareholders\u2019 equity divided by     \n     total tangible assets.                                     \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures   \n     our net income as a percentage of adjusted average total   \n  \u25cf  shareholders\u2019 equity. The tangible equity ratio            \n     represents adjusted ending shareholders\u2019 equity divided    \n     by total tangible assets.                                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted   \n  \u25cf  ending common shareholders\u2019 equity divided by ending       \n     common shares outstanding.                                 \n                                                                \nWe believe that the use of\nratios that utilize tangible\nequity provides additional\nuseful information because they\npresent measures of those\nassets that can generate\nincome. Tangible book value per\ncommon share provides\nadditional useful information\nabout the level of tangible\nassets in relation to\noutstanding shares of common\nstock. The aforementioned\nsupplemental data and\nperformance measures are\npresented in Tables 6 and 7 .\nFor more information on the\nreconciliation of these non-\nGAAP financial measures to the\ncorresponding GAAP financial\nmeasures, see Non-GAAP\nReconciliations on page 51 .\nKey Performance Indicators We\npresent certain key financial\nand nonfinancial performance\nindicators (key performance\nindicators) that management\nuses when assessing our\nconsolidated and/or segment\nresults.

We manage our segments and report their\nresults on an FTE basis. For more information, see Business\nSegment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2019 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K . We periodically review capital allocated\nto our businesses and allocate capital annually during the\nstrategic and capital planning processes. We utilize a\nmethodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital\nrequirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models.\nOur internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted\nmethodology incorporating each segment\u2019s credit, market,\ninterest rate, business and operational risk components. For\nmore information on the nature of these risks, see Managing Risk\non page 23 . The capital allocated to the business segments is\nreferred to as allocated capital. Allocated equity in the\nreporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital\nfor the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically\nassigned to the reporting unit. For more information, see Note 7\n\u2013 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements .

Net\ninterest income decreased $1.1 billion to $6.0 billion primarily\ndue to lower interest rates, partially offset by higher deposit\nand loan balances. Noninterest income decreased $741 million to\n$1.9 billion driven by a decline in service charges and card\nincome primarily due to fewer overdrafts and lower client\nactivity, as well as lower other income driven by the allocation\nof asset and liability management (ALM) results. The provision\nfor credit losses increased $2.1 billion to $3.0 billion\nprimarily due to the weaker economic outlook related to\nCOVID-19. Noninterest expense increased $321 million to $4.7\nbillion primarily driven by incremental expense to support\ncustomers and employees during COVID-19, as well as the cost of\nincreased client activity and continued investments for business\ngrowth. The return on average allocated capital was one percent,\ndown from 36 percent, driven by lower net income, and to a\nlesser extent, an increase in allocated capital.

Consumer Lending\nThree-Month Comparison Net loss for Consumer Lending was $714\nmillion , a decrease of $1.8 billion primarily due to higher\nprovision for credit losses. Net interest income decreased $61\nmillion to $2.7 billion driven by the allocation of ALM results,\npartially offset by loan growth. Noninterest income decreased\n$256 million to $1.1 billion primarily driven by lower card\nincome due to lower client activity. The provision for credit\nlosses increased $2.0 billion to $2.9 billion primarily due to\nthe weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19. Noninterest\nexpense increased $127 million to $1.9 billion primarily driven\nby investments in the business and incremental expense to\nsupport customers and employees during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAverage loans increased $25.2 billion to $316.2 billion\nprimarily driven by an increase in residential mortgages. Six-\nMonth Comparison Net loss for Consumer Lending was $575 million\n, a decrease of $2.8 billion primarily due to higher provision\nfor credit losses. Net interest income increased $54 million to\n$5.6 billion driven by loan growth, and noninterest income\ndecreased $354 million to $2.3 billion primarily driven by the\nsame factors as described in the three-month discussion. The\nprovision for credit losses increased $3.2 billion to $5.0\nbillion primarily due to the weaker economic outlook related to\nCOVID-19. Noninterest expense increased $185 million to $3.6\nbillion primarily driven by the same factors as described in the\nthree-month discussion.

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2020\n, total credit card purchase volumes declined $16.6 billion to\n$53.7 billion , and $15.0 billion to $118.1 billion compared to\nthe same periods in 2019 . Debit card purchase volumes declined\n$1.6 billion to $89.6 billion during the three months ended June\n30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The declines in\ncredit card and debit card purchase volumes were driven by lower\nlevels of consumer spending due to the impact of COVID-19. Debit\ncard purchase volumes began to improve late in the second\nquarter of 2020 as businesses reopened and consumers used their\ncards for more essential spending, as well as retail, services\nand restaurant spending. For the six months ended June 30, 2020\n, debit card purchase volumes increased $2.0 billion to $178.2\nbillion , driven by higher levels of consumer spending in the\nfirst quarter and again in June 2020.\n                                                                \n                  Three                       Six               \n  (Dol\u2026          Months                    Months               \n  in     Key      Ended                     Ended               \n  mill\u2026  Stati\u2026    June                      June               \n  Cons\u2026  \u2013 Loan      30                        30               \n  Bank\u2026  Produ\u2026    2020         2019         2020         2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  First  $       15,049    $  12,757    $  27,930    $  20,912  \n  mort\u2026                                                         \n  Home   $        3,176    $   2,405    $   5,817    $   4,890  \n  equi\u2026                                                         \n  Tota\u2026                                                         \n  First  $       23,124    $  18,229    $  42,062    $  29,689  \n  mort\u2026                                                         \n  Home            3,683        2,768        6,707        5,593  \n  equi\u2026                                                         \n                                                                \n                                                                \n       The loan production amounts represent the unpaid         \n  (1)  principal balance of loans and, in the case of home      \n       equity, the principal amount of the total line of        \n       credit.                                                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n       In addition to loan production inConsumer Banking,       \n  (2)  there is also first mortgage and home equity loan        \n       production inGWIM.                                       \n                                                                \nFirst mortgage loan originations in Consumer Banking and for the\ntotal Corporation increased $2.3 billion and $4.9 billion for\nthe three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period\nin 2019 primarily due to a lower interest rate environment\ndriving higher first-lien mortgage refinances.

GWIM consists of two primary businesses:\nMerrill Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM) and Bank of\nAmerica Private Bank. For more information about GWIM , see\nBusiness Segment Operations in the MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s\n2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . Three-Month Comparison Net\nincome for GWIM decreased $452 million to $624 million for the\nthree months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in\n2019 due to lower revenue and higher provision for credit\nlosses. The operating margin was 19 percent compared to 29\npercent a year ago. Net interest income decreased $246 million\nto $1.4 billion due to the impact of lower interest rates,\npartially offset by the benefit of strong deposit and loan\ngrowth. Noninterest income, which primarily includes investment\nand brokerage services income, decreased $229 million to $3.0\nbillion . The decrease was primarily driven by lower\ntransactional revenue, lower market valuations, and declines in\nAUM pricing, partially offset by the benefit of positive AUM\nflows. The provision for credit losses increased $115 million to\n$136 million primarily due to the weaker economic outlook\nrelated to COVID-19. Noninterest expense remained relatively\nunchanged at $3.5 billion . The return on average allocated\ncapital was 17 percent, down from 30 percent, due to lower net\nincome and, to a lesser extent, a small increase in allocated\ncapital. MLGWM revenue of $3.6 billion decreased ten percent\nprimarily driven by the impact of lower interest rates,\ntransactional revenue and market valuations, as well as declines\nin AUM pricing, partially offset by the benefit of positive AUM\nflows. Bank of America Private Bank revenue of $800 million\ndecreased six percent primarily driven by the impact of lower\ninterest rates and lower market valuations. Six-Month Comparison\nNet income for GWIM decreased $629 million to $1.5 billion for\nthe six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period\nin 2019 due to lower revenue, higher provision for credit losses\nand higher noninterest expense. The operating margin was 21\npercent compared to 29 percent a year ago. Net interest income\ndecreased $359 million to $2.9 billion due to the same factors\nas described in the three-month discussion. Noninterest income,\nwhich primarily includes investment and brokerage services\nincome, remained relatively unchanged at $6.4 billion as the\nbenefits of higher market valuations and positive AUM flows were\noffset by declines in AUM pricing and lower transactional\nrevenue compared to the same period in 2019 . The provision for\ncredit losses increased $299 million to $325 million primarily\ndue to the weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19.\nNoninterest expense increased $176 million to $7.1 billion ,\nprimarily due to investments for business growth along with\nhigher revenue-related incentives. The return on average\nallocated capital was 20 percent, down from 30 percent, due to\nlower net income and, to a lesser extent, a small increase in\nallocated capital.\n                     \n  Bank of America16  \n                     \nMLGWM revenue of $7.7 billion decreased four percent primarily\ndriven by the impact of lower interest rates and AUM pricing,\npartially offset by higher market valuations, positive AUM flows\nand increased transactional revenue.

Three-Month Comparison Net income for\nGlobal Banking decreased $1.2 billion to $726 million primarily\ndriven by higher provision for credit losses, partially offset\nby higher revenue. Revenue increased $116 million to $5.1\nbillion driven by higher noninterest income, partially offset by\nlower net interest income. Net interest income decreased $346\nmillion to $2.4 billion primarily due to the allocation of ALM\nresults and spread compression, partially offset by loan and\ndeposit growth. Noninterest income increased $462 million to\n$2.7 billion primarily due to higher investment banking fees and\nvaluation adjustments on leveraged loans and the fair value\noption loan portfolio. The provision for credit losses increased\n$1.7 billion to $1.9 billion primarily due to the weaker\neconomic outlook related to COVID-19. Noninterest expense\nremained relatively unchanged at $2.2 billion . The return on\naverage allocated capital was seven percent in 2020 compared to\n19 percent in 2019 , due to lower net income and, to a lesser\nextent, an increase in allocated capital.

Six-Month Comparison Net income for\nGlobal Banking decreased $3.1 billion to $862 million primarily\ndriven by higher provision for credit losses as well as lower\nrevenue. Revenue decreased $439 million to $9.7 billion driven\nby lower net interest income, partially offset by higher\nnoninterest income. Net interest income decreased $524 million\nto $5.0 billion primarily driven by the same factors as\ndescribed in the three-month discussion. Noninterest income\nincreased $85 million to $4.7 billion primarily due to higher\ninvestment banking fees, partially offset by valuation\nadjustments on the fair value option loan portfolio, debt\nsecurities and leveraged loans and the allocation of ALM\nresults. The provision for credit losses increased $3.7 billion\nto $4.0 billion primarily due to the weaker economic outlook\nrelated to COVID-19. Noninterest expense increased $66 million\nprimarily due to continued investments in the business,\npartially offset by lower revenue-related incentives.\n                     \n  Bank of America18  \n                     \nThe return on average allocated capital was four percent in 2020\ncompared to 19 percent in 2019 , due to lower net income and, to\na lesser extent, an increase in allocated capital.

revenue decreased $196 million and $355 million\nfor the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the\nsame periods in 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by the\nallocation of ALM results, partially offset by the impact of\nhigher loan and lease balances. Global Transaction Services\nrevenue decreased $350 million and $509 million for the three\nand six months ended June 30, 2020 driven by the allocation of\nALM results, partially offset by the impact of higher deposit\nbalances. Average loans and leases increased 12 percent and 8\npercent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020\ncompared to the same periods in 2019 driven by growth in the\ncommercial and industrial loan portfolio. Average deposits\nincreased 36 percent and 23 percent for the three and six months\nended June 30, 2020 primarily due to client responses to market\nvolatility, government stimulus and placement of credit draws.\nGlobal Investment Banking Client teams and product specialists\nunderwrite and distribute debt, equity and loan products, and\nprovide advisory services and tailored risk management\nsolutions.

During the six months ended June 30, 2020 ,\nresidential mortgage loans held for ALM activities decreased\n$10.6 billion to $11.1 billion due primarily to loan sales. Non-\ncore residential mortgage and home equity loans, which are\nprincipally runoff portfolios, are also held in All Other .\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2020 , total non-core loans\ndecreased $1.6 billion to $14.1 billion due primarily to payoffs\nand paydowns, as well as Federal Housing Administration (FHA)\nloan conveyances and sales, partially offset by repurchases. For\nmore information on the composition of the core and non-core\nportfolios, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on\npage 31 . Three-Month Comparison Net income for All Other\nincreased $207 million primarily driven by higher revenue and\nlower noninterest expense, partially offset by a decrease in the\nbenefit in the provision for credit losses. Revenue increased\n$241 million primarily due to a $704 million gain on sales of\ncertain mortgage loans, partially offset by lower net interest\nincome and equity investment income. Noninterest expense\ndecreased $207 million to $309 million reflecting a decrease in\ncompensation and benefits, lower non-core mortgage costs,\nprimarily due to lower volume, and lower technology costs. The\nbenefit in the provision for credit losses decreased $220\nmillion to $21 million from the prior period, which included\nhigher recoveries from the sales of previously charged-off\nconsumer real estate loans. The income tax benefit decreased $21\nmillion reflecting the impact of lower pretax losses. Both\nperiods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the\nFTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking\n. Six-Month Comparison The net loss for All Other increased $251\nmillion , driven by higher provision for credit losses and lower\nrevenue, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. Revenue\ndecreased $107 million primarily due to certain valuation\nadjustments on securities and derivatives and extinguishment\nlosses on certain structured liabilities, partially offset by a\ngain on sales of mortgage loans. The provision for credit losses\nincreased $388 million to $93 million due to the same factor as\ndescribed in the three-month discussion. Noninterest expense\ndecreased $360 million to $556 million due to the same factors\nas described in the three-month discussion.

Managing Risk Risk is inherent in\nall our business activities. The seven key types of risk faced\nby the Corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity,\ncompliance, operational and reputational. Sound risk management\nenables us to serve our customers and deliver for our\nshareholders. If not managed well, risks can result in financial\nloss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our\nreputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to\nexecute our business strategies. We take a comprehensive\napproach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework and an\narticulated Risk Appetite Statement which are approved annually\nby the Enterprise Risk Committee and the Board. Our Risk\nFramework serves as the foundation for the consistent and\neffective management of risks facing the Corporation. The Risk\nFramework sets forth clear roles, responsibilities and\naccountability for the management of risk and provides a\nblueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to\ncommittees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and\nassociated limits for our activities. Our Risk Appetite\nStatement is intended to ensure that the Corporation maintains\nan acceptable risk profile by providing a common framework and a\ncomparable set of measures for senior management and the Board\nto clearly indicate the level of risk the Corporation is willing\nto accept. Risk appetite is set at least annually and is aligned\nwith the Corporation\u2019s strategic, capital and financial\noperating plans. Our line of business strategies and risk\nappetite are also similarly aligned. For more information about\nthe Corporation's risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see\nPart II, Item 1A. Risk Factors on page 104 . These COVID-19\nrelated risks are being managed within our Risk Framework and\nsupporting risk management programs. For more information on our\nRisk Framework, our risk management activities and the key types\nof risk faced by the Corporation, see the Managing Risk through\nReputational Risk sections in the MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2019\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K . Capital Management The Corporation\nmanages its capital position so that its capital is more than\nadequate to support its business activities and aligns with\nrisk, risk appetite and strategic planning. For more information\non capital management, including related regulatory\nrequirements, see Capital Management in the MD&A of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . CCAR and Capital\nPlanning The Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital\nplan and planned capital actions on an annual basis, consistent\nwith the rules governing the CCAR capital plan. In June 2020,\nthe Federal Reserve notified BHCs of their 2020 CCAR supervisory\nstress test results. Based on our results, we will be subject to\na preliminary 2.5 percent SCB for the period beginning October\n1, 2020 and ending on September 30, 2021. Our Common equity tier\n1 (CET1) capital ratio under the Standardized approach must\nremain above 9.5 percent during this period (the sum of our CET1\ncapital ratio minimum of 4.5 percent, global systemically\nimportant bank (G-SIB) surcharge of 2.5 percent and our\npreliminary SCB of 2.5 percent) in order to avoid restrictions\non capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The\nFederal Reserve plans to finalize the SCB for all BHCs by August\n31, 2020. The Federal Reserve also announced that due to\neconomic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, all\nlarge banks will be required to suspend share repurchase\nprograms in the third quarter of 2020, except for repurchases to\noffset shares issued under equity compensation plans, and limit\ndividends to existing rates that do not exceed the average of\nthe last four quarters\u2019 net income. Large banks will also be\nrequired to resubmit and update their capital plans later this\nyear based on instructions that the Federal Reserve will\nprovide. The Federal Reserve plans to conduct additional\nanalysis to assess the Corporation\u2019s capital plans and will\nreview capital preservation measures on a quarter-by-quarter\nbasis. The Federal Reserve\u2019s directive regarding share\nrepurchases aligns with our decision to voluntarily suspend\nrepurchases in the first quarter of 2020 from the date of the\nannouncement on March 15, 2020 through the end of the second\nquarter of 2020. The suspension of our repurchases did not\ninclude repurchases to offset shares issued under our equity\ncompensation plans, for which we repurchased $286 million of\ncommon stock during the second quarter of 2020 pursuant to the\nBoard\u2019s repurchase authorization under our 2019 CCAR capital\nplan. For more information, see Capital Management -- CCAR and\nCapital Planning in the MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2019 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K . We intend to maintain the quarterly common\nstock dividend at the current rate of $0.18 per share until\nfurther notice, subject to approval by the Board. We will also\ncontinue our current suspension of common stock repurchases in\nthe third quarter of 2020, except for repurchases to offset\nshares issued under equity compensation plans. Our repurchase\nprogram is subject to the Board\u2019s approval, and at such time\nthat we reinstate our stock repurchase program, our stock\nrepurchases will be subject to various factors, including the\nCorporation\u2019s capital position, liquidity, financial performance\nand alternative uses of capital, stock trading price and general\nmarket conditions, and may be suspended at any time. Such\nrepurchases may be effected through open market purchases or\nprivately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans\nthat satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). For more\ninformation, see Regulatory Developments in this section.\nRegulatory Capital As a financial services holding company, we\nare subject to regulatory capital rules, including Basel 3,\nissued by U.S. banking regulators. The Corporation's depository\ninstitution subsidiaries are also subject to the Prompt\nCorrective Action (PCA) framework.\n                     \n  23Bank of America  \n                     \nThe Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA,\nare Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3 and are\nrequired to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and\nrisk-weighted assets under both the Standardized and Advanced\napproaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to\nassess capital adequacy including under the PCA framework. As of\nJune 30, 2020 , the CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total Capital\nratios for the Corporation were lower under the Advanced\napproaches. Minimum Capital Requirements In order to avoid\nrestrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus\npayments, the Corporation must meet risk-based capital ratio\nrequirements that include a capital conservation buffer greater\nthan 2.5 percent, plus any applicable countercyclical capital\nbuffer and a G-SIB surcharge. Beginning October 1, 2020, the\ncapital conservation buffer will be replaced by the SCB for the\nCorporation\u2019s Standardized approach ratio requirements. The\nbuffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of CET1 capital.\nThe Corporation is also required to maintain a minimum\nsupplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a\nleverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain\nrestrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus\npayments. Our insured depository institution subsidiaries are\nrequired to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered\nwell capitalized under the PCA framework. Capital Composition\nand Ratios Table 9 presents Bank of America Corporation\u2019s\ncapital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel\n3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as measured at June 30,\n2020 and December 31, 2019 .

Revisions to\nBasel 3 to Address Current Expected Credit Loss Accounting On\nJanuary 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted the new accounting\nstandard that requires the measurement of the allowance for\ncredit losses to be based on management\u2019s best estimate of\nlifetime ECL inherent in the Corporation's relevant financial\nassets. For more information, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements . During the first quarter of 2020, in accordance\nwith an interim final rule issued by U.S. banking regulators,\nthe Corporation delayed for two years the initial adoption\nimpact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year\ntransition period to phase out the aggregate amount of the\ncapital benefit provided during 2020 and 2021 (i.e., a five-year\ntransition period). For more information, see Capital Management\n\u2013 Regulatory Developments in the MD&A of the Corporation's\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31,\n2020 . Stress Capital Buffer On March 4, 2020, the Federal\nReserve issued a final rule that integrates the annual\nquantitative assessment of the CCAR program with the buffer\nrequirements in the U.S. Basel 3 Final Rule. The new approach\nreplaces the existing static 2.5 percent capital conservation\nbuffer for Basel 3 Standardized approach requirements with a\nstress capital buffer, calculated as the decline in the CET1\ncapital ratio under the supervisory severely adverse scenario\nplus four quarters of planned common stock dividends, floored at\n2.5 percent. Based on the CCAR 2020 supervisory stress test\nresults, the Corporation will be subject to a preliminary 2.5\npercent SCB for the period beginning October 1, 2020 and ending\non September 30, 2021. The Federal Reserve plans to finalize the\nSCB for all BHCs by August 31, 2020. In conjunction with this\nnew requirement, the Federal Reserve has removed the annual CCAR\nquantitative objection process beginning with CCAR 2020. While\nthe final rule continues to require that the Corporation\ndescribe its planned capital distributions in its CCAR capital\nplan, the Corporation is no longer required to seek prior\napproval if it makes capital distributions in excess of those\nincluded in its CCAR capital plan. The Corporation is instead\nsubject to automatic distribution limitations if its capital\nratios fall below its buffer requirements, which include the\nstress capital buffer. Supplementary Leverage Ratio On April 1,\n2020, in response to the economic impact of the COVID-19\npandemic, the Federal Reserve issued an interim final rule to\ntemporarily exclude the on-balance sheet amounts of U.S.\nTreasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from\nthe calculation of supplementary leverage exposure for bank\nholding companies. The rule is effective for June 30, 2020\nthrough March 31, 2021 reports. As of June 30, 2020, temporary\nexclusions improved the supplementary leverage ratio by 0.9\npercent to 7.1 percent. On May 15, 2020, the U.S. banking\nregulators issued an interim final rule that provides a similar\ntemporary exclusion to depository institutions, effective from\nthe beginning of the second quarter of 2020 through March 31,\n2021; however, institutions must elect the relief. Beginning in\nthe third quarter of 2020, a depository institution electing to\napply the exclusion must receive approval from its primary\nregulator prior to making any capital distributions as long as\nthe exclusion is in effect. As of June 30, 2020, the\nCorporation\u2019s insured depository institution subsidiaries have\nnot elected the exclusions. Paycheck Protection Program Loans On\nApril 9, 2020, in response to the economic impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation issued an interim final rule that, among other\nthings, stipulates PPP loans, which are guaranteed by the Small\nBusiness Administration, will receive a zero percent risk weight\nunder the Basel 3 Advanced and Standardized approaches. For more\ninformation on the PPP, see Executive Summary - Recent\nDevelopments \u2013 COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3 and Note 1 \u2013 Summary\nof Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements . Standardized Approach for Measuring\nCounterparty Credit Risk As of June 30, 2020 the Corporation\nadopted the new standardized approach for measuring counterparty\ncredit risk (SA-CCR), which replaces the current exposure method\nfor calculating the exposure amount of derivative contracts for\nrisk-weighted assets and supplementary leverage exposure.\nAdoption of SA-CCR resulted in a decrease of approximately $15\nbillion in the Corporation\u2019s Standardized risk-weighted assets,\nand a $66 billion decrease in supplementary leverage exposure.\nSwap Dealer Capital Requirements On July 22, 2020, the U.S.\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued a final rule\nto establish capital requirements for swap dealers and major\nswap participants that are not subject to existing U.S.\nprudential regulation. Under the rule, applicable subsidiaries\nof the Corporation would be permitted to elect one of two\napproaches to compute their regulatory capital. The first\napproach is a bank-based capital approach which requires that\nfirms maintain CET1 capital greater than or equal to 6.5 percent\nof the entity\u2019s RWA as calculated under Basel 3, Total capital\ngreater than or equal to 8.0 percent of the entity\u2019s RWA as\ncalculated under Basel 3 and Total capital greater than or equal\nto 8.0 percent of the entity\u2019s uncleared swap margin. The second\napproach is based on net liquid assets and requires that a firm\nmaintain net capital greater than or equal to 2.0 percent of\nuncleared swap margin. The final rule also includes reporting\nrequirements. The impact to the Corporation is not expected to\nbe significant. Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation The\nCorporation\u2019s principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are BofA\nSecurities, Inc. (BofAS), Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing\nCorp. (MLPCC) and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith\nIncorporated (MLPF&S). The Corporation's principal European\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch International (MLI)\nand BofA Securities Europe SA (BofASE). The U.S. broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries are subject to the net capital requirements of Rule\n15c3-1 under the Exchange Act. BofAS computes its minimum\ncapital requirements as an alternative net capital broker-dealer\nunder Rule 15c3-1, and MLPCC and MLPF&S compute their minimum\ncapital requirements in accordance with the alternative standard\nunder Rule 15c3-1. BofAS and MLPCC are also registered as\nfutures commission merchants and are subject to CFTC Regulation\n1.17. The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are also registered\nwith the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA).\nPursuant to FINRA Rule 4110, FINRA may impose higher net capital\nrequirements than\n                     \n  27Bank of America  \n                     \nRule 15c3-1 under the Exchange\nAct with respect to each of the\nbroker-dealers.

These liquidity risk\nmanagement practices have\nallowed us to effectively\nmanage the market stress that\nbegan in the first quarter of\n2020 from the COVID-19\npandemic. For more information\non the effects of the pandemic,\nsee Executive Summary - Recent\nDevelopments \u2013 COVID-19\nPandemic on page 3 . We define\nliquidity as readily available\nassets, limited to cash and\nhigh-quality, liquid,\nunencumbered securities that we\ncan use to meet our contractual\nand contingent financial\nobligations as those\nobligations arise. We manage\nour liquidity position through\nline of business and ALM\nactivities, as well as through\nour legal entity funding\nstrategy, on both a forward and\ncurrent (including intraday)\nbasis under both expected and\nstressed conditions. We believe\nthat a centralized approach to\nfunding and liquidity\nmanagement enhances our ability\nto monitor liquidity\nrequirements, maximizes access\nto funding sources, minimizes\nborrowing costs and facilitates\ntimely responses to liquidity\nevents. For more information\nregarding global funding and\nliquidity risk management, as\nwell as liquidity sources,\nliquidity arrangements,\ncontingency planning and credit\nratings discussed\n\nbelow, see Liquidity Risk in\nthe MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s\n2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n. NB Holdings Corporation We\nhave intercompany arrangements\nwith certain key subsidiaries\nunder which we transferred\ncertain assets of Bank of\nAmerica Corporation, as the\nparent company, which is a\nseparate and distinct legal\nentity from our banking and\nnonbank subsidiaries, and\nagreed to transfer certain\nadditional parent company\nassets not needed to satisfy\nanticipated near term\nexpenditures, to NB Holdings\nCorporation, a wholly-owned\nholding company subsidiary (NB\nHoldings). The parent company\nis expected to continue to have\naccess to the same flow of\ndividends, interest and other\namounts of cash necessary to\nservice its debt, pay dividends\nand perform other obligations\nas it would have had if it had\nnot entered into these\narrangements and transferred\nany assets. These arrangements\nsupport our preferred single\npoint of entry resolution\nstrategy, under which only the\nparent company would be\nresolved under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code.

Liquidity at bank\nsubsidiaries excludes the cash\ndeposited by the parent company\nand NB Holdings. Our bank\nsubsidiaries can also generate\nincremental liquidity by\npledging a range of\nunencumbered loans and\nsecurities to certain Federal\nHome Loan Banks (FHLBs) and the\nFederal Reserve Discount\nWindow. The cash we could have\nobtained by borrowing against\nthis pool of specifically-\nidentified eligible assets was\n$340 billion and $372 billion\nat June 30, 2020 and December\n31, 2019 .

Due to regulatory\nrestrictions, liquidity\ngenerated by the bank\nsubsidiaries can generally be\nused only to fund obligations\nwithin the bank subsidiaries,\nand transfers to the parent\ncompany or nonbank subsidiaries\nmay be subject to prior\nregulatory approval.

We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding\ndebt instruments in various transactions, depending on market\nconditions, liquidity and other factors. Our other regulated\nentities may also make markets in our debt instruments to\nprovide liquidity for investors. We use derivative transactions\nto manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our\nborrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they\nare funding. For more information on our ALM activities, see\nInterest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 47 .\nWe may issue unsecured debt in the form of structured notes for\nclient purposes, certain of which qualify as TLAC-eligible debt.\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2020 , we issued $5.3\nbillion of structured notes, which are debt obligations that pay\ninvestors returns linked to other debt or equity securities,\nindices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the\nreturns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with\nderivatives and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so\nthat from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our\nother unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle\ncertain structured note obligations for cash or other securities\nprior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider\nfor liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a\nportion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the\nearliest put or redemption date. Substantially all of our senior\nand subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that\ncould trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require\nadditional collateral support, result in changes to terms,\naccelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations\nupon an adverse change in our credit ratings,\n\nfinancial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. For more\ninformation on long-term debt funding, including issuances and\nmaturities and redemptions, see Note 12 \u2013 Long-term Debt to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2019\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K . Credit Ratings Credit ratings and\noutlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our\ncreditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities,\nincluding long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock\nand other securities, including asset securitizations. Table 18\npresents the Corporation\u2019s current long-term/short-term senior\ndebt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies. On\nApril 22, 2020, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) completed its review of\nthe large, complex securities trading and universal banks in the\nU.S., including Bank of America, in response to declining\neconomic activity from the COVID-19 pandemic. The agency\naffirmed the long-term and short-term senior debt ratings of the\nCorporation and all of its rated subsidiaries, except for select\nissuer and instrument level ratings that had previously been\nplaced under criteria observation (UCO) on March 4, 2020,\nfollowing changes in the agency\u2019s bank rating criteria on\nFebruary 28, 2020. Concurrently, Fitch reached a conclusion on\nselect UCO designations for the Corporation and upgraded the\nlong-term and short-term senior debt ratings of MLI and BofASE\nby one notch to AA-/F1+. The agency also upgraded the preferred\nstock rating of the Corporation by one notch to BBB and\ndowngraded the subordinated debt rating of the Corporation by\none notch to A-. According to Fitch, rating changes UCO are the\nsole result of bank rating criteria change and do not reflect a\nchange in the underlying fundamentals of the institution.\nFitch\u2019s rating outlook for all our long-term ratings is\ncurrently Stable. On June 9, 2020, Fitch affirmed as A the\nsubordinated debt rating of BANA. This rating had remained UCO\nfollowing Fitch\u2019s broader rating actions.

During the six months ended June 30, 2020, the\nCOVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted economic activity in the\nU.S. and around the world. While we experienced increases in\nCommercial nonperforming loans and reservable criticized\nexposures as a result of weaker economic conditions arising from\nCOVID-19, we did not see meaningful impacts to Consumer\nportfolio delinquencies, nonperforming loans or charge-offs\nduring the six months ended June 30, 2020 due to payment\ndeferrals and government stimulus benefits. To provide relief to\nindividuals and businesses in the U.S., in March and April 2020,\nthe President signed into law four economic stimulus packages,\nincluding the CARES Act. U.S. bank regulatory agencies also\nissued interagency guidance to financial institutions that are\nworking with borrowers affected by COVID-19. To support our\ncustomers, we have implemented various loan modification\nprograms and other forms of support, including offering loan\npayment deferrals, refunding certain fees and pausing\nforeclosure sales, evictions and repossessions. For a summary of\nthe loan modification programs that we have implemented along\nwith a summary of deferral requests that have been executed, see\nExecutive Summary - Recent Developments \u2013 COVID-19 Pandemic on\npage 3 . For information on the accounting for loan\nmodifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Note 1 \u2013\nSummary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements . Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management\nCredit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with\ninitial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower\u2019s\ncredit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with\nexperiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio\nmanagement including underwriting, product pricing, risk\nappetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating\nprocesses and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns.\nStatistical models are built using detailed behavioral\ninformation from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or\ninternal historical experience and are a component of our\nconsumer credit risk management process. These models are used\nin part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit\ndecisions, as well as portfolio management strategies, including\nauthorizations and line management, collection practices and\nstrategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and\nlease losses and allocated capital for credit risk. Consumer\nCredit Portfolio Although COVID-19 is severely impacting\neconomic activity, it did not have a meaningful impact on the\nconsumer portfolio delinquencies, nonperforming loans or charge-\noffs as of and during the six months ended June 30, 2020 due to\npayment deferrals and government stimulus benefits but there may\nbe adverse impacts to credit quality metrics in future periods\nif negative economic conditions continue. Net charge-offs\nincreased $43 million and $80 million to $734 million and $1.6\nbillion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 driven\nby lower consumer real estate loan sale recoveries. The consumer\nallowance for loan and lease losses increased $6.4 billion\nduring the six months ended June 30, 2020 to $11.0 billion due\nto the adoption of the new CECL accounting standard and\ndeterioration in the economic outlook resulting from the impact\nof COVID-19.

Approximately 54\npercent of the residential mortgage portfolio was in Consumer\nBanking and 37 percent was in GWIM. The remaining portion was in\nAll Other and was comprised of loans used in our overall ALM\nactivities, delinquent FHA loans repurchased pursuant to our\nservicing agreements with the Government National Mortgage\nAssociation as well as loans repurchased related to our\nrepresentations and warranties. Outstanding balances in the\nresidential mortgage portfolio increased $3.3 billion during the\nsix months ended June 30, 2020 as retention of new originations\nwas partially offset by both loan sales and runoff. At June 30,\n2020 and December 31, 2019 , the residential mortgage portfolio\nincluded $11.7 billion and $18.7 billion of outstanding fully-\ninsured loans, of which $3.1 billion and $11.2 billion had FHA\ninsurance with the remainder protected by long-term standby\nagreements. The decline was primarily driven by sales of loans\nwith FHA insurance during the three months ended June 30, 2020 .\nTable 22 presents certain residential mortgage key credit\nstatistics on both a reported basis and excluding the fully-\ninsured loan portfolio.

Upon adoption of the new\ncredit loss standard, these loans are accounted for on an\nindividual basis and, if applicable, included in nonperforming\nloans. Of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at June\n30, 2020 , $628 million , or 40 percent , were current on\ncontractual payments. Loans accruing past due 30 days or more\ndecreased $397 million driven by both government stimulus\nbenefits and payment deferrals associated with the economic\nimpact of COVID-19, as well as seasonal declines. Net charge-\noffs decreased $23 million and $8 million to a net recovery of\n$20 million and $21 million for the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 . This\ndecrease is due largely to loan sales that generated a recovery\nof $16 million during the three months ended June 30, 2020. Of\nthe $227.8 billion in total residential mortgage loans\noutstanding at June 30, 2020 , as shown in Table 22 , 26 percent\nwere originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance\nof interest-only residential mortgage loans that have entered\nthe amortization period was $6.6 billion , or 11 percent , at\nJune 30, 2020 . Residential mortgage loans that have entered the\namortization period generally have experienced a higher rate of\nearly stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to\nthe residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At June 30, 2020\n, $87 million , or one percent of outstanding interest-only\nresidential mortgages that had entered the amortization period\nwere accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $899 million\n, or less than one percent , for the entire residential mortgage\nportfolio. In addition, at June 30, 2020 , $295 million , or\nfour percent , of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage\nloans that had entered the amortization period were\nnonperforming, of which $111 million were contractually current,\ncompared to $1.6 billion , or one percent , for the entire\nresidential mortgage portfolio. Loans that have yet to enter the\namortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage\nportfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth\nmanagement clients and have an interest-only period of three to\nten years. Approximately 96 percent of these loans that have yet\nto enter the amortization period will not be required to make a\nfully-amortizing payment until 2022 or later. Table 23 presents\noutstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain\nstate concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio.

We no longer originate home equity loans or reverse\nmortgages. At June 30, 2020 , our HELOC portfolio had an\noutstanding balance of $35.9 billion , or 94 percent of the\ntotal home equity portfolio, compared to $37.5 billion , or 93\npercent , at December 31, 2019 . HELOCs generally have an\ninitial draw period of 10 years, and after the initial draw\nperiod ends, the loans generally convert to 15- or 20-year\namortizing loans. At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , our\nhome equity loan portfolio had an outstanding balance of $1.1\nbillion and $1.2 billion , or three percent , of the total home\nequity portfolio. At June 30, 2020 , our reverse mortgage\nportfolio had an outstanding balance of $1.4 billion , or three\npercent of the total home equity portfolio, compared to $1.5\nbillion , or four percent , at December 31, 2019 . At June 30,\n2020 , 80 percent of the home equity portfolio was in Consumer\nBanking , 12 percent was in All Other and the remainder of the\nportfolio was primarily in GWIM . Outstanding balances in the\nhome equity portfolio decreased $1.8 billion during the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to paydowns outpacing\nnew originations and draws on existing lines. Of the total home\nequity portfolio at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , $14.7\nbillion , or 38 percent , and $15.0 billion , or 37 percent ,\nwere in first-lien positions. At June 30, 2020 , outstanding\nbalances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien\nor more junior-lien position and where we also held the first-\nlien loan totaled $6.6 billion , or 17 percent , of our total\nhome equity portfolio. Unused HELOCs totaled $44.4 billion and\n$43.6 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . The\nincrease was primarily driven by new production, partially\noffset by accounts closed voluntarily. The HELOC utilization\nrate was 45 percent and 46 percent at June 30, 2020 and December\n31, 2019 .

Upon\nadoption of the new credit loss standard, these loans are\naccounted for on an individual basis and, if applicable,\nincluded in nonperforming loans. Of the nonperforming home\nequity loans at June 30, 2020 , $266 million , or 45 percent ,\nwere current on contractual payments. In addition, $201 million\n, or 34 percent , of nonperforming home equity loans were 180\ndays or more past due and had been written down to the estimated\nfair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans\nthat were 30 days or more past due decreased $44 million during\nthe six months ended June 30, 2020 . Net charge-offs increased\n$141 million to a net recovery of $14 million , and $119 million\nto a net recovery of $25 million for the three and six months\nended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 as the\nprior-year period included recoveries from non-core home equity\nloan sales. Of the $38.4 billion in total home equity portfolio\noutstandings at June 30, 2020 , as shown in Table 24 , 15\npercent require\n                     \n  Bank of America34  \n                     \ninterest-only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that\nhave reached the end of their draw period and have entered the\namortization period was $10.6 billion at June 30, 2020 . The\nHELOCs that have entered the amortization period have\nexperienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and\nnonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a\nwhole. At June 30, 2020 , $124 million , or one percent of\noutstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were\naccruing past due 30 days or more. In addition, at June 30, 2020\n, $438 million , or four percent , were nonperforming. Loans\nthat have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-\nonly portfolio are primarily post-2008 vintages and generally\nhave better credit quality than the previous vintages that had\nentered the amortization period. We communicate to contractually\ncurrent customers more than a year prior to the end of their\ndraw period to inform them of the potential change to the\npayment structure before entering the amortization period, and\nprovide payment options to customers prior to the end of the\ndraw period. Although we do not actively track how many of our\nhome equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their\nhome equity loans and lines, we can infer some of this\ninformation through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we\nservice and that is still in its revolving period. During the\nthree months ended June 30, 2020 , 18 percent of these customers\nwith an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their\nHELOCs.

In the New York area, the New York-Northern\nNew Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 13 percent of the outstanding\nhome equity portfolio at both June 30, 2020 and December 31,\n2019 .

Outstandings in the credit card portfolio decreased $13.4\nbillion during the six months ended June 30, 2020 to $84.2\nbillion due to lower retail spending. Net charge-offs decreased\n$97 million to $665 million and $72 million to $1.4 billion\nduring the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to\nthe same periods in 2019 due to government stimulus benefits and\npayment deferrals associated with COVID-19. Credit card loans 30\ndays or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $615\nmillion and loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing\ninterest decreased $260 million primarily due to government\nstimulus benefits and payment deferrals along with declines in\nloan balances associated with COVID-19. Unused lines of credit\nfor credit card increased to $348.1 billion at June 30, 2020\nfrom $336.9 billion at December 31, 2019 driven by lower\npurchase volumes.

During the six months ended June\n30, 2020 , nonperforming consumer loans increased $138 million\nto $2.2 billion primarily driven by the inclusion of $135\nmillion of certain loans that were previously classified as\npurchased credit-impaired loans and accounted for under a pool\nbasis. At June 30, 2020 , $730 million , or 33 percent of\nnonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due and had been\nwritten down to their estimated property value less costs to\nsell. In addition, at June 30, 2020 , $934 million , or 43\npercent of nonperforming consumer loans were modified and are\nnow current after successful trial periods, or are current loans\nclassified as nonperforming loans in accordance with applicable\npolicies. Foreclosed properties decreased $60 million during the\nsix months ended June 30, 2020 to $169 million as liquidations\noutpaced additions. Nonperforming loans also include certain\nloans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions\nhave been granted to borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulties. Nonperforming TDRs are included in Table 28 .

Credit card and\nother consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction\nin the customer\u2019s interest rate on the account and placing the\ncustomer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months, all of\nwhich are considered TDRs (the renegotiated TDR portfolio).\nModifications of credit card and other consumer loans are made\nthrough renegotiation programs utilizing direct customer\ncontact, but may also utilize external renegotiation programs.\nThe renegotiated TDR portfolio is excluded in large part from\nTable 28 as substantially all of the loans remain on accrual\nstatus until either charged off or paid in full. At June 30,\n2020 and December 31, 2019 , our renegotiated TDR portfolio was\n$677 million and $679 million , of which $601 million and $570\nmillion were current or less than 30 days past due under the\nmodified terms. Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management\nCommercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal\nthat concentrations of credit exposure continue to be aligned\nwith our risk appetite. We review, measure and manage\nconcentrations of credit exposure by industry, product,\ngeography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review,\nmeasure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic\nlocation and property type. In addition, within our non-U.S.\nportfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country.\nTables 34 , 37 and 40 summarize our concentrations. We also\nutilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales,\nhedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size\nand risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For more\ninformation on our industry concentrations, see Commercial\nPortfolio Credit Risk Management \u2013 Industry Concentrations on\npage 41 and Table 37 . For more information on our accounting\npolicies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, net\ncharge-offs and TDRs for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 \u2013\nSummary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2019 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K . For information on the accounting for loan\nmodifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Note 1 \u2013\nSummary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements . Commercial Credit Portfolio During the\nsix months ended June 30, 2020 , commercial asset quality\nweakened as a result of the economic impact from COVID-19.\nHowever, there were also positive signs during this period. Of\nthe draws by large corporate and commercial clients contributing\nto the $67.2 billion loan growth in the first three months of\n2020, $62.0 billion was repaid as emergency or contingent\nfunding was no longer needed or clients were able to access\ncapital markets. Additionally, as part of the CARES Act, we\nfunded $25.1 billion of PPP loans for our small business\nclients, which are included in U.S. small business commercial in\nthe tables in this section. For more information on PPP loans,\nsee Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements . Credit quality of commercial\nreal estate borrowers in most sectors remained stable but\nvarious sectors continued to experience varying degrees of\nstrain as a result of COVID-19. Hospitality and retail sectors\nhave been most negatively impacted. Many real estate markets\nexperienced disruption in demand, supply chain challenges and\nunderlying tenant difficulties. The commercial allowance for\nloan and lease losses increased $3.6 billion during the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2020 to $8.4 billion due to the\ndeterioration in the economic outlook resulting from the impact\nof COVID-19. For more information, see Allowance for Credit\nLosses on page 44 . Total commercial utilized credit exposure\nincreased $32.3 billion during the six months ended June 30,\n2020 to $667.7 billion driven by higher loans and leases. The\nutilization rate for loans and leases, standby letters of credit\n(SBLCs) and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of\ncredit, in the aggregate, was 60 percent at June 30, 2020 and 58\npercent at December 31, 2019 .

U.S.\nCommercial At June 30, 2020 , 69 percent of the U.S. commercial\nloan portfolio, excluding small business, was managed in Global\nBanking, 15 percent in Global Markets , 13 percent in GWIM\n(generally business-purpose loans for high net worth clients)\nand the remainder primarily in Consumer Banking . U.S.\ncommercial loans increased $6.9 billion during the six months\nended June 30, 2020 across most lines of business. Reservable\ncriticized utilized exposure increased $10.4 billion , or 125\npercent , driven by the impact of COVID-19 and was broad-based\nacross industries. Non-U.S. Commercial At June 30, 2020 , 82\npercent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in\nGlobal Banking and 17 percent in Global Markets . Non-U.S.\ncommercial loans decreased $1.3 billion during the six months\nended June 30, 2020 , primarily in Global Banking . For\ninformation on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S.\nPortfolio on page 43 . Commercial Real Estate Commercial real\nestate primarily includes commercial loans secured by non-owner-\noccupied real estate and is dependent on the sale or lease of\nthe real estate as the primary source of repayment. Outstanding\nloans increased $1.4 billion , or two percent , during the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2020 to $64.1 billion due to new\noriginations and increased utilizations under existing credit\nfacilities outpacing paydowns. The portfolio remains diversified\nacross property types and geographic regions. California\nrepresented the largest state concentration at 23 percent and 24\npercent of the commercial real estate portfolio at June 30, 2020\nand December 31, 2019 . The commercial real estate portfolio is\npredominantly managed in Global Banking and consists of loans\nmade primarily to public and private developers, and commercial\nreal estate firms. For the three and six months ended June 30,\n2020 , we continued to see low default rates and varying degrees\nof weakness in the non-residential portfolio. We use a number of\nproactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated\nexposure in the commercial real estate portfolio, including\ntransfers of deteriorating exposures to management by\nindependent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan\nrestructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for\nour customers and the Corporation.\n                     \n  39Bank of

Nonperforming Commercial Loans,\nLeases and Foreclosed Properties Activity Table 35 presents the\nnonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties\nactivity during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and\n2019 . Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for\nunder the fair value option. During the six months ended June\n30, 2020 , nonperforming commercial loans and leases increased\n$703 million to $2.2 billion , primarily driven by the impact of\nCOVID-19. At June 30, 2020 , 87 percent of commercial\nnonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were\nsecured and 65 percent were contractually current. Commercial\nnonperforming loans were carried at 81 percent of their unpaid\nprincipal balance before consideration of the allowance for loan\nand lease losses as the carrying value of these loans has been\nreduced to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell.\n                     \n  Bank of America40  \n                     \n

U.S. small business commercial TDRs are\ncomprised of renegotiated small business card loans and small\nbusiness loans. The renegotiated small business card loans are\nnot classified as nonperforming as they are charged off no later\nthan the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days\npast due.

Our commercial\ncredit exposure is diversified across a broad range of\nindustries. Total commercial committed exposure decreased $2.8\nbillion , less than one percent, during the six months ended\nJune 30, 2020 to $1.1 trillion . The decrease in commercial\ncommitted exposure was concentrated in the Asset managers and\nfunds, Utilities, and Global commercial banks industry sectors.\nDecreases were partially offset by increased exposure to the\nHealthcare equipment and services, Capital goods, and\nAutomobiles and components industry sectors. For information on\nindustry limits, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management\n- Industry Concentrations in the MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2019\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K . Asset managers and funds, our\nlargest industry concentration with committed exposure of $100.8\nbillion , decreased $9.3 billion , or eight percent , during the\nsix months ended June 30, 2020 . Real estate, our second largest\nindustry concentration with committed exposure of $96.1 billion\n, remained relatively flat during the six months ended June 30,\n2020 . For more information on the commercial real estate and\nrelated portfolios, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk\nManagement \u2013 Commercial Real Estate on page 39 . Capital goods,\nour third largest industry concentration with committed exposure\nof $85.7 billion , increased $4.8 billion , or six percent ,\nduring the six months ended June 30, 2020 with the growth\nlargely occurring in the machinery, and aerospace and defense\nconglomerates categories, partially offset by a decrease in\ntrading companies and distributors, and industrial\nconglomerates. Given the widespread impact the COVID-19 pandemic\nis having on the U.S. and global economy, a number of industries\ncontinue to be adversely impacted. We continue to monitor all\nindustries, particularly higher risk industries, which are\ncontinuing to experience a more significant impact to their\nfinancial condition. In addition, we continue to assess\npotential mitigants such as the various stimulus programs\ndesigned to support these clients and\n                     \n  41Bank of America  \n                     \nindustries through COVID-19. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\nhas also placed significant stress on global demand for oil,\nresulting in a steep decline in prices. Our energy-related\ncommitted exposure increased $1.1 billion , or three percent ,\nduring the six months ended June 30, 2020 to $37.4 billion ,\ndriven by our integrated client exposure, partially offset by a\ndecline in our higher risk exploration and production exposure.\nFor more information on COVID-19, see Executive Summary - Recent\nDevelopments \u2013 COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3 .\n

We define country risk as the risk\nof loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions,\ncurrency fluctuations, social instability and changes in\ngovernment policies. A risk management framework is in place to\nmeasure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In\naddition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we\nalso are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the\ncollateral received on secured financing transactions or related\nto client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are\nmanaged in the normal course of business through credit, market\nand operational risk governance, rather than through country\nrisk governance. Table 40 presents our 20 largest non-U.S.\ncountry exposures at June 30, 2020 . These exposures accounted\nfor 90 percent and 88 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at\nJune 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . Net country exposure for\nthese 20 countries increased $43.7 billion in the six months\nended June 30, 2020 . The majority of the increase was due to\nhigher deposits with central banks in Germany and Japan.\n                                                                \n                                                    \u2026           \n     \u2026                                              \u2026      \u2026    \n     \u2026                                              \u2026      \u2026    \n     \u2026                                              \u2026      \u2026    \n     \u2026                                              \u2026      \u2026    \n     \u2026                                              \u2026      \u2026    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n     $      $      $      $      $      $    )      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                             )      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                             )      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                             )      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                             )      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                             )      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                             )      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                             )      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                             )      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                             )      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                             )      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                             )      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                             )      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                             )      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                             )      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                             )      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                             )      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                             )      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                             )      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                             )      \u2026      \u2026    \n     $      $      $      $      $      $    )      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                                                \nOur largest non-U.S. country exposure at June 30, 2020 was the\nU.K. with net exposure of $61.0 billion , which represents a\n$5.2 billion increase from December 31, 2019 . Our second\nlargest non-U.S. country exposure was Germany with net exposure\nof $49.9 billion at June 30, 2020 , a $19.1 billion increase\nfrom December 31, 2019 . The increase in Germany was primarily\ndriven by an increase in deposits with the central bank. In\nlight of the global COVID-19 pandemic, we are monitoring our\nnon-U.S. exposure closely, particularly in countries where\nrestrictions on certain activities, in an attempt to contain the\nspread and impact of the virus, have affected and will continue\nto adversely affect economic activity. We are managing the\nimpact to our international business operations as part of our\noverall response framework and are taking actions to manage\nexposure carefully in impacted regions while supporting the\nneeds of our clients. The magnitude and duration of the COVID-19\npandemic and its full impact on the global economy continue to\nbe highly uncertain. The impact of COVID-19 could have an\nadverse impact on the global economy for a prolonged period of\ntime.

Upon adoption of the\nnew accounting standard, the Corporation recorded a net increase\nof $3.3 billion in the allowance for credit losses which was\ncomprised of a net increase of $2.9 billion in the allowance for\nloan and lease losses and an increase of $310 million in the\nreserve for unfunded lending commitments. The net increase was\nprimarily driven by a $3.1 billion increase related to the\ncredit card portfolio.

Report on Form 10-K . Market risk\nis the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely\nimpact the value of assets or liabilities, or otherwise\nnegatively impact earnings. This risk is inherent in the\nfinancial instruments associated with our operations, primarily\nwithin our Global Markets segment. We are also exposed to these\nrisks in other areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM\nactivities). In the event of market stress, these risks could\nhave a material impact on our results. We have been affected,\nand expect to continue to be affected, by market stress\nresulting from the COVID-19 pandemic that began in the first\nquarter of 2020. For more information on the effects of the\npandemic, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments \u2013 COVID-19\nPandemic on page 3 . Trading Risk Management To evaluate risks\nin our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential\nvolatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well\nas portfolios of positions. VaR is a common statistic used to\nmeasure market risk. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to\na 99 percent confidence level, which means that for a VaR with a\none-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of\nVaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days. Table 43 presents\nthe total market-based portfolio VaR which is the combination of\nthe total covered positions (and less liquid trading positions)\nportfolio and the fair value option portfolio. For more\ninformation on the market risk VaR for trading activities, see\nTrading Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2019\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K . The total market-based portfolio\nVaR results in Table 43 include market risk to which we are\nexposed from all business segments, excluding credit valuation\nadjustment (CVA), DVA and related hedges. The majority of this\nportfolio is within the Global Markets segment. Table 43\npresents period-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for\nthe three months ended June 30, 2020 , March 31, 2020 and June\n30, 2019 using a 99 percent confidence level, as well as average\ndaily trading VaR for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and\n2019 . The amounts disclosed in Table 43 and Table 44 align to\nthe view of covered positions used in the Basel 3 capital\ncalculations. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are\nalways considered covered positions, regardless of trading or\nbanking treatment for the trade, except for structural foreign\ncurrency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory\napproval. The average of total covered positions and less liquid\ntrading positions portfolio VaR increased for the three months\nended June 30, 2020 compared to the prior quarter primarily due\nto the impact of market volatility stemming from the COVID-19\npandemic in the look-back period.\n                                                                \n                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n       The high and low for each portfolio may have occurred    \n       on different trading days than the high and low for the  \n  (1)  components.

a\none-day holding period, against a comparable subset of trading\nrevenue. For more information on our backtesting process, see\nTrading Risk Management \u2013 Backtesting in the MD&A of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . During the three\nand six months ended June 30, 2020 , there were zero days and\nseven days respectively where this subset of trading revenue had\nlosses that exceeded our total covered portfolio VaR, utilizing\na one-day holding period. Total Trading-related Revenue Total\ntrading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA\nand funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents the\ntotal amount earned from trading positions, including market-\nbased net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of\nfinancial instruments and markets. For more information, see\nTrading Risk Management \u2013 Total Trading-related Revenue in the\nMD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . The\nfollowing histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility\nand illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for\nthe three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2020 . During the three months ended June\n30, 2020 , positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100\npercent of the trading days, of which 95 percent were daily\ntrading gains of over $25 million. This compares to the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2020 where positive trading-related\nrevenue was recorded for 94 percent of the trading days, of\nwhich 89 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million.\nTrading Portfolio Stress Testing Because the very nature of a\nVaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is\ndependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test\nour portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis estimates\nthe change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result\nfrom abnormal market movements.

The interest rate\nscenarios also assume U.S.\ndollar rates are floored at\nzero. In the six months ended\nJune 30, 2020 , the asset\nsensitivity of our balance\nsheet increased in up-rate\nscenarios primarily due to\nlower rates and higher cash\nlevels. Asset sensitivity of\nour balance sheet decreased in\ndown-rate scenarios due to\ninterest rate floors. We\ncontinue to be asset sensitive\nto a parallel move in interest\nrates with the majority of that\nimpact coming from the short\nend of the yield curve.\nAdditionally, higher interest\nrates impact the fair value of\ndebt securities and,\naccordingly, for debt\nsecurities classified as AFS,\nmay adversely affect OCI and\nthus capital levels under the\nBasel 3 capital rules. Under\ninstantaneous upward parallel\nshifts, the near-term adverse\nimpact to Basel 3 capital is\nreduced over time by offsetting\npositive impacts to net\ninterest income.

As part of our ALM activities, we use\nsecurities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and\nforeign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate\nsensitivity.\n\nThe behavior of our deposits portfolio in the baseline forecast\nand in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in\nour projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity\nanalysis in Table 46 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size\nor mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate\nenvironments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity\nresulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing\ndeposits with higher yielding deposits or market-based funding\nwould reduce our benefit in those scenarios. Interest Rate and\nForeign Exchange Derivative Contracts Interest rate and foreign\nexchange derivative contracts are utilized in our ALM activities\nand serve as an efficient tool to manage our interest rate and\nforeign exchange risk. We use derivatives to hedge the\nvariability in cash flows or changes in fair value on our\nbalance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange\ncomponents. For more information on our hedging activities, see\nNote 3 \u2013 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements .\nFor more information on interest rate contracts and risk\nmanagement, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking\nBook in the MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2019 Annual Report on Form\n10-K . We use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the\nvariability in the cash flows of our assets and liabilities and\nother forecasted transactions (collectively referred to as cash\nflow hedges). The net results on both open and terminated cash\nflow hedge derivative instruments recorded in accumulated OCI\nwere a gain of $454 million and a loss of $496 million , on a\npretax basis, at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . These\ngains (losses) are expected to be reclassified into earnings in\nthe same period as the hedged cash flows affect earnings and\nwill decrease income or increase expense on the respective\nhedged cash flows. Assuming no change in open cash flow\nderivative hedge positions and no changes in prices or interest\nrates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves at June 30,\n2020 , the after-tax net gains are expected to be reclassified\ninto earnings as follows: a gain of $189 million within the next\nyear, a gain of $298 million in years two through five, a loss\nof $96 million in years six through ten, with the remaining loss\nof $59 million thereafter. For more information on derivatives\ndesignated as cash flow hedges, see Note 3 \u2013 Derivatives to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements . We hedge our net investment\nin non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies\nother than the U.S. dollar using forward foreign exchange\ncontracts that typically settle in less than 180 days, cross-\ncurrency basis swaps and foreign exchange options. We recorded\nnet after-tax losses on derivatives in accumulated OCI\nassociated with net investment hedges which were offset by gains\non our net investments in consolidated non-U.S. entities at June\n30, 2020 . Table 47 presents derivatives utilized in our ALM\nactivities and shows the notional amount, fair value, weighted-\naverage receive-fixed and pay-fixed rates, expected maturity and\naverage estimated durations of our open ALM derivatives at June\n30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . These amounts do not include\nderivative hedges on our MSRs. During the six months ended June\n30, 2020 , the fair value of receive-fixed interest rate swaps\nincreased while pay-fixed interest swaps decreased, primarily\ndriven by lower swap rates on hedges of U.S. dollar long-term\ndebt.\n                     \n  Bank of America48  \n                     \n                                                                \n

We determine whether loans\nwill be held for investment or held for sale at the time of\ncommitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or\nsecuritizing a portion of the loans we originate. Changes in\ninterest rates impact the value of interest rate lock\ncommitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first mortgage\nloans held-for-sale (LHFS), as well as the value of the MSRs.\nBecause the interest rate risks of these hedged items offset, we\ncombine them into one overall hedged item with one combined\neconomic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and\nsecurities. For more information on IRLCs and the related\nresidential mortgage LHFS, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management\nin the MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 ,\nwe recorded gains of $65 million and $228 million related to the\nchange in fair value of the MSRs, IRLCs and LHFS, net of gains\nand losses on the hedge portfolio, compared to gains of $78\nmillion and $139 million for the same periods in 2019 . Complex\nAccounting Estimates Our significant accounting principles are\nessential in understanding the MD&A. Many of our significant\naccounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the\nvalues of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and\nprocesses in place to facilitate making these judgments. For\nmore information, see Complex Accounting Estimates in the MD&A\nof the Corporation\u2019s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 1\n\u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2019\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. Except as noted below under\nAllowance for Credit Losses, there have not been any material\nupdates to our complex accounting estimates as disclosed in the\nMD&A of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n                     \n  49Bank of America  \n                     \nAllowance for Credit Losses On January 1, 2020 , the Corporation\nadopted the new accounting standard that requires the\nmeasurement of the allowance for credit losses, which includes\nthe allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments, to be based on management\u2019s best\nestimate of lifetime ECL inherent in the Corporation's relevant\nfinancial assets. The Corporation's estimate of lifetime ECL\nincludes the use of quantitative models that incorporate\nforward-looking macroeconomic scenarios that are applied over\nthe contractual life of the loan portfolios, adjusted for\nexpected prepayments and borrower controlled extension options.\nThese macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have\nhistorically been key drivers of increases and decreases in\ncredit losses. These variables include, but are not limited to,\nunemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product\nlevels, corporate bond spreads and long-term interest rate\nforecasts. As any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain,\nthe Corporation leverages multiple scenarios. The scenarios that\nare chosen each quarter and the amount of weighting given to\neach scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent\neconomic events, leading economic indicators, views of internal\nand third-party economists and industry trends. The Corporation\nalso includes qualitative reserves to cover losses that are\nexpected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be\nadequately represented in the economic assumptions described\nabove. For example, factors that the Corporation considers\ninclude changes in lending policies and procedures, business\nconditions, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio\nconcentrations, the volume and severity of past due loans and\nnonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as\ncompetition, and legal and regulatory requirements, among\nothers. Further, the Corporation considers the inherent\nuncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical\ndata. The allowance for credit losses can also be impacted by\nunanticipated changes in asset quality of the portfolio, such as\nincreases in risk rating downgrades in our commercial portfolio,\ndeterioration in borrower delinquencies or credit scores in our\ncredit card portfolio or increases in LTVs in our consumer real\nestate portfolio. In addition, while we have incorporated our\nestimated impact of COVID-19 into our allowance for credit\nlosses, the ultimate impact of the pandemic is still unknown,\nincluding how long economic activities will be impacted and what\neffect the unprecedented levels of government fiscal and\nmonetary actions will have on the economy and our credit losses.\nAs described above, the process to determine the allowance for\ncredit losses requires numerous estimates and assumptions, some\nof which require a high degree of judgment and are often\ninterrelated. Changes in the estimates and assumptions can\nresult in significant changes in the allowance for credit\nlosses. Our process for determining the allowance for credit\nlosses is further discussed in Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant\nAccounting Principles and Note 5 \u2013 Outstanding Loans and Leases\nand Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements . Goodwill and Intangible Assets The nature of and\naccounting for goodwill and intangible assets are discussed in\nNote 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 7\n\u2013 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements .

We\ncompleted our annual goodwill\nimpairment test as of June 30,\n2020 . In performing that test,\nwe compared the fair value of\neach reporting unit to its\nestimated carrying value as\nmeasured by allocated equity.\nWe estimated the fair value of\neach reporting unit based on\nthe income approach (which\nutilizes the present value of\ncash flows to estimate fair\nvalue) and the market\nmultiplier approach (which\nutilizes observable market\nprices and metrics of peer\ncompanies to estimate fair\nvalue). Our discounted cash\nflows were generally based on\nthe Corporation\u2019s three-year\ninternal forecasts with a long-\nterm growth rate of 3.68\npercent. Our estimated cash\nflows take into account the\ncurrent challenging global\nindustry and market conditions\nrelated to the COVID-19\npandemic, including the low\ninterest rate environment. The\ncash flows were discounted\nusing rates that range from 9\npercent to 12 percent, which\nwere derived from a capital\nasset pricing model that\nincorporates the risk and\nuncertainty in the cash flow\nforecasts, the financial\nmarkets and industries similar\nto each of the reporting units.\nUnder the market multiplier\napproach, we estimated the fair\nvalue of the individual\nreporting units utilizing\nvarious market multiples,\nprimarily various pricing\nmultiples, from comparable\npublicly-traded companies in\nindustries similar to the\nreporting unit and then\nfactored in a control premium\nbased upon observed comparable\npremiums paid for change-in-\ncontrol transactions for\nfinancial institutions. Based\non the results of the test, we\ndetermined that each reporting\nunit\u2019s estimated fair value\nexceeded its respective\ncarrying value and that the\ngoodwill assigned to each\nreporting unit, as of June 30,\n2020 , was not impaired. The\nfair values of the reporting\nunits as a percentage of their\ncarrying values ranged from 109\npercent to 213 percent. As it\ncurrently remains difficult to\npredict the economic impacts\nrelated to the COVID-19\npandemic, we will continue to\nmonitor key assumptions and\nother factors utilized in our\nimpairment analysis. It is\npossible that, during the\nremainder of 2020 , economic\nand market conditions (both in\nthe U.S. and internationally)\ncould further deteriorate,\nwhich could negatively impact\nour reporting units. If our key\nassumptions and related\nestimates change, we may be\nrequired to record an\nimpairment charge in the\nfuture.\n                     \n  Bank of America50  \n                     \nNon-GAAP Reconciliations Table 49 provides reconciliations of\ncertain non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely related\nGAAP financial measures.\n                                                                \n       \u2026                                                        \n       \u2026                                                        \n       \u2026                                                        \n       \u2026                                                        \n       \u2026                                                        \n       \u2026                                                        \n       \u2026                                                        \n       \u2026                                                        \n       \u2026                                                        \n    \u2026  \u2026                                                        \n    \u2026  \u2026                                                        \n    \u2026  \u2026                                                        \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n    \u2026  $         $         $         $         $           \u2026    \n    \u2026                                                           \n    \u2026       )         )         )         )         )      \u2026    \n    \u2026                                                           \n    \u2026       )         )         )         )         )      \u2026    \n    \u2026                                                           \n    \u2026                                                           \n    \u2026                                                           \n    \u2026                                                      \u2026    \n    \u2026                                                           \n    \u2026                                                           \n    \u2026                                                           \n    \u2026  $         $         $         $         $           \u2026    \n    \u2026                                                           \n    \u2026       )         )         )         )         )      \u2026    \n    \u2026                                                           \n    \u2026                                                           \n    \u2026  $         $         $         $         $           \u2026    \n    \u2026                                                           \n    \u2026                                                           \n    \u2026  $         $                                              \n    \u2026                                                           \n    \u2026       )         )                                         \n    \u2026                                                           \n    \u2026       )         )                                         \n    \u2026                                                           \n    \u2026                                                           \n    \u2026                                                           \n    \u2026                                                           \n    \u2026                                                           \n    \u2026                                                           \n    \u2026  $         $                                              \n    \u2026                                                           \n                                                                \n                                                                \n       Presents reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures  \n       to the most closely related GAAP financial measures.     \n  (1)  For more information on non-GAAP financial measures and  \n       ratios we use in assessing the results of the            \n       Corporation, seeSupplemental Financial Dataon page8.     \n                                                                \nItem 3.

America Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements NOTE 1 Summary of Significant\nAccounting Principles Bank of America Corporation, a bank\nholding company and a financial holding company, provides a\ndiverse range of financial services and products throughout the\nU.S. and in certain international markets. The term \u201cthe\nCorporation\u201d as used herein may refer to Bank of America\nCorporation, individually, Bank of America Corporation and its\nsubsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation\u2019s\nsubsidiaries or affiliates. Principles of Consolidation and\nBasis of Presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements\ninclude the accounts of the Corporation and its majority-owned\nsubsidiaries and those variable interest entities (VIEs) where\nthe Corporation is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany\naccounts and transactions have been eliminated. Results of\noperations of acquired companies are included from the dates of\nacquisition, and for VIEs, from the dates that the Corporation\nbecame the primary beneficiary. Assets held in an agency or\nfiduciary capacity are not included in the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements. The Corporation accounts for investments\nin companies for which it owns a voting interest and for which\nit has the ability to exercise significant influence over\noperating and financing decisions using the equity method of\naccounting. These investments are included in other assets.\nEquity method investments are subject to impairment testing, and\nthe Corporation\u2019s proportionate share of income or loss is\nincluded in other income. The preparation of the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect\nreported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could\nmaterially differ from those estimates and assumptions. These\nunaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in\nconjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements\nof the Corporation\u2019s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The nature\nof the Corporation\u2019s business is such that the results of any\ninterim period are not necessarily indicative of results for a\nfull year. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which\nconsist of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair\nstatement of the interim period results, have been made. The\nCorporation evaluates subsequent events through the date of\nfiling with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain\nprior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to\ncurrent period presentation. New Accounting Standards Reference\nRate Reform In March 2020, the FASB issued a new accounting\nstandard related to contracts or hedging relationships that\nreference LIBOR or other reference rates that are expected to be\ndiscontinued due to reference rate reform. The new standard\nprovides for optional expedients and other guidance regarding\nthe accounting related to modifications of contracts, hedging\nrelationships and other transactions affected by reference rate\nreform. The Corporation has elected to retrospectively adopt the\nnew standard as of January 1, 2020 which resulted in no\nimmediate impact. While reference rate reform is not expected to\nhave a material accounting impact on the Corporation\u2019s\nconsolidated financial position or results of operations, the\nstandard will ease the administrative burden in accounting for\nthe future effects of reference rate reform. Accounting for\nFinancial Instruments -- Credit Losses On January 1, 2020, the\nCorporation adopted the new accounting standard that requires\nthe measurement of the allowance for credit losses to be based\non management\u2019s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses\n(ECL) inherent in the Corporation\u2019s relevant financial assets.\nUpon adoption of the standard on January 1, 2020, the\nCorporation recorded a $ 3.3billion , or 32percent , increase to\nthe allowance for credit losses. After adjusting for deferred\ntaxes and other adoption effects, a $ 2.4billion decrease was\nrecorded in retained earnings through a cumulative-effect\nadjustment. Accounting Principles for Credit Losses The\nfollowing summarizes the Corporation\u2019s accounting policies for\ncertain credit loss activities. Allowance for Credit Losses The\nallowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan\nand lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments and represents management\u2019s estimate of the ECL in\nthe Corporation\u2019s loan and lease portfolio, excluding loans and\nunfunded lending commitments accounted for under the fair value\noption. The ECL on funded consumer and commercial loans and\nleases is referred to as the allowance for loan and lease losses\nand is reported separately as a contra-asset to loans and leases\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The ECL for unfunded lending\ncommitments, including home equity lines of credit (HELOCs),\nstandby letters of credit (SBLCs) and binding unfunded loan\ncommitments is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in\naccrued expenses and other liabilities. The provision for credit\nlosses related to the loan and lease portfolio and unfunded\nlending commitments is reported in the Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. For loans and leases, the ECL is typically estimated\nusing quantitative methods that consider a variety of factors\nsuch as historical loss experience, the current credit quality\nof the portfolio as well as an economic outlook over the life of\nthe loan. The life of the loan for closed-ended products is\nbased on the contractual maturity of the loan adjusted for any\nexpected prepayments. The contractual maturity includes any\nextension options that are at the sole discretion of the\nborrower. For open-ended products (e.g., lines of credit), the\nECL is determined based on the maximum repayment term associated\nwith future draws from credit lines unless those lines of credit\nare unconditionally cancellable (e.g., credit cards) in which\ncase the Corporation does not record any allowance. In its loss\nforecasting framework, the Corporation incorporates forward-\nlooking information through the use of macroeconomic scenarios\napplied over the forecasted life of the assets. These\nmacroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically\nbeen key drivers of increases and decreases in credit losses.\nThese variables include, but are not limited to, unemployment\nrates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels,\ncorporate bond spreads and long-term interest rate forecasts. As\nany one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the\nCorporation leverages multiple scenarios. The scenarios that are\nchosen each quarter and the amount of weighting given to each\nscenario depend on a variety of factors including recent\neconomic events, leading economic indicators, views of internal\nas well as third-party economists and industry trends. The\nestimate of credit losses includes expected recoveries of\namounts previously charged off (i.e., negative allowance). If a\nloan\n                     \n  Bank of America56  \n                     \nhas been charged off, the expected cash flows on the loan are\nnot limited by the current amortized cost balance. Instead,\nexpected cash flows can be assumed up to the unpaid principal\nbalance immediately prior to the charge-off. The allowance for\nloan and lease losses for troubled debt restructurings (TDR) is\nmeasured based on the present value of projected future lifetime\nprincipal and interest cash flows discounted at the loan\u2019s\noriginal effective interest rate, or in cases where foreclosure\nis probable or the loan is collateral dependent, at the loan\u2019s\ncollateral value or its observable market price, if available.\nThe measurement of ECL for the renegotiated consumer credit card\nTDR portfolio is based on the present value of projected cash\nflows discounted using the average TDR portfolio contractual\ninterest rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect\nprior to restructuring. Projected cash flows for TDRs use the\nsame economic outlook as discussed above. For purposes of\ncomputing this specific loss component of the allowance, larger\nimpaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired\nloans are evaluated as a pool. Also included in the allowance\nfor loan and lease losses are qualitative reserves to cover\nlosses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment,\nmay not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or\nthe economic assumptions described above. For example, factors\nthat the Corporation considers include changes in lending\npolicies and procedures, business conditions, the nature and\nsize of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and\nseverity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of\nexternal factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory\nrequirements, among others. Further, the Corporation considers\nthe inherent uncertainty in quantitative models that are built\non historical data. With the exception of the Corporation's\ncredit card portfolio, the Corporation does not include reserves\nfor interest receivable in the measurement of the allowance for\ncredit losses as the Corporation generally classifies consumer\nloans as nonperforming at 90 days past due and reverses interest\nincome for these loans at that time. For credit card loans, the\nCorporation reserves for interest and fees as part of the\nallowance for loan and lease losses. Upon charge-off of a credit\ncard loan, the Corporation reverses the interest and fee income\nagainst the income statement line item where it was originally\nrecorded. The Corporation has identified the following three\nportfolio segments and measures the allowance for credit losses\nusing the following methods. Consumer Real Estate To estimate\nECL for consumer loans secured by residential real estate, the\nCorporation estimates the number of loans that will default over\nthe life of the existing portfolio, after factoring in estimated\nprepayments, using quantitative modeling methodologies. The\nattributes that are most significant in estimating the\nCorporation\u2019s ECL include refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) or, in\nthe case of a subordinated lien, refreshed combined LTV (CLTV),\nborrower credit score, months since origination and geography,\nall of which are further broken down by present collection\nstatus (whether the loan is current, delinquent, in default, or\nin bankruptcy). The estimates are based on the Corporation\u2019s\nhistorical experience with the loan portfolio, adjusted to\nreflect the economic outlook. The outlook on the unemployment\nrate and consumer real estate prices are key factors that impact\nthe frequency and severity of loss estimates. The Corporation\ndoes not reserve for credit losses on the unpaid principal\nbalance of loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration\n(FHA) and long-term standby loans, as these loans are fully\ninsured. The Corporation records a reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments for the ECL associated with the undrawn portion of\nthe Corporation\u2019s HELOCs, which can only be canceled by the\nCorporation if certain criteria are met. The ECL associated with\nthese unfunded lending commitments is calculated using the same\nmodels and methodologies noted above and incorporate utilization\nassumptions at time of default. For loans that are more than 180\ndays past due and collateral-dependent TDRs, the Corporation\nbases the allowance on the estimated fair value of the\nunderlying collateral as of the reporting date less costs to\nsell. The fair value of the collateral securing these loans is\ngenerally determined using an automated valuation model (AVM)\nthat estimates the value of a property by reference to market\ndata including sales of comparable properties and price trends\nspecific to the Metropolitan Statistical Area in which the\nproperty being valued is located. In the event that an AVM value\nis not available, the Corporation utilizes publicized indices or\nif these methods provide less reliable valuations, the\nCorporation uses appraisals or broker price opinions to estimate\nthe fair value of the collateral. While there is inherent\nimprecision in these valuations, the Corporation believes that\nthey are representative of this portfolio in the aggregate. For\nloans that are more than 180 days past due and collateral-\ndependent TDRs, with the exception of the Corporation\u2019s fully\ninsured portfolio, the outstanding balance of loans that is in\nexcess of the estimated property value after adjusting for costs\nto sell is charged off. If the estimated property value\ndecreases in periods subsequent to the initial charge-off, the\nCorporation will record an additional charge-off; however, if\nthe value increases in periods subsequent to the charge-off, the\nCorporation will adjust the allowance to account for the\nincrease but not to a level above the cumulative charge-off\namount. Credit Cards and Other Consumer Credit cards are\nrevolving lines of credit without a defined maturity date. The\nestimated life of a credit card receivable is determined by\nestimating the amount and timing of expected future payments\n(e.g., borrowers making full payments, minimum payments or\nsomewhere in between) that it will take for a receivable balance\nto pay off. The ECL on the future payments incorporates the\nspending behavior of a borrower through time using key borrower-\nspecific factors and the economic outlook described above. The\nCorporation applies all expected payments in accordance with the\nCredit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of\n2009 (i.e., paying down the highest interest rate bucket first).\nThen forecasted future payments are prioritized to pay off the\noldest balance until it is brought to zero or an expected\ncharge-off amount. Unemployment rate outlook, borrower credit\nscore, delinquency status and historical payment behavior are\nall key inputs into the credit card receivable loss forecasting\nmodel. Future draws on the credit card lines are excluded from\nthe ECL as they are unconditionally cancellable. The ECL for the\nconsumer vehicle lending portfolio is also determined using\nquantitative methods supplemented with qualitative analysis. The\nquantitative model estimates ECL giving consideration to key\nborrower and loan characteristics such as delinquency status,\nborrower credit score, LTV ratio, underlying collateral type and\ncollateral value. Commercial The ECL on commercial loans is\nforecasted using models that estimate credit losses over the\nloan\u2019s contractual life at an individual loan level. The models\nuse the contractual terms to forecast future principal cash\nflows while also considering expected prepayments. For open-\nended commitments such as revolving lines of credit, changes in\nfunded balance are captured by forecasting a borrower\u2019s draw and\npayment behavior over the remaining life of the commitment. For\nloans collateralized with\n                     \n  57Bank of America  \n                     \ncommercial real estate and for which the underlying asset is the\nprimary source of repayment, the loss forecasting models\nconsider key loan and customer attributes such as LTV ratio, net\noperating income and debt service coverage, and captures\nvariations in behavior according to property type and region.\nThe commercial real estate model also utilizes key economic\nvariables to forecast market indicators such as rent levels and\nvacancy rates, which impact the expected credit loss estimate.\nFor all other commercial loans and leases, the loss forecasting\nmodel determines the probabilities of transition to different\ncredit risk ratings or default at each point over the life of\nthe asset based on the borrower\u2019s current credit risk rating,\nindustry sector, size of the exposure and the geographic market.\nThe severity of loss is determined based on the type of\ncollateral securing the exposure, the size of the exposure, the\nborrower\u2019s industry sector, any guarantors and the geographic\nmarket. Assumptions of expected loss are conditioned to the\neconomic outlook and the model considers key economic variables\nsuch as unemployment rate, gross domestic product, credit risk\nspreads, asset prices and equity market returns. In addition to\nthe allowance for loan and lease losses, the Corporation also\nestimates ECL related to unfunded lending commitments such as\nletters of credit, financial guarantees, unfunded bankers\nacceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments\naccounted for under the fair value option. Reserves are\nestimated for the unfunded exposure using the same models and\nmethodologies as the funded exposure and are reported as\nreserves for unfunded lending commitments. Securities The\nCorporation evaluates each available-for-sale (AFS) security\nwhere the value has declined below amortized cost. If the\nCorporation intends to sell or believes it is more likely than\nnot that it will be required to sell the debt security, it is\nwritten down to fair value through earnings. For AFS debt\nsecurities the Corporation intends to hold, the Corporation\nevaluates the debt securities for ECL except for debt securities\nthat are guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury, U.S. government\nagencies or sovereign entities of high credit quality where the\nCorporation applies a zero credit loss assumption. For the\nremaining AFS debt securities, the Corporation considers\nqualitative parameters such as internal and external credit\nratings and the value of underlying collateral. If an AFS debt\nsecurity fails any of the qualitative parameters, a discounted\ncash flow analysis is used by the Corporation to determine if a\nportion of the unrealized loss is a result of a credit loss. Any\ncredit losses determined are recognized as an increase to the\nallowance for credit losses through provision expense recorded\nin other income. Cash flows expected to be collected are\nestimated using all relevant information available such as,\nremaining payment terms, prepayment speeds, the financial\ncondition of the issuer, expected defaults and the value of the\nunderlying collateral. If any of the decline in fair value is\nrelated to market factors, that amount is recognized in\naccumulated other comprehensive income (OCI). In certain\ninstances, the credit loss may exceed the total decline in fair\nvalue, in which case, the allowance recorded is limited to the\ndifference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the\nasset. The Corporation separately evaluates its held-to-maturity\n(HTM) debt securities for any credit losses, of which\nsubstantially all qualify for the zero loss assumption. For the\nremaining securities, the Corporation performs a discounted cash\nflow analysis to estimate any credit losses which are then\nrecognized as part of the allowance for credit losses. Other\nAssets For the Corporation\u2019s financial assets that are measured\nat amortized cost and are not included in debt securities or\nloans and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the\nCorporation evaluates these assets for ECL using various\ntechniques. For assets that are subject to collateral\nmaintenance provisions, including federal funds sold and\nsecurities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell,\nwhere the collateral consists of daily margining of liquid and\nmarketable assets where the margining is expected to be\nmaintained into the foreseeable future, the expected losses are\nassumed to be zero . For all other assets, the Corporation\nperforms qualitative analyses, including consideration of\nhistorical losses and current economic conditions, to estimate\nany ECL which are then included in a valuation account that is\nrecorded as a contra-asset against the amortized cost basis of\nthe financial asset. Troubled Debt Restructurings The\nCorporation has implemented various consumer and commercial loan\nmodification programs to provide its borrowers relief from the\neconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In accordance with\nthe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES\nAct), the Corporation has elected to not apply TDR\nclassification to any COVID-19 related loan modifications that\nwere performed after March 1, 2020 to borrowers who were current\nas of December 31, 2019. Accordingly, these restructurings are\nnot classified as TDRs. In addition, for loans modified in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic that do not meet the above\ncriteria (e.g., current payment status at December 31, 2019),\nthe Corporation is applying the guidance included in an\ninteragency statement issued by the bank regulatory agencies.\nThis guidance states that loan modifications performed in light\nof the COVID-19 pandemic, including loan payment deferrals that\nare up to six months in duration, that were granted to borrowers\nwho were current as of the implementation date of a loan\nmodification program or modifications granted under government\nmandated modification programs, are not TDRs. For loan\nmodifications that include a payment deferral and are not TDRs,\nthe borrower\u2019s past due and nonaccrual status will not be\nimpacted during the deferral period. Interest income will\ncontinue to be recognized over the contractual life of the loan.\nFor more information on the Corporation's TDR accounting, see\nNote 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2019\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. Paycheck Protection Program The\nCorporation is participating in the Paycheck Protection Program\n(PPP), which is a loan program that originated from the CARES\nAct and was subsequently expanded by the Paycheck Protection\nProgram and Health Care Enhancement Act. The PPP is designed to\nprovide U.S. small businesses with cash-flow assistance through\nloans fully guaranteed by the Small Business Administration\n(SBA). If the borrower meets certain criteria and uses the\nproceeds towards certain eligible expenses, the borrower\u2019s\nobligation to repay the loan can be forgiven up to the full\nprincipal amount of the loan and any accrued interest. Upon\nborrower forgiveness, the SBA pays the Corporation for the\nprincipal and accrued interest owed on the loan. If the full\nprincipal of the loan is not forgiven, the loan will operate\naccording to the original loan terms with the 100 percent SBA\nguaranty remaining. As of June 30, 2020 , the Corporation had\nfunded approximately 334,000 loans under the PPP totaling $\n25.1billion . As compensation for originating the loans, the\nCorporation receives lender processing fees from the SBA, which\nare\n                     \n  Bank of America58  \n                     \ncapitalized, along with the loan origination costs, and will be\namortized over the loans\u2019 contractual lives and recognized as\ninterest income. Upon forgiveness of a loan and repayment by the\nSBA, any unrecognized net capitalized fees and costs related to\nthe loan will be recognized as interest income in that period.\nAccounting Principles for Goodwill Goodwill is the purchase\npremium after adjusting for the fair value of net assets\nacquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for\npotential impairment on an annual basis, or when events or\ncircumstances indicate a potential impairment, at the reporting\nunit level. Beginning January 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted\nthe new accounting standard that requires the measurement of any\ngoodwill impairment to be based on the amount by which a\nreporting unit\u2019s carrying value exceeds its fair value. If the\nfair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the\nreporting unit\u2019s goodwill is not considered impaired.\nPreviously, the amount of impairment was based on a comparison\nof the reporting unit\u2019s implied fair value of goodwill to the\nreporting unit\u2019s assigned amount of goodwill. During the second\nquarter of 2020, the Corporation performed a quantitative\nanalysis for its annual goodwill impairment test as of June 30,\n2020. For more information on the results of the Corporation's\ntest, see Note 7 \u2013 Goodwill and Intangible Assets . For more\ninformation on accounting for goodwill, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements of the Corporation\u2019s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n. Subsequent Events On July 22, 2020, the U.K. enacted a repeal\nof the final two percent of scheduled decreases in the U.K.\ncorporation tax rate, which had been previously enacted. This\nchange will unfavorably affect income tax expense on future U.K.\nearnings, and requires a remeasurement of the Corporation's U.K.\nnet deferred tax assets using the higher tax rate. Accordingly,\nduring the third quarter of 2020, the Corporation will record an\nincome tax benefit of approximately $ 700million along with a\ncorresponding increase to the U.K. net deferred tax assets.

For more information on ALM and risk\nmanagement derivatives, see Note 3 \u2013 Derivatives to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2019\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K . Derivatives Designated as\nAccounting Hedges The Corporation uses various types of interest\nrate and foreign exchange derivative contracts to protect\nagainst changes in the fair value of its assets and liabilities\ndue to fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates (fair\nvalue hedges). The Corporation also uses these types of\ncontracts to protect against changes in the cash flows of its\nassets and liabilities, and other forecasted transactions (cash\nflow hedges). The Corporation hedges its net investment in\nconsolidated non-U.S. operations determined to have functional\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward exchange\ncontracts and cross-currency basis swaps, and by issuing foreign\ncurrency-denominated debt (net investment hedges).

However, the\nCorporation does not monitor its exposure to credit derivatives\nbased solely on the notional amount because this measure does\nnot take into consideration the probability of occurrence. As\nsuch, the notional amount is not a reliable indicator of the\nCorporation\u2019s exposure to these contracts. Instead, a risk\nframework is used to define risk tolerances and establish limits\nso that certain credit risk-related losses occur within\nacceptable, predefined limits. Credit-related notes in the table\nabove include investments in securities issued by collateralized\ndebt obligation (CDO), collateralized loan obligation and\ncredit-linked note vehicles. These instruments are primarily\nclassified as trading securities. The carrying value of these\ninstruments equals the Corporation\u2019s maximum exposure to loss.\nThe Corporation is not obligated to make any payments to the\nentities under the terms of the securities owned.\n                     \n  65Bank of America  \n                     \nCredit-related Contingent Features and Collateral Certain of the\nCorporation\u2019s derivative contracts contain credit risk-related\ncontingent features, primarily in the form of ISDA master\nnetting agreements and credit support documentation that enhance\nthe creditworthiness of these instruments compared to other\nobligations of the respective counterparty with whom the\nCorporation has transacted. These contingent features may be for\nthe benefit of the Corporation as well as its counterparties\nwith respect to changes in the Corporation\u2019s creditworthiness\nand the mark-to-market exposure under the derivative\ntransactions. At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , the\nCorporation held cash and securities collateral of $ 89.0billion\nand $ 84.3billion and posted cash and securities collateral of $\n85.3billion and $ 69.1billion in the normal course of business\nunder derivative agreements, excluding cross-product margining\nagreements where clients are permitted to margin on a net basis\nfor both derivative and secured financing arrangements. In\nconnection with certain over-the-counter derivative contracts\nand other trading agreements, the Corporation can be required to\nprovide additional collateral or to terminate transactions with\ncertain counterparties in the event of a downgrade of the senior\ndebt ratings of the Corporation or certain subsidiaries. The\namount of additional collateral required depends on the contract\nand is usually a fixed incremental amount and/or the market\nvalue of the exposure. For more information on credit-related\ncontingent features and collateral, see Note 3 \u2013 Derivatives to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2019\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K . At June 30, 2020 , the amount of\ncollateral, calculated based on the terms of the contracts, that\nthe Corporation and certain subsidiaries could be required to\npost to counterparties but had not yet posted to counterparties\nwas $ 2.2billion , including $ 1.3billion for Bank of America,\nNational Association. Some counterparties are currently able to\nunilaterally terminate certain contracts, or the Corporation or\ncertain subsidiaries may be required to take other action such\nas find a suitable replacement or obtain a guarantee. At June\n30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , the liability recorded for\nthese derivative contracts was not significant. The following\ntable presents the amount of additional collateral that would\nhave been contractually required by derivative contracts and\nother trading agreements at June 30, 2020 if the rating agencies\nhad downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the\nCorporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch and\nby an additional second incremental notch.\n                                                                \n                Additional                                      \n                Collateral                                      \n                Required to                                     \n                be Posted                                       \n                Upon                                            \n                Downgrade                                       \n                at June 30,                                     \n                2020                                            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (Dollars in                           One             Second  \n  millions)                     incremental        incremental  \n                                      notch              notch  \n  Bank of                                                       \n  America       $                       337    $           707  \n  Corporation                                                   \n  Bank of                                                       \n  America,                              111                512  \n  N.A. and                                                      \n  subsidiarie\u2026                                                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  (1)  Included in Bank of America Corporation collateral       \n       requirements in this table.                              \n                                                                \nThe following table presents\nthe derivative liabilities that\nwould be subject to unilateral\ntermination by counterparties\nand the amounts of collateral\nthat would have been\ncontractually required at June\n30, 2020 if the long-term\nsenior debt ratings for the\nCorporation or certain\nsubsidiaries had been lower by\none incremental notch and by an\nadditional second incremental\nnotch.\n                                                                \n                Derivative                                      \n                Liabilities                                     \n                Subject to                                      \n                Unilateral                                      \n                Termination                                     \n                Upon                                            \n                Downgrade at                                    \n                June 30,                                        \n                2020                                            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (Dollars in                           One             Second  \n  millions)                     incremental        incremental  \n                                      notch              notch  \n  Derivative    $                        36    $         1,189  \n  liabilities                                                   \n  Collateral                              1                920  \n  posted                                                        \n                                                                \nValuation Adjustments on\nDerivatives\nThe table below presents credit\nvaluation adjustment (CVA), DVA\nand FVA gains (losses) on\nderivatives (excluding the\neffect of any related hedge\nactivities), which are recorded\nin market making and similar\nactivities, for the three and\nsix months ended June 30, 2020\nand 2019 .

Generally, loans that\nwere originated after January 1, 2010, qualified under\ngovernment-sponsored enterprise (GSE) underwriting guidelines,\nor otherwise met the Corporation\u2019s underwriting guidelines in\nplace in 2015 are characterized as core loans. All other loans\nare generally characterized as non-core loans and represent\nrunoff portfolios. The Corporation has entered into long-term\ncredit protection agreements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on\nloans totaling $ 8.6billion and $ 7.5billion at June 30, 2020\nand December 31, 2019 , providing full credit protection on\nresidential mortgage loans that become severely delinquent. All\nof these loans are individually insured and therefore the\nCorporation does not record an allowance for credit losses\nrelated to these loans. Nonperforming Loans and Leases\nCommercial nonperforming loans increased to $ 2.2billion at June\n30, 2020 from $ 1.5billion at December 31, 2019 with broad-based\nincreases across multiple industries. The Corporation did not\nsee meaningful impacts to consumer portfolio delinquencies and\nnonperforming loans during the six months ended June 30, 2020\ndue to payment deferrals and government stimulus benefits. The\ntable below presents the Corporation\u2019s nonperforming loans and\nleases including nonperforming TDRs, and loans accruing past due\n90 days or more at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 .\nNonperforming loans held-for-sale (LHFS) are excluded from\nnonperforming loans and leases as they are recorded at either\nfair value or the lower of cost or fair value.

Credit\nQuality Indicators The Corporation monitors credit quality\nwithin its Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer,\nand Commercial portfolio segments based on primary credit\nquality indicators. For more information on the portfolio\nsegments, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting\nPrinciples . Within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment,\nthe primary credit quality indicators are refreshed LTV and\nrefreshed FICO score. Refreshed LTV measures the carrying value\nof the loan as a percentage of the value of the property\nsecuring the loan, refreshed quarterly. Home equity loans are\nevaluated using CLTV which measures the carrying value of the\nCorporation\u2019s loan and available line of credit combined with\nany outstanding senior liens against the property as a\npercentage of the value of the property securing the loan,\nrefreshed quarterly. FICO score measures the creditworthiness of\nthe borrower based on the financial obligations of the borrower\nand the borrower\u2019s credit history. FICO scores are typically\nrefreshed quarterly or more frequently. Certain borrowers (e.g.,\nborrowers that have had debts discharged in a bankruptcy\nproceeding) may not have their FICO scores updated. FICO scores\nare also a primary credit quality indicator for the Credit Card\nand Other Consumer portfolio segment and the business card\nportfolio within U.S. small business commercial. Within the\nCommercial portfolio segment, loans are evaluated using the\ninternal classifications of pass rated or reservable criticized\nas the primary credit quality indicators. The term reservable\ncriticized refers to those commercial loans that are internally\nclassified or listed by the Corporation as Special Mention,\nSubstandard or Doubtful, which are asset quality categories\ndefined by regulatory authorities. These assets have an elevated\nlevel of risk and may have a high probability of default or\ntotal loss. Pass rated refers to all loans not considered\nreservable criticized. In addition to these primary credit\nquality indicators, the Corporation uses other credit quality\nindicators for certain types of loans. The following tables\npresent certain credit quality indicators for the Corporation's\nConsumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and\nCommercial portfolio segments, by class of financing receivables\nand year of origination for term loan balances at June 30, 2020\n, including revolving loans that converted to term loans without\nan additional credit decision after origination or

Troubled Debt Restructurings The\nCorporation began entering into loan modifications with\nborrowers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which have not\nbeen classified as TDRs, and therefore are not included in the\ndiscussion below. For more information on the criteria for\nclassifying loans as TDRs, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant\nAccounting Principles . Consumer Real Estate Modifications of\nconsumer real estate loans are classified as TDRs when the\nborrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a concession\nhas been granted. Concessions may include reductions in interest\nrates, capitalization of past due amounts, principal and/or\ninterest forbearance, payment extensions, principal and/or\ninterest forgiveness, or combinations thereof. Prior to\npermanently modifying a loan, the Corporation may enter into\ntrial modifications with certain borrowers under both government\nand proprietary programs. Trial modifications generally\nrepresent a three- to four-month period during which the\nborrower makes monthly payments under the anticipated modified\npayment terms. Upon successful completion of the trial period,\nthe Corporation and the borrower enter into a permanent\nmodification. Binding trial modifications are classified as TDRs\nwhen the trial offer is made and continue to be classified as\nTDRs regardless of whether the borrower enters into a permanent\nmodification. Consumer real estate loans of $ 396million that\nhave been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy with no change in\nrepayment terms and not reaffirmed by the borrower were included\nin TDRs at June 30, 2020 , of which $ 98million were classified\nas nonperforming and $ 75million were loans fully insured.\nConsumer real estate TDRs are measured primarily based on the\nnet present value of the estimated cash flows discounted at the\nloan\u2019s original effective interest rate. If the carrying value\nof a TDR exceeds this amount, a specific allowance is recorded\nas a component of the allowance for loan and lease losses.\nAlternatively, consumer real estate TDRs that are considered to\nbe dependent solely on the collateral for repayment (e.g., due\nto the lack of income verification) are measured based on the\nestimated fair value of the collateral and a charge-off is\nrecorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the\ncollateral. Consumer real estate loans that reach 180 days past\ndue prior to modification are charged off to their net\nrealizable value, less costs to sell, before they are modified\nas TDRs in accordance with established policy. Subsequent\ndeclines in the fair value of the collateral after a loan has\nreached 180 days past due are recorded as charge-offs. Fully-\ninsured loans are protected against principal loss, and\ntherefore, the Corporation does not record an allowance\n                     \n  Bank of America74  \n                     \nfor loan and lease losses on the outstanding principal balance,\neven after they have been modified in a TDR. At June 30, 2020\nand December 31, 2019 , remaining commitments to lend additional\nfunds to debtors whose terms have been modified in a consumer\nreal estate TDR were not significant. Consumer real estate\nforeclosed properties totaled $ 169million and $ 229million at\nJune 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . The carrying value of\nconsumer real estate loans, including fully-insured loans, for\nwhich formal foreclosure proceedings were in process at June 30,\n2020 was $ 1.4billion . Although the Corporation has paused\nformal loan foreclosure proceedings and foreclosure sales,\nduring the six months ended June 30, 2020 , the Corporation\nreclassified $ 154million of consumer real estate loans\ncompleted or which were in process prior to the pause in\nforeclosures, to foreclosed properties or, for properties\nacquired upon foreclosure of certain government-guaranteed loans\n(principally FHA-insured loans), to other assets. The\nreclassifications represent non-cash investing activities and,\naccordingly, are not reflected in the Consolidated Statement of\nCash Flows. The table below presents the June 30, 2020 and 2019\nunpaid principal balance, carrying value, and average pre- and\npost-modification interest rates of consumer real estate loans\nthat were modified in TDRs during the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2020 and 2019 . The following Consumer Real Estate\nportfolio segment tables include loans that were initially\nclassified as TDRs during the period and also loans that had\npreviously been classified as TDRs and

Payment defaults are one of the\nfactors considered when projecting future cash flows in the\ncalculation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for\ncredit card and other consumer. Based on historical experience,\nthe Corporation estimates that 14percent of new credit card TDRs\nand 22percent of new direct/indirect consumer TDRs may be in\npayment default within 12 months after modification. Commercial\nLoans Modifications of loans to commercial borrowers that are\nexperiencing financial difficulty are designed to reduce the\nCorporation\u2019s loss exposure while providing the borrower with an\nopportunity to work through financial difficulties, often to\navoid foreclosure or bankruptcy. Each modification is unique and\nreflects the individual circumstances of the borrower.\nModifications that result in a TDR may include extensions of\nmaturity at a concessionary (below market) rate of interest,\npayment forbearances or other actions designed to benefit the\nborrower while mitigating the Corporation\u2019s risk exposure.\nReductions in interest rates are rare. Instead, the interest\nrates are typically increased, although the increased rate may\nnot represent a market rate of interest. Infrequently,\nconcessions may also include principal forgiveness in connection\nwith foreclosure, short sale or other settlement agreements\nleading to termination or sale of the loan. At the time of\nrestructuring, the loans are remeasured to reflect the impact,\nif any, on projected cash flows resulting from the modified\nterms. If a portion of the loan is deemed to be uncollectible, a\ncharge-off may be recorded at the time of restructuring.\nAlternatively, a charge-off may have already been recorded in a\nprevious period such that no charge-off is required at the time\nof modification. For more information on modifications for the\nU.S. small business commercial portfolio, see Credit Card and\nOther Consumer in this Note. At June 30, 2020 and December 31,\n2019 , remaining commitments to lend additional funds to debtors\nwhose terms have been modified in a commercial loan TDR were $\n500million and $ 445million . The balance of commercial TDRs in\npayment default was not significant at June 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019 .\n                     \n  Bank of America76  \n                     \nLoans Held-for-sale The Corporation had LHFS of $ 7.4billion and\n$ 9.2billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . Cash and\nnon-cash proceeds from sales and paydowns of loans originally\nclassified as LHFS were $ 11.1billion and $ 14.4billion for the\nsix months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 . Cash used for\noriginations and purchases of LHFS totaled approximately $\n9.2billion for both the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019\n. Accrued Interest Receivable Accrued interest receivable for\nloans and leases and loans held-for-sale at June 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019 was $ 2.4billion and $ 2.6billion and is\nreported in customer and other receivables on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. Outstanding credit card loan balances include\nunpaid principal, interest and fees. Credit card loans are not\nclassified as nonperforming but are charged-off no later than\nthe end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past\ndue, within 60 days after receipt of notification of death or\nbankruptcy, or upon confirmation of fraud . During the three and\nsix months ended June 30, 2020 , the Corporation reversed $\n141million and $ 306million of interest and fee income against\nthe income statement line item in which it was originally\nrecorded upon charge-off of the principal balance of the loan .\nFor the outstanding residential mortgage, home equity,\ndirect/indirect consumer and commercial loan balances classified\nas nonperforming during the three and six months ended June 30,\n2020 , the Corporation reversed $ 8million and $ 18million of\ninterest and fee income at the time the loans were classified as\nnonperforming against the income statement line item in which it\nwas originally recorded. For more information on the\nCorporation's nonperforming loan policies, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary\nof Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2019 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K . Allowance for Credit Losses On January 1, 2020 , the\nCorporation adopted the new accounting standard that requires\nthe measurement of the allowance for credit losses to be based\non management\u2019s best estimate of lifetime ECL inherent in the\nCorporation\u2019s relevant financial assets. Upon adoption of the\nnew accounting standard, the Corporation recorded a $ 3.3billion\n, or 32percent , increase in the allowance for credit losses,\nwhich was comprised of a net increase of $ 2.9billion in the\nallowance for loan and lease losses and a $ 310million increase\nin the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The net\nincrease in the allowance for loan and lease losses was\nprimarily driven by a $ 3.1billion increase in credit card as\nthe Corporation now reserves for the life of these receivables.\nThe increase in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments\nincluded $ 119million in the consumer portfolio for the undrawn\nportion of HELOCs and $ 191million in the commercial portfolio.\nFor more information on the Corporation's credit loss accounting\npolicies including the allowance for credit losses see Note 1 \u2013\nSummary of Significant Accounting Principles . The allowance for\nloan and lease losses at June 30, 2020 was $ 19.4billion , an\nincrease of $ 7.0billion compared to January 1, 2020 . The\nincrease in the allowance for loan and lease losses was\nprimarily driven by deterioration in the economic outlook\nresulting from the impact of COVID-19. The increase in the\nallowance for loan and lease losses was $ 393million in the\nconsumer real estate portfolio, $ 2.7billion in the credit card\nand other consumer portfolio, and $ 3.9billion in the commercial\nportfolio. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments\nincreased $ 579million from January 1, 2020 to $ 1.7billion at\nJune 30, 2020 . The allowance for credit losses is estimated\nusing quantitative methods that consider a variety of factors\nsuch as historical loss experience, the current credit quality\nof the portfolio as well as an economic outlook over the life of\nthe loan. Also included in the allowance for loan and lease\nlosses are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are\nexpected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be\nadequately represented in the quantitative methods or the\neconomic assumptions. In its loss forecasting framework, the\nCorporation incorporates forward-looking information through the\nuse of macroeconomic scenarios applied over the forecasted life\nof the assets. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and\nthe amount of weighting given to each scenario depend on a\nvariety of factors including recent economic events, leading\neconomic indicators, views of internal as well as third-party\neconomists and industry trends. For more information on the\nCorporation's credit loss accounting policies, including the\nallowance for credit losses, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant\nAccounting Principles . The lifetime estimate considers several\nrecessionary scenarios that include deterioration in key\nmacroeconomic variables such as gross domestic product,\nunemployment rate and home price index over the life of the\nportfolio. As of January 1, 2020 , the Corporation's economic\noutlook was weighted to include the potential of a recession\nwith some expectation of tail risk similar to the severely\nadverse scenario used in stress testing. During the three and\nsix months ended June 30, 2020 , there was significant\ndeterioration in the macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. and\nglobally related to impact of COVID-19. This has resulted in\nchanges to key macroeconomic variables, including, but not\nlimited to, increases in the unemployment rate and decreases to\nthe forecasted gross domestic product compared to the\nCorporation's January 1, 2020 outlook. The weakened economic\noutlook was the primary driver of the Corporation\u2019s increase in\nthe allowance for credit losses. In establishing the allowance\nfor credit losses at June 30, 2020 , the Corporation used an\neconomic outlook derived from weighting consensus estimates, a\ndownside scenario that assumed a significantly slower recovery\nin order to reflect the uncertainty around the pace of recovery\nin the current crisis, and a tail risk scenario similar to the\nseverely adverse scenario used in stress testing. The\nunemployment rate under this economic outlook remained above 10\npercent as of the fourth quarter of 2020 with a gradual decline\nto above seven percent in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nAdditionally, in this economic outlook, gross domestic product\ndid not return to pre-pandemic levels until the beginning of\n2023. The Corporation factored into its allowance for credit\nloss estimate the impact to borrowers from additional\nunemployment benefits that were provided as part of the CARES\nAct, including a probability-weighted likelihood of an extension\nof benefits into the fourth quarter of 2020 . In addition, the\nallowance for credit losses at June 30, 2020 included\nqualitative reserves for certain segments that the Corporation\nviews as higher risk that may not be fully recognized through\nits quantitative models. These high risk segments include\nleveraged loans and higher risk industries such as hospitality\nand energy. The Corporation also holds additional reserves for\nborrowers who requested deferrals that take into account their\ncredit characteristics and payment behavior subsequent to\ndeferral. There are still many unknowns including the duration\nof the impact of COVID-19 on the economy and the results of the\ncurrent government fiscal and monetary actions including payment\ndeferral programs as well as future government actions. The\nCorporation will continue to evaluate the allowance for credit\nlosses and the related economic outlook each quarter.\n                     \n  77Bank of America  \n                     \nOutstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under\nthe fair value option increased $ 14.7billion in the six months\nended June 30, 2020 . Outstanding commercial loans and leases\nexcluding loans accounted for under the fair value option\nincreased $ 29.0billion primarily due to $ 25.1billion of funded\nPPP loans and growth in the commercial and industrial portfolio.\nOutstanding consumer loans and leases excluding loans accounted\nfor under the fair value option decreased $ 14.3billion in the\nsix months ended June 30, 2020 primarily driven by a decline in\ncredit card due to reduced consumer spending. The funding of PPP\nloans did not impact the allowance for credit losses as they are\nfully guaranteed by the SBA. The decline in consumer loans and\nleases somewhat offset the increase in the allowance for credit\ndriven by the weaker economic outlook. The table below\nsummarizes the changes in the allowance for credit losses by\nportfolio segment for the three and six months ended June 30,\n2020 and 2019 .\n

In addition, the Corporation\nmay be obligated to provide subordinate funding to the trusts\nduring a rapid amortization event. This obligation is included\nin the maximum loss exposure in the table above. The charges\nthat will ultimately be recorded as a result of the rapid\namortization events depend\n                     \n  Bank of America80  \n                     \non the undrawn portion of the HELOCs, performance of the loans,\nthe amount of subsequent draws and the timing of related cash\nflows. Credit Card Securitizations The Corporation securitizes\noriginated and purchased credit card loans. The Corporation\u2019s\ncontinuing involvement with the securitization trust includes\nservicing the receivables, retaining an undivided interest\n(seller\u2019s interest) in the receivables, and holding certain\nretained interests including subordinate interests in accrued\ninterest and fees on the securitized receivables and cash\nreserve accounts. No new senior debt securities were issued to\nthird-party investors from the credit card securitization trust\nduring the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 . At June 30,\n2020 and December 31, 2019 , the Corporation held subordinate\nsecurities issued by the credit card securitization trust with a\nnotional principal amount of $ 7.0billion and $ 7.4billion .\nThese securities serve as a form of credit enhancement to the\nsenior debt securities and have a stated interest rate of\nzeropercent . No subordinate securities were issued by the\ncredit card securitization trust during the six months ended\nJune 30, 2020 and 2019 . Resecuritization Trusts The Corporation\ntransfers securities, typically MBS, into resecuritization VIEs\ngenerally at the request of customers seeking securities with\nspecific characteristics. Generally, there are no significant\nongoing activities performed in a resecuritization trust, and no\nsingle investor has the unilateral ability to liquidate the\ntrust. The Corporation resecuritized $ 10.7billion and $\n18.1billion of securities during the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2020 compared to $ 4.1billion and $ 8.5billion for the\nsame periods in 2019 . Securities transferred into\nresecuritization VIEs were measured at fair value with changes\nin fair value recorded in market making and similar activities\nprior to the resecuritization and, accordingly, no gain or loss\non sale was recorded. Securities received from the\nresecuritization VIEs were recognized at their fair value of $\n4.4billion and $ 4.9billion during the three and six months\nended June 30, 2020 compared to $ 1.5billion and $ 2.8billion\nfor the same periods in 2019 , of which substantially all of the\nsecurities in the prior-year period were classified as trading\naccount assets. Of the securities received as resecuritization\nproceeds during the three months ended June 30, 2020 , $\n654million , $ 2.1billion and $ 1.7billion were classified as\ntrading account assets, debt securities carried at fair value\nand HTM securities, respectively. Of the securities received as\nresecuritizations proceeds during the six months ended June 30,\n2020 , $ 1.2billion , $ 2.1billion and $ 1.7billion were\nclassified as trading account assets, debt securities carried at\nfair value and HTM securities, respectively. Substantially all\nof the trading account securities and debt securities carried at\nfair value were categorized as Level 2 within the fair value\nhierarchy. Municipal Bond Trusts The Corporation administers\nmunicipal bond trusts that hold highly-rated, long-term, fixed-\nrate municipal bonds. The trusts obtain financing by issuing\nfloating-rate trust certificates that reprice on a weekly or\nother short-term basis to third-party investors. The\nCorporation\u2019s liquidity commitments to unconsolidated municipal\nbond trusts, including those for which the Corporation was\ntransferor, totaled $ 3.3billion and $ 3.7billion at June 30,\n2020 and December 31, 2019 . The weighted-average remaining life\nof bonds held in the trusts at June 30, 2020 was 7.0years .\nThere were no significant write-downs or downgrades of assets or\nissuers during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 .\nOther Variable Interest Entities The table below summarizes\nselect information related to other VIEs in which the\nCorporation held a variable interest at June 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019 .\n                                                                \n       \u2026                                \u2026                       \n       \u2026                                \u2026                       \n    \u2026  \u2026                                \u2026                       \n    \u2026  \u2026          \u2026          \u2026          \u2026                  \u2026    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n    $  \u2026       $  \u2026       $  \u2026       $  \u2026      $           \u2026    \n                                                                \n    $  \u2026       $  \u2026       $  \u2026       $  \u2026      $           \u2026    \n       \u2014          \u2026          \u2026          \u2014                  \u2026    \n       \u2026          \u2026          \u2026          \u2026                  \u2026    \n       \u2026  )       \u2026  )       \u2026  )       \u2026           )      \u2026    \n       \u2026          \u2026          \u2026          \u2026                  \u2026    \n    $  \u2026       $  \u2026       $  \u2026       $  \u2026      $           \u2026    \n                                                                \n    $  \u2026       $  \u2014       $  \u2026       $  \u2014      $           \u2014    \n       \u2026          \u2014          \u2026          \u2026                  \u2026    \n       \u2014          \u2026          \u2026          2                  \u2026    \n    $  \u2026       $  \u2026       $  \u2026       $  \u2026      $           \u2026    \n    $  \u2026       $  \u2026       $  \u2026       $  \u2026      $           \u2026    \n                                                                \nCustomer VIEs Customer VIEs include credit-linked, equity-linked\nand commodity-linked note VIEs, repackaging VIEs and asset\nacquisition VIEs, which are typically created on behalf of\ncustomers who wish to obtain market or credit exposure to a\nspecific company, index, commodity or financial instrument. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure to consolidated and\nunconsolidated customer VIEs totaled $ 2.1billion and $\n2.2billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , including\nthe notional amount of derivatives to which the Corporation is a\ncounterparty, net of losses previously recorded, and the\nCorporation\u2019s investment, if any, in securities issued by the\nVIEs. Collateralized Debt Obligation VIEs The Corporation\nreceives fees for structuring CDO VIEs, which hold diversified\npools of fixed-income securities, typically corporate debt or\nABS, which the CDO VIEs fund by issuing multiple tranches of\ndebt and equity securities. CDOs are generally managed by third-\nparty portfolio managers. The Corporation typically transfers\nassets to these CDOs, holds securities issued by the CDOs and\nmay be a derivative counterparty to the CDOs.

The\nCorporation structures the\ntrusts and holds a significant\nresidual interest. The net\ninvestment represents the\nCorporation\u2019s maximum loss\nexposure to the trusts in the\nunlikely event that the\nleveraged lease investments\nbecome worthless. Debt issued\nby the leveraged lease trusts\nis non-recourse to the\nCorporation. Tax Credit VIEs\nThe Corporation holds\ninvestments in unconsolidated\nlimited partnerships and\nsimilar entities that\nconstruct, own and operate\naffordable housing, wind and\nsolar projects.

The Corporation earns a\nreturn primarily through the\nreceipt of tax credits\nallocated to the projects. The\nmaximum loss exposure included\nin the Other VIEs table was $\n19.6billion and $ 18.9billion\nat June 30, 2020 and December\n31, 2019 . The Corporation\u2019s\nrisk of loss is generally\nmitigated by policies requiring\nthat the project qualify for\nthe expected tax credits prior\nto making its investment. The\nCorporation\u2019s investments in\naffordable housing\npartnerships, which are\nreported in other assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet,\ntotaled $ 10.3billion and $\n10.0billion , including\nunfunded commitments to provide\ncapital contributions of $\n4.6billion and $ 4.3billion at\nJune 30, 2020 and December 31,\n2019 .

For the same periods in 2019\n, the Corporation recognized\ntax credits and other tax\nbenefits of $ 291million and $\n571million and reported pretax\nlosses in other income of $\n234million and $ 482million .\nTax credits are recognized as\npart of the Corporation\u2019s\nannual effective tax rate used\nto determine tax expense in a\ngiven quarter. Accordingly, the\nportion of a year\u2019s expected\ntax benefits recognized in any\ngiven quarter may differ from\n25percent . The Corporation may\nfrom time to time be asked to\ninvest additional amounts to\nsupport a troubled affordable\nhousing project. Such\nadditional investments have not\nbeen and are not expected to be\nsignificant.\n\nNOTE 7 Goodwill and Intangible\nAssets\nGoodwill                                                        \nThe table below presents\ngoodwill balances by business\nsegment and All Other at June\n30, 2020 and December 31, 2019\n.

At June\n30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , the Corporation had commitments\nto purchase commodities, primarily liquefied natural gas, of $\n498million and $ 830million , which upon settlement will be\nincluded in trading account assets. At June 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019 , the Corporation had commitments to enter\ninto resale and forward-dated resale and securities borrowing\nagreements of $ 144.3billion and $ 97.2billion , and commitments\nto enter into forward-dated repurchase and securities lending\nagreements of $ 45.5billion and $ 24.9billion . These\ncommitments generally expire within the next 12 months. At June\n30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , the Corporation had a\ncommitment to originate or purchase up to $ 3.5billion and $\n3.3billion on a rolling 12-month basis, of auto loans and leases\nfrom a strategic partner. This commitment extends through\nNovember 2022 and can be terminated with 12months prior notice.\nOther Guarantees Bank-owned Life Insurance Book Value Protection\nThe Corporation sells products that offer book value protection\nto insurance carriers who offer group life insurance policies to\ncorporations, primarily banks. At June 30, 2020 and December 31,\n2019 , the notional amount of these guarantees totaled $\n7.1billion and $ 7.3billion . At June 30, 2020 and December 31,\n2019 , the Corporation\u2019s maximum exposure related to these\nguarantees totaled $ 1.0billion and $ 1.1billion , with\nestimated maturity dates between 2033 and 2039. Merchant\nServices In accordance with credit and debit card association\nrules, the Corporation sponsors merchant processing servicers\nthat process credit and debit card transactions on behalf of\nvarious merchants. If a merchant processor fails to meet its\nobligation regarding disputed transactions, then the Corporation\ncould be held liable. For the three and six months ended June\n30, 2020 , the sponsored entities processed $ 183.1billion and $\n386.9billion of transactions and recorded losses of $ 6million\nand $ 13million . For the same periods in 2019 , the sponsored\nentities processed $ 235.7billion and $ 441.3billion of\ntransactions and recorded losses of $ 7million and $ 11million .\nAt June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , the maximum potential\nexposure for sponsored transactions totaled $ 307.9billion and $\n384.2billion . However, the Corporation believes that the\nmaximum potential exposure is not representative of the actual\npotential loss exposure. A significant portion of the\nCorporation's merchant processing activity is performed by a\njoint venture, formed in 2009, in which the Corporation holds a\n49percent ownership interest. The carrying value of the\nCorporation\u2019s investment was $ 614million and $ 640million at\nJune 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . The\n                     \n  85Bank of America  \n                     \njoint venture is accounted for as an equity method investment\nand reported in All Other . On July 29, 2019, the Corporation\ngave notice to the joint venture partner of the termination of\nthe joint venture upon the conclusion of its current term in\nJune 2020. As a result, the Corporation incurred a non-cash,\npretax impairment charge in 2019 of $ 2.1billion , included in\nother general operating expense. Effective July 1, 2020, the\nCorporation received its share of the joint venture's merchant\ncontracts and began providing merchant services for the customer\nrelationships received. Beginning in the third quarter of 2020,\nmerchant revenue and the related noninterest expense will be\nrecorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income and are not\nexpected to be material. Representations and Warranties\nObligations and Corporate Guarantees For more information on\nrepresentations and warranties obligations and corporate\nguarantees, see Note 13 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2019\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K . The reserve for representations and\nwarranties obligations and corporate guarantees was $ 1.4billion\nand $ 1.8billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 and is\nincluded in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet and the related provision is included\nin other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The\nrepresentations and warranties reserve represents the\nCorporation\u2019s best estimate of probable incurred losses, is\nbased on our experience in previous negotiations, and is subject\nto judgment, a variety of assumptions, and known or unknown\nuncertainties. Future representations and warranties losses may\noccur in excess of the amounts recorded for these exposures;\nhowever, the Corporation does not expect such amounts to be\nmaterial to the Corporation's financial condition and liquidity.\nSee Litigation and Regulatory Matters below for the\nCorporation's combined range of possible loss in excess of the\nreserve for representations and warranties and the accrued\nliability for litigation. Fixed Income Clearing Corporation\nSponsored Member Repo Program The Corporation acts as a\nsponsoring member in a repo program whereby the Corporation\nclears certain eligible resale and repurchase agreements through\nthe Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation on behalf of clients that are sponsored members in\naccordance with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation\u2019s rules.\nAs part of this program, the Corporation guarantees the payment\nand performance of its sponsored members to the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation. The Corporation\u2019s guarantee obligation is\nsecured by a security interest in cash or high-quality\nsecurities collateral placed by clients with the clearinghouse\nand therefore, the potential for the Corporation to incur\nsignificant losses under this arrangement is remote. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum potential exposure, without taking into\nconsideration the related collateral, was $ 3.8billion and $\n9.3billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . Other\nGuarantees The Corporation has entered into additional guarantee\nagreements and commitments, including sold risk participation\nswaps, liquidity facilities, lease-end obligation agreements,\npartial credit guarantees on certain leases, real estate joint\nventure guarantees, divested business commitments and sold put\noptions that require gross settlement. The maximum potential\nfuture payments under these agreements are approximately $\n8.8billion and $ 8.7billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31,\n2019 . The estimated maturity dates of these obligations extend\nup to 2049. The Corporation has made no material payments under\nthese guarantees. For more information on maximum potential\nfuture payments under VIE-related liquidity commitments, see\nNote 6 \u2013 Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities .\nIn the normal course of business, the Corporation periodically\nguarantees the obligations of its affiliates in a variety of\ntransactions including ISDA-related transactions and non-ISDA\nrelated transactions such as commodities trading, repurchase\nagreements, prime brokerage agreements and other transactions.\nGuarantees of Certain Long-term Debt The Corporation, as the\nparent company, fully and unconditionally guarantees the\nsecurities issued by BofA Finance LLC, a 100 percent owned\nfinance subsidiary of the Corporation, and effectively provides\nfor the full and unconditional guarantee of trust securities\nissued by certain statutory trust companies that are 100percent\nowned finance subsidiaries of the Corporation. Litigation and\nRegulatory Matters The following disclosure supplements the\ndisclosure in Note 13 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2019\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K (the prior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure). In the ordinary course of business,\nthe Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in\nor parties to many pending and threatened legal, regulatory and\ngovernmental actions and proceedings. In view of the inherent\ndifficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters,\nparticularly where the claimants seek very large or\nindeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal\ntheories or involve a large number of parties, the Corporation\ngenerally cannot predict the eventual outcome of the pending\nmatters, the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters,\nor any eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending\nmatter. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the\nCorporation establishes an accrued liability when those matters\npresent loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable.\nIn such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any\namounts accrued. As a matter develops, the Corporation, in\nconjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter,\nevaluates on an ongoing basis whether such matter presents a\nloss contingency that is probable and estimable. Once the loss\ncontingency is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the\nCorporation will establish an accrued liability and record a\ncorresponding amount of litigation-related expense. The\nCorporation continues to monitor the matter for further\ndevelopments that could affect the amount of the accrued\nliability that has been previously established. Excluding\nexpenses of internal and external legal service providers,\nlitigation-related expense of $ 57million and $ 81million was\nrecognized for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020\ncompared to $ 114million and $ 187million for the same periods\nin 2019 . For a limited number of the matters disclosed in this\nNote, and in the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure,\nfor which a loss, whether in excess of a related accrued\nliability or where there is no accrued liability, is reasonably\npossible in future periods, the Corporation is able to estimate\na range of possible loss. In determining whether it is possible\nto estimate a range of possible loss, the Corporation reviews\nand evaluates these matters on an ongoing basis, in conjunction\nwith any outside counsel handling the matter, in light of\npotentially relevant factual and legal developments. With\nrespect to such matters, in cases in which the Corporation\npossesses sufficient appropriate information to estimate a range\nof possible loss, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed\nbelow. There may be other disclosed\n                     \n  Bank of America86  \n                     \nmatters for which a loss is\nprobable or reasonably possible\nbut such an estimate of the\nrange of possible loss may not\nbe possible. For those\ndisclosed matters where an\nestimate of the range of\npossible loss is possible, as\nwell as for representations and\nwarranties exposures,\nmanagement currently estimates\nthe aggregate range of\nreasonably possible loss for\nthese exposures is $ 0 to $\n1.6billion in excess of the\naccrued liability, if any. The\nestimated range of possible\nloss, as well as the\nCorporation's accrued\nliability, is based upon\ncurrently available information\nand is subject to significant\njudgment, a variety of\nassumptions and known and\nunknown uncertainties. The\nmatters underlying the\nestimated range of possible\nloss and liability accrual are\nunpredictable and will change\nfrom time to time, and actual\nlosses may vary significantly\nfrom the current estimate or\naccrual. Therefore, this\nestimated range of possible\nloss represents what the\nCorporation believes to be an\nestimate of possible loss only\nfor certain matters meeting\nthese criteria. It does not\nrepresent the Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum loss exposure.\nInformation is provided below,\nor in the prior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure\nregarding the nature of the\nlitigation and, where\nspecified, associated claimed\ndamages. Based on current\nknowledge, and taking into\naccount accrued liabilities,\nmanagement does not believe\nthat loss contingencies arising\nfrom pending matters, including\nthe matter described below, and\nin the prior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure, will\nhave a material adverse effect\non the consolidated financial\ncondition or liquidity of the\nCorporation. However, in light\nof the significant judgment,\nvariety of assumptions and\nuncertainties involved in these\nmatters, some of which are\nbeyond the Corporation\u2019s\ncontrol, and the very large or\nindeterminate damages sought in\nsome of these matters, an\nadverse outcome in one or more\nof these matters could be\nmaterial to the Corporation\u2019s\nbusinesses or results of\noperations for any particular\nreporting period, or cause\nsignificant reputational harm.\nMortgage Appraisal Litigation\nOn July 16, 2020, the District\nCourt granted final approval of\nthe settlement.

The Federal Reserve\u2019s directive regarding\nshare repurchases aligns with the Corporation's decision to\nvoluntarily suspend repurchases in the first quarter of 2020\nfrom the date of the announcement on March 15, 2020 through the\nend of the second quarter of 2020. The suspension of the\nCorporation's repurchases did not include repurchases to offset\nshares awarded under its equity-based compensation plans. During\nthe three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , the Corporation\nrepurchased and retired 12million and 212million shares of\ncommon stock in connection with the Board of Directors' (the\nBoard) 2019 repurchase authorizations, which reduced\nshareholders\u2019 equity by $ 286million and $ 6.6billion . During\nthe six months ended June 30, 2020 , in connection with employee\nstock plans, the Corporation issued 63million shares of its\ncommon stock and, to satisfy tax withholding obligations,\nrepurchased 24million shares of its common stock. At June 30,\n2020 , the Corporation had reserved 516million unissued shares\nof common stock for future issuances under employee stock plans,\nconvertible notes and preferred stock. On July 22, 2020 the\nBoard declared a quarterly common stock dividend at the existing\nrate of $ 0.18 per share. Preferred Stock During the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020 , the Corporation\ndeclared $ 469million and $ 249million of cash dividends on\npreferred stock, or a total of $ 718million for the six months\nended June 30, 2020 .

Risk Factors Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2019 (2019 Form 10-K) describes market,\ncredit, geopolitical and business operations risk factors that\ncould affect our businesses, results of operations or financial\ncondition due to, among other things, \u201cwidespread health\nemergencies or pandemics.\u201d On March 11, 2020, the World Health\nOrganization declared the outbreak of a strain of novel\ncoronavirus disease, COVID-19, a global pandemic. As conditions\nand circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic evolved\nsubsequent to our 2019 Form 10-K filing, the Corporation\ndisclosed a risk factor in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for\nthe period ended March 31, 2020 captioned \u201cCoronavirus Disease\n2019\u201d to supplement the risk factors described in its 2019 Form\n10-K. The following supplements the risk factors described in\nthe Corporation\u2019s 2019 Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form\n10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2020. Coronavirus Disease\n2019 The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant global\neconomic downturn that has adversely affected, and is expected\nto continue to adversely affect, the Corporation\u2019s businesses\nand results of operations, and the duration and future impacts\nof the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. and/or global economy and\nthe Corporation\u2019s businesses, results of operations and\nfinancial condition remain uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic has\nresulted in authorities implementing numerous measures intended\nto contain the spread and impact of COVID-19, such as travel\nbans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and\nlimitations on business activity, including closures. These\nmeasures have severely restricted economic activity, reduced\neconomic output and resulted in a deterioration in economic\nconditions, globally and in the U.S. This has resulted in, among\nother things, high rates of unemployment and underemployment and\ncaused volatility and disruptions in consumer spending and the\nglobal financial markets, including the energy and commodity\nmarkets. Although some of these restrictive measures have been\neased in certain areas, many of the restrictive measures remain\nin place or have been reinstated, and in some cases additional\nrestrictive measures are being or may need to be implemented.\nBusinesses, market participants, our counterparties and clients,\nand the U.S. and global economy have been negatively impacted\nand are likely to be so for an extended period of time, as there\nremains significant uncertainty about the timing and strength of\nan economic recovery. The negative economic conditions arising\nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted our financial\nresults during the second quarter in various respects, including\nan increase in our provision for credit losses and our\nnoninterest expenses. These negative economic conditions are\nexpected to have a continued adverse effect on our businesses\nand results of operations, which could include, but not be\nlimited to: decreased demand for and use of our products and\nservices; protracted periods of historically low interest rates;\nlower fees, including asset management fees; lower sales and\ntrading revenue due to decreased market liquidity resulting from\nheightened volatility; increased noninterest expenses, including\noperational losses, and increased credit losses due to our\ncustomers' and clients' ability to fulfill contractual\nobligations and deterioration in the financial condition of our\nconsumer and commercial borrowers, which may continue to\nincrease our provision for credit losses and net charge-offs.\nOur provision for credit losses and net charge-offs may also\ncontinue to be impacted by volatility in the energy and\ncommodity markets. Additionally, our liquidity and/or regulatory\ncapital could be adversely impacted by customers\u2019 withdrawal of\ndeposits, volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit\nmarkets, volatility in foreign exchange rates and customer draws\non lines of credit. Continued adverse macroeconomic conditions\ncaused by COVID-19 could also result in potential downgrades to\nour credit ratings, negative impacts to regulatory capital and\nliquidity and further capital preservation measures, which could\nlimit the capital we return to shareholders. If we become unable\nto successfully operate our business from remote locations\nincluding, for example, because of an internal or external\nfailure of our information technology infrastructure, we\nexperience increased rates of employee illness or\nunavailability, or governmental restrictions are placed on our\nemployees or operations, this could also have an adverse effect\non our business continuity status and result in disruption to\nour businesses. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic continues to\nadversely affect the U.S. and/or global economy and/or adversely\naffects our businesses, results of operations or financial\ncondition, it may also have the effect of increasing the\nlikelihood and/or magnitude of other risks described in the\nsection captioned \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in our 2019 Form 10-K or risks\ndescribed in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission. In response to the economic and market conditions\nresulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, governments and regulatory\nauthorities, including central banks, have acted and may take\nfurther action to provide fiscal and monetary stimuli to support\nthe global economy. However, there can be no assurance that\nthese measures will stimulate the global economy or avert\ncontinued recessionary conditions in markets or economies in\nwhich we conduct operations. Our participation in and execution\nof measures taken by governments and regulatory authorities\ncould result in reputational harm and government actions and\nproceedings, and has resulted in, and may continue to result in,\nlitigation, including class actions. Such actions may result in\njudgments, settlements, penalties, and fines adverse to the\nCorporation. We continue to closely monitor the COVID-19\npandemic and related risks as they evolve globally and in the\nU.S. The magnitude and duration of the current outbreak of\nCOVID-19, the likelihood of further outbreaks of COVID-19,\nfuture actions taken by governmental authorities and/or other\nthird parties in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and its\nfuture direct and indirect effects on the global economy and our\nbusinesses, results of operation and financial condition are\nhighly uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic may cause prolonged\nglobal or national recessionary economic conditions or longer\nlasting effects on economic conditions than currently exist,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our businesses,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\n                      \n  Bank of America104  \n                      \nItem 2.
