Investment banking fees for the\nnine-month period increased $969 million\nprimarily due to higher debt and equity\nissuance fees.\n\n\u25cf Market making and similar activities\ndecreased $1.3 billion for the nine-\nmonth period primarily driven by lower\ntrading revenue from macro products in\nFixed Income, Currencies and Commodities\n(FICC).\n\n\u25cf Other income decreased $347 million\nand $286 million primarily driven by a\ncharge of $189 million related to Visa\u2019s\nincrease in its litigation escrow\naccount. The decrease in the nine-month\nperiod was also driven by higher\npartnership losses on tax credit\ninvestments and certain negative\nvaluation adjustments, partially offset\nby lower losses on sales of available-\nfor-sale debt securities.\n                                                                                  \n  Provision for Credit Losses                                                     \n                                                                                  \nThe provision for credit losses\nincreased $308 million to $1.5 billion\nand $1.1 billion to $4.4 billion for the\nthree and nine months ended September\n30, 2024 compared to the same periods in\n2023.

Non-GAAP financial measures\nexclude certain items or otherwise\ninclude components that differ from the\nmost directly comparable measures\ncalculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-\nGAAP financial measures are provided as\nadditional useful information to assess\nour financial condition, results of\noperations (including period-to-period\noperating performance) or compliance\nwith prospective regulatory\nrequirements. These non-GAAP financial\nmeasures are not intended as a\nsubstitute for GAAP financial measures\nand may not be defined or calculated the\nsame way as non-GAAP financial measures\nused by other companies.\n\nWhen presented on a consolidated basis,\nwe view net interest income on an FTE\nbasis as a non-GAAP financial measure.\nTo derive the FTE basis, net interest\nincome is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt\nincome on an equivalent before-tax basis\nwith a corresponding increase in income\ntax expense. For purposes of this\ncalculation, we use the federal\nstatutory tax rate of 21 percent and a\nrepresentative state tax rate. Net\ninterest yield, which measures the basis\npoints we earn over the cost of funds,\nutilizes net interest income on an FTE\nbasis. We believe that presentation of\nthese items on an FTE basis allows for\ncomparison of amounts from both taxable\nand tax-exempt sources and is consistent\nwith industry practices.\n\nWe may present certain key performance\nindicators and ratios excluding certain\nitems (e.g., debit valuation adjustment\n(DVA) gains (losses)), which result in\nnon-GAAP financial measures. We believe\nthat the presentation of measures that\nexclude these items is useful because\nsuch measures provide additional\ninformation to assess the underlying\noperational performance and trends of\nour businesses and to allow better\ncomparison of period-to-period operating\nperformance.\n\nWe also evaluate our business based on\ncertain ratios that utilize tangible\nequity, a non-GAAP financial measure.\nTangible equity represents shareholders\u2019\nequity or common\n\nshareholders\u2019 equity reduced by goodwill\nand intangible assets (excluding\nmortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net\nof related deferred tax liabilities\n(\u201cadjusted\u201d shareholders\u2019 equity or\ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity). These\nmeasures are used to evaluate our use of\nequity. In addition, profitability,\nrelationship and investment models use\nboth return on average tangible common\nshareholders\u2019 equity and return on\naverage tangible shareholders\u2019 equity as\nkey measures to support our overall\ngrowth objectives. These ratios are:\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible common\nshareholders\u2019 equity measures our net\nincome applicable to common shareholders\nas a percentage of adjusted average\ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity. The\ntangible common equity ratio represents\nadjusted ending common shareholders\u2019\nequity divided by total tangible assets.\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible\nshareholders\u2019 equity measures our net\nincome as a percentage of adjusted\naverage total shareholders\u2019 equity. The\ntangible equity ratio represents\nadjusted ending shareholders\u2019 equity\ndivided by total tangible assets.\n\n\u25cf Tangible book value per common share\nrepresents adjusted ending common\nshareholders\u2019 equity divided by ending\ncommon shares outstanding.\n\nWe believe ratios utilizing tangible\nequity provide additional useful\ninformation because they present\nmeasures of those assets that can\ngenerate income. Tangible book value per\ncommon share provides additional useful\ninformation about the level of tangible\nassets in relation to outstanding shares\nof common stock.\n\nThe aforementioned supplemental data and\nperformance measures are presented in\nTable 5 on page 7.\n\nFor more information on the\nreconciliation of these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to the corresponding\nGAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP\nReconciliations on page 49.\n                                                                                  \n  Key Performance Indicators                                                      \n                                                                                  \nWe present certain key financial and\nnonfinancial performance indicators (key\nperformance indicators) that management\nuses when assessing our consolidated\nand/or segment results.

The seven key types of risk\nfaced by the Corporation are strategic,\ncredit, market, liquidity, compliance,\noperational and reputational. Sound risk\nmanagement enables us to serve our\ncustomers and deliver for our\nshareholders. If not managed well, risk\ncan result in financial loss, regulatory\nsanctions and penalties, and damage to\nour reputation, each of which may\nadversely impact our ability to execute\nour business strategies. We take a\ncomprehensive approach to risk\nmanagement with a defined Risk Framework\nand an articulated Risk Appetite\nStatement, which are approved annually\nby the Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC)\nand the Board.\n\nOur Risk Framework serves as the\nfoundation for the consistent and\neffective management of risks facing the\nCorporation. The Risk Framework sets\nforth roles and responsibilities for the\nmanagement of risk and provides a\nblueprint for how the Board, through\ndelegation of authority to committees\nand executive officers, establishes risk\nappetite and associated limits for our\nactivities.\n\nOur risk appetite provides a common\nframework that includes a set of\nmeasures to assist senior management and\nthe Board in assessing the Corporation\u2019s\nrisk profile across all risk types\nagainst our risk appetite and risk\ncapacity. Our risk appetite is formally\narticulated in the Risk Appetite\nStatement, which includes both\nqualitative statements and quantitative\nlimits.\n\nFor more information on the\nCorporation\u2019s risks, see Item 1A.

The new SCB is effective from\nOctober 1, 2024 through September 30,\n2025.\n\nIn October 2021, the Board authorized\nthe repurchase of up to $25 billion of\ncommon stock over time. This\nauthorization was modified in September\n2023 to include common stock repurchases\nto offset shares awarded under the\nCorporation\u2019s equity-based compensation\nplans when determining the remaining\nrepurchase authority. On July 24, 2024,\nthe Board authorized a $25 billion\ncommon stock repurchase program,\neffective August 1, 2024, which replaced\nthe Corporation\u2019s previous program that\nexpired on August 1, 2024.\n\nPursuant to Board authorizations, during\nthe three months ended September 30,\n2024, we repurchased $3.5 billion of\ncommon stock.

Such repurchases may be effected\nthrough open market purchases or\nprivately negotiated transactions,\nincluding repurchase plans that satisfy\nthe conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (Exchange Act).\n                                                                                  \n  Regulatory Capital                                                              \n                                                                                  \nAs a BHC, we are subject to regulatory\ncapital rules, including Basel 3, issued\nby U.S. banking regulators. The\nCorporation's depository institution\nsubsidiaries are also subject to the\nPrompt Corrective Action (PCA)\nframework. The Corporation and its\nprimary affiliated banking entity, BANA,\nare Advanced approaches institutions\nunder Basel 3 and are required to report\nregulatory risk-based capital ratios and\nrisk-weighted assets (RWA) under both\nthe Standardized and Advanced\napproaches. The lower of the capital\nratios under Standardized or Advanced\napproaches compared to their respective\nregulatory capital ratio requirements is\nused to assess capital adequacy,\nincluding under the PCA framework. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the CET1 capital,\nTier 1 capital and Total capital ratios\nunder the Standardized approach were the\nbinding ratios.\n                                                                                  \n  Minimum Capital Requirements                                                    \n                                                                                  \nIn order to avoid restrictions on\ncapital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments to executive officers,\nthe Corporation must meet risk-based\ncapital ratio requirements that include\na capital conservation buffer of 2.5\npercent (under the Advanced approaches\nonly), an SCB (under the Standardized\napproach only), plus any applicable\ncountercyclical capital buffer and a\nglobal systemically important bank\n(G-SIB) surcharge. The buffers and\nsurcharge must be comprised solely of\nCET1 capital. For the period from\nJanuary 1, 2024 through September 30,\n2024, the Corporation's minimum CET1\ncapital ratio requirements were 10.0\npercent under both the Standardized\napproach and the Advanced approaches.\n\nThe Corporation is required to calculate\nits G-SIB surcharge on an annual basis\nunder two methods and is subject to the\nhigher of the resulting two surcharges.\nMethod 1 is consistent with the approach\nprescribed by the Basel Committee\u2019s\nassessment methodology and is calculated\nusing specified indicators of systemic\nimportance. Method 2 modifies the Method\n1 approach by, among other factors,\nincluding a measure of the Corporation\u2019s\nreliance on short-term wholesale\nfunding. Effective January 1, 2024, the\nCorporation\u2019s G-SIB surcharge, which is\nhigher under Method 2, increased 50 bps,\nresulting in an increase in our minimum\nCET1 capital ratio requirement under the\nStandardized approach and the Advanced\napproaches to 10.0 percent from 9.5\npercent. At September 30, 2024, the\nCorporation\u2019s CET1 capital ratio of 11.8\npercent under the Standardized approach\nexceeded its CET1 capital ratio\nrequirement.\n                                                                                  \n  21Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nThe Corporation is also required to\nmaintain a minimum supplementary\nleverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus\na leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in\norder to avoid certain restrictions on\ncapital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments to executive officers. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, our insured\ndepository institution subsidiaries\nexceeded their requirement to maintain a\nminimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered\nwell capitalized under the PCA\nframework.\n                                                                                  \n  Capital Composition and Ratios                                                  \n                                                                                  \nTable 8 presents Bank of America\nCorporation\u2019s capital ratios and related\ninformation in accordance with Basel 3\nStandardized and Advanced approaches as\nmeasured at September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023.

sum of the CET1 capital ratio\nminimum of 4.5 percent, our G-SIB\nsurcharge of 3.0 percent at September\n30, 2024 and 2.5 percent at December 31,\n2023, and our capital conservation\nbuffer (under the

The\ncountercyclical capital buffer was zero\nfor both periods. The SLR regulatory\nminimum includes a leverage buffer of\n2.0 percent.\n\n(3) Total capital under the Advanced\napproaches differs from the Standardized\napproach due to differences in the\namount permitted in Tier 2 capital\nrelated to the qualifying allowance for\ncredit losses.\n\n(4) Reflects total average assets\nadjusted for certain Tier 1 capital\ndeductions.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, CET1 capital was\n$199.8 billion, an increase of $4.9\nbillion from December 31, 2023,\nprimarily due to earnings, partially\noffset by capital distributions. Tier 1\ncapital decreased $381 million primarily\ndriven by preferred stock redemptions,\npartially offset by the increase in CET1\ncapital. Total capital under the\nStandardized approach increased $982\nmillion primarily due to an increase in\nsubordinated debt and adjusted allowance\nfor credit losses included in Tier 2\ncapital,\n\npartially offset by the decrease in Tier\n1 capital. RWA under the Standardized\napproach, which yielded the lower CET1\ncapital ratio at September 30, 2024,\nincreased $37.5 billion during 2024 to\n$1,689 billion primarily driven by\nclient activity in Global Markets and\nlending activity in GWIM and Global\nBanking .

To achieve\nthat objective, we analyze and monitor\nour liquidity risk under expected and\nstressed conditions, maintain liquidity\nand access to diverse funding sources,\nincluding our stable deposit base, and\nseek to align liquidity-related\nincentives and risks. These liquidity\nrisk management practices have allowed\nus to effectively manage market\nfluctuations from the rising interest\nrate environment, inflationary pressures\nand changes in the macroeconomic\nenvironment.\n\nWe define liquidity as readily available\nassets, limited to cash and high-\nquality, liquid, unencumbered securities\nthat we can use to meet our contractual\nand contingent financial obligations as\nthey arise. We manage our liquidity\nposition through line of business and\nALM activities, as well as through our\nlegal entity funding strategy, on both a\nforward and current (including intraday)\nbasis under both expected and stressed\nconditions. We believe that a\ncentralized approach to funding and\nliquidity management enhances our\nability to monitor\n                                                                                  \n  25Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nliquidity requirements, maximizes access\nto funding sources, minimizes borrowing\ncosts and facilitates timely responses\nto liquidity events.

NB Holdings\nCorporation Bank of America Corporation,\nas the parent company (the Parent),\nwhich is a separate and distinct legal\nentity from our bank and nonbank\nsubsidiaries, has an intercompany\narrangement with our wholly-owned\nholding company subsidiary, NB Holdings\nCorporation (NB Holdings). We have\ntransferred, and agreed to transfer,\nadditional Parent assets not required to\nsatisfy anticipated near-term\nexpenditures to NB Holdings. The Parent\nis expected to continue to have access\nto the same flow of dividends, interest\nand other amounts of cash necessary to\nservice its debt, pay dividends and\nperform other obligations as it would\nhave had it not entered into these\narrangements and transferred any assets.\nThese arrangements support our preferred\nsingle point of entry resolution\nstrategy, under which only the Parent\nwould be resolved under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code.\n\nGlobal Liquidity Sources and Other\nUnencumbered Assets We maintain\nliquidity available to the Corporation,\nincluding the Parent and selected\nsubsidiaries, in the form of cash and\nhigh- quality, liquid, unencumbered\nsecurities.

Our bank\nsubsidiaries\u2019 liquidity is primarily\ndriven by deposit and lending activity,\nas well as securities valuation and net\ndebt activity. Bank subsidiaries can\nalso generate incremental liquidity by\npledging a range of unencumbered loans\nand securities to certain Federal Home\nLoan Banks (FHLBs) and the Federal\nReserve Discount Window. The cash we\ncould have obtained by borrowing against\nthis pool of specifically-identified\neligible assets was $334 billion and\n$312 billion at September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023.

Eligibility is defined in\nguidelines from the FHLBs and the\nFederal Reserve and is subject to change\nat their discretion. Due to regulatory\nrestrictions, liquidity generated by the\nbank subsidiaries can generally be used\nonly to fund obligations within the bank\nsubsidiaries, and transfers to the\nParent or nonbank subsidiaries may be\nsubject to prior regulatory approval.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America26                                                               \n                                                                                  \nLiquidity is also held in nonbank\nentities, including the Parent, NB\nHoldings and other regulated entities.\nThe Parent and NB Holdings liquidity is\ntypically in the form of cash deposited\nat BANA, which is excluded from the\nliquidity at bank subsidiaries, and\nhigh-quality, liquid, unencumbered\nsecurities.

However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market\nvalue, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the\nexclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated\nas the amount of a financial institution\u2019s unencumbered HQLA relative to the\nestimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period\nof significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average\nconsolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $610 billion and $590 billion for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. For both periods, the\naverage consolidated LCR was 115 percent. Our LCR fluctuates due to normal\nbusiness flows from customer activity. Liquidity Stress Analysis We utilize\nliquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of\nliquidity to maintain at the Parent and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and\ncontingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. For more information on\nliquidity stress analysis, see Liquidity Risk \u2013 Liquidity Stress Analysis in the\nMD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Net Stable Funding\nRatio The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is a liquidity requirement for large\nbanks to maintain a minimum level of stable funding over a one-year period. The\nrequirement is intended to support the ability of banks to lend to households and\nbusinesses in both normal and adverse economic conditions and is complementary to\nthe LCR, which focuses on short-term liquidity\n\nrisks. The U.S. NSFR applies to the Corporation on a consolidated basis and to our\ninsured depository institutions. At September 30, 2024, the Corporation and its\ninsured depository institutions were in compliance with the U.S. NSFR. For more\ninformation, see the Pillar 3 U.S. NSFR Disclosure report for the quarters ended\nMarch 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024 on the Corporation\u2019s website, the contents of\nwhich are not incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nDiversified Funding Sources We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits,\nand secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated\nfunding approach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and\ninvestor groups. We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through\nour deposits, which were $1.93 trillion and $1.92 trillion at September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023 . Our trading activities in other regulated entities are\nprimarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase\nagreements, and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market\nconditions. Deposits Our deposit base is well-diversified by clients, geography\nand product type across our business segments. At September 30, 2024, 49 percent\nof our deposits were in Consumer Banking , 15 percent in GWIM and 29 percent in\nGlobal Banking . We consider a substantial portion of our deposit base to be a\nstable, low-cost and consistent source of liquidity. At September 30, 2024\napproximately 68 percent of consumer and small business deposits and 80 percent of\nU.S. deposits in Global Banking were held by clients who have had accounts with us\nfor 10 or more years. In addition, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 27\npercent and 28 percent of our deposits were noninterest bearing and included\noperating accounts of our consumer and commercial clients. Deposits at September\n30, 2024 increased $6.5 billion from December 31, 2023 primarily due to higher\ncommercial deposits and time deposit growth, partially offset by consumer deposit\noutflows and customers\u2019 movement of balances to higher yielding investment\nalternatives. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, rates\npaid on deposits were 65 bps and 34 bps in Consumer Banking , 313 bps and 269 bps\nin GWIM , and 327 bps and 266 bps in Global Banking . For information on rates\npaid on consolidated deposit balances, see Table 6 on page 8. Long-term Debt\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued $41.9 billion of long-\nterm debt consisting of $12.4 billion of notes issued by Bank of America\nCorporation, substantially all of which were TLAC compliant, $13.2 billion of\nnotes issued by Bank of America, N.A. and $16.3 billion of other debt. During the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, we had total long-term debt maturities and\nredemptions in the aggregate of $50.0 billion consisting of $28.6 billion for Bank\nof America Corporation, $12.8 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $8.6 billion\nof other debt.

respectively,\nand $83.8 billion thereafter. For more\ninformation on our TLAC eligible and\ncallable outstanding notes, see\nLiquidity Risk \u2013 Diversified Funding\nSources in the MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s\n2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n(2) Represents liabilities of\nconsolidated variable interest entities\n(VIEs) included in total long-term debt\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nTotal long-term debt decreased $5.3\nbillion to $296.9 billion during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024\nprimarily due to debt maturities,\npartially offset by debt issuances and\nvaluation adjustments. We may, from time\nto time, purchase outstanding debt\ninstruments in various transactions,\ndepending on market conditions,\nliquidity and other factors. Our other\nregulated entities may also make markets\nin our debt instruments to provide\nliquidity for investors.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September\n30, 2024, we issued $21.2 billion of\nstructured notes, which are debt\nobligations that pay investors returns\nlinked to other debt or equity\nsecurities, indices, currencies or\ncommodities. These structured notes are\ntypically issued to meet client demand,\nand notes with certain attributes may\nalso be TLAC eligible. We typically\nhedge the returns we are obligated to\npay on these liabilities with\nderivatives and/or investments in the\nunderlying instruments, so that from a\nfunding perspective, the cost is similar\nto our other unsecured long-term debt.\nWe could be required to settle certain\nstructured note obligations for cash or\nother securities prior to maturity under\ncertain circumstances, which we consider\nfor liquidity planning purposes. We\nbelieve, however, that a portion of such\nborrowings will remain outstanding\nbeyond the earliest put or redemption\ndate.\n\nSubstantially all of our senior and\nsubordinated debt obligations contain no\nprovisions that could trigger a\nrequirement for an early repayment,\nrequire additional collateral support,\nresult in changes to terms, accelerate\nmaturity or create additional financial\nobligations upon an adverse change in\nour credit ratings, financial ratios,\nearnings, cash flows or stock price.

Risk Factors of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September\n30, 2024, our net charge-off ratio\nincreased primarily driven by credit\ncard loans and the commercial real\nestate office portfolio. Commercial\n\nreservable criticized exposure increased\ncompared to December 31, 2023 driven by\nan increase across a broad range of\nindustries. Nonperforming loans also\nincreased compared to December 31, 2023\nprimarily driven by commercial real\nestate. Uncertainty remains regarding\nbroader economic impacts as a result of\nhigher costs associated with\ninflationary pressures experienced over\nthe past several years, elevated rates\nas well as the current geopolitical\nenvironment, and could lead to adverse\nimpacts to credit quality metrics in\nfuture periods.\n                                                                                  \n   Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management                                      \n                                                                                  \nCredit risk management for the consumer\nportfolio begins with initial\nunderwriting and continues throughout a\nborrower\u2019s credit cycle. Statistical\ntechniques in conjunction with\nexperiential judgment are used in all\naspects of portfolio management\nincluding underwriting, product pricing,\nrisk appetite, setting credit limits,\nand establishing operating processes and\nmetrics to quantify and balance risks\nand returns. Statistical models are\nbuilt using detailed behavioral\ninformation from external sources, such\nas credit bureaus, and/or internal\nhistorical experience and are a\ncomponent of our consumer credit risk\nmanagement process. These models are\nused in part to assist in making both\nnew and ongoing credit decisions as well\nas portfolio management strategies,\nincluding authorizations and line\nmanagement, collection practices and\nstrategies, and determination of the\nallowance for loan and lease losses and\nallocated capital for credit risk.\n                                                                                  \n  Consumer Credit Portfolio                                                       \n                                                                                  \nDuring the nine months ended September\n30, 2024, the U.S. unemployment rate\nremained relatively stable and home\nprices continued to rise. During the\nthree and nine months ended September\n30, 2024, net charge-offs increased $240\nmillion and $954 million to $1.0 billion\nand $3.1 billion compared to the same\nperiods in 2023, primarily due to higher\ncredit card loan charge-offs.\n\nThe consumer allowance for loan and\nlease losses was $8.6 billion,\nrelatively unchanged from December 31,\n2023.

Of\nthe nonperforming residential mortgage\nloans at September 30, 2024, $1.3\nbillion, or 62 percent, were current on\ncontractual payments. Loans accruing\npast due 30 days or more of $979 million\nalso remained relatively unchanged.\n\nOf the $217.5 billion in total\nresidential mortgage loans outstanding\nat September 30, 2024, $63.5 billion, or\n29 percent, of loans were originated as\ninterest-only. The outstanding balance\nof interest-only residential mortgage\nloans that had entered the amortization\nperiod was $3.5 billion, or six percent,\nat September 30, 2024. Residential\nmortgage loans that have entered the\namortization period generally experience\na higher rate of early stage\ndelinquencies and nonperforming status\ncompared to the residential mortgage\nportfolio as a whole. At September 30,\n2024, $45 million, or one percent, of\noutstanding interest-only residential\nmortgages that had entered the\namortization period were accruing past\ndue 30 days or more compared to $979\nmillion, or less than one percent, for\nthe\n\nentire residential mortgage portfolio.\nIn addition, at September 30, 2024, $218\nmillion, or six percent, of outstanding\ninterest-only residential mortgage loans\nthat had entered the amortization period\nwere nonperforming, of which $74 million\nwere contractually current. Loans that\nhave yet to enter the amortization\nperiod in our interest-only residential\nmortgage portfolio are primarily well-\ncollateralized loans to our wealth\nmanagement clients and have an interest-\nonly period of three years to 10 years.\nSubstantially all of these loans that\nhave yet to enter the amortization\nperiod will not be required to make a\nfully-amortizing payment until 2026 or\nlater.\n\nTable 20 presents outstandings,\nnonperforming loans and net charge-offs\nby certain state concentrations for the\nresidential mortgage portfolio.

Of the\nnonperforming home equity loans at\nSeptember 30, 2024, $253 million, or 61\npercent, were current on contractual\npayments. In addition, $90 million, or\n22 percent, were 180 days or more past\ndue and had been written down to the\nestimated fair value of the collateral,\nless costs to sell. Accruing loans that\nwere 30 days or more past d ue remained\nrelatively unchanged d uring the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024.\n\nOf the $25.5 billion in total home\nequity portfolio outstandings at\nSeptember 30, 2024, as shown in Table\n21, nine percent require interest-only\npayments. The outstanding balance of\nHELOCs that had reached the end of their\ndraw period and entered the amortization\nperiod was $3.5 billion at September 30,\n2024. The HELOCs that have entered the\namortization period have experienced a\nhigher percentage of early stage\ndelinquencies and nonperforming status\nwhen compared to the HELOC portfolio as\na whole. At September 30, 2024, $30\nmillion, or one percent, of outstanding\nHELOCs that\n\nhad entered the amortization period were\naccruing past due 30 days or more. In\naddition, at September 30, 2024, $253\nmillion, or seven percent, were\nnonperforming.\n\nFor our interest-only HELOC portfolio,\nwe do not actively track how many of our\nhome equity customers pay only the\nminimum amount due on their home equity\nloans and lines; however, we can infer\nsome of this information through a\nreview of our HELOC portfolio that we\nservice and is still in its revolving\nperiod. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, 30 percent of these\ncustomers with an outstanding balance\ndid not pay any principal on their\nHELOCs.\n\nTable 22 presents outstandings,\nnonperforming balances and net\nrecoveries by certain state\nconcentrations for the home equity\nportfolio.

 \nCommercial credit risk is evaluated and\nmanaged with the goal that\nconcentrations of credit exposure\ncontinue to be aligned with our risk\nappetite. We review, measure and manage\nconcentrations of credit exposure by\nindustry, product, geography, customer\nrelationship and loan size. We also\nreview, measure and manage commercial\nreal estate loans by geographic location\nand property type. In addition, within\nour non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate\nexposures by region and by country.\nTables 30, 32 and 35 summarize our\nconcentrations. We also utilize\nsyndications of exposure to third\nparties, loan sales, hedging and other\nrisk mitigation techniques to manage the\nsize and risk profile of the commercial\ncredit portfolio. For more information\non our industry concentrations, see\nTable 32 and Commercial Portfolio Credit\nRisk Management \u2013 Industry\nConcentrations on page 38.\n\nFor more information on our accounting\npolicies regarding delinquencies,\nnonperforming status, net charge-offs\nand loan modifications for the\ncommercial portfolio, see Note 1 \u2013\nSummary of Significant Accounting\nPrinciples to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements of the Corporation\u2019s 2023\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K and Note 5 \u2013\nOutstanding Loans and Leases and\nAllowance for Credit Losses to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\n                                                                                  \n  Commercial Credit Portfolio                                                     \n                                                                                  \nOutstanding commercial loans and leases\nincreased $21.8 billion during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 due to\ngrowth in U.S. commercial, primarily in\nGlobal Banking and Global Markets.\nDuring the nine months ended September\n30, 2024, commercial credit quality\ndeteriorated as reservable criticized\nutilized exposure increased across a\nbroad range of industries, and\nnonperforming commercial loans increased\nprimarily driven by commercial real\nestate. Commercial net charge-offs\nincreased $363 million and $1.0 billion\nto $490 million and $1.4 billion during\nthe three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to the same\nperiods in 2023 primarily due to higher\nlosses in the commercial real estate\noffice portfolio and U.S. commercial\nportfolio.\n\nWith the exception of the office\nproperty type, which is further\ndiscussed in the Commercial Real Estate\nsection herein, credit quality of\ncommercial real estate borrowers has\nremained relatively stable since\nDecember 31, 2023; however, we are\nclosely monitoring emerging trends and\nborrower performance in a higher\ninterest rate environment. Recent demand\nfor office space continues to be\nstagnant, and future demand for office\nspace continues to be uncertain as\ncompanies evaluate space needs with\nemployment models that utilize a mix of\nremote and conventional office use.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America34                                                               \n                                                                                  \nThe commercial allowance for loan and\nlease losses decreased $164 million\nduring the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 to $4.7 billion. For more\ninformation, see Allowance for Credit\nLosses on page 41.\n\nTotal commercial utilized credit\nexposure increased $20.7 billion during\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024\nto $717.0 billion primarily driven by\nincreased loans and leases, partially\noffset by lower derivative assets. The\nutilization rate for loans and leases,\nstandby letters of credit (SBLCs) and\nfinancial guarantees, and commercial\nletters of credit, in the aggregate, was\n55 percent at both September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023.\n\nTable 26 presents commercial credit\nexposure by type for utilized, unfunded\nand total binding committed credit\nexposure.

Nonperforming loans do not include\nloans accounted for under the fair value\noption.

Commercial nonperforming loans\nwere carried at 81 percent of their\nunpaid principal balance, as the\ncarrying value of these loans has been\nreduced to the estimated collateral\nvalue less costs to

participated) to other financial\ninstitutions. The distributed amounts were $10.3 billion at both September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\n(3) Industries are viewed from a variety of perspectives to best isolate the\nperceived risks. For purposes of this table, the real estate industry is defined\nbased on the primary business activity of the borrowers or counterparties using\noperating cash flows and primary source of repayment as key factors.\nRisk Mitigation We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well\nas the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of\nobtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within\nan industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. At September\n30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, net notional credit default protection purchased\nin our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for\nwhich we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures,\nwas $11.1 billion and $10.9 billion. We recorded net losses of $42 million and $58\nmillion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net\nlosses of $23 million and $134 million for the same periods in 2023.

A risk\nmanagement framework is in place to\nmeasure, monitor and manage non-U.S.\nrisk and exposures. In addition to the\ndirect risk of doing business in a\ncountry, we also are exposed to indirect\ncountry risks (e.g., related to the\ncollateral received on secured financing\ntransactions or related to client\nclearing activities). These indirect\nexposures are managed in the normal\n\ncourse of business through credit,\nmarket and operational risk governance\nrather than through country risk\ngovernance.

Risk Factors of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in\nmarket conditions may adversely impact\nthe value of assets or liabilities, or\notherwise negatively impact earnings.\nThis risk is inherent in the financial\ninstruments associated with our\noperations, primarily within our Global\nMarkets segment. We are also exposed to\nthese risks in other areas of the\nCorporation (e.g., our ALM activities).\nIn the event of market stress, these\nrisks could have a material impact on\nour results.\n                                                                                  \n   Trading Risk Management                                                        \n                                                                                  \nTo evaluate risks in our trading\nactivities, we focus on the actual and\npotential volatility of revenues\ngenerated by individual positions as\nwell as portfolios of positions. VaR is\na common statistic used to measure\nmarket risk. Our primary VaR statistic\nis equivalent to a 99 percent confidence\nlevel, which means that for a VaR with a\none-day holding period, there should not\nbe losses in excess of VaR, on average,\n99 out of 100 trading days.\n\nTable 38 presents the total market-based\nportfolio VaR, which is the combination\nof the total covered positions (and less\nliquid trading positions) portfolio and\nthe fair value option portfolio. For\nmore information on the market risk VaR\nfor trading activities, see Trading Risk\nManagement in the MD&A of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n\nThe total market-based portfolio VaR\nresults in Table 38 include market risk\nto which we are exposed from all\nbusiness segments, excluding credit\nvaluation adjustment (CVA), DVA and\nrelated hedges. The majority of this\nportfolio is within the Global Markets\nsegment.\n\nTable 38 presents period-end, average,\nhigh and low daily trading VaR for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024,\nJune 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023\nusing a 99 percent confidence level. The\namounts disclosed in Table 38 and Table\n39 align to the view of covered\npositions used in the Basel 3 capital\ncalculations. Foreign exchange and\ncommodity positions are always\nconsidered covered positions, regardless\nof trading or banking treatment for the\ntrade, except for structural foreign\ncurrency positions that are excluded\nwith prior regulatory approval.\n\nThe average of total covered positions\nand less liquid trading positions\nportfolio VaR decreased for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 compared\nto the prior quarter due to a reduction\nin interest rate risk.\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n(1) The high and low for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading\ndays than the high and low for the components.

sensitive to a\nparallel upward move in interest rates,\nwith the majority of that impact coming\nfrom the short end of the yield curve.\nAdditionally, higher interest rates\nnegatively impact the fair value of our\ndebt securities classified as available\nfor sale and adversely affect\naccumulated OCI and thus capital levels\nunder the Basel 3 capital rules. Under\ninstantaneous upward parallel shifts,\nthe near-term adverse impact to Basel 3\ncapital would be reduced over time by\noffsetting positive impacts to net\ninterest income generated from banking\nbook activities. For more information on\nBasel 3, see Capital Management \u2013\nRegulatory Capital on page 21.\n\nAs part of our ALM activities, we use\nsecurities, certain residential\nmortgages, and interest rate and foreign\nexchange derivatives in managing\ninterest rate sensitivity. The\nsensitivity analysis in Table 41 assumes\nthat we take no action in response to\nthese rate shocks and does not assume\nany change in other macroeconomic\nvariables normally correlated with\nchanges in interest rates. Beginning in\nthe second quarter of 2024, the\nsensitivity analysis incorporates\npotential movements in customer behavior\nthat could result in changes in both\ntotal customer deposit balances and\ndeposit balance mix, (e.g., interest\nbearing versus noninterest bearing),\nunder the various interest rate\nscenarios. In higher rate scenarios, the\nanalysis assumes that a portion of low-\ncost or noninterest-bearing deposits are\nreplaced with higher yielding deposits\nor market-based funding. Conversely, in\nlower rate scenarios, the analysis\nassumes that a portion of higher\nyielding deposits or market-based\nfunding are replaced with low-cost or\nnoninterest-bearing deposits.\n\nFor larger interest rate scenarios, the\ninterest rate sensitivity may behave in\na non-linear manner as there are\nnumerous estimates and assumptions,\nwhich require a high degree of judgment\nand are often interrelated, that could\nimpact the outcome. Pertaining to the\nmortgage-backed securities and\nresidential mortgage portfolio, if long-\nend interest rates were to significantly\ndecrease over the next twelve months,\nfor example over 200 bps, there would\ngenerally be an increase in customer\nprepayment behaviors with an incremental\nreduction to net interest income, noting\nthat the extent of changes in customer\nprepayment activity can be impacted by\nmultiple factors and is not necessarily\nlimited to long-end interest rates.\nConversely, if long-end interest rates\nwere to significantly increase over the\nnext twelve months, for example, over\n200 bps, customer prepayments would\nlikely modestly decrease and result in\nan incremental increase to net interest\nincome. In addition, deposit pricing is\nrate sensitive in nature. This\nsensitivity is assumed to have non-\nlinear impacts to larger short-end rate\nmovements. In decreasing interest rate\nscenarios, and particularly where\ninterest rates have decreased to small\namounts, the ability to further reduce\nrates paid is reduced as customer rates\nnear zero. In higher short-end rate\nscenarios, deposit pricing will likely\nincrease at a faster rate, leading to\nincremental interest expense and\nreducing asset sensitivity. While the\nimpact related to the above assumptions\nused in the asset sensitivity analysis\ncan provide directional analysis on how\nnet interest income will be impacted in\nchanging environments, the ultimate\nimpact is dependent upon the\ninterrelationship of the assumptions and\nfactors, which vary in different\nmacroeconomic scenarios.\n                                                                                  \n  Economic Value of Equity                                                        \n                                                                                  \nIn addition to interest rate sensitivity\ndescribed above, the Corporation\u2019s\nmanagement of its interest rate\nexposures in the banking book also\nconsiders a long-term view of interest\nrate sensitivity through the measurement\nof Economic Value of Equity (EVE). EVE\ncaptures changes in the net present\nvalue of banking book assets and\nliabilities under various interest rate\nscenarios and its impact to Tier 1\ncapital. Similar to net interest income,\nthe Corporation establishes limits for\nEVE. EVE is largely driven by the\nCorporation\u2019s longer duration fixed-rate\nproducts, such as investment securities,\nresidential mortgages and deposits. For\nassets or liabilities that have no\nstated maturity, such as deposits, the\nCorporation estimates the duration for\nmeasurement purposes.\n\nInterest Rate and Foreign Exchange\nDerivative Contracts\n\nWe use interest rate and foreign\nexchange derivative contracts in our ALM\nactivities to manage our interest rate\nand foreign exchange risks.\nSpecifically, we use those derivatives\nto manage both the variability in cash\nflows and changes in fair value of\nvarious assets and liabilities arising\nfrom those risks. Our interest rate\nderivative contracts are generally non-\nleveraged swaps tied to various\nbenchmark interest rates and foreign\nexchange basis swaps, options, futures\nand forwards, and our foreign exchange\ncontracts include cross-currency\ninterest rate swaps, foreign currency\nfutures contracts, foreign currency\nforward contracts and options.\n\nThe derivatives used in our ALM\nactivities can be split into two broad\ncategories: designated accounting hedges\nand other risk management derivatives.\nDesignated accounting hedges are\nprimarily used to manage our exposure to\ninterest rates as described in the\nInterest Rate Risk Management for the\nBanking Book section and are included in\nthe sensitivities presented in Table 41.\nThe Corporation also uses foreign\ncurrency derivatives in accounting\nhedges to manage substantially all of\nthe foreign exchange risk of our foreign\noperations. By hedging the foreign\nexchange risk of our foreign operations,\nthe Corporation's market risk exposure\nin this area is not significant.\n\nRisk management derivatives are\npredominantly used to hedge foreign\nexchange risks related to various\nforeign currency-denominated assets and\nliabilities and eliminate substantially\nall foreign currency exposures in the\ncash flows of the Corporation\u2019s non-\ntrading foreign currency-denominated\nfinancial instruments. These foreign\nexchange derivatives are sensitive to\nother market risk exposures such as\ncross-currency basis spreads and\ninterest rate risk. However, as these\nfeatures are not a significant component\nof these foreign exchange derivatives,\nthe market risk related to this exposure\nis not significant. For more information\non the accounting for derivatives, see\nNote 3 \u2013 Derivatives to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America46                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Mortgage Banking Risk Management                                                \n                                                                                  \nWe originate, fund and service mortgage\nloans, which subject us to credit,\nliquidity and interest rate risks, among\nothers. We determine whether loans will\nbe held for investment or held for sale\nat the time of commitment and manage\ncredit and liquidity risks by selling or\nsecuritizing a portion of the loans we\noriginate.\n\nChanges in interest rates impact the\nvalue of interest rate lock commitments\n(IRLCs) and the related residential\nfirst mortgage loans held-for-sale\n(LHFS), as well as the value of the\nMSRs. Because the interest rate risks of\nthese hedged items offset, we combine\nthem into one overall hedged item with\none combined economic hedge portfolio\nconsisting of derivative contracts and\nsecurities.

Climate-related\nrisks are divided into two major\ncategories, both of which span across\nthe seven key risk types discussed in\nthe Managing Risk section in the MD&A of\nthe Corporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K: (1) Physical Risk: risks\nrelated to the physical impacts of\nclimate change, driven by extreme\nweather events such as hurricanes and\nfloods, as well as chronic longer-term\nshifts such as rising average global\ntemperatures and sea levels, and (2)\nTransition Risk: risks related to the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy,\nwhich may entail extensive policy,\nlegal, technology and market changes.\n\nPhysical risks of climate change, such\nas more frequent and severe extreme\nweather events, can increase the\nCorporation\u2019s risks, including credit\nrisk by diminishing borrowers\u2019 repayment\ncapacity or collateral values, and\noperational risk by negatively impacting\nthe Corporation\u2019s facilities, employees,\nor vendors. Transition risks of climate\nchange may amplify credit risks through\nthe financial impacts of changes in\npolicy, technology or the market on the\nCorporation or our counterparties.\nUnanticipated market changes can lead to\nsudden price adjustments and give rise\nto heightened market risk.\n\nReputational risk can arise if we do not\nmeet our climate-related goals, or are\nperceived to be inadequately responsive\nto climate change.\n\nOur approach to managing climate risk is\nconsistent with our risk management\ngovernance structure, from senior\nmanagement to our Board and its\ncommittees, including the ERC and the\nCorporate Governance, ESG and\nSustainability Committee (CGESC) of the\nBoard, which regularly discuss climate-\nrelated topics. The ERC oversees climate\nrisk as set forth in our Risk Framework\nand Risk Appetite Statement. The CGESC\nis responsible for overseeing the\nCorporation\u2019s environmental and\nsustainability-related activities and\npractices, and regularly reviews the\nCorporation\u2019s climate-related policies\nand practices. Our Climate Risk Council\nconsists of leaders across risk, Front\nLine Unit and control functions, and\nmeets routinely to discuss our approach\nto managing climate-related risks.\n\nOur climate risk management efforts are\noverseen by an officer who reports to\nthe Chief Risk Officer. The Corporation\nhas a Climate and Environmental Risk\nManagement function that is responsible\nfor overseeing climate risk management.\nThey are responsible for establishing\nthe Climate Risk Framework (described\nbelow) and governance structure, and\nproviding an independent assessment of\nenterprise-wide climate risks.\n\nBased on the Corporation\u2019s Risk\nFramework, in 2023 we created our\ninternal Climate Risk Framework, which\naddresses how the Corporation\nidentifies, measures, monitors and\ncontrols climate risk by enhancing\nexisting risk management processes and\nalso includes examples of how climate\nrisk manifests across the seven risk\ntypes. The framework details the roles\nand responsibilities for climate risk\nmanagement across our three lines of\ndefense (i.e., Front Line Units, Global\nRisk Management and Corporate Audit).\n\nFor more information on our governance\nframework, see the Managing Risk section\nin the MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2023\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.

of Significant Accounting\nPrinciples\n\nBank of America Corporation, a bank\nholding company and a financial holding\ncompany, provides a diverse range of\nfinancial services and products\nthroughout the U.S. and in certain\ninternational markets. The term \u201cthe\nCorporation\u201d as used herein may refer to\nBank of America Corporation,\nindividually, Bank of America\nCorporation and its subsidiaries, or\ncertain of Bank of America Corporation\u2019s\nsubsidiaries or affiliates. Principles\nof Consolidation and Basis of\nPresentation The Consolidated Financial\nStatements include the accounts of the\nCorporation and its majority-owned\nsubsidiaries and those variable interest\nentities (VIEs) where the Corporation is\nthe primary beneficiary. Intercompany\naccounts and transactions have been\neliminated. Results of operations of\nacquired companies are included from the\ndates of acquisition, and for VIEs, from\nthe dates that the Corporation became\nthe primary beneficiary. Assets held in\nan agency or fiduciary capacity are not\nincluded in the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. The Corporation accounts for\ninvestments in companies for which it\nowns a voting interest and for which it\nhas the ability to exercise\n\nsignificant influence over operating and\nfinancing decisions using the equity\nmethod of accounting. These investments,\nwhich include the Corporation\u2019s\ninterests in affordable housing and\nrenewable energy partnerships, are\nrecorded in other assets. Equity method\ninvestments are subject to impairment\ntesting, and the Corporation\u2019s\nproportionate share of income or loss is\nincluded in other income. The\npreparation of the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America requires\nmanagement to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect reported amounts\nand disclosures. Actual results could\nmaterially differ from those estimates\nand assumptions. These unaudited\nConsolidated Financial Statements should\nbe read in conjunction with the audited\nConsolidated Financial Statements, and\nrelated notes thereto, of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. The nature of the Corporation\u2019s\nbusiness is such that the results of any\ninterim period are not necessarily\nindicative of results for a full year.\nIn the opinion of management, all\nadjustments, which consist of normal\nrecurring adjustments necessary for a\nfair statement of the interim period\nresults, have been made. The Corporation\nevaluates subsequent events through the\ndate of filing with the Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC).\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America54                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  NOTE 2 Net Interest Income and Noninterest Income                               \n                                                                                  \nThe table below presents the Corporation\u2019s net interest income and noninterest\nincome disaggregated by revenue source for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023.

If an open hedge is de-designated prior to the derivative\u2019s maturity,\nany cumulative fair value adjustments at the de-designation date are then\namortized or accreted into earnings over the remaining life of the hedged assets\nor liabilities.\n                                                                                  \n  Designat\u2026                                                                       \n  Fair                                                                            \n  Value                                                                           \n  Hedged                                                                          \n  Assets                                                                          \n  and              September                          December                    \n  Liabilit\u2026         30, 2024                          31, 2023                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (Dollars          Carrying       Cumulative         Carrying        Cumulative  \n  in                   Value       Fair Value            Value        Fair Value  \n  millions)                        Adjustmen\u2026                        Adjustment\u2026  \n  Long-term    $     122,287    $      -2,195    $     203,986    $       -5,767  \n  debt                                                                            \n  Availabl\u2026                                                                       \n  debt               232,010            1,720          134,077            -1,793  \n  securiti\u2026                                                                       \n  3)                                                                              \n  Trading                                                                         \n  account              3,792              288            7,475               414  \n  assets(4)                                                                       \n                                                                                  \n(1) Increase (decrease) to carrying value.\n(2) These amounts include the amortized cost of the financial assets in closed\nportfolios used to designate hedging relationships in which the hedged item is a\nstated layer that is expected to be remaining at the end of the hedging\nrelationship (i.e. portfolio layer hedging relationship). At September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023, the amortized cost of the closed portfolios used in these\nhedging relationships was $ 36.5billion and $ 39.1billion, of which $ 23.8billion\nand $ 22.5billion were designated in a portfolio layer hedging relationship. At\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the cumulative adjustment associated\nwith these hedging relationships was an increase of $ 387million and $ 48million.\n(3) Carrying value represents amortized cost.\n(4) Represents hedging activities related to certain commodities inventory.\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value adjustments from de-\ndesignated long-term debt hedges decreased the long-term debt carrying value by $\n10.9billion and $ 10.5billion. The fair value adjustments from de-designated\navailable-for-sale (AFS) debt securities hedges decreased the AFS debt securities\ncarrying value by $ 4.7billion and $ 5.6billion. The fair value adjustments are\nbeing amortized or accreted into interest over the contractual lives of the assets\nor liabilities, along with any premiums or discounts. Cash Flow and Net Investment\nHedges The following table summarizes certain information related to cash flow\nhedges and net investment hedges for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023. Of the $ 4.9billion after-tax net loss ($ 6.6billion pretax) on\nderivatives in accumulated OCI at September 30, 2024, losses of $ 2.4billion\nafter-tax ($ 3.1billion pretax) related to both open and closed cash flow hedges\nare expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months. These net\nlosses reclassified into earnings are expected to primarily decrease net interest\nincome related to the respective hedged items. For open cash flow hedges, the\nmaximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is\napproximately six years. For terminated cash flow hedges, the time period over\nwhich the forecasted transactions will be recognized in interest income is\napproximately five years, with the aggregated amount beyond this time period being\ninsignificant.\n                                                                                  \n  59Bank of America                                                               \n

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the\nCorporation had transferred $ 3.9billion and $ 4.1billion of non-U.S. government-\nguaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to a third-party trust and retained\neconomic exposure to the transferred assets through derivative contracts. In\nconnection with these transfers, the Corporation received gross cash proceeds of $\n4.0billion and $ 4.2billion at the transfer dates. At September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, the fair value of the transferred securities was $ 3.9billion\nand $ 4.1billion. Sales and Trading Revenue The Corporation enters into trading\nderivatives to facilitate client transactions and to manage risk exposures arising\nfrom trading account assets and liabilities. It is the Corporation\u2019s policy to\ninclude these derivative instruments in its trading activities, which include\nderivatives and non-derivative cash instruments. The resulting risk from these\nderivatives is managed on a portfolio basis as part of the Corporation\u2019s Global\nMarkets business segment. For more information on sales and trading revenue, see\nNote 3 \u2013 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s\n2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following table, which includes both\nderivatives and non-derivative cash instruments, identifies the amounts in the\nrespective income statement line items attributable to the Corporation\u2019s sales and\ntrading revenue in Global Markets , categorized by primary risk, for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

However, the Corporation does not monitor its exposure to\ncredit derivatives based solely on the notional amount because this measure does\nnot take into consideration the probability of occurrence. As such, the notional\namount is not a reliable indicator of the Corporation\u2019s exposure to these\ncontracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to define risk tolerances and\nestablish limits so that certain credit risk-related losses occur within\nacceptable, predefined limits. Credit-related notes in the table above include\ninvestments in securities issued by collateralized debt obligation (CDO),\ncollateralized loan obligation (CLO) and credit-linked note vehicles. These\ninstruments are primarily classified as trading securities. The carrying value of\nthese instruments equals the Corporation\u2019s maximum exposure to loss. The\nCorporation is not obligated to make any payments to the entities under the terms\nof the securities owned. Credit-related Contingent Features and Collateral Certain\nof the Corporation\u2019s derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent\nfeatures, primarily in the form of ISDA master netting agreements and credit\nsupport documentation that enhance the creditworthiness of these instruments\ncompared to other obligations of the respective counterparty with whom the\nCorporation has transacted. These contingent features may be for the benefit of\nthe Corporation as well as its\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America62                                                               \n                                                                                  \ncounterparties with respect to changes in the Corporation\u2019s creditworthiness and\nthe mark-to-market exposure under the derivative transactions. At September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, the Corporation held cash and securities collateral of\n$ 106.5billion and $ 104.1billion and posted cash and securities collateral of $\n95.6billion and $ 93.4billion in the normal course of business under derivative\nagreements, excluding cross-product margining agreements where clients are\npermitted to margin on a net basis for both derivative and secured financing\narrangements. In connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other\ntrading agreements, the Corporation can be required to provide additional\ncollateral or to terminate transactions with certain counterparties in the event\nof a downgrade of the senior debt ratings of the Corporation or certain\nsubsidiaries. The amount of additional collateral required depends on the contract\nand is usually a fixed incremental amount and/or the market value of the exposure.\nFor more information on credit-related contingent features and collateral, see\nNote 3 \u2013 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s\n2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. At September 30, 2024, the amount of collateral,\ncalculated based on the terms of the contracts, that the Corporation and certain\nsubsidiaries could be required to post to counterparties but had not yet posted to\ncounterparties was $ 3.8billion, including $ 2.0billion for Bank of America,\nNational Association (BANA). Some counterparties are currently able to\nunilaterally terminate certain contracts, or the Corporation or certain\nsubsidiaries may be required to take other action such as find a suitable\nreplacement or obtain a guarantee.

For more information on the\nportfolio segments, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K . Within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment, the primary credit\nquality indicators are refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) and refreshed Fair Isaac\nCorporation (FICO) score. Refreshed LTV measures the carrying value of the loan as\na percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly.\nHome equity loans are evaluated using combined loan-to-value (CLTV), which\nmeasures the carrying value of the Corporation\u2019s loan and available line of credit\ncombined with any outstanding senior liens against the property as a percentage of\nthe value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. FICO score\nmeasures the creditworthiness of the borrower based on the financial obligations\nof the borrower and the borrower\u2019s credit history. FICO scores are typically\nrefreshed quarterly or more frequently. Certain borrowers (e.g., borrowers that\nhave had debts discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding) may not have their FICO\nscores updated. FICO scores are also a primary credit quality indicator for the\nCredit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment and the business card portfolio\nwithin U.S. small business commercial. Within the Commercial portfolio segment,\nloans are evaluated using the internal classifications of pass rated or reservable\ncriticized as the primary credit quality indicators. The term reservable\ncriticized refers to those commercial loans that are internally classified or\nlisted by the Corporation as Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful, which are\nasset quality categories defined by regulatory authorities. These assets have an\nelevated level of risk and may have a high probability of default or total loss.\nPass rated refers to all loans not considered reservable criticized. In addition\nto these primary credit quality indicators, the Corporation uses other credit\nquality indicators for certain types of loans. The following tables present\ncertain credit quality indicators and gross charge-offs for the Corporation's\nConsumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio\nsegments by year of origination, except for revolving loans and revolving loans\nthat were modified into term loans, which are shown on an aggregate basis at\nSeptember 30, 2024.\n

Effective January 1, 2023, the\nCorporation adopted the new accounting standard on loan modifications.\nAccordingly, September 30, 2024 balances presented in payment status tables\nrepresent loans that were modified over the last 12 months, and September 30, 2023\nbalances presented in payment status tables represent loans that were modified\nduring the first nine months of 2023. Consumer Real Estate The following\nmodification programs are offered for consumer real estate loans to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulties. Forbearance and Other Payment Plans:\nForbearance plans generally consist of the Corporation suspending the borrower\u2019s\npayments for a defined period, with those payments then due over a defined period\nof time or at the conclusion of the forbearance period. The aging status of a loan\nis generally\n\nfrozen when it enters into a forbearance plan. If a borrower is unable to fulfill\ntheir obligations under the forbearance plans, they may be offered a trial offer\nor permanent modification. Trial Offer and Permanent Modifications : Trial offer\nfor modification plans generally consist of the Corporation offering a borrower\nmodified loan terms that reduce their contractual payments temporarily over a\nthree-to- four-monthtrial period. If the customer successfully makes the modified\npayments during the trial period and formally accepts the modified terms, the\nmodified loan terms become permanent. Some borrowers may enter into permanent\nmodifications without a trial period. In a permanent modification, the borrower\u2019s\npayment terms are typically modified in more than one manner, but generally\ninclude a term extension and an interest rate reduction. At times, the permanent\nmodification may also include principal forgiveness and/or a deferral of past due\nprincipal and interest amounts to the end of the loan term. The combinations\nutilized are based on modifying the terms that give the borrower an improved\nability to meet the contractual obligations. The term extensions granted for\nresidential mortgage and home equity permanent modifications vary widely and can\nbe up to 30years, but most are in the range of 1to 20years. Principal forgiveness\nand payment deferrals were insignificant during the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023. The table below provides the ending amortized cost of\nthe Corporation\u2019s modified consumer real estate loans for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n

The carrying value of consumer real\nestate loans, including fully-insured loans, for which formal foreclosure\nproceedings were in process at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was $\n482million and $ 633million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, the Corporation reclassified $ 73million and $ 86million of consumer real\nestate loans to foreclosed properties or, for properties acquired upon foreclosure\nof certain government-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured loans), to other\nassets. The reclassifications represent non-cash investing activities and,\naccordingly, are not reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Credit\nCard and Other Consumer Credit card and other consumer loans are primarily\nmodified by placing the customer on a fixed payment plan with a significantly\nreduced fixed interest rate, with terms ranging from 6months to 72months, most of\nwhich had a 60-monthterm at September 30, 2024. In certain circumstances, the\nCorporation will forgive a portion of the outstanding balance if the borrower\nmakes payments up to a set amount. The Corporation makes modifications directly\nwith borrowers for loans held by the Corporation (internal programs) as well as\nthrough third-party renegotiation agencies that provide solutions to customers\u2019\nentire unsecured debt structures (external programs). The September 30, 2024\namortized cost of credit card and other consumer loans that were modified through\nthese programs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $\n202million and $ 534million compared to $ 196million and $ 455million for the same\nperiods in 2023. These modifications represented 0.10percent and 0.26percent of\noutstanding credit card and other consumer loans for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.10percent and 0.22percent for the same\nperiods in 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the\nfinancial effect of modifications resulted in a weighted-average interest rate\nreduction of 19.13percent and 19.29percent compared to 19.40percent and\n19.02percent for the same periods in 2023, and principal forgiveness of $\n30million and $ 88million compared to $ 16million and $ 41million for the same\nperiods in 2023. The Corporation tracks the performance of modified loans to\nassess effectiveness of modification programs. During the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, defaults of credit card and other consumer\nloans that had been modified within 12 months were insignificant. At September 30,\n2024, modified credit card and other consumer loans to borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty over the last 12 months totaled $ 665million, of which $\n562million were current, $ 58million were 30-89 days past due, and $ 45million\n                                                                                  \n  75Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nwere greater than 90 days past due.

Commercial Loans\nModifications of loans to commercial borrowers experiencing financial difficulty\nare designed to reduce the Corporation\u2019s loss exposure while providing borrowers\nwith an opportunity to work through financial difficulties, often to avoid\nforeclosure or bankruptcy. Each modification is unique, reflects the borrower\u2019s\nindividual circumstances and is designed to benefit the borrower while mitigating\nthe Corporation\u2019s risk exposure. Commercial modifications are primarily term\nextensions and payment forbearances. Payment forbearances involve the Corporation\nforbearing its contractual right to collect certain payments or payment in full\n(maturity forbearance) for a defined period of time. Reductions in interest rates\nand principal forgiveness occur infrequently for commercial borrowers. Principal\nforgiveness may occur in connection with foreclosure, short sales or other\nsettlement agreements, leading to termination or sale of the loan.

Cash and non-cash proceeds from\nsales and paydowns of loans originally\nclassified as LHFS were $ 21.7billion\nand $ 10.8billion for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Cash\nused for originations and purchases of\nLHFS totaled $ 26.3billion and $\n11.5billion for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 . Also\nincluded were non-cash net transfers\ninto LHFS of $ 0 and $ 634million during\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023 . Accrued Interest Receivable\nAccrued interest receivable for loans\nand leases and loans held-for-sale was $\n4.4billion and $ 4.5billion at September\n30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and is\nreported in customer and other\nreceivables on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Outstanding credit card loan\nbalances include unpaid principal,\ninterest and fees. Credit card loans are\nnot classified as nonperforming but are\ncharged off no later than the end of the\nmonth in which the account becomes 180\ndays past due, within 60 days after\nreceipt of notification of death or\nbankruptcy, or upon confirmation of\nfraud . During the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, the\nCorporation reversed $ 213million and $\n633million of interest and fee income\nagainst the income statement line item\nin which it was originally recorded upon\ncharge-off of the principal balance of\nthe loan compared to $ 152million and $\n409million for the same periods in 2023.\nFor the outstanding residential\nmortgage, home equity, direct/indirect\nconsumer and commercial loan balances\nclassified as nonperforming during the\nthree and nine months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023, interest and fee\nincome reversed at the time the loans\nwere classified as nonperforming was not\nsignificant. For more information on the\nCorporation's nonperforming loan\npolicies, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form\n10-K .\nAllowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses is estimated using\nquantitative and qualitative methods that consider a variety of factors, such as\nhistorical loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio and an\neconomic outlook over the life of the loan. Qualitative reserves cover losses that\nare expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not adequately be reflected\nin the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. The Corporation\nincorporates forward-looking information through the use of several macroeconomic\nscenarios in determining the weighted economic outlook over the forecasted life of\nthe assets. These scenarios include key macroeconomic variables such as gross\ndomestic product, unemployment rate, real\n\nestate prices and corporate bond spreads. The scenarios that are chosen each\nquarter and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors\nincluding recent economic events, leading economic indicators, internal and third-\nparty economist views, and industry trends. For more information on the\nCorporation's credit loss accounting policies including the allowance for credit\nlosses, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. The September 30, 2024 estimate for allowance for credit losses was based on\nvarious economic scenarios, including a baseline scenario derived from consensus\nestimates, an adverse scenario reflecting an extended moderate recession, a\ndownside scenario reflecting continued inflation and interest rates with minimal\nrate cuts, a tail risk scenario similar to the severely adverse scenario used in\nstress testing and an upside scenario that considers the potential for improvement\nabove the baseline scenario. The overall weighted economic outlook of the above\nscenarios has improved compared to the weighted economic outlook estimated as of\nDecember 31, 2023. The weighted economic outlook assumes that the U.S. average\nunemployment rate will be fivepercent by the fourth quarter of 2025 and will\ndecrease to just below fivepercent by the fourth quarter of 2026. The weighted\neconomic outlook assumes steady growth with U.S. real gross domestic product\nforecasted to grow at 1.4percent and 1.9percent year-over-year in the fourth\nquarters of 2025 and 2026. The allowance for credit losses decreased $ 200million\nfrom December 31, 2023 to $ 14.4billion at September 30, 2024. The change in the\nallowance for credit losses was comprised of a net decrease of $ 91million in the\nallowance for loan and lease losses and a decrease of $ 109million in the reserve\nfor unfunded lending commitments. The decline in the allowance for credit losses\nwas attributed to decreases in the commercial portfolio of $ 249million and the\nconsumer real estate portfolio of $ 101million, partially offset by an increase in\nthe credit card and other consumer portfolios of $ 150million. The provision for\ncredit losses increased $ 308million to $ 1.5billion, and $ 1.1billion to $\n4.4billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the\nsame periods in 2023. The provision for credit losses for the current-year periods\nwas primarily driven by credit card loans and the commercial real estate office\nportfolio. Outstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the\nfair value option increased $ 21.5billion during the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 primarily driven by commercial, which increased $ 21.2billion due to\nbroad-based growth.

Interest Entities\n\nThe Corporation utilizes VIEs in the ordinary course of business to support its\nown and its customers\u2019 financing and investing needs. The Corporation routinely\nsecuritizes loans and debt securities using VIEs as a source of funding for the\nCorporation and as a means of transferring the economic risk of the loans or debt\nsecurities to third parties. The assets are transferred into a trust or other\nsecuritization vehicle such that the assets are legally isolated from the\ncreditors of the Corporation and are not\n\navailable to satisfy its obligations. These assets can only be used to settle\nobligations of the trust or other securitization vehicle. The Corporation also\nadministers, structures or invests in other VIEs including CDOs, investment\nvehicles and other entities. For more information on the Corporation\u2019s use of\nVIEs, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 6 \u2013\nSecuritizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements of the Corporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K . The tables in\nthis Note present the assets and liabilities of consolidated and unconsolidated\nVIEs at September 30, 2024\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America78                                                               \n                                                                                  \nand December 31, 2023 in situations where the Corporation has a loan or security\ninterest and involvement with transferred assets or if the Corporation otherwise\nhas an additional interest in the VIE. The tables also present the Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum loss exposure at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 resulting from\nits involvement with consolidated VIEs and unconsolidated VIEs. The Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum loss exposure is based on the unlikely event that all of the assets in the\nVIEs become worthless and incorporates not only potential losses associated with\nassets recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but also potential losses\nassociated with off-balance sheet commitments, such as unfunded liquidity\ncommitments and other contractual arrangements. The Corporation\u2019s maximum loss\nexposure does not include losses previously recognized through write-downs of\nassets. The Corporation invests in ABS, CLOs and other similar investments issued\nby third-party VIEs with which it has no other form of involvement other than a\nloan or debt security issued by the VIE. In addition, the Corporation also enters\ninto certain commercial lending arrangements that may utilize VIEs for activities\nsecondary to the lending arrangement, for example to hold collateral. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure to these VIEs is the investment balances.\nThese securities and loans are included in Note 4 \u2013 Securities or Note 5 \u2013\nOutstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses and are not included\nin the following tables. The Corporation did not provide financial support to\nconsolidated or unconsolidated VIEs during the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 or the year ended December 31, 2023 that it was not previously\ncontractually required to provide, nor does it intend to do so. The Corporation\nhad liquidity commitments, including written put options and collateral value\nguarantees, with certain unconsolidated VIEs of $ 982million and $ 989million at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. First-lien Mortgage Securitizations As\npart of its mortgage banking activities, the Corporation securitizes a portion of\nthe first-lien residential mortgage loans it originates or purchases from third\nparties, generally in the form of residential mortgage-backed securities\nguaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises, FNMA and FHLMC (collectively the\nGSEs), or the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) primarily in the\ncase of FHA-insured and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-guaranteed\nmortgage loans. Securitization usually occurs in conjunction with or shortly after\norigination or purchase, and the Corporation may also securitize loans held in its\nresidential mortgage portfolio. In addition, the Corporation may, from time to\ntime, securitize commercial mortgages it originates or purchases from other\nentities. The Corporation typically services the loans it securitizes. Further,\nthe Corporation may retain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts\nincluding senior and subordinate securities and equity tranches issued by the\ntrusts. Except as described in Note 10 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies , the\nCorporation does not provide guarantees or recourse to the securitization trusts\nother than standard representations and warranties. The table below summarizes\nselect information related to first-lien mortgage securitizations for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n                                                                                  \n  F\u2026                                                                              \n  M\u2026                                                                              \n  S\u2026                                                                              \n           Re\u2026                                                                    \n           Mo\u2026                                   Co\u2026                              \n             -                                   Mo\u2026                              \n           Ag\u2026                                                                    \n           Th\u2026                Ni\u2026                Th\u2026                Ni\u2026           \n           Mo\u2026                Mo\u2026                Mo\u2026                Mo\u2026           \n           En\u2026                En\u2026                En\u2026                En\u2026           \n           Se\u2026                Se\u2026                Se\u2026                Se\u2026           \n            30                 30                 30                 30           \n  (\u2026                                                                              \n  in       20\u2026       2\u2026       20\u2026       2\u2026       20\u2026       2\u2026       20\u2026       2\u2026  \n  m\u2026                                                                              \n  P\u2026                                                                              \n  f\u2026    $  928    $  1\u2026    $  3,\u2026    $  3\u2026    $  1,\u2026    $  1\u2026    $  8,\u2026    $  1\u2026  \n  l\u2026                                                                              \n  s\u2026                                                                              \n  G\u2026                                                                              \n  (\u2026        -1       -2        -3       -6        18       33       106       35  \n  on                                                                              \n  s\u2026                                                                              \n  R\u2026                                                                              \n  f\u2026         8       10        24       24         \u2014        \u2014         \u2014        \u2014  \n  s\u2026                                                                              \n  t\u2026                                                                              \n                                                                                  \n(1) The Corporation transfers residential mortgage loans to securitizations\nsponsored primarily by the GSEs or GNMA in the normal course of business and\nprimarily receives residential mortgage-backed securities in exchange.\nSubstantially all of these securities are classified as Level 2 within the fair\nvalue hierarchy and are typically sold shortly after receipt.\n\n(2) A majority of the first-lien residential mortgage loans securitized are\ninitially classified as LHFS and accounted for under the fair value option. Gains\nrecognized on these LHFS prior to securitization, which totaled $ 10million and $\n23million, net of hedges, during the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024 compared to $ 17million and $ 34million for the same periods in 2023, are not\nincluded in the table above.\n\n(3) The Corporation may have the option to repurchase delinquent loans out of\nsecuritization trusts, which reduces the amount of servicing advances it is\nrequired to make. The Corporation may also repurchase loans from securitization\ntrusts to perform modifications. Repurchased loans include FHA-insured mortgages\ncollateralizing GNMA securities.\nThe Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale or securitization of\nconsumer real estate loans. The unpaid principal balance of loans serviced for\ninvestors, including residential mortgage and home equity loans, totaled $\n85.7billion and $ 93.5billion at September 30, 2024 and 2023. Servicing fee and\nancillary fee income on serviced loans was $ 54million and $ 174million during the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $ 55million and $\n187million for the same periods in 2023. Servicing advances on serviced loans,\nincluding loans serviced for others and loans held for investment, were $\n1.0billion and $ 1.3billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. For more\ninformation on MSRs, see Note 14 \u2013 Fair Value Measurements . Home Equity Loans The\nCorporation retains interests, primarily senior securities, in home equity\nsecuritization trusts to which it transferred home equity loans. In addition, the\nCorporation may be obligated to provide subordinate funding to the trusts during a\nrapid amortization event. This obligation is included in the maximum loss exposure\nin the preceding table. The charges that will ultimately be recorded as a result\nof the rapid amortization events depend on the undrawn portion of the home equity\nlines of credit, performance of the loans, the amount of subsequent draws and the\ntiming of related cash flows. Mortgage and Home Equity Securitizations During the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Corporation deconsolidated\nagency residential mortgage securitization trusts with total assets of $\n115million and $ 940million compared to $ 35million and $ 659million for the same\nperiods in 2023. The following table summarizes select information related to\nmortgage and home equity securitization trusts in which the Corporation held a\nvariable interest and had continuing involvement at September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023.\n                                                                                  \n  79Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                         \u2026                                                        \n         \u2026               \u2026                                                        \n         \u2026               \u2026                               \u2026                        \n         \u2026               \u2026               \u2026               \u2026                        \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $      $    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2014                \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014                \n         \u2014       \u2014       2       4       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2014                \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $      $    \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $    \n                                                                                  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $    \n                                                                                  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $      $    \n         \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026                \n         \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       6       7                \n         \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       1       1                \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $    \n      $  \u2014    $  7    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $    \n                                                                                  \n(1) Maximum loss exposure includes obligations under loss-sharing reinsurance and\nother arrangements for non-agency residential mortgage and commercial mortgage\nsecuritizations, but excludes the reserve for representations and warranties\nobligations and corporate guarantees and also excludes servicing advances and\nother servicing rights and obligations. For more information, see Note 10 \u2013\nCommitments and Contingencies and Note 14 \u2013 Fair Value Measurements .\n\n(2) Principal balance outstanding includes loans where the Corporation was the\ntransferor to securitization VIEs with which it has continuing involvement, which\nmay include servicing the loans.\n\n(3) For unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs, the maximum loss exposure includes\noutstanding trust certificates issued by trusts in rapid amortization, net of\nrecorded reserves. For both consolidated and unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs,\nthe maximum loss exposure excludes the reserve for representations and warranties\nobligations and corporate guarantees. For more information, see Note 10 \u2013\nCommitments and Contingencies .\nOther Asset-backed Securitizations The following paragraphs summarize select\ninformation related to other asset-backed VIEs in which the Corporation had a\nvariable interest at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Credit Card and\nAutomobile Loan Securitizations The Corporation securitizes originated and\npurchased credit card and automobile loans as a source of financing. The loans are\nsold on a non-recourse basis to consolidated trusts. The securitizations are\nongoing, whereas additional receivables will be funded into the trusts by either\nloan repayments or proceeds from securities issued to third parties, depending on\nthe securitization structure. The Corporation\u2019s continuing involvement with the\nsecuritization trusts includes servicing the receivables and holding various\nsubordinated interests, including an undivided seller\u2019s interest in the credit\ncard receivables and owning certain retained interests. At September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, the carrying values of the receivables in the trusts totaled $\n18.2billion and $ 16.6billion, which are included in loans and leases, and the\ncarrying values of senior debt securities that were issued to third-party\ninvestors from the trusts totaled $ 8.3billion and $ 7.8billion, which are\nincluded in long-term debt. Resecuritization Trusts The Corporation transfers\nsecurities, typically MBS, into resecuritization VIEs generally at the request of\ncustomers seeking securities with specific characteristics. Generally, there are\nno significant ongoing activities performed in a resecuritization trust, and no\nsingle investor has the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust.

Securities transferred into resecuritization VIEs were\nmeasured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in market making and\nsimilar activities prior to the resecuritization and, accordingly, no gain or loss\non sale was recorded. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nresecuritization proceeds included securities with an initial fair value of $\n1.3billion and $ 2.2billion, compared to $ 1.1billion and $ 2.1billion for the\nsame periods in 2023, of which substantially all of the securities were classified\nas trading account assets for both periods.

Collateralized Debt Obligation\nVIEs The Corporation receives fees for structuring CDO VIEs, which hold\ndiversified pools of fixed-income securities, typically corporate debt or ABS,\nwhich the CDO VIEs fund by issuing multiple tranches of debt and equity\nsecurities. CDOs are generally managed by third-party portfolio managers. The\nCorporation typically transfers assets to these CDOs, holds securities issued by\nthe CDOs and may be a derivative counterparty to the CDOs. The Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated CDOs totaled $ 66million\nand $ 80million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Investment VIEs The\nCorporation sponsors, invests in or provides financing, which may be in connection\nwith the sale of assets, to a variety of investment VIEs that hold loans, real\nestate, debt securities or other financial instruments and are designed to provide\nthe desired investment profile to investors or the Corporation.

securities were valued using quoted market prices or\nobservable market inputs (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy).\nTax Credit VIEs The Corporation holds equity investments in unconsolidated limited\npartnerships and similar entities that construct, own and operate affordable\nhousing, renewable energy and certain other projects. The total assets of these\nunconsolidated tax credit VIEs were $ 82.3billion and $ 84.1billion as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. An unrelated third party is typically\nthe general partner or managing member and has control over the significant\nactivities of the VIE. As an investor, tax credits associated with the investments\nin these entities are allocated to the Corporation, as provided by the U.S.\nInternal Revenue Code and related regulations, and are recognized as\n                                                                                  \n  81Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nincome tax benefits in the Corporation\u2019s\nConsolidated Statement of Income in the\nyear they are earned, which varies based\non the type of investments. Tax credits\nfrom investments in affordable housing\nare recognized ratably over a term of up\nto 10 years, and tax credits from\nrenewable energy investments are\nrecognized either at inception for\ntransactions electing Investment Tax\nCredits (ITCs) or as energy is produced\nfor transactions electing Production Tax\nCredits (PTCs), which is generally up to\na 10-year time period. The volume and\ntypes of investments held by the\nCorporation will influence the amount of\ntax credits recognized each period.\n\nThe Corporation\u2019s equity investments in\naffordable housing and other projects\ntotaled $ 16.2billion and $ 15.8billion\nat September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, which included unfunded capital\ncontributions of $ 7.3billion and $\n7.2billion that are probable to be paid\nover the next five years. The\nCorporation may be asked to invest\nadditional amounts to support a troubled\naffordable housing project. Such\nadditional investments have not been and\nare not expected to be significant.\nDuring the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Corporation\nrecognized tax credits and other tax\nbenefits related to affordable housing\nequity investments of $ 564million and $\n1.7billion compared to $ 526million and\n$ 1.6billion for the same periods in\n2023, and reported pretax losses in\nother income of $ 418million and $\n1.2billion compared to $ 379million and\n$ 1.1billion for the same periods in\n2023. The Corporation\u2019s equity\ninvestments in renewable energy totaled\n$ 13.3billion and $ 14.2billion at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023. In addition, the Corporation had\nunfunded capital contributions for\nrenewable energy investments of $\n4.9billion and $ 6.2billion at September\n30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, which\nare contingent on various conditions\nprecedent to funding over the next two\nyears. The Corporation\u2019s risk of loss is\ngenerally mitigated by policies\nrequiring the project to qualify for the\nexpected tax credits prior to making its\ninvestment. During the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, the\nCorporation recognized tax credits and\nother tax benefits related to renewable\nenergy equity investments of $\n873million and $ 2.8billion compared to\n$ 1.3billion and $ 3.4billion for the\nsame periods in 2023 and reported pretax\nlosses in other income of $ 697million\nand $ 2.0billion compared to $\n849million and $ 2.0billion for the same\nperiods in 2023.

or practice to sell or repledge. At September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, the fair value of this collateral was $ 976.0billion and $\n911.3billion, of which $ 944.6billion and $ 870.9billion were sold or repledged.\nThe primary source of this collateral is securities borrowed or purchased under\nagreements to resell. For more information on collateral, see Note 10 \u2013 Securities\nFinancing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings, Collateral and Restricted Cash to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. Restricted Cash At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Corporation\nheld restricted cash included within cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet of $ 6.8billion and $ 5.6billion, predominantly related to cash\nsegregated in compliance with securities regulations and cash held on deposit with\ncentral banks to meet reserve requirements.\n\nNOTE 10 Commitments and Contingencies\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Corporation enters into a number of off-\nbalance sheet commitments. These commitments expose the Corporation to varying\ndegrees of credit and market risk and are subject to the same credit and market\nrisk limitation reviews as those instruments recorded on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. For more information on commitments and contingencies, see Note 12 \u2013\nCommitments\n\nand Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s\n2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Credit Extension Commitments The Corporation\nenters into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, standby letters\nof credit (SBLCs) and commercial letters of credit to meet the financing needs of\nits customers. The following table includes the notional amount of unfunded\nlegally binding lending commitments net of amounts distributed (i.e., syndicated\nor participated) to other financial institutions. The distributed amounts were $\n10.3billion at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The carrying value\nof the Corporation\u2019s credit extension commitments at September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value\noption, was $ 1.1billion and $ 1.2billion, which predominantly related to the\nreserve for unfunded lending commitments. The carrying value of these commitments\nis classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. Legally binding commitments to extend credit generally have\nspecified rates and maturities. Certain of these commitments have adverse change\nclauses that help to protect the Corporation against deterioration in the\nborrower\u2019s ability to pay. The following table includes the notional amount of\ncommitments of $ 2.5billion and $ 2.6billion at September 30, 2024 and December\n31, 2023 that are accounted for under the fair value option. However, the table\nexcludes the cumulative net fair value for these commitments of $ 66million and $\n67million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, which\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America84                                                               \n                                                                                  \nis classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities.

Amounts in the table include consumer SBLCs of $ 883million and $\n744million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\n(3) Primarily includes second-loss positions on lease-end residual value\nguarantees.\n\n(4) Includes business card unused lines of credit.\nOther Commitments At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Corporation had\ncommitments to purchase loans (e.g., residential mortgage and commercial real\nestate) of $ 451million and $ 822million, which upon settlement will be included\nin trading account assets, loans or LHFS, and commitments to purchase commercial\nloans of $ 6.9billion and $ 420million, which upon settlement will be included in\ntrading account assets. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the\nCorporation had commitments to enter into resale and forward-dated resale and\nsecurities borrowing agreements of $ 129.4billion and $ 117.0billion, and\ncommitments to enter into forward-dated repurchase and securities lending\nagreements of $ 113.1billion and $ 63.0billion. A significant portion of these\ncommitments will expire within the next 12months. At both September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, the Corporation had a commitment to originate or purchase up to\n$ 4.0billion, on a rolling 12-month basis, of auto loans and leases from a\nstrategic partner. This commitment extends through November 2026 and can be\nterminated with 12months prior notice. At September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, the Corporation had unfunded equity investment commitments of $ 444million\nand $ 477million. As a Federal Reserve member bank, the Corporation is required to\nsubscribe to a certain amount of shares issued by its Federal Reserve district\nbank, which pays cumulative dividends at a prescribed rate. At both September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, the Corporation had paid $ 5.4billion for half of its\nsubscribed shares, with the remaining half subject to call by the Federal Reserve\ndistrict bank board, which the Corporation believes is remote. Other Guarantees\nBank-owned Life Insurance Book Value Protection The Corporation sells products\nthat offer book value protection to insurance carriers who offer group life\ninsurance policies to corporations, primarily banks. At September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, the notional amount of these guarantees totaled $ 3.3billion\nand $ 3.8billion. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum exposure related to these guarantees totaled $ 505million and $\n577million, with estimated maturity dates between 2034 and 2037. Merchant Services\nThe Corporation in its role as merchant acquirer or as a sponsor of other merchant\nacquirers may be held liable for any reversed charges that cannot be collected\nfrom the merchants due to,\n                                                                                  \n  85Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \namong other things, merchant fraud or\ninsolvency. If charges are properly\nreversed after a purchase and cannot be\ncollected from either the merchants or\nmerchant acquirers, the Corporation may\nbe held liable for these reversed\ncharges. The ability to reverse a charge\nis primarily governed by the applicable\npayment network rules and regulations,\nwhich include, but are not limited to,\nthe type of charge, type of payment used\nand time limits. The total amount of\ntransactions subject to reversal under\npayment network rules and regulations\nprocessed for the preceding six-month\nperiod, which was approximately $\n195billion, is an estimate of the\nCorporation\u2019s maximum potential exposure\nas of September 30, 2024. The\nCorporation\u2019s risk in this area\nprimarily relates to circumstances where\na cardholder has purchased goods or\nservices for future delivery. The\nCorporation mitigates this risk by\nrequiring cash deposits, guarantees,\nletters of credit or other types of\ncollateral from certain merchants. The\nCorporation\u2019s reserves for contingent\nlosses, and the losses incurred related\nto the merchant processing activity were\nnot significant. Representations and\nWarranties Obligations and Corporate\nGuarantees For more information on\nrepresentations and warranties\nobligations and corporate guarantees,\nsee Note 12 \u2013 Commitments and\nContingencies to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. The reserve for representations\nand warranties obligations and corporate\nguarantees was $ 276million and $\n604million at September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023 and is included in\naccrued expenses and other liabilities\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and\nthe related provision is included in\nother income in the Consolidated\nStatement of Income. The representations\nand warranties reserve represents the\nCorporation\u2019s best estimate of incurred\nlosses, is based on its experience in\nprevious negotiations, and is subject to\njudgment, a variety of assumptions and\nknown or unknown uncertainties. Future\nrepresentations and warranties losses\nmay occur in excess of the amounts\nrecorded for these exposures; however,\nthe Corporation does not expect such\namounts to be material to the\nCorporation's financial condition and\nliquidity. See Litigation and Regulatory\nMatters below for the Corporation's\ncombined range of possible loss in\nexcess of the reserve for\nrepresentations and warranties and the\naccrued liability for litigation. Fixed\nIncome Clearing Corporation Sponsored\nMember Repo Program The Corporation acts\nas a sponsoring member in a repo program\nwhereby the Corporation clears certain\neligible resale and repurchase\nagreements through the Government\nSecurities Division of the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation on behalf of\nclients that are sponsored members in\naccordance with the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation\u2019s rules. As part of\nthis program, the Corporation guarantees\nthe payment and performance of its\nsponsored members to the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation. The Corporation\u2019s\nguarantee obligation is secured by a\nsecurity interest in cash or high-\nquality securities collateral placed by\nclients with the clearinghouse and\ntherefore, the potential for the\nCorporation to incur significant losses\nunder this arrangement is remote. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum potential\nexposure, without taking into\nconsideration the related collateral,\nwas $ 197.7billion and $ 132.5billion at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023.\n\nOther Guarantees In the normal course of\nbusiness, the Corporation periodically\nguarantees the obligations of its\naffiliates in a variety of transactions\nincluding ISDA-related transactions and\nnon-ISDA related transactions such as\ncommodities trading, repurchase\nagreements, prime brokerage agreements\nand other transactions. Guarantees of\nCertain Long-term Debt The Corporation,\nas the parent company, fully and\nunconditionally guarantees the\nsecurities issued by BofA Finance LLC, a\nconsolidated finance subsidiary of the\nCorporation, and effectively provides\nfor the full and unconditional guarantee\nof trust securities and capital\nsecurities issued by certain statutory\ntrust companies that are 100percent\nowned finance subsidiaries of the\nCorporation. Other Contingencies In\n2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC) issued a final rule\nto impose a special assessment to\nrecover certain estimated losses to the\nDeposit Insurance Fund (DIF) arising\nfrom the closures of Silicon Valley Bank\nand Signature Bank. The estimated losses\nwill be recovered through quarterly\nspecial assessments collected from\ncertain insured depository institutions,\nincluding the Corporation, and\ncollection began during the three months\nended June 30, 2024. As of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, the\nCorporation\u2019s accrual for its estimated\nshare of the FDIC special assessment was\n$ 2.2billion and $ 2.1billion. The\nCorporation continues to monitor the\nFDIC\u2019s estimated loss to the DIF, which\ncould affect the amount of its accrued\nliability.\n\nLitigation and Regulatory Matters The\nfollowing disclosures supplement the\ndisclosure in Note 12 \u2013 Commitments and\nContingencies to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form\n10-K (the prior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure). In the\nordinary course of business, the\nCorporation and its subsidiaries are\nroutinely defendants in or parties to\nmany pending and threatened legal,\nregulatory and governmental actions and\nproceedings. In view of the inherent\ndifficulty of predicting the outcome of\nsuch matters, particularly where the\nclaimants seek very large or\nindeterminate damages or where the\nmatters present novel legal theories or\ninvolve a large number of parties, the\nCorporation generally cannot predict the\neventual outcome of the pending matters,\ntiming of the ultimate resolution of\nthese matters, or eventual loss, fines\nor penalties related to each pending\nmatter. As a matter develops, the\nCorporation, in conjunction with any\noutside counsel handling the matter,\nevaluates whether such matter presents a\nloss contingency that is probable and\nestimable, and, for the matters\ndisclosed below and in the prior\ncommitments and contingencies\ndisclosure, whether a loss in excess of\nany accrued liability is reasonably\npossible in future periods. Once the\nloss contingency is deemed to be both\nprobable and estimable, the Corporation\nwill establish an accrued liability and\nrecord a corresponding amount of\nlitigation-related expense. The\nCorporation continues to monitor the\nmatter for further developments that\ncould affect the amount of the accrued\nliability that has been previously\nestablished. Excluding expenses of\ninternal and external legal service\nproviders, litigation and regulatory\ninvestigation-related expense of $\n38million and $ 188million was\nrecognized for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024 compared to $\n76million and $ 442million for the same\nperiods in 2023.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America86                                                               \n                                                                                  \nFor any matter disclosed in this Note\nand in the prior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure for which a\nloss in future periods is reasonably\npossible and estimable (whether in\nexcess of an accrued liability or where\nthere is no accrued liability) and for\nrepresentations and warranties\nexposures, the Corporation\u2019s estimated\nrange of possible loss is $ 0to $\n0.8billion in excess of the accrued\nliability, if any, as of September 30,\n2024. The accrued liability and\nestimated range of possible loss are\nbased upon currently available\ninformation and subject to significant\njudgment, a variety of assumptions and\nknown and unknown uncertainties. The\nmatters underlying the accrued liability\nand estimated range of possible loss are\nunpredictable and may change from time\nto time, and actual losses may vary\nsignificantly from the current estimate\nand accrual. The estimated range of\npossible loss does not represent the\nCorporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure.\nInformation is provided below and in the\nprior commitments and contingencies\ndisclosure regarding the nature of the\nlitigation or other contingency and,\nwhere specified, associated claimed\ndamages. Based on current knowledge, and\ntaking into account accrued liabilities,\nmanagement does not believe that loss\ncontingencies arising from pending\nmatters, including the matters described\nbelow and in the prior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure, will have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the\nconsolidated financial condition or\nliquidity of the Corporation. However,\nin light of the significant judgment,\nvariety of assumptions and uncertainties\ninvolved in those matters, some of which\nare beyond the Corporation\u2019s control,\nand the very large or indeterminate\ndamages sought in some of those matters,\nan adverse outcome in one or more of\nthose matters could be material to the\nCorporation\u2019s business or results of\noperations for any particular reporting\nperiod, or cause significant\nreputational harm. Bank Secrecy\nAct/Anti-Money Laundering and Economic\nSanctions Compliance The Corporation has\nbeen engaged with several of its federal\nregulators in relation to certain\naspects of the Corporation\u2019s Bank\nSecrecy Act/anti-money laundering and\nsanctions compliance programs\n(Programs), including transaction\nmonitoring, training, governance, and\ncustomer due diligence. In cooperation\nwith regulators, the Corporation has\nbeen, and plans to continue,\nimplementing enhancements to these\nPrograms. The Corporation is continuing\ndiscussions with its regulators about\nthe Programs, and resolution of these\ndiscussions may include one or more\npublic orders by the regulators. Based\non these discussions, the Corporation\ndoes not expect these issues relating to\nthe Programs will have a material\nadverse financial impact on the\nCorporation. CFPB Inquiry Related to\nProcessing Electronic Payments The\nCorporation has been responding to an\ninquiry from the Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau (CFPB) regarding the\nCorporation\u2019s processing of electronic\npayments of funds through the Zelle\nnetwork. The CFPB staff has initiated\ndiscussions with the Corporation to\npursue a resolution of the inquiry or\nfile an enforcement action. The\nCorporation is evaluating next steps,\nincluding litigation.\n\nDeposit Insurance Assessment On July 1,\n2024, the district court judge vacated\nthe magistrate judge\u2019s April 2023 report\nand recommendation for resolving the\nparties\u2019 cross-motions for summary\njudgment, and asked the parties to file\nnew motions, in light of a recent\nSupreme Court decision. The parties\nsubsequently filed their new summary\njudgment motions which are pending.\nUnemployment Insurance Prepaid Cards In\nconnection with the multidistrict\nlitigation (MDL) in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Southern District of\nCalifornia, in response to BANA\u2019s\npartial motion to dismiss, the court\ndismissed certain claims in the amended\ncomplaint and allowed others to proceed,\nincluding claims under the Electronic\nFunds Transfer Act.

transfer a liability (an exit\nprice) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in\nan orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The\nCorporation determines the fair values of its financial instruments under\napplicable accounting standards and conducts a review of fair value hierarchy\nclassifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of fair value\nhierarchy classifications are made if the significant inputs used in the financial\nmodels measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities become unobservable\nor observable in the current\n\nmarketplace. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no\nchanges to valuation approaches or techniques that had, or are expected to have, a\nmaterial impact on the Corporation\u2019s consolidated financial position or results of\noperations. For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy, how the\nCorporation measures fair value and valuation techniques, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles and Note 20 \u2013 Fair Value Measurements to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. The Corporation accounts for certain financial instruments under the fair\nvalue option. For more information, see Note 15 \u2013 Fair Value Option . Recurring\nFair Value Assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, including financial instruments that the\nCorporation accounts for under the fair value option, are summarized in the\nfollowing tables.\n                                                                                  \n  89Bank of America

Transfers occur on a regular basis for long-term debt instruments\ndue to changes in the impact of unobservable inputs on the value of the embedded\nderivative in relation to the instrument as a whole.\n                                                                                  \n  91Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                     $      $      $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                     $      $      $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n(1) Assets (liabilities).
