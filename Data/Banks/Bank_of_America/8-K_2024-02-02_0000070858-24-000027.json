\u201cCompany\u201d) today announced\nthat its Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) approved 2023 total compensation for\nChair and Chief Executive Officer Brian T. Moynihan of $29,000,000, compared to\n2022 total compensation of $30,000,000.\n\nIn determining this compensation, the independent members of the Board evaluated\nmany aspects of the Company\u2019s performance and Mr. Moynihan\u2019s leadership in\ndelivering Responsible Growth once again in 2023. The Board acknowledged the\nCompany\u2019s continued success in 2023 and Mr. Moynihan\u2019s leadership under this\noperating model particularly in this period of considerable economic uncertainty.\n\nShareholders. The Company earned $26.5 billion in net income in 2023, a decrease\nof 4% from 2022. As the Company reported in its latest earnings release on January\n12, 2024, those full year results included two notable items related to the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation special assessment ($2.1 billion pre-tax)\nand the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index cessation-related charge ($1.6\nbillion pre-tax) incurred in the fourth quarter totaling $3.7 billion pre-tax, or\n$2.8 billion after-tax. Excluding these notable items net income was $29.3\nbillion, an increase of 6% over 2022. Excluding these two notable items provides\nadditional information for evaluating the Company\u2019s results of operations and\ncomparing its operational performance between periods because these impacts may\nnot be reflective of the Company\u2019s underlying operating performance. These results\nwere aided by strong organic growth, while showing diligent expense management.\nThe Company\u2019s balance sheet remained a source of strength, with approximately $292\nbillion in shareholders\u2019 equity and liquidity levels of $897 billion at the end of\n2023. Book value per share improved 9% during 2023, as well. The strength of the\nbalance sheet allowed the Company to support clients and continue to invest in the\nfuture of the Company. It also allowed the Company to return $12 billion to\nshareholders in 2023, through dividends and common stock repurchases. The\nCompany\u2019s common stock price improved modestly from year-end 2022, while the KBW\nBank Index declined 5%.\n\nEmployees. The Company continued to invest in being a great place to work in 2023.\nThe Company raised the minimum hourly rate of pay for U.S. teammates to $23/hour\ncontinuing its commitment to increase that rate to $25/hour by 2025. Benefits\noffered by Bank of America included continued support for childcare reimbursement\nand back-up care programs, as well as elder care. The Company also further\nenhanced its emotional health wellness programs, and beginning in 2023, teammates\ncelebrating at least 15 years of continuous service with the Company may\nparticipate in a new sabbatical program. Additionally, the Company recently\nannounced the seventh year of Sharing Success awards since 2017, with\napproximately 97% of employees receiving an award. The majority of these employees\nwill receive shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, further aligning their\ninterests with shareholders.\n\nClients. The Company continued to support clients in 2023 with credit, capital and\nliquidity. This helped us to report approximately $8 billion in loan growth to\nmore than $1.05 trillion. With regard to Consumer and Wealth Management, we were\nentrusted by clients to manage $5.4 trillion in balances across loans, deposits\nand investment balances. In total we saw approximately $84 billion in wealth flows\nin 2023. Importantly, the Company experienced organic growth across all its\nbusinesses and was a source of strength in times of stress in the industry this\nyear. In 2023, the Company added more than 600,000 net new consumer checking\naccounts, with Consumer investment accounts growing to more than 3.8 million. The\nCompany\u2019s Wealth Management businesses added a record 40,000 net new relationships\nin 2023, and added nearly 150,000 new bank accounts for investment clients in\n2023.
