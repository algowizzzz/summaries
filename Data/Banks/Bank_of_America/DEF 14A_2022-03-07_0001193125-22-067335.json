This includes sharing our success in support of the communities in\nwhich we work and live. We do this in numerous ways. Sharing success in our\ncommunities. We help our clients realize their financial goals by offering a full\nsuite of consumer banking products and services, digital banking, investment\nmanagement, small business and commercial banking, large corporate banking, and\nmarkets businesses. Over time, we\u0092ve made significant changes to our overdraft\nservices and solutions, eliminating non-sufficient funds fees and reducing\nclients\u0092 reliance on overdraft, and providing resources to help clients manage\ntheir deposit accounts and finances responsibly. We help our communities through\nphilanthropy and partnerships to create economic opportunity. We invest in low-and\nmoderate-income (LMI) neighborhoods to create jobs and provide opportunities. We\nexpanded our Pathways program, which began with a commitment to hire 10,000\nteammates from LMI neighborhoods, to make an additional 10,000 LMI hires. We\ntripled our mortgage assistance program to make available up to $15 billion to\nhelp 60,000 LMI individuals and families purchase a home. We spend over $2 billion\nannually with our minority-owned and women-owned suppliers and vendors. We\ncommitted $1.25 billion over five years to help advance racial equality and\neconomic opportunity, with over $450 million already committed to help address\ncritical issues and fill long-term gaps, including skills and job readiness,\nmedical capacity and access, small business support, and affordable housing. Our\ncommitment and how we share success with our communities is dynamic and\nmultifaceted. Read about them in more detail on pages 39 through 40. Helping reach\na clean energy future. We continue to make progress on our strategy to support and\nfinance the transition to an environmentally sustainable, low-carboneconomy. In\n2021, we announced our goal to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in\nour financing activities, operations, and supply chain before 2050 (Net Zero\nGoal). We engage with our clients to support their transitions to net zero GHG\nemissions and plan to establish interim emissions reduction targets for high-\nemitting portfolios, including energy and power, to help our clients make progress\non their plans. In 2021, we also announced a goal to deploy $1 trillion by 2030 to\naccelerate the transition to a low-carbon,sustainable economy by providing\nlending, capital raising, advisory and investment services, and by developing\nother client-driven financial solutions. This commitment anchors a broader $1.5\ntrillion sustainable finance goal to support both environmental transition and\nsocial inclusive development, which spans business activities across the globe.\nThese goals are aligned to address the United Nations\u0092 Sustainable Development\nGoals and are intended to help drive business opportunities and enhance risk\nmanagement related to the transition to a low-carboneconomy. We participate in\nfinancial industry initiatives designed to drive the convergence of net zero GHG\nemissions approaches. We joined the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials\n(PCAF) to help develop a consistent methodology to assess and disclose financed\nemissions. We helped to launch the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), which\noutlines guidelines for banks to achieve net zero GHG emissions including\nrequirements for setting long-term and interim targets. We are transparent about\nour goals and progress, including in our Task Force on Climate-Related Financial\nDisclosures (TCFD) Report, which we will update in 2022. In our own operations, we\nhave been carbon neutral with respect to Scope 1 and 2 emissions since 2019, and\nwe purchase renewable energy to meet 100% of our power needs for our operations.\nMore details on our approach to addressing the clean energy transition and\nmanaging risk in our financing activities can be found under \u0093Our ESG leadership\u0094\nstarting on page 38, Proposal 6 starting on page 93, and our Environmental and\nSocial Risk Policy Framework available at www.bankofamerica.com/ESRPF.\n                                                                                  \n       For cautionary information and forward-looking statements regarding        \n  (1)  Responsible Growth and ESG information, see the                            \n       \u0093Table of contents\u0094 page to this proxy statement.                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                               \n  (2)  See our 2021 Annual Report for additional information.  \n                                                               \n                             \n  2022 PROXY STATEMENT    7  \n                             \nProxy statement summary Our commitment to being a great place to work Another way\nwe drive Responsible Growth and grow in a sustainable manner is by being a great\nplace to work for our teammates. We deliver on this commitment by being a diverse\nand inclusive workplace, attracting and developing exceptional talent, supporting\nemployees\u0092 physical, emotional, and financial wellness, and recognizing and\nrewarding performance.

We value and promote diversity and inclusion in every aspect of our\nbusiness and at every level of our organization. Our commitment to creating a\ndiverse and inclusive environment starts at the top with oversight from our Board\nand CEO. Our management team sets diversity and inclusion goals, and drives our\ndiversity and inclusion strategy, programs, initiatives, and policies. We consider\nachievement of diversity goals in performance management for managers. We hold\nourselves accountable each year by asking our workforce to tell us how we are\ndoing in our Employee Satisfaction Survey, which has a Diversity & Inclusion\ncomponent. We seek to build a diverse pipeline of candidates for positions at all\nlevels of the company, including leadership positions. Our practices and policies\nhave also resulted in strong representation across our employee population, with\nthe composition of our workforce mirroring the clients and communities we serve.\n                                                                                  \n  Director            Top three            Workforce           2021 Campus hires  \n  nominees            management levels                                           \n                      42% women \u00a0 24%      50% women                              \n                      people of color      globally \u00a0 49%                         \n                      (8% Asian, 9%        people of color     46% women          \n  50% diverse(1)      Black/African        (13% Asian, 14%     53% people of      \n                      American, 6%         Black/African       color              \n                      Hispanic/Latino)     American, 19%                          \n                                           Hispanic)(2)                           \n  Management team                                                                 \n  55% diverse(1)                                                                  \n                                                                                  \nWe invest in our talent by offering a range of programs and resources that allow\nemployees to develop and progress in their careers.

All\nnominees currently serve as directors on our Board and were elected by you at our\n2021 annual meeting of shareholders. Each director elected at the meeting will\nserve until our 2023 annual meeting or until a successor is duly elected and\nqualified. Each director nominee has consented to being named in this proxy\nstatement and to serving as a director if elected. If any nominee is unable to\nstand for election for any reason, the shares represented at our annual meeting\nmay be voted for another candidate proposed by our Board, or our Board may choose\nto reduce its size. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that an individual\nwho would be age 75 as of the time of election shall not be nominated for initial\nelection to the Board, provided that the Board may approve the nomination for\nreelection of a director who would be age 75 at the time of the election, if, in\nlight of all the circumstances, the Board determines that it is in the best\ninterests of our company and shareholders. After serving more than 18 years on our\nBoard, including most recently as the Chair of the Corporate Governance, ESG, and\nSustainability Committee, Thomas J. May, who has reached the retirement age of 75,\nwill retire at our annual meeting. In addition, after serving more than 12 years\non our Board, Susan S. Bies has informed the Board that she will not seek\nreelection, one year ahead of reaching age 75, and also will retire at our annual\nmeeting. In light of Mr. May\u0092s and Ms. Bies\u0092s retirements, the size of our Board\nwill be reduced to 14 as of the annual meeting.\n                                                                                  \n                                                               Other    Committ\u2026  \n  Nominee    Age(1)    Princip\u2026    Director    Indepen\u2026    U.S.-lis\u2026    members\u2026  \n                       occupat\u2026       since                  company    (C\u00a0=\u00a0     \n                                                              boards    Chair)    \n                                                                        Audit\u00a0    \n  Sharon\u00a0              Former                                           (C)       \n  L.\u00a0            70    Chairma\u2026        2012    Yes                 2    Corpora\u2026  \n  Allen                Deloitte                                         Governa\u2026  \n                       LLP                                              ESG, and  \n                                                                        Sustain\u2026  \n                       Former                                           Corpora\u2026  \n  Frank\u00a0               Executi\u2026                                         Governa\u2026  \n  P.\u00a0            73    Vice            2006    Yes              None    ESG, and  \n  Brambl\u2026              Chairma\u2026                                         Sustain\u2026  \n  Sr.                  MBNA\u00a0                                            Enterpr\u2026  \n                       Corpora\u2026                                         Risk (C)  \n                       Former                                                     \n                       Chairman                                                   \n                       and\u00a0                                             Compens\u2026  \n  Pierre               Global                                           and\u00a0      \n  J.P. de        71    Head of         2013    Yes              None    Human     \n  Weck                 Private                                          Capital   \n                       Wealth                                           Enterpr\u2026  \n                       Managem\u2026                                         Risk      \n                       Deutsche                                                   \n                       Bank AG                                                    \n                       Preside\u2026                                                   \n                       and CEO,                                         Audit     \n  Arnold               Carnival                                         Compens\u2026  \n  W.             67    Corpora\u2026        2013    Yes                 1    and\u00a0      \n  Donald               and                                              Human     \n                       Carnival                                         Capital   \n                       plc                                                        \n                       Former                                                     \n                       Chairman                                                   \n                       and CEO,                                                   \n                       The                                              Compens\u2026  \n                       Cardea                                           and       \n  Linda                Group,                                           Human     \n  P.             71    LLC;

Our\nBoard provides active and independent oversight of management. To carry out its\nresponsibilities and set the appropriate tone at the top, our Board is keenly\nfocused on the character, integrity, and qualifications of its members, and its\nleadership structure and composition. Our Board believes our directors best serve\nour company and shareholders by possessing high personal integrity and character,\ndemonstrated management and leadership ability, extensive experience within our\nindustry and across sectors, and the ability to exercise their sound and\nindependent judgment in a collegial manner. Our Board seeks directors whose\ncomplementary knowledge, experience, and skills provide a broad range of\nperspectives and leadership expertise in financial services and other global,\nhighly complex and regulated industries, strategic planning and business\ndevelopment, business operations, marketing and distribution, technology,\ncybersecurity, risk management and financial controls, human capital management,\ncorporate governance, public policy, and other areas important to our company\u0092s\nstrategy and oversight. Our Board assesses directors\u0092 age and tenure, and Board\ncontinuity; it strives to achieve a balance between the perspectives of new\ndirectors and those of longer-serving directors with industry and institutional\ninsights. Our Board also evaluates whether directors are able to devote the time\nnecessary to discharge their duties considering the time commitment involved in\nserving on the Board and its committees. Our Board views diversity as a priority\nand seeks representation across a range of attributes. It regularly assesses our\nBoard\u0092s diversity when identifying and evaluating director candidates. See the\nnext page. In addition, our Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability\nCommittee follows applicable regulations in confirming that our Board includes\nmembers who are independent, possess financial literacy and expertise, an\nunderstanding of risk management principles, policies, and practices, and have\nexperience in identifying, assessing, and managing risk exposures. Our current\nBoard, including the 14 director nominees, reflects the Board\u0092s commitment to\nidentify, evaluate, and nominate candidates who possess personal qualities,\nqualifications, skills, and diversity of backgrounds, and provide a mix of tenures\nthat, when taken together, best serve our company and our shareholders. See \u0093Our\ndirector nominees\u0094 on page 12. Succession planning and the director recruitment\nprocess Our Board regularly reviews and renews its composition. Our Corporate\nGovernance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee is responsible for identifying and\nrecommending director candidates to our Board for nomination using a director\nselection process that has been reviewed and acknowledged by our primary bank\nregulators. The Board, in coordination with the Board committees, also regularly\nconsiders Board leadership succession planning and committee membership. With the\npending retirement of Mr. May, Chair of the Corporate Governance, ESG, and\nSustainability Committee, at the annual meeting, the Board, with input from that\nCommittee, has been reviewing committee succession and planning for leadership\nsuccession upon Mr. May\u0092s retirement.\n                         \n  10    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nProposal 1: Electing directors Assess. The Committee regularly reviews the mix of\nindividual directors on our Board to assess the overall Board composition. Among\nother factors, the Committee considers our company\u0092s strategy and needs; our\ndirectors\u0092 experiences, diversity, tenure, and age; and the attributes and\nqualifications our Board identifies in its self-evaluations to develop criteria\nfor potential candidates and assess whether these attributes and qualifications\nare additive to our overall Board composition. To maintain a vibrant mixture of\nviewpoints and benefit from the fresh perspectives brought by new directors and\nthe institutional knowledge and industry insights of directors having longer\nexperience on our Board, the Committee reviews measures that enhance the Board\u0092s\nsuccession planning process, including the appropriate retirement age and related\ntenure limitations, and ability to commit the time necessary in service to our\ncompany. For additional information on the average tenure of directors serving on\nour Board and each director\u0092s tenure, see \u0093Our director nominees\u0094 on page 12.\nIdentify. To drive effective Board renewal and director and Board leadership\nsuccession planning, the Committee has a regularly recurring agenda item to\ndevelop and review a diverse group of potential director candidates. Based on the\nfactors and criteria developed in the assessment phase, the Committee engages\nthird-party search firms to identify potential candidates for review. It considers\nand provides feedback on the then-current pool of director talent identified by\nsearch firms; the search firms periodically update the list of potential director\ncandidates based on Committee and Board input. In 2021, the Committee continued to\ndevelop the pool of potential director candidates using multiple external search\nfirms. In its work with the external search firms, the Committee emphasizes the\nimportance of diversity by requesting the inclusion of diverse candidates in its\nconsideration of potential directors. Potential director candidates possess\nprofessional experiences and racial, ethnic, gender, nationality, and other\nrelevant attributes aligned with Committee-specified criteria and with the\nqualities identified by our Board in recent self-evaluations. See \u0093Board\nevaluation\u0094 on page 26 for additional information on our Board\u0092s self-evaluation\nprocess.

York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listing standards require\na majority of our directors and each member of our Audit Committee, Compensation\nand Human Capital Committee, and Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability\nCommittee to be independent. The Federal Reserve Board\u0092s Enhanced Prudential\nStandards require the chair of our Enterprise Risk Committee to be independent. In\naddition, our Corporate Governance Guidelines require a substantial majority of\nour directors to be independent. Our Board has adopted Director Independence\nCategorical Standards (Categorical Standards), published on our website at\nhttp://investor.bankofamerica.com, to assist it in determining each director\u0092s\nindependence. Our Board considers directors or director nominees \u0093independent\u0094 if\nthey meet the criteria for independence in both the NYSE listing standards and our\nCategorical Standards. In early 2022, our Board, in coordination with our\nCorporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee, evaluated the relevant\nrelationships between each director or director nominee (and his or her immediate\nfamily members and affiliates) and Bank of America Corporation and its\nsubsidiaries, and affirmatively determined that all of our directors and director\nnominees are independent, except for Mr. Moynihan due to his employment by our\ncompany. Specifically, the following directors and director nominees are\nindependent under the NYSE listing standards and our Categorical Standards: Ms.\nAllen, Ms. Bies, Mr. Bramble, Mr. de Weck, Mr. Donald, Ms. Hudson, Ms. Lozano, Mr.\nMay, Mr. Nowell, Ms. Ramos, Dr. Rose, Mr. White, Mr. Woods, Mr. Yost, and Dr.\nZuber. In making its independence determinations, our Board considered the\nfollowing ordinary course, non-preferentialrelationships that existed during the\npreceding three years and those applicable transactions reported under \u0093Related\nperson and certain other transactions\u0094 on page 48, and determined that none of the\nrelationships for the directors and director nominees set forth below constituted\na material relationship between the director or director nominee and our company:\n                                                                                  \n      Our company or its subsidiaries provided ordinary course financial          \n      products and services to all of our directors and                           \n      director nominees, some of their immediate family members, and entities     \n      affiliated with some of them or their immediate family members (Mr.\u00a0de      \n      Weck, Mr.\u00a0Donald, and Dr.\u00a0Rose). In each case, the fees we received for     \n      these products and                                                          \n      services were below the thresholds of the NYSE listing standards and our    \n      Categorical Standards, and, where applicable, were less than 2% of the      \n      consolidated gross annual revenues of our company and of the other entity.  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      Our company or its subsidiaries purchased products or services in the       \n      ordinary course from entities where some of our                             \n      directors and director nominees are executive officers or employees or      \n      their immediate family members serve or served in the past three years as   \n      executive officers (Mr.\u00a0Donald, Dr.\u00a0Rose, and Mr.\u00a0Woods).

Our\nBoard views the active, objective, independent oversight of management as central\nto effective Board governance, to serving the best interests of our company and\nour shareholders, and to executing our strategic objectives and creating long-term\nvalue. This commitment is reflected in our company\u0092s governing documents,\nincluding our Bylaws, our Corporate Governance Guidelines, and the governing\ndocuments of each of the Board\u0092s committees. Our Board leadership structure Our\nBoard\u0092s optimal leadership structure may change over time to reflect our company\u0092s\nevolving needs, strategy, and operating environment; changes in our Board\u0092s\ncomposition and leadership needs; and other factors, including the perspectives of\nshareholders and other stakeholders. In accordance with a 2014 amendment to our\nBylaws that was ratified by our shareholders at a 2015 special meeting called\nsolely for that purpose, our Board has the flexibility to determine the Board\nleadership structure best suited to the needs and circumstances of our company and\nour Board. Our shareholders reaffirmed their support for allowing this flexibility\nby voting against shareholder proposals seeking Bylaw amendments requiring an\nindependent Chair at each of our 2017 and 2018 annual meetings of shareholders. At\nleast annually, our Board, in coordination with our Corporate Governance, ESG, and\nSustainability Committee, deliberates on and discusses the appropriate Board\nleadership structure, including the considerations described above. Under our\nBoard\u0092s current leadership structure, we have a Chair and a Lead Independent\nDirector. Our Lead Independent Director is empowered with and exercises, robust,\nwell-defined duties. Our Board is composed of experienced and committed\nindependent directors (with all non-managementnominees being independent). Our\nBoard committees have objective, experienced chairs and members. All our directors\nare required to stand for election annually. Our Board, under leadership of the\nLead Independent Director, is committed to engaging with shareholders and other\nstakeholders. Our Board believes that these factors, taken together, provide for\nobjective, independent Board leadership, effective engagement with and oversight\nof management, and a voice that is independent from management and accountable to\nshareholders and other stakeholders. Our Lead Independent Director, together with\nthe other independent directors, exemplifies objective independent Board\nleadership, and effectively engages and oversees management. The Lead Independent\nDirector is joined by experienced, independent Board members and a Chair who, as\nCEO, serves as the primary voice to articulate our long-term strategy and our\nResponsible Growth. The independent directors provide objective oversight of\nmanagement, review the CEO\u0092s performance, determine and approve CEO compensation,\nhelp to establish our long-term strategy and regularly assess its effectiveness,\nand serve the best interests of our company and our shareholders by overseeing\nmanagement\u0092s work to create long-term value. Our Board, through its annual\nassessment, with input from shareholders, believes that the existing structure\ncontinues to be the optimal leadership framework at this time. As a highly\nregulated global financial services company, we and our shareholders benefit from\nan executive Chair with deep experience and leadership in and knowledge of the\nfinancial services industry, our company, its businesses, and our focus on\nResponsible Growth. Our Chair is also a global leader who is helping drive ESG\nprogress, including chairing the World Economic Forum\u0092s (WEF) International\nBusiness Council, which is leading efforts on standardization of ESG disclosures,\nand is co-chair of the Sustainable Markets Initiative. We and our shareholders\nalso benefit from a Lead Independent Director who is empowered (see next page for\na list of the defined duties); who is highly engaged and holds regular meetings\nwith our primary regulators, our independent directors, and our CEO and other\nmanagement members, and plays a leading role in our shareholder engagement process\n(see page 35).\n                                                                                  \n  Highly engaged Lead Independent Director                                        \n  The formalized list of                                                          \n  duties of the Lead Independent Director does not fully capture Mr.\u00a0Nowell\u0092s      \n  active role as our Board\u0092s independent leader.

In addition, our Corporate Governance, ESG,\nand Sustainability Committee has a process for implementing an orderly independent\ndirector leadership transition for our Lead Independent Director. Mr. Nowell was\nnamed as the successor to our retiring Lead Independent Director in the fall of\n2020, following an orderly succession planning process overseen by our Corporate\nGovernance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee, and assumed his role as Lead\nIndependent Director in April 2021 upon his reelection to the Board by\nshareholders at the 2021 annual meeting. To facilitate an orderly transition prior\nto assuming his role, Mr. Nowell worked closely with the then Lead Independent\nDirector. As Lead Independent Director, Mr. Nowell regularly meets with our CEO\nand key regulators, and meets quarterly with independent directors. He also\nregularly attends the company\u0092s shareholder engagement meetings and since fall\n2020, has joined more than 70 meetings with investors holding approximately 36% of\nour company\u0092s outstanding shares. He is expected to meet with additional\nshareholders prior to the 2022 annual meeting.

2022 PROXY STATEMENT    25  \n                              \nCorporate Governance Board evaluation Our Board and our Board committees\ncontinuously evaluate their own effectiveness throughout the year. The evaluation\nis a multifaceted process that includes quarterly one-on-onediscussions with our\nLead Independent Director, individual director input on agenda topics for Board\nand committee meetings and strategic planning sessions, executive sessions held in\nBoard and committee meetings without management present, periodic input to our CEO\nand senior management on enhancements to Board and committee effectiveness, and an\nannual formal self-evaluation developed and administered under the direction of\nthe Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee. Formal self-\nevaluation Information from research commissioned by the Board on the\ncharacteristics of highly effective and efficient boards identified five key areas\nwhere the research suggested high functioning boards and committees excelled:\nboard and committee composition; board culture; board and committee focus; board\nprocess; and information and resources. Composition.Through the self-evaluation\nprocess, our Board identifies qualities, relevant skills, and experience of\npotential director candidates that are consistent with the company\u0092s current\nstrategy and Responsible Growth, that allow the Board to effectively perform its\nrisk oversight responsibilities, and that would add to the Board\u0092s diversity. Our\nBoard also assesses its overall succession planning process and committee\ncomposition. Board culture.Our Board considers its role in setting the standard\nfor the company\u0092s culture and values by forging a collegial and collaborative\ndynamic that values independent judgment and emphasizes accountability. As part of\nthis review, directors evaluate how they interact among themselves and with\nmanagement, including the importance of challenging and holding management\naccountable. Enhancements to allow our directors to continue to effectively engage\nin the pandemic operating environment has been an area of recent focus. Focus.Our\nBoard and committees consider their primary oversight responsibilities, including\nstrategy, risk, ESG, and management talent and succession planning. Our Board and\ncommittees continuously reassess their focus and regularly engage in dialogue and\nsolicit feedback from management, shareholders, and other stakeholders and receive\nthird-party perspectives on the competitive environment, opportunities for growth,\nmacroeconomic trends, and geopolitics.\n                         \n  26    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nCorporate Governance Process.As part of the self-evaluation process, directors\nreview overall Board and committee structure, quality of meeting materials and\npresentations, the allocation of meeting time, cadence of meetings, and other\nmeeting processes. In addition, outside of our formal self-evaluation process,\neach of our directors also meets with management and with our Lead Independent\nDirector through a combination of executive sessions, smaller group sessions, and\none-on-onemeetings. Directors are focused on Board and committee meeting structure\nso as to allow ample time for discussion, debate, and in-depthreview of key topics\nand trends, as well understandable, clear, and streamlined materials that identify\nkey issues. Information and resources.Through the self-evaluation process, our\nBoard and committees evaluate the amount and type of information, education, and\ntraining opportunities they receive both from management and outside advisors and\nexperts. Our directors continue to highlight the need for clear, comprehensive,\nand concise information to effectively support their oversight responsibilities.\nRecently directors evaluated the type of information received related to the\nCOVID-19pandemic, the resulting economic environment, and management\u0092s response.\nOur Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee considered industry\ntrends, practices of our peers, feedback from shareholders, and regulatory\ndevelopments in developing the formal 2021 self-evaluation. The formal 2021 self-\nevaluation solicited directors\u0092 views on topics in each of the five key areas of\nboard effectiveness, including topics relating to the continued impact of the\nCOVID-19pandemic on our company\u0092s and Board\u0092s operating environment, management\nsuccession planning, recent regulatory guidance related to board effectiveness,\ninput from shareholders learned in the shareholder engagement discussions, and\nactions taken in response to the prior year\u0092s evaluation. As part of its ongoing\nreview of Board and committee composition, the Corporate Governance, ESG, and\nSustainability Committee also continued to seek input on the Board\u0092s director\nsuccession planning process, including Board leadership succession planning.\nResults are shared with management, as appropriate, to assist the Board and\ncommittees in making enhancements to address opportunities identified.\nEnhancements made in response to formal Board self-evaluations In response to\nfeedback solicited from our Board and committees in 2021, we continue to:\n

director education is vital to the ability of directors to\nfulfill their roles, and supports Board members in their continuous learning. The\nBoard encourages directors to participate annually in external continuing director\neducation programs, and our company reimburses directors for their expenses\nassociated with this participation. Our directors also attend forums and\nconferences convened by our primary banking regulators. Continuing director\neducation is also provided during Board meetings and other Board discussions as\npart of the formal meetings, and as stand-alone information sessions outside of\nmeetings. Among other topics, during 2021, our Board heard from our primary\nbanking regulators, global\n                              \n  2022 PROXY STATEMENT    27  \n                              \nCorporate Governance management advisors, an infectious disease expert, experts on\nfinancial technology disruptors, and from management on numerous subjects,\nincluding current geopolitical events, cybersecurity, digital banking, climate\nrisk, racial equality and economic opportunity, human capital management,\nincluding diversity and inclusion, and the COVID-19pandemic and many related\nconsiderations. All new directors also participate in our director orientation\nprogram during their first six months on our Board. New directors have a series of\nmeetings over time with management representatives from all of our business and\nstaff areas to review and discuss, with increasing detail, information about our\ncompany, industry, and regulatory framework, as well as compliance training. Based\non input from our directors, we believe this gradual on-boardingapproach over the\nfirst six months of Board service, coupled with participation in regular Board and\ncommittee meetings, provides new directors with a strong foundation in our\ncompany\u0092s businesses, connects directors with members of management with whom they\nwill interact and oversee, and accelerates their effectiveness to engage fully in\nBoard deliberations. Directors have access to additional orientation and\neducational opportunities upon acceptance of new or additional responsibilities on\nthe Board and in committees. CEO and senior management succession planning Our\nBoard oversees CEO and senior management succession planning, which is formally\nreviewed at least annually; two such planning sessions were held in 2021. Our CEO\nand our Chief Human Resources Officer provide our Board with recommendations and\nevaluations of potential CEO successors, and review their development progress.\nOur Board reviews potential internal senior management candidates with our CEO and\nour Chief Human Resources Officer, including the qualifications, experience, and\ndevelopment priorities for these individuals. Directors engage with potential CEO\nand senior management successors at Board and committee meetings and in less\nformal settings to allow directors to personally assess candidates. Further, our\nBoard periodically reviews the overall composition of our senior management\u0092s\nqualifications, tenure, and experience. In 2021, the Board also reviewed\nstrategies for enhancing representation of diverse teammates at senior levels of\nthe company and professional development for managers and senior leaders,\nincluding each of our eight lines of business and staff areas. As a result of this\nprocess and planning, in 2021 we announced several retirements and transitions for\nkey senior executive leadership\u0097the company added five new members to the\nmanagement team, including three women, further strengthening diversity at the\nmost senior levels. These changes were an outcome of our robust talent planning\npractices, following extensive engagement and discussions with the Board in a\nseries of meetings over time. The company\u0092s management team is comprised of\nindividuals with an average of 21 years of service with the company and 31 years\nin the financial services industry, with increased global and international\nexpertise, and is more diverse than ever before in the company\u0092s history\u0097the\nmanagement team, excluding Mr. Moynihan, is now 55% diverse, including 7 women, 2\nBlack/African American, 2 Asian and 1 Hispanic/Latino leaders. Our Board also\nestablishes steps to address emergency CEO planning in extraordinary\ncircumstances. Our emergency CEO succession planning is intended to enable our\ncompany to respond to unexpected position vacancies, including those resulting\nfrom a major catastrophe, by continuing our company\u0092s safe and sound operation and\nminimizing potential disruption or loss of continuity to our company\u0092s business\nand operations. Board meetings and attendance Directors are expected to attend our\nannual meetings of shareholders and our Board and committee meetings. Each of our\nincumbent directors attended at least 75% of the aggregate meetings of our Board\nand the committees on which they served during 2021. In addition all of the\ndirectors serving on our Board at the time of our 2021 annual meeting attended the\nmeeting (which was held virtually) on a remote basis. Our independent directors\nregularly meet privately in executive session without our Chair and CEO or other\nmembers of management present, and held 14 such executive sessions in connection\nwith Board meetings in 2021. Our Lead Independent Director leads these Board\nexecutive sessions.\n                                                  \n  Number of Board and committee meetings held in  \n  2021                                            \n                                                  \n                         \n  28    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nCorporate Governance Committees and membership Our Board has four committees.\nCharters describing the responsibilities of each of the Audit Committee,\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee, Corporate Governance, ESG, and\nSustainability Committee, and Enterprise Risk Committee can be found at\nhttp://investor.bankofamerica.com, and their membership is set forth below.

The Board and management\nregularly review the Risk Framework and Risk Appetite Statement for enhancements\nand improvements. The Risk Framework serves as the foundation for consistent and\neffective risk management by setting forth clear roles, responsibilities, and\naccountability for the management of risk and describing how our Board oversees\nthe establishment of our risk appetite, including both quantitative limits and\nqualitative statements and objectives for our activities. This framework of\nobjective, independent Board oversight and management\u0092s robust risk management\nbetter enables us to serve our clients, deliver long-term value for our\nshareholders and achieve our strategic objectives, and helps make our company a\ngreat place to work. Our Risk Framework outlines the seven key types of risk that\nour company faces\u0097strategic risk, credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk,\noperational risk (including third-party, model, conduct, technology, information\nsecurity and data risks), compliance risk, and reputational risk\u0097and addresses\nclimate risk and legal risk. It describes components of our risk management\napproach, including our culture of managing risk well, risk appetite, and risk\nmanagement processes, highlighting the responsibilities of all employees in\nmanaging risk. It also outlines our risk management governance structure,\nincluding the roles of our Board, management, lines of business, independent risk\nmanagement, and corporate audit within the governance structure. Our Risk Appetite\nStatement defines the aggregate levels and types of risk our Board and management\nbelieve appropriate to achieve our company\u0092s strategic objectives and business\nplans.\n                         \n  30    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nCorporate Governance Our directors have relevant risk management oversight\nexperience; see \u0093Our director nominees\u0094 on page 12.

The Committee regularly reviews: (i) company performance;\n(ii) our executive compensation strategy, approach, trends, and regulatory\ndevelopments; and (iii) other related topics, as appropriate. Each year, the\nCommittee reviews, and makes available to our Board, an executive compensation\nstatement, or \u0093tally sheet,\u0094 for each executive officer. The tally sheets reflect\neach executive officer\u0092s total compensation, including base salary, cash and\nequity-based incentive awards, the value of prior restricted stock unit awards\n(including the status of achieving any\n                         \n  32    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nCorporate Governance performance goals), qualified and nonqualified retirement and\ndeferred compensation benefit accruals, and the incremental cost to our company of\nthe executive\u0092s perquisites. The Committee uses this information to evaluate all\nelements of compensation and benefits provided to an executive officer. The\nCommittee also annually reviews market pay practices, including compensation\nbenchmarks at our primary competitor group, to evaluate market trends and\ncompetitive pay levels for our executive officers. For additional information, see\n\u0093Competitor groups\u0094 section on page 68. Annually, the Committee reviews with our\nBoard its compensation decisions (including cash and equity-based incentive\nawards, if applicable) for executives who report directly to our CEO. With respect\nto the CEO\u0092s compensation, the Committee makes a recommendation that is further\nreviewed and approved by the independent members of the Board. The CEO does not\nparticipate in Committee or Board deliberations about his compensation.\nAdditionally, for our Chief Risk Officer and Chief Audit Executive, the\nCommittee\u0092s pay recommendations are further reviewed and approved by our Board\u0092s\nEnterprise Risk Committee and Audit Committee, respectively. Executive officers do\nnot engage with the Committee in setting the amount of their own individual\ncompensation. During annual performance reviews for executive officers other than\nour CEO, the Committee considers our CEO\u0092s perspective and incentive award\nrecommendations before approving compensation for each of these executive\nofficers. In addition, the Committee considers the performance of our various\nlines of business, business segments and functions, as well as performance\nfeedback from our Chief Human Resources Officer and our independent control\nfunctions (Corporate Audit, Risk and Compliance, Finance, Human Resources, and\nLegal). The Committee has the sole authority and responsibility under its charter\nto approve engaging any compensation consultant it uses and the fees for those\nservices. The Committee retained Farient Advisors LLC (Farient Advisors) as its\n2021 independent compensation consultant. Farient Advisors\u0092 business with us is\nlimited to providing independent executive and director compensation consulting\nservices. Farient Advisors does not provide any other services to our company. For\n2021, Farient Advisors provided the Committee external market and performance\ncomparisons, advised the Committee on senior executive, CEO, and director\ncompensation, assisted in evaluating program design, and assisted with other\nexecutive and director compensation-related matters. In performing these services,\nFarient Advisors met regularly with the Committee without management and privately\nwith the Chair of the Committee. The Committee may delegate to management certain\nduties and responsibilities regarding our benefit plans. Significant Committee\ndelegations to management include authority to: (i) the Management Compensation\nCommittee to direct the compensation for all of our employees except for our CEO\nand his direct reports; and (ii) the Corporate Benefits Committee to oversee\nsubstantially all of our employee benefit plans. See \u0093Compensation governance\nstructure\u0094 below. Compensation risk management policies and practices Our\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee is committed to a compensation governance\nstructure that effectively contributes to our company\u0092s overall risk management\npolicies. Compensation governance policy. The Committee has adopted and annually\nreviews our Compensation Governance Policy, which governs our incentive\ncompensation decisions and defines the framework for oversight of enterprise-wide\nincentive compensation program design. Consistent with global regulatory\ninitiatives, our Compensation Governance Policy requires that our incentive\ncompensation plans do not encourage excessive risk-taking.\n                                                                                  \n                            Our Compensation                                      \n                            Governance Policy                                     \n                            addresses...                                          \n  \u0095\u2002\u2009Definition and process                             \u0095\u2002\u2009Policies on incentive    \n  for identifying                                      compensation plan          \n  \u0093risk-taking\u0094 employees \u00a0 \u0095                             effectiveness through      \n  Key goals and process                                testing and monitoring to  \n  for incentive                                        confirm that the plans     \n  compensation plan design                             appropriately balance      \n  and governance to                                    risks with compensation    \n  appropriately balance                                outcomes, including        \n  risks with compensation                              developing processes to    \n  outcomes, including:                                 administer cancellations   \n  O\u2009\u2009funding incentive                                 and clawbacks              \n  compensation pools                                   \u0095\u2002\u2009Policies that provide    \n  O\u2009\u2009determining                                       for the independence       \n  individual incentive                                 of our company\u0092s            \n  compensation awards \u00a0 O\u2009                             independent control        \n  use of discretion as                                 functions and their        \n  part of those processes                              appropriate input to the   \n                                                       Committee                  \n                                                                                  \n                              \n  2022 PROXY STATEMENT    33  \n                              \nCorporate Governance Compensation governance structure. Our compensation\ngovernance structure allocates responsibility so that our Board, Compensation and\nHuman Capital Committee, or the appropriate management-level governing body makes\ncompensation decisions with documented input from the independent control\nfunctions. This approach promotes effective oversight and review and facilitates\nthe appropriate governance to balance risk and reward. Below is an illustration of\nour compensation governance structure, which is influenced by internal\nconsiderations and external factors: Incentive plan certification process.\nPursuant to our Compensation Governance Policy, our annual incentive plan\ncertification and review process provides for a comprehensive review, analysis,\nand discussion of incentive design and operation. As part of the governance for\nincentive plans, each of the CEO\u0092s direct reports, along with their management\nteams and independent control functions (including their respective risk\nofficers), meet periodically to discuss how business strategy, performance, and\nrisk align to compensation. The relevant participants certify that the incentive\nprograms they review: (i) are aligned with the applicable lines of business and\nour company\u0092s business strategy and performance objectives, (ii) do not encourage\nexcessive or imprudent risk-taking beyond our company\u0092s ability to effectively\nidentify and manage risk, (iii) are compatible with effective controls and risk\nmanagement, and (iv) do not incentivize impermissible proprietary trading. Our\nChief Risk Officer also certifies all incentive plans across our company as part\nof the Management Compensation Committee\u0092s governance process. Farient Advisors\nand the Compensation and Human Capital Committee review these management\ncertifications. Incentive plan audit reviews. Corporate Audit annually reviews the\noperational effectiveness of the incentive compensation program, using a risk-\nbased approach to evaluate plan design, pay execution, program governance, and\nconformity with regulatory requirements. Conduct reviews. As part of our\ncompensation governance practices, management reviews the results of the conduct\nreview process so that conduct is consistently and appropriately considered in\nperformance assessments and pay decisions across the company. These performance\nand pay outcomes are reviewed at least annually by the Committee. Independent\ncontrol function feedback. In addition to reviewing the individual incentive\ncompensation awards for executive officers and other senior executives who report\ndirectly to the CEO, the Committee also reviews the outcomes of our control\nfunction feedback process and individual incentive compensation awards for certain\nhighly compensated employees. As part of its governance process, the Committee\nmeets with the heads of our independent control functions and business lines to\ndiscuss their feedback on the pay-for-performanceprocess, including how risk\nmanagement and conduct matters were factored into compensation decisions. These\nprocesses and reviews, in combination with risk management and clawback features,\nare key components of our compensation programs. These programs are designed to\nappropriately hold employees accountable, while balancing risks and rewards in a\nway that does not encourage excessive or imprudent risk-taking or create risks\nthat are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our company.\nHedging policy. Under our Code of Conduct and other policies, all Bank of America\ndirectors, executive officers, and certain other designated insiders are\nprohibited from hedging and speculative trading of Bank of America securities.\nThey may not engage in short sales or trading in puts, calls, and other options or\nderivatives with respect to our securities. All other employees may not engage in\nany such transactions other than transactions that hedge against an existing long\nposition in our securities if the shares underlying the position are readily\navailable for sale or delivery. No employee may hedge the value of outstanding\nrestricted stock units or other equity-based awards, and such awards may be\nforfeited or recouped for violation of our anti-hedging and derivative\ntransactions policies.

Our Investor Relations team regularly meets with shareholders,\nprospective investors, and investment analysts. These meetings often include\nparticipation by our Chair and CEO, Chief Financial Officer, or line of business\nleaders, and they generally are focused on company performance, strategy, and\nResponsible Growth. Our Lead Independent Director and management also regularly\nengage with our shareholders to solicit their views and input on company\nperformance, corporate governance, ESG, and other topics of interest to them, such\nas environmental initiatives, climate risk, racial equality and economic\nopportunity, human capital management, and executive compensation matters. The\ncombination of information received in Investor Relations meetings and shareholder\nengagement meetings provides the Board and management with insights into a\ncomprehensive scope of topics important to our shareholders. Our shareholder\nengagement program Board-driven engagement. Our Corporate Governance, ESG, and\nSustainability Committee oversees the shareholder engagement process and regularly\nreviews and assesses shareholders\u0092 input. Our Compensation and Human Capital\nManagement Committee receives regular reports on shareholders\u0092 input on\ncompensation and human capital management topics. Both our Chair and our Lead\nIndependent Director play a central role in our Board\u0092s shareholder engagement\nefforts. Our other directors may also participate in meetings with shareholders.\nCommitment codified in governing documents. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines\nand our Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee\u0092s charter codify\nour Board\u0092s oversight of shareholder engagement; they reflect our Board\u0092s\nunderstanding of the critical role shareholder engagement has as a routine part of\nour governance. Year-round engagement and Board reporting. Our Corporate\nSecretary, ESG, Human Resources, Investor Relations, and Public Policy teams,\ntogether with executive management members and our Lead Independent Director,\nconduct regular, year-round outreach to shareholders in-person(when possible) and\nby phone to obtain their input on key matters and to inform our management and our\nBoard about the issues that our shareholders tell us matter most to them. Our\nInvestor Relations and Corporate Secretary teams provide periodic company updates\nthroughout the year to our institutional shareholders, driving awareness of our\nsignificant corporate governance matters, environmental and social initiatives,\nand stakeholder impacts, and changes in our Board and executive management. We\nalso continue to improve our engagement and communications with our retail\nshareholders, including employee shareholders. Transparent and informed governance\nenhancements. Our Board routinely reviews and improves our governance practices\nand policies, including our shareholder engagement practices. Shareholders\u0092 input\nis regularly shared with our Board, its committees, and management, facilitating a\ndialogue that provides shareholders with transparency into our governance\npractices and considerations, and informs our company\u0092s enhancement of those\npractices. In addition to shareholders\u0092 sentiments, our Board considers trends in\ngovernance practices and regularly reviews the voting results of our shareholders\u0092\nmeetings, the governance practices of our peers and other large companies, and\ncurrent trends in governance. See page 37 for additional detail on recent\ngovernance enhancements our Board implemented. Our 2021 and early 2022 shareholder\nengagement initiatives Our Lead Independent Director, Mr. Nowell, and management\nhave met with shareholders holding approximately 34% of our shares outstanding and\nkey stakeholders throughout 2021 and in early 2022. As part of these discussions,\nMr. Nowell shared information about his transition to the role of Lead Independent\nDirector in April 2021. We obtained these shareholders\u0092 input and discussed their\nviews on, among other things, our Board\u0092s independent oversight of management, our\nBoard\u0092s composition and director succession planning and recruitment, and our\nBoard\u0092s oversight of senior management succession planning, our environmental and\nsocial initiatives, including our company\u0092s long-standing focus on racial equality\nand economic opportunity, and our human capital management practices. We also\ndiscussed the advisability of asking shareholders to ratify our Bylaw amendment to\nprovide for the Delaware Exclusive Forum Provision. See Proposal 4 on page 85.\nThese views were shared with our Board and its committees for their consideration.\nMore broadly, we sent periodic company updates to our largest 250 shareholders\nrepresenting approximately 66% of our shares outstanding throughout 2021.

There is a significant gap between the amount of capital needed to address\nthese global challenges and the amount that is being mobilized today. Private\nsector engagement is critical to closing this gap. Through the combined resources\nand expertise of the global financial community, governments, and nonprofit\norganizations, we are working to address problems through business decisions that\nimprove our communities, generate growth, and lead to a return on investment.\nSharing success with our communities Philanthropy.Our philanthropic initiatives\nare a component of our overall business strategies and a key part of how we make\nour growth sustainable. We have long shared our success with communities through\ntargeted, intentional philanthropic investments, and we have developed strong\npartnerships with nonprofit organizations to help address issues fundamental to\neconomic mobility and social progress. We focus on improving the lives of\nindividuals and families by investing in basic needs, workforce development, and\neducation, while also strengthening broader community vitality by addressing needs\nrelated to affordable housing, small businesses, and neighborhood revitalization.\nThrough our partnerships, we support vulnerable populations, including working\nfamilies, youth and young adults out of school and work, seniors, individuals\nliving with disabilities, veterans, and those impacted by the criminal justice\nsystem\u0097enabling them to move forward toward their goals. In 2021, we provided $370\nmillion in philanthropic investments to drive economic mobility in the communities\nwe serve, including more than $94 million in support of workforce\ndevelopment/jobs, $87 million for community development/affordable housing, and\nmore than $81 million for basic needs including nearly $5 million for natural\ndisaster and humanitarian needs. We continue to invest locally through our\nsignature philanthropic programs, Neighborhood Builders and Neighborhood\nChampions, supporting more than 1,400 local nonprofits and the leadership\ndevelopment of 2,800 nonprofit executives since 2004. Last year, we connected\n4,000 young adults across more than 80 markets to virtual and in-person summer\njobs. Racial equality and economic opportunity. As a company with national and\nglobal operations, our Board and management understand the need for real and\nongoing progress on assessing and addressing racial and economic inequality in the\nUnited States. Our long-standing commitment to advance racial equality and\neconomic opportunity includes multiple strategies from across our company. Through\nall of our activities, we drive positive change both within our company\u0097with our\nglobal teammates\u0097and outside our company. We enlist many independent third parties\nfor advice, counsel, perspective, ideas, and assistance. These third parties and\nother stakeholders represent a range of diverse perspectives and provide\ncontinuous feedback on our actions and progress, holding us accountable. Our Board\nand its Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee and Compensation\nand Human Capital Committee provide governance and oversight to these efforts. We\nregularly report on our activities, seek input from our shareholders about the\ntypes of information that would be useful to them in assessing our activities,\nreview that input with our Board and its committees, and provide additional\ndisclosures in response so that we are accountable for our progress. We will\ncontinue this cycle of work\u0097focus on ESG leadership, input and counsel from\nindependent and diverse perspectives, Board oversight, additional transparency,\nand accountability\u0097to power and amplify momentum on the flywheel that drives\nconcrete actions that further progress.\n                              \n  2022 PROXY STATEMENT    39  \n                              \nOur ESG leadership We have a demonstrable sustained record of promoting civil\nrights, racial equality and nondiscrimination, and advancing economic opportunity\nboth inside our company and with external stakeholders.

In 2005, we formed our National\nCommunity Advisory Council, or NCAC, a forum made up of senior leaders from social\njustice, consumer advocacy, community development, environmental, and research\norganizations from whom we solicit independent external perspectives, guidance,\nand feedback. Initially, the NCAC was predominantly focused on delivering against\nthe components of the Community Reinvestment Act. Over time, the NCAC\u0092s dialogue\nwith us has evolved to provide broader feedback as we examine our business\npractices and products, community investments, and diversity and inclusion\nefforts. In 2015, the NCAC was expanded to include environmental stakeholders to\nmore fully inform all our ESG efforts. The NCAC meets at least twice annually and\nhas been meeting with greater frequency during the pandemic. Our CEO and senior\nmanagement join these meetings regularly and our independent Board members have\nhad the opportunity to meet and hear directly from our NCAC advisors. Our NCAC\nadvisors provide multiple perspectives, engage in healthy debate and dialogue with\nus, and offer sound advice on critical issues affecting our clients, employees,\nand communities. Over the years, these advisors have informed our practices,\npolicies, products and services in numerous areas; they are important and valuable\nvoices helping us deliver Responsible Growth. Consumer products and retail The\nNCAC provided valuable feedback on the evolution of policies and practices in our\nefforts to reduce checking account fees, eliminate non-sufficient funds fees, and\nreduce clients\u0092 reliance on overdraft. Since 2010, we have engaged with our NCAC\nadvisors for their guidance and feedback on the many steps we have taken to\nempower our consumer and small business clients to bank with greater confidence\nand reduce overdraft usage. Their input helped inform our January 2022\nannouncement of significant changes to our overdraft services, including plans to\neliminate non-sufficient funds fees, reduce overdraft fees from $35 to $10, and\neliminate the transfer fee associated with Balance Connect \u0099for overdraft\nprotection service. In addition, the NCAC\u0092s perspectives on the needs of lower\nincome clients helped inform the product development of SafeBalance Banking\u00ae,\nAffordable Loan Solution \u0099, Better Money Habits \u00ae, and Balance Assist \u0099. The NCAC\nalso provides perspective on key societal issues such as access to credit,\nfinancial literacy, affordable housing, small business, and mortgage lending.\nWorkforce and jobs Our engagement with the NCAC members led to the pilot and\nsubsequent expansion, in partnership with UnidosUS, of Latinos in Finance, a\nworkforce development program focused on training bilingual talent for financial\ncenter positions. Additionally, our NCAC advisors provided input on our Pathway\u0092s\ninitiative designed to hire thousands of teammates from LMI communities. Racial\nequality and economic opportunity The NCAC\u0097especially those members focused on\ncivil rights, community development, and consumer advocacy\u0097helped inform the\ndevelopment of our $1.25 billion, five-year commitment to advance racial equality\nand economic opportunity. Our commitment to racial equality spans the company and\nis rooted in our long-standing diversity and inclusion practices, including hiring\nand retention, compensation, benefits, and our employee networks. Our NCAC\nadvisors continue to provide input on areas where we need to increase transparency\nor should focus our attention. Environmental commitments As we continue our work\nto address climate change and the demands on Earth\u0092s natural resources, our NCAC\nadvisors have been instrumental in providing counsel, including how we deliver on\nand work to achieve our Net Zero Goal.

Minimize BAC\u0092s\nimpact on the climate: net zero before 2050 . In 2021, we announced our Net Zero\nGoal to achieve net zero GHG emissions in our financing activities, operations,\nand supply chain before 2050. Achieving this goal will require technological\nadvances, clearly defined roadmaps for industry sectors, public policies, and\nbetter emissions data reporting, as well as ongoing, strong and active engagement\nwith clients, suppliers, investors, government officials, and other stakeholders.\nWe are dedicating significant financial, intellectual, philanthropic, and\ncatalytic capital to support the advancement of developing technologies, such as\nsustainable agriculture and biofuels, water infrastructure, clean hydrogen, waste-\nto-energy,and carbon capture and sequestration. Tracking our progress towards\nachieving our Net Zero Goal includes establishing the baseline for emissions\nassociated with our financing activities, often referred to as financed emissions.\nWe joined the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials or PCAF in 2020 and, in\ncollaboration with 15 other financial institutions, helped develop a consistent\nmethodology to assess and disclose financed emissions. Additionally, given the\nurgency required to address climate change, we helped launch the Net-Zero Banking\nAlliance or NZBA in April 2021, which outlines guidelines for banks to achieve net\nzero GHG emissions, including the requirements for setting long-term and interim\ntargets using widely accepted, science-based scenarios as well as establishing an\nemissions baseline and annually measuring and reporting the emissions profile of\ntheir lending portfolios and investment activities. As a member of NZBA, our\ncompany and more than 100 other financial institution members representing more\nthan 40% of the world\u0092s banking assets, have committed to set science-aligned\nemission reduction targets for 2030. In addition to PCAF and NZBA, in 2021, we\njoined a number of coalitions focused on collaborating to accelerate the clean\nenergy transition, including: Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, which\nincludes NZBA and brings together leading financial institutions to accelerate the\ntransition to a net zero global economy; Breakthrough Energy Catalyst to\naccelerate the development of the climate smart technologies necessary to achieve\nnet zero emissions by 2050; and three efforts created by the WEF: First Movers\nCoalition (WEF and U.S. State Department) to mobilize collective demand for\ncritical emerging technologies essential for the net zero transition; Clean Skies\nfor Tomorrow Coalition to accelerate the supply and use of SAF to reach 10% of\nglobal jet aviation fuel supply by 2030; and Natural Climate Solutions Investment\nAccelerator to drive and aggregate corporate demand for 1 Gigatonne of CO\n2emissions through reductions and removals per year by 2025. In line with our PCAF\nand NZBA commitments, we expect to begin to disclose financed emissions no later\nthan 2023, and we expect to set 2030 targets for the significant majority of\nfinanced emissions in our portfolio by 2024. We plan to establish interim\nemissions reduction targets for high-emitting portfolios, and announce our first\nset of emission reduction targets for energy, power, and auto manufacturing in\nApril, 2022. To complement these targets, we are also reviewing opportunities to\nenhance our policies related to the support we provide our energy and power\nclients as we work with them to help finance their transition. In line with our\nNZBA commitments, we plan to regularly review our targets so that they remain\nconsistent with current climate science. Support clients in their low-carbon\ntransition . As we work to achieve our Net Zero Goal, we are focused on financing\nthe transition to a low-carbon environment by rebalancing our portfolios over time\nand supporting the low-carbon economy. In 2021, we announced a goal to deploy $1\ntrillion by 2030 to help accelerate the transition to a low-carbon,environmentally\nsustainable economy by providing lending, capital raising, advisory and investment\nservices, and by developing other client driven financial solutions to support\nlow-carbon energy sources and technology. This commitment anchors a broader $1.5\ntrillion sustainable finance goal to support both environmental transition and\nsocial inclusive development, which spans business activities across the globe.\nThese goals are aligned to addressing the United Nations\u0092 Sustainable Development\nGoals and are intended to help drive business opportunities and enhance risk\nmanagement related to the transition to a low-carboneconomy. Our multi-year\nfinancing commitment provides financial capital, along with significant\nintellectual capital, to develop solutions to climate change and other\nenvironmental challenges. It focuses on low-carbonenergy, energy efficiency, and\nsustainable transportation, in addition to addressing other important areas like\nwater conservation, land use, and waste.\n                         \n  42    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nOur ESG leadership We actively engage with our clients to support their\ntransitions to net zero GHG emissions. This engagement allows us to share our\nexpertise and perspectives, deepen our collective understanding of issues, engage\nin constructive dialogue, and, often, create connections between stakeholders with\ndiffering views. Our wealth management clients have been increasingly interested\nin the role that ESG criteria can play in evaluating portfolio risks and long-term\ninvestment opportunities as well as the positive societal impact their investments\nmay have. In response, our wealth management business has continued to expand on\nofferings that provide our clients access to strategies across multiple asset\nclasses that integrate ESG criteria into their investment approach. Assess &\nmanage climate-related risks.Effective management of climate risk requires\ncoordinated governance, clearly defined roles and responsibilities, and well-\ndeveloped processes to identify, measure, monitor, and control risks. We continue\nto build out and enhance our climate risk management capabilities. As climate risk\nis interconnected with all key risk types, we have developed and continue to\nenhance processes to embed climate risk considerations into our Risk Framework,\nrisk appetite, and risk management programs established for strategic, credit,\nmarket, liquidity, compliance, operational, and reputational risks. Our ESRPF\naligns with our Risk Framework and provides additional clarity and transparency\nregarding our approach to environmental and social risks, including climate risk.\nThe ESRPF also helps define how we deploy capital and resources to align our\nbusiness practices to our values.\n                                                                                  \n  Climate-related risks are divided       (2) Physical risks\u0097risks related to the  \n  into two                                physical                                \n  major categories: \u00a0 (1) Transition      impacts of climate change, driven by    \n  risks\u0097risks related to the               extreme weather events, such as         \n  transition to a low-carbon economy,     hurricanes and floods, as well as       \n  which may entail extensive policy,      chronic longer-term shifts, such as     \n  legal, technology, and market           temperature increases and sea level     \n  changes                                 rise                                    \n                                                                                  \nWe disclose our climate risk and governance practices under several frameworks\nincluding the ESG Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics developed by the WEF\u0092s\nInternational Business Council (of which Mr. Moynihan serves as chair). In 2020,\nwe issued our first report under the recommendations of the TCFD, and published\nour second Sustainability Accounting Standards Board Report in 2021. We plan to\npublish an updated TCFD report in 2022. This is in addition to publicly disclosed\ninformation about how we manage climate risk contained in our 2021 Annual Report,\nand reporting through the Global Reporting Initiative and CDP global disclosure\nsystem. Our governance framework establishes oversight of climate risk practices\nand strategies by the Board, supported by its Corporate Governance, ESG, and\nSustainability Committee and Enterprise Risk Committee, as well as the Management\nRisk Committee and the management-level Global ESG Committee. Our climate risk\nmanagement efforts are overseen by our Global Climate Risk Executive, who reports\nto our Chief Risk Officer. More details on our company\u0092s approach to addressing\nclimate change and managing risk in its financing activities can be found on our\nwebsite and in our ESRPF and TCFD Report. For more information about our climate-\nrelated goals and commitments, including emissions associated with our operations\nand supply chain and progress on our sustainable finance goals, see our 2021\nAnnual Report. Being a great place to work Fostering a diverse and inclusive\nworkplace We believe that our diversity makes us stronger, and our leaders embrace\ndiversity and inclusion as integral to our business success. Our commitment to a\ndiverse and inclusive environment starts at the top with our Board and CEO and\nextends to all teammates. Our CEO and management team set the diversity and\ninclusion goals of the company. Each management team member has action-oriented\ndiversity goals, which are subject to our quarterly business review process, used\nas part of talent planning, and included in scorecards reviewed by the Board.\nManagement team members cascade these goals across their organizations to support\ncommitment and accountability across the company. We hold all managers responsible\nfor driving a diverse workforce and an inclusive work environment. We also provide\nopportunities for managers to sponsor and support rising talent to continue\nbuilding our diverse workforce. The Global Diversity & Inclusion Council (GDIC)\npromotes diversity goal setting, which is embedded in our performance management\nprocess at all levels of the organization. The GDIC consists of senior executives\nfrom every line of business, has been in place for over 20 years, and has been\nchaired by our CEO since 2007. The GDIC sponsors and supports business, operating\nunit, and regional diversity and inclusion councils to provide for alignment to\nenterprise diversity strategies and goals. Our Chief Diversity & Inclusion\nExecutive partners with the CEO and management team to drive our diversity and\ninclusion strategy, initiatives, programs, and policies. We have built robust\nanalytics and put processes in place at all levels of the company including our\ntop three management levels comprised of approximately 1,650 people in senior\nroles, to drive progress and accountability.\n                              \n  2022 PROXY STATEMENT    43  \n                              \nOur ESG leadership\n                                                                                  \n  Transparency and accountability. Many of our shareholders have informed us of   \n  the importance                                                                  \n  they place on transparency and understanding our employee practices. In         \n  November 2019, we published our first Human Capital Management Report with      \n  details on all we do to support our employees and their families and our        \n  workforce diversity metrics                                                     \n  over time. In October 2020, we followed up with an updated report to provide    \n  information on the steps we have taken during the global health crisis, our     \n  focus on hiring, developing, and retaining diverse talent and the additional    \n  steps we are taking                                                             \n  to continue to build on our progress. In our 2021 Annual Report, we include     \n  Human Capital Management updates to continue to provide key information on our  \n  progress in being a great place to work. We routinely disclose our company\u0092s     \n  EEO-1 workforce diversity metrics in order to publicly hold ourselves           \n  accountable and to confirm whether we are delivering on our commitment to       \n  increase diverse representation across the company wherever                     \n  possible.                                                                       \n                                                                                  \nWorkforce diversity. We hold ourselves accountable for increasing diverse\nrepresentation by disclosing our employment metrics, measuring progress across top\nmanagement levels, making managers responsible for driving advancement on their\nteams, and building a robust pipeline of emerging talent through recruitment and\npartnerships at campuses across the world. By maintaining this focus, we believe\nour company is well-positioned to attract and retain diverse talent, better serve\nour clients and communities, and build meaningful connections among our teammates.\nOur company has built a diverse pipeline of candidates for positions at all levels\nof the company, including leadership positions, as demonstrated in our published\ndiversity representation metrics. For over a decade, our company has had a long-\nstanding practice of utilizing diverse slates in order to grow diversity at senior\nlevels of the company. To further demonstrate our commitment to this long-standing\npractice, we have formalized the use of diverse candidate slates into a policy.\nThe use of diverse slates at senior levels, among other broad based diversity\npractices, has helped to drive our strong progress against our aspirational goal\nwhere our employee population mirrors the clients and communities we serve. Our\nlatest measures show improvement in the diversity of our leadership, management\nand global workforce, including:\n                                                                                  \n                                                                   Since\u00a02015,\u00a0   \n  50% of our      55%                                              our\u00a0           \n  Board           of our           50%                             representati\u2026  \n  nominees        management       of our global                   of\u00a0teammates\u00a0  \n  are             team             workforce are                   of\u00a0color\u00a0in\u00a0   \n  diverse(1),\u00a0    is               women and                       the            \n  including       diverse(1),      49% people of                   top\u00a0three\u00a0     \n  36%             including        color.(2)                       management     \n  women.          32% women.                                       levels\u00a0        \n                                                                   increased      \n                                                                   +60%.          \n                                                  Since 2015,                     \n                                                  we\u0092ve seen                       \n                                                  improvements                    \n                                                  in                              \n                                                  representati\u2026                   \n                  Since 2009,                     of Asian,                       \n  People of       representati\u2026                   Black/African                   \n  color in all    of people of                    American and                    \n  management      color in our                    Hispanic/Lat\u2026                   \n  positions       Campus                          teammates                       \n  increased to    classes                         across key                      \n  41%             increased                       categories                      \n  since 2015.     +47%.                           like                            \n                                                  management                      \n                                                  levels 1\u00963,                      \n                                                  managers,                       \n                                                  executive/se\u2026                   \n                                                  level and                       \n                                                  mid-level.                      \n                                                                                  \nAttracting and retaining talent. A key aspect of Responsible Growth is attracting\nand retaining exceptional talent from around the world to our company. This starts\nwith how we recruit new employees and extends to the many ways we support their\nprofessional development and career growth. Starting with early identification\nprograms, we connect first- and second-year college students to opportunities\nacross the company to equip them with the knowledge and skills to meet their full\npotential. Our campus programs also pair thousands of interns with leaders across\nthe company to make an impact from the start. Our campus recruitment initiatives\nand partnerships are fueling a pipeline of diverse talent to our company.

Physical wellness . In addition to our support of our employees\nand their families during the global health crisis, our approach to physical\nwellness is based on how we can help employees address health risks and manage\nhealth care costs, including by providing robust health and insurance benefits and\nwellness and prevention resources. For the ninth year in a row, we held medical\npremiums flatfor U.S. employees earning less than $50,000 in performance year cash\ncompensation. And, for the fifth straight year, employees earning between $50,000\nand less than $100,000 saw nominal premium increases. We provided no-cost, virtual\nmedical consultations with Teladoc\u00ae and a 24/7 nurse linefor those enrolled in our\nnational U.S. bank medical plans. We introduced a new cancer support benefitfor\nemployees and loved ones to help schedule expedited appointments, coordinate care,\nrecommend a local facility and more. Emotional wellness . Mental health has been\nan increasingly urgent and important focus as the global health crisis continues,\nand we\u0092ve provided additional resources to help employees manage stress, build\nresiliency, and pursue mindfulness. We added access to licensed social workers and\npsychologists for youthsaged 13-17 through Teladoc in addition to the no-cost\nvirtual consultations with mental health specialists for employees in our national\nmedical plans. Over 23,000 telephonic and face-to-face confidential counseling\nsessionswere supported through our employee assistance programs (EAP), and we\nbegan offering on-site EAP counselors to support employees at some of our office\nlocations. Our Life Events Services teamhelps provide teammates with personalized\nconnections to resources when they need them the most, by tapping experts inside\nand outside the company for significant events like domestic violence, natural\ndisasters, terminal illness, survivor support and more. We continued to provide\nadditional resources from Thrive Global, including digital programs and access to\nThriving Families modules to assist with navigating new home and work routines.\nAll employees globally have access at no cost to mindfulness apps, company-led\nmindfulness training, and daily mindfulness practices to keep a focus on mental\nhealth throughout the year. We provide 26 weeks of parental leave for birth or\nadoption of a child, 16 weeks of which are fully paid for eligible teammates. Our\nFamily Planning Reimbursement programprovides teammates with the flexibility to\nchoose reimbursement for eligible adoption, fertility, and/or surrogacy expenses,\nup to a collective $20,000 lifetime maximum over the course of their career at the\ncompany, and our Family Support program (through our company\u0092s national health\nplans) offers additional support for new or future parents. To help employees when\nchild or adult care plans fall through, we increased our back-up care program to\noffer 50 days of back-up care for both adults and children (up from 40 days).\nUnderstanding that time off is important for emotional wellness, we added more\nflexibility with vacation and paid personal/illness days for U.S. teammates,\nincluding the option to carry over up to five days of accrued-but-unused vacation\nto the first quarter of the following year, every year, use up to five occasional\nillness days as personal days each year, and the addition of Juneteenth as a bank\nholiday.\n                              \n  2022 PROXY STATEMENT    45  \n                              \nOur ESG leadership Financial wellness . As our company\u0092s purpose is to help make\nfinancial lives better through the power of every connection, it is especially\nimportant that we support the financial wellness of our employees. That includes\noffering benefits and programs to help employees reach their short- and long-term\ngoals, plan for the future, and manage life\u0092s priorities. Examples include: In\n2021, we enhanced our Child Care Plus\u00ae reimbursement programand increased the\nnumber of teammates eligible for this benefit and the amount of reimbursement to\n$275 per month, per eligible child to offer more assistance with childcare costs\nwhen employees need to be at work. Note: Specific programs vary by region. U.S.\nprograms shown. We offer education benefits to teammates and their childrento\nsupport their goals. In 2021, we provided $22 million in tuition assistance, a 40%\nincrease over 2020, for approximately 5,000 teammates. We automatically enroll\nteammates into the 401(k) planto help with saving for retirement. Based on service\nfor eligible U.S. teammates, we make an annual contribution of 2%\u00963% regardless of\nemployee 401(k) contribution level. We also offer matching contributions of up to\n5% of eligible pay on a dollar-for-dollar basis. We offer an Employee Relief\nFund,which allows teammates to receive up to $2,500 in relief per event for\nqualified disaster and up to $5,000 for an unexpected emergency hardship. Since\nthe beginning of the global health crisis in 2020, we have provided a total of $13\nmillion to teammates from the fund. Recognizing and rewarding teammate performance\nOur pay-for-performancecompensation approach strives to recognize and reward\nperformance with competitive and fair pay for the work each teammate does, at all\nlevels of our company. We believe our pay-for-performanceapproach\u0097combined with\nour focus on workforce representation\u0097will continue driving the advancement and\nrepresentation of women and people of color in our company. We pay our employees\nfairly based on market rates for their roles, experience, and how they perform,\nand we regularly benchmark against other companies both within and outside our\nindustry to help confirm our pay is competitive. We have a standard U.S. practice\nthat restricts the solicitation of compensation information from candidates during\nour hiring process so that we consider new hires for their individual\nqualifications and roles, rather than how they may have been previously\ncompensated. We are committed to equal pay for equal work. We maintain robust\npolicies and practices that reinforce equal pay for equal work, including reviews\nwith oversight from our Board and senior leaders. For over 15 years, we have\nconducted rigorous processes and analyses with outside experts to examine\nindividual employee pay before year-endcompensation decisions are finalized, and\nwe adjust compensation where appropriate. In 2021, we continued to compensate our\nemployees fairly and equitably as demonstrated through our equal pay for equal\nwork review. Our review covered our regional leadership hubs (U.S., U.K., France,\nIreland, Hong Kong, and Singapore) and India. Results of this equal pay for equal\nwork review showed that compensation received by women was on average more than\n99% of that received by men, and that compensation received by people of color in\nthe U.S. was on average more than 99% of that received by non-peopleof color\nemployees.\n                                                                                  \n                     $25 by 2025                                                  \n                     We are a national                         Sharing Success    \n                     and industry                              compensation       \n                     leader                                    awards(1)          \n                     in establishing an                        For the fifth      \n                     internal minimum                          year since 2017,   \n                     rate of pay above                         we recognized our  \n                     all mandated                              teammates with     \n                     minimums for our                          Sharing Success    \n                     U.S. hourly                               compensation       \n                     employees, and                            awards.            \n                     have made regular                         Approximately 97%  \n                     increases over the                        of employees       \n                     past several                              globally have      \n                     years.

The results of the survey and the process of continuous improvement\nthat ensues is discussed with the Board at least annually. In 2021, 89% of\nteammates (nearly 182,000 teammates) participated, demonstrating our employees\u0092\nwillingness to give us feedback on how we are meeting their needs. Since 2012, our\nEmployee Engagement Index Score has continued to trend upward, even during the\nglobal health crisis. We also measure an internal Diversity & Inclusion Index that\ngives us feedback on how we measure inclusion at work. Our Diversity & Inclusion\nIndex has a positive trend over time and exceeds industry benchmarks. We believe\nour employee turnover reflects the strength of our employee engagement results and\nhow our teammates view Bank of America as an employer of choice. Over the past\ndecade, our turnover rate has decreased and has been among the lowest in the\nindustry. Following a record low turnover rate of 7% in 2020 reflecting the\npandemic environment, like many companies, our turnover did increase in 2021 as\nlabor markets normalized. Even with that increase in 2021, we are seeing employee\nturnover at a similar rate as pre-pandemic record low levels of 11-12% turnover, a\nstrong result for a company of our size and scale.

Our policy covers\nany transactions where the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to\nexceed $120,000 in any fiscal year, our company is a participant, and a related\nperson has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. Under our related\nperson transactions policy, our Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability\nCommittee must approve or ratify any related person transactions, and when doing\nso, consider: the related person\u0092s interest in the transaction; whether the\ntransaction involves arm\u0092s-lengthbids or market prices and terms; the\ntransaction\u0092s materiality to each party; the availability of the product or\nservices through other sources; the implications of our Code of Conduct or\nreputational risk; whether the transaction would impair a director\u0092s or executive\nofficer\u0092s judgment to act in our company\u0092s best interest; the transaction\u0092s\nacceptability to our regulators; and in the case of an independent director,\nwhether the transaction would impair his or her independence or status as an\n\u0093outside\u0094 or \u0093non-employee\u0094director. Our Board has determined that certain types\nof transactions do not create or involve a direct or indirect material interest on\nthe part of the related person and therefore do not require review or approval\nunder the policy. These include transactions involving financial services,\nincluding: loans and brokerage; banking, insurance, investment advisory, or asset\nmanagement services; and other financial services we provide to any related\nperson, if the services are provided in the ordinary course of business, on\nsubstantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable\nservices provided to non-affiliates,and comply with applicable law, including the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Federal Reserve Board Regulation O. A number of our\ndirectors, director nominees, and executive officers, their family members, and\ncertain business organizations associated with them are or have been clients of\nour banking subsidiaries. All extensions of credit to these persons have been made\nin the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms, including\ninterest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time in comparable\ntransactions with persons not related to our company and did not involve more than\nthe normal risk of collectability. Occasionally, we may have employees who are\nrelated to our executive officers, directors, or director nominees. We compensate\nthese individuals in a manner consistent with our practices that apply to all\nemployees. The brother of Dr. Zuber, a director and nominee, is employed by the\ncompany in a non-executive, non-strategicposition, and received compensation in\n2021 of approximately $360,000. Dr. Zuber\u0092s brother\u0092s compensation is primarily\ncommissions based. The methodology through which his compensation is calculated is\nconsistent with that used for other financial advisors in similar roles. The\ncompensation and other terms of employment of Dr. Zuber\u0092s brother are determined\non a basis consistent with the company\u0092s human resources policies. Our company and\nMr. Moynihan are parties to an aircraft time-sharing agreement, as disclosed in\nprior proxy statements and approved by our Corporate Governance, ESG, and\nSustainability Committee in December 2010. In addition, the company and each of\nour executive officers have entered into nonexclusive aircraft time-sharing\nagreements. These agreements provide a means under Federal Aviation Administration\nregulations for our executive officers to reimburse the company for incremental\ncosts of permitted personal travel on our company\u0092s aircraft. To the extent such\naircraft usage exceeds the dollar threshold in our related person transactions\npolicy, it will be reviewed for approval or ratification by our Corporate\nGovernance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee. Based on information contained in\nseparate Schedule 13G filings with the SEC, each of Warren E. Buffett/Berkshire\nHathaway Inc. (Berkshire Hathaway), BlackRock, Inc. (BlackRock), and The Vanguard\nGroup (Vanguard) reported that it beneficially owned more than 5% of the\noutstanding shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2021 (see \u0093Stock\nownership of directors, executive officers, and certain beneficial owners\u0094 on the\nnext page). In the ordinary course of our business during 2021, our subsidiaries\nprovided and are expected to continue to provide financial advisory, sales and\ntrading, treasury, and other financial or administrative services to Berkshire\nHathaway, BlackRock, and Vanguard and their subsidiaries. These and other routine\nbusiness transactions between the companies were entered into on an\narm\u0092s-lengthbasis and contain customary terms and conditions. Our company and its\nsubsidiaries may also, in the ordinary course, invest in BlackRock or Vanguard\nfunds or other products or buy or sell assets to or from BlackRock or Vanguard\nfunds and separate accounts.\n                         \n  48    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nStock ownership of directors, executive officers, and certain beneficial owners\nStock ownership of directors, executive officers, and certain beneficial owners\nThe following table shows the number of shares of our common stock beneficially\nowned as of March 1, 2022 by: (i) each director; (ii) each named executive\nofficer; (iii) all directors and executive officers as a group; and (iv)\nbeneficial owners of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities (as\ndetermined under SEC rules).

The number of restricted shares awarded is equal\nto the dollar value of the award divided by the closing price of our common stock\non the NYSE on the grant date, rounded down to the next whole share, with cash\npaid for any fractional share. Dividends are paid on the award when they are paid\non shares of our common stock. The annual restricted stock award is subject to a\none-yearvesting requirement. If a director retires before the one-yearvesting\ndate, a prorated amount of the award vests based on the number of days the\ndirector served during the vesting period before retirement. Any unvested amount\nof the award is forfeited. 2021 Director compensation review Our Compensation and\nHuman Capital Committee annually reviews and periodically recommends updates to\nthe director compensation program to our Board for approval. The Committee\u0092s\nrecommendation takes into account our director compensation philosophy, changes in\nmarket practices, and consultation with the Committee\u0092s independent compensation\nconsultant, Farient Advisors. No changes were made to the form or amount of\ndirector compensation as part of the 2021 review. Director deferral plan Non-\nmanagementdirectors may elect to defer all or a portion of their annual restricted\nstock or cash awards through the Bank of America Corporation Director Deferral\nPlan (Director Deferral Plan). When directors elect to defer their restricted\nstock award, their \u0093stock account\u0094 is credited with \u0093stock units\u0094 equal in value\nto the restricted stock award and subject to the same vesting requirement\napplicable to restricted stock awards to directors. Each stock unit is equal in\nvalue to a share of our common stock but because it is not an actual share of our\ncommon stock, it does not have any voting rights. When directors elect to defer\ntheir cash award, they may choose to defer into either a stock account or a \u0093cash\naccount.\u0094 Deferrals into a stock account are credited with dividend equivalents in\nthe form of additional stock units and deferrals into the cash account are\ncredited with interest at a long-term bond rate. Following retirement from our\nBoard and depending on the director\u0092s selection, a non-managementdirector may\nreceive the stock account balance (to the extent vested) and cash account balance\nin a single lump-sumcash payment or in a series of cash installment payments.\nStock retention requirements and hedging prohibition for directors\n                                                                                  \n      Under our stock retention requirements, non-management directors are        \n      required to                                                                 \n      hold and cannot sell the restricted stock they receive as compensation      \n      (except as necessary to pay taxes on taxable events such as vesting) until  \n      termination of their service.

At our 2017 annual meeting of shareholders, a\nmajority of shareholders voted to have a \u0093Say on Pay\u0094 vote each year. As a result,\nwe will conduct an advisory vote on executive compensation annually at least until\nthe next shareholder advisory vote on the frequency of such votes. Although the\n\u0093Say on Pay\u0094 vote is advisory and is not binding on our Board, our Compensation\nand Human Capital Committee will take into consideration the outcome of the vote\nwhen making future executive compensation decisions. At the 2021 annual meeting of\nshareholders, 94.4% of the votes cast favored our \u0093Say on Pay\u0094 proposal. The\nCommittee considered this result and input from investors during our shareholder\nengagement process, and in light of the strong support, maintained a consistent\noverall approach for compensating named executive officers for 2021 full year\nperformance. Our Board has designed our current executive compensation program to\nappropriately link compensation realized by our executive officers to our\nperformance and properly align the interests of our executive officers with those\nof our shareholders. The details of this compensation for 2021, and the reasons we\nawarded it, are described in \u0093Compensation discussion and analysis,\u0094 starting\nbelow.\n                                                    \n  Our Board recommends a vote \u0093FOR\u0094 approving our     \n  executive compensation (an advisory, non-binding  \n  \u0093Say on Pay\u0094 resolution) (Proposal 2).              \n                                                    \nOur Board recommends that our shareholders vote in favor of the following\nresolution: \u0093Resolved, that our shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the\ncompensation of our company\u0092s named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to\nthe compensation disclosure rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,\nincluding the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and\nthe accompanying narrative discussion disclosed in this proxy statement.\u0094\nCompensation discussion and analysis\n                                                                                  \n  1.

Executive summary a. Executive\ncompensation philosophy Our compensation philosophy is to pay for performance over\nthe long-term, as well as on an annual basis. Our performance considerations\ninclude both financial and non-financialmeasures\u0097including the manner in which\nresults are achieved\u0097for the company, line of business, and the individual. The\n\u0093Pay evaluation and decision process\u0094 section on page 56 presents the range of\nperformance and governance considerations that the Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee considers as inputs into compensation decisions. These factors are\nevaluated each year and have remained generally consistent over time as part of a\nbalanced and disciplined approach to the compensation decision process. Within\nthat broader framework, the \u00932021 Company and segment performance\u0094 section on page\n57 highlights key company and segment performance considerations for 2021, and the\n\u0093Individual performance highlights\u0094 section on page 59 focuses on performance for\neach of our named executive officers. These considerations reinforce and promote\nResponsible Growth and maintain alignment with our Risk Framework. Our executive\ncompensation program provides a mix of salary, incentives, and benefits paid over\ntime to align executive officer and shareholder interests. Our Compensation and\nHuman Capital Committee has the primary responsibility for approving our\ncompensation strategy and philosophy, and the compensation programs applicable to\nour named executive officers listed below.

Shareholder engagement & \u0093Say on Pay\u0094 results We conduct shareholder engagement\nthroughout the year and provide shareholders with an annual opportunity to cast an\nadvisory \u0093Say on Pay\u0094 vote. At our 2021 annual meeting of shareholders, out of\napproximately 8.6 billion shares outstanding and entitled to vote over 94% of the\napproximately 6 billion votes cast favored our \u0093Say on Pay\u0094 proposal. This\nrepresents the 11 thconsecutive year of \u0093Say on Pay\u0094 approval of 92% or higher.\nAdditionally, in 2021 and early 2022, management and directors met with investors\nowning approximately 34% of our outstanding common shares and, at the majority of\nthese meetings, discussed our executive compensation program, human capital\nmanagement, and other compensation-related matters. These discussions, together\nwith the 2021 \u0093Say on Pay\u0094 results, indicated strong support for our 2020\ncompensation program and influenced our decision to maintain a consistent overall\napproach for 2021.\n                              \n  2022 PROXY STATEMENT    55  \n                              \nCompensation discussion and analysis 2. Pay evaluation and decision process Each\nyear, our Compensation and Human Capital Committee reviews our named executive\nofficers\u0092 performance using a balanced and disciplined approach to determine their\nbase salaries and variable compensation awards. The approach for 2021 included a\nrange of performance and governance considerations as inputs into compensation\ndecisions, which remain largely unchanged from prior years. In addition, several\nnamed executive officers transitioned to new roles in the fourth quarter of 2021\nand the Committee took this transition process into consideration when determining\ncompensation for 2021 for those new named executive officers. The Committee\u0092s\ncompensation decision process involves a robust review of company and line of\nbusiness performance as well as individual performance for each named executive\nofficer. Bank of America\u0092s performance framework for named executive officers is\naligned to the four tenets of Responsible Growth. At the start of each year, goals\naligned to the tenets of Responsible Growth are set for each executive officer and\nprogress to meeting those goals are tracked on scorecards, including both\nfinancial and non-financialresults. The Committee also takes into account the\nmanner in which results are achieved and creating accountability to building trust\nin our communities, application of our core values and performance relative to\npeers. Below are examples of the key metrics tracked across company, line of\nbusiness and individual performance, as appropriate by role.\n                      \n  Responsible\u00a0Growth  \n

SEC rules require that the \u0093Summary compensation table\u0094 include\nequity compensation in the year granted, while the Committee awards equity\ncompensation after the performance year. Therefore, equity-based incentives\ngranted in 2021 for the 2020 performance year are shown in the \u0093Summary\ncompensation table\u0094 as 2021 compensation. The equity-based incentives above were\ngranted in 2022 for the 2021 performance year. The \u0093Summary compensation table\u0094\nalso includes elements of compensation not shown above. Base salaries for Messrs.\nBorthwick, DeMare and Koder were increased to $1 million effective September 1,\n2021. Salary in the table above reflects salary delivered in 2021. Messrs. DeMare\nand Koder did not receive performance restricted stock units for performance year\n2021 as their compensation was determined based on their position for the\nsignificant majority of 2021. For a description of the pay components above, see\n\u0093Executive pay components & variable pay mix\u0094 on page 64. b. 2022 Management team\nstock awards In February 2022, the Committee granted Mr. Donofrio and Mr.\nBorthwick stock awards of 150,000 RSUs and 50,000 RSUs, respectively. These\nequity-based awards are separate and distinct from 2021 performance year\ncompensation. To receive full payment, the executives must remain employed by the\ncompany through the 4-yearback-loaded vesting period. In making these awards the\nCommittee considered a range of factors, including:\n                                                                                  \n      Record company performance in 2021, each executive\u0092s individual performance  \n      and track record of success, and ongoing                                    \n      criticality to the company in coming years.

Executive compensation program features a.\nExecutive pay components & variable pay mix Our Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee determines the pay for our named executive officers for each performance\nyear. Our pay-for-performancestructure is designed to emphasize variable pay and\nhelp motivate our executives to deliver sustained shareholder value and\nResponsible Growth. Restricted stock units are divided into the following\ncomponents: cash-settled (CEO only), time-based and performance-based. The CEO\u0092s\ncash-settled restricted stock units continue to vest over one year. Time-based\nrestricted stock units vest ratably over four years, to further drive long-term\nshareholder alignment. Our performance-based awards continue to use a re-\nearnapproach, meaning 100% of the award is the maximum that can be earned, and\nvest only if performance standards are met over a three-year period. Future\nperformance below these standards will decrease the amount paid, and no PRSUs will\nbe re-earnedif results are below the minimum standards.

Standards for performance restricted stock\nunits Re-earningthe PRSUs granted in February 2022 (based on 2021 performance)\nrequires the company to meet average ROA and average adjusted TBV growth standards\n(tax-normalized)over a three-year performance period from 2022-2024. The Committee\nmade no change to the standards for performance year 2021 PRSU awards. Under a\nhypothetical scenario, if our 2021 ending assets of $3.2 trillion remained\nconstant during the performance period, our company would need to earn $76.1\nbillion in aggregate net income from 2022-2024 to achieve the PRSU 80 bps ROA\nstandard. On an annualized basis, this equals approximately $25.4 billion in\nearnings which is higher than reported net income in nine of the last twelve\nyears. These performance metrics and standards encourage the achievement of\nsustained shareholder value and Responsible Growth. PRSUs are forfeited if results\nare below both minimum standards. PRSUs granted since 2017 provide no upside\npayout opportunity (100% is the maximum that can be re-earnedfor these awards).\nFor any portion of the PRSU standards achieved, payment will be made after the end\nof the performance period.

Multiple cancellation & clawback features\nOur equity-based awards are subject to three separate and distinct features that\ncan result in the awards being cancelled or prior payments being clawed back in\nthe event of certain detrimental conduct or financial losses. These features were\ndesigned to encourage appropriate behavior and manage risk in our compensation\nprogram. Our named executive officers are subject to all three cancellation and\nclawback features.\n                                                                                  \n          Detrimental conduct      Performance-based        Incentive             \n          cancellation\u00a0&           cancellation             compensation          \n          clawback                                          recoupment policy     \n                                   \u0095\u2002\u2009Applies to                                   \n          \u0095\u2002\u2009Applies to over        approximately 5,500      \u0095\u2002\u2009Applies to all of   \n          20,000 employees who     employees                our executive         \n          received equity-based    who are deemed to be     officers \u00a0 \u0095\u2002\u2009Our      \n          awards as part of        \u0093risk takers\u0094 and          policy covers a       \n          their 2021 incentive     received equity-based    broader group of      \n  Who     compensation, as well    awards as part of        executives than       \n          as all recipients of     their 2021               required by the       \n          our Delivering           compensation             Sarbanes-Oxley Act,   \n          Together equity-based    \u0095\u2002\u2009\u0093Risk takers\u0094 defined    which covers only     \n          awards granted in        according                the CEO and Chief     \n          March 2021               to banking               Financial Officer     \n                                   regulations and                                \n                                   company policies                               \n          \u0095\u2002\u2009An employee engages    \u0095\u2002\u2009Our company, a line                          \n          in certain               of business, a                                 \n          \u0093detrimental conduct,\u0094     business unit, or an                           \n          including: \u00a0 O\u2009\u2009         employee experiences                           \n          illegal activity         a loss outside of the                          \n          O\u2009\u2009breach                ordinary course of       \u0095\u2002\u2009When fraud or       \n          of a fiduciary duty \u00a0    business and the         intentional           \n          O\u2009\u2009intentional           employee is found to     misconduct by         \n  When    violation or grossly     be accountable based     an executive officer  \n          negligent disregard      on:                      causes our company    \n          of our policies,         O\u2009\u2009the                   to restate its        \n          rules, and procedures    magnitude of the loss    financial statements  \n          O\u2009\u2009trading positions     O\u2009\u2009the decisions that                          \n          that result in a need    may have led to the                            \n          for restatement or       loss                                           \n          significant loss         O\u2009\u2009the employee\u0092s                               \n          O\u2009\u2009conduct               overall performance                            \n          constituting \u0093cause\u0094                                                      \n                                                            \u0095\u2002\u2009Any incentive       \n                                                            compensation may be   \n                                                            recouped as           \n          \u0095\u2002\u2009All unvested equity                             determined by the     \n          awards will be                                    Board or a Board      \n          cancelled \u00a0 \u0095\u2002\u2009Any        \u0095\u2002\u2009All or part of the     committee             \n  What    previously vested        outstanding award may    \u0095\u2002\u2009Any action          \n          award may be             be cancelled             necessary to remedy   \n          recouped, depending                               the                   \n          on the conduct                                    misconduct and        \n                                                            prevent its           \n                                                            recurrence may be     \n                                                            taken                 \n                                                                                  \nSince 2011, all of our equity-based awards provide that they are subject to any\nfinal rules implementing the compensation clawback provisions of the Dodd-Frank\nWall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) that the SEC and\nNYSE may adopt. We intend to update our policies to reflect any applicable rules\nimplementing the Dodd-Frank Act clawback requirements that are finalized,\nreleased, and become effective. Pursuant to our Incentive Compensation Forfeiture\n& Recoupment Disclosure Policy, we will disclose publicly the incentive\nforfeitures or clawbacks recovered from certain senior executives in the aggregate\npursuant to our Detrimental Conduct and Incentive Compensation Recoupment policies\ndescribed above, subject to certain privacy, privilege, and regulatory\nlimitations. iii. Stock ownership & retention requirements Our stock ownership and\nretention requirements align executive officer and shareholder interests by\nlinking the value realized from equity-based awards to sustainable company\nperformance. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require:\n                                                                                  \n                      Minimum shares of                      Retention            \n                      common stock owned                                          \n                                                             50% of net           \n                                                             after-tax shares     \n  Chief Executive                                            received from        \n  Officer                                  500,000 shares    equity-based awards  \n                                                             retained             \n                                                             until one year       \n                                                             after retirement     \n                                                             50% of net           \n                                                             after-tax shares     \n  Other Executive                          300,000 shares    received from        \n  Officers                                                   equity-based awards  \n                                                             retained             \n                                                             until retirement     \n                                                                                  \nIn light of our policy, we expect new executive officers to be in compliance with\nthese requirements within five years. Full-value shares and units owned, awarded,\nor deemed beneficially owned are included in the stock ownership calculations;\nPRSUs are included only when earned and stock options are not included. Our Code\nof Conduct prohibits our executive officers from hedging and speculative trading\nof company securities. See the \u0093Hedging policy\u0094 section on page 34 for more\ninformation on our hedging policy and rules.\n                              \n  2022 PROXY STATEMENT    67  \n                              \nCompensation discussion and analysis 6. Other compensation topics a. Results for\nperformance restricted stock units PRSUs have been a component of our executive\ncompensation program since 2011. PRSUs require recipients to re-earnawards over\nthe performance period based on achievement of established performance standards\nand help align management with shareholder interests. Since 2013, PRSUs have been\nbased 50% on three-year average ROA and 50% on three-year average growth in\nadjusted TBV standards. Our practice is not to make discretionary adjustments to\nPRSU results for the impact of legacy litigation, fines, and penalties, the Tax\nCuts and Jobs Act, or impairment charges, which has contributed to outcomes for\nPRSU payouts since their introduction. The 2019 PRSUs completed in 2021 at 96% of\nthe target opportunity based on ROA results of 95 bps and adjusted TBV results of\n10.55%. We did not make adjustments to those awards in response to the COVID-19\npandemic and related effects. See the description of the 2019 PRSUs and vesting\nterms following the \u0093Grants of plan-based awards table\u0094 on page 62 of our 2020\nproxy statement. The maximum payout opportunity is 100% for all outstanding\nawards. The award terms for these PRSUs provide for the calculation of performance\nresults at the conclusion of each calendar year in the performance period. As a\nresult, the performance results above may differ from the results reported under\nGAAP in our company\u0092s audited financial statements. b. Competitor groups Our\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee periodically reviews compensation\npractices of two competitor groups:\n                                                                                  \n      Our primary competitor group includes five leading U.S. financial           \n      institutions\u0097we compete directly with them for                               \n      customers, employees, and investors, and they follow similar economic       \n      cycles to our own                                                           \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      Leading international financial institutions for perspectives on the        \n      global financial services industry                                          \n                                                                                  \nThe Committee used the following 2021 competitor groups to periodically evaluate\nmarket trends, pay levels, and relative performance in executive compensation, but\nwithout any formulaic benchmarking.\n                                                                                  \n              Primary                                  Leading                    \n              competitor                               internatio\u2026                \n              group                                    financial                  \n                                                       institutio\u2026                \n  \u0095\u2002\u2009                       \u0095\u2002\u2009Morgan       \u0095\u2002\u2009Barclays                \u0095\u2002\u2009HSBC        \n  Citigroup                Stanley                                                \n  \u0095\u2002\u2009Goldman                \u0095\u2002\u2009Wells        \u0095\u2002\u2009BNP                     \u0095\u2002\u2009Royal Bank  \n  Sachs                    Fargo          Paribas                   of Canada     \n              \u0095\u2002\u2009JPMorgan                  \u0095\u2002\u2009Credit                  \u0095\u2002\u2009UBS         \n              Chase                       Suisse                                  \n                                                       \u0095\u2002\u2009Deutsche                 \n                                                       Bank                       \n                                                                                  \nFrom time to time, the Committee also reviews executive compensation for a leading\ngroup of global companies headquartered in the U.S. spanning all industries to get\na general perspective on compensation practices for companies of similar size and\nglobal scope. For 2021, these companies were: Abbott Laboratories, AT&T, Chevron,\nCisco, Coca-Cola, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil, General Electric, IBM, Intel,\nJohnson & Johnson, PepsiCo, Pfizer, Philip Morris International, Procter & Gamble,\nVerizon, and Wal-Mart.\n                         \n  68    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nCompensation discussion and analysis c. Retirement benefits We provide our named\nexecutive officers the opportunity to save for their retirement via employee and\nemployer contributions to qualified and nonqualified defined contribution plans on\nthe same terms as other U.S.-based salaried employees. These plans help us attract\nand retain key people by providing a means to save for retirement. Certain named\nexecutive officers also participate in various frozen qualified and nonqualified\ndefined benefit pension plans. For more information about these plans, see\n\u0093Pension benefits table\u0094 and \u0093Nonqualified deferred compensation table\u0094 on pages\n78 and 79, respectively. Additionally, in June 2014 Mr. DeMare entered into a\nletter agreement with the company that provided him continued vesting for his\nrestricted stock units upon his termination. In 2021 we updated this arrangement\nand, consistent with the terms of the prior letter, entered into a new agreement\nto provide continued vesting upon termination for all his restricted stock unit\nawards, including more recently granted awards, subject to Mr. DeMare\u0092s compliance\nwith certain covenants, including not working for named competitive businesses.\nFor more information regarding the letter agreement, please see the section on\n\u0093Potential payments upon termination or change in control\u0094 on page 80. d. Health\nand welfare benefits & perquisites Our named executive officers receive health and\nwelfare benefits, such as medical, life, and long-term disability coverage, under\nplans generally available to all other U.S.-based salaried employees; in addition,\nour named executive officers are eligible to receive an annual physical exam.\nBecause we have internal expertise on financial advisory matters, we do not charge\nfees to our named executive officers for their use of our financial advisory\nservices for personal needs. We also may provide certain named executive officers\nwith secured parking. For information security purposes and efficiency, certain\nnamed executive officers are permitted to use a car service when commuting to and\nfrom our offices or business-related events; participating named executive\nofficers reimburse the company for incremental costs incurred. In limited\ncircumstances, we may occasionally provide meals and allow spouses or guests to\naccompany executives traveling for a business-related purpose and pay for other\nincidental expenses. Our policy provides for the use of corporate aircraft by\nsenior management for approved travel. For reasons of security, personal safety,\nand efficiency, we require our CEO to use corporate aircraft for all air travel\n(business, commuting, and personal). Pursuant to his aircraft time-sharing\nagreement, our CEO reimburses our company for costs related to his use of our\naircraft for commuting. Our executive officers, including our named executive\nofficers, other than our CEO, are permitted to use corporate aircraft for limited\npersonal travel with reimbursement to the company for incremental costs, pursuant\nto their aircraft time-sharing agreements. (1)Mr. Koder is party to a legacy tax\nequalization agreement related to equity awards granted before April 1, 2019,\nduring a previous international assignment prior to being named an executive\nofficer. Under this agreement, our company is responsible for certain additional\nforeign and U.S. taxes due, if any, from such equity awards as a result of his\nrelocation to the U.S., and Mr. Koder remains responsible for the amount of taxes\nincurred had he continued to live and work in his previous jurisdiction of\nresidence. e. Tax deductibility of compensation U.S. tax law limits a public\ncompany\u0092s deductions to $1 million per year for compensation paid to its CEO,\nchief financial officer, and each of its three other most highly compensated\nexecutive officers, as well as to any individual who was subject to the $1 million\ndeduction limitation in 2017 or any later year. The Committee continues to retain\nthe discretion to make awards and pay amounts that do not qualify as deductible.\n                                                \n  Accordingly, our Board recommends a vote \u0093FOR\u0094  \n  this proposal (Proposal 2).                   \n                                                \nCompensation and Human Capital Committee Report Our Compensation and Human Capital\nCommittee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion\nand Analysis that immediately precedes this report.

The grant date fair value is based on the closing price of our    \n       common stock on the applicable grant                                       \n       date (for 2021, $33.37 on February 12, 2021 and $42.92 on June 1, 2021).   \n       For the PRSUs granted in 2021, the actual number of PRSUs earned (0% up    \n       to the maximum level of 100%) will depend on our company\u0092s future           \n       achievement of specific ROA and                                            \n       growth in adjusted TBV standards (tax-normalized) over a three-year        \n       performance period ending December\u00a031, 2023.

The grant   \n       date fair value for PRSUs and TRSUs (excluding certain TRSUs granted to    \n       Messrs.

In late 2017, we amended our policy to require Mr.\nMoynihan to use only corporate aircraft for all business, commuting, and personal\nflights. We generally do not consider amounts related to business- and/or\nbusiness-development related flights as compensation to Mr. Moynihan, and we\nconsider the amounts related to Mr. Moynihan\u0092s required personal and commuting use\nof our corporate aircraft to be necessary business expenses for reasons of\nsecurity, personal safety, and efficiency. However, SEC rules require that we\ninclude in the \u0093Summary compensation table\u0094 the value of certain flights or\nportions of certain flights as a perquisite.\n                              \n  2022 PROXY STATEMENT    71  \n                              \nExecutive compensation Therefore, the amount shown for Mr. Moynihan for use of\ncorporate aircraft primarily reflects the aggregate incremental cost to our\ncompany for: (i) elements of business- and/or business-development related flights\nand (ii) all personal flights taken for non-commuting, non-businesspurposes. Under\nhis aircraft time-sharing agreement, during 2021 Mr. Moynihan reimbursed our\ncompany for certain incremental costs of flights on our corporate aircraft for\ncommuting purposes. Mr. Moynihan is responsible for his own taxes on any imputed\nincome resulting from his personal use of our corporate aircraft. As noted above,\na $45,000 regulatory filing fee was paid on behalf of Messrs. Moynihan and Montag\nrelated to their common stock ownership and continued receipt of stock-based\ncompensation, and a tax gross-uppayment of $36,375 and $60,584 was made to each\nrespectively in connection with that fee. We will make two charitable gifts in\n2022 to further our ESG efforts and to honor Mr. Montag\u0092s retirement. First,\ncontinuing our ongoing support of colleges and universities and their scholarly\npursuits on topics of importance to society and our industry, we will sponsor a\ngift of approximately $1 million for sustainable finance education at the Kellogg\nSchool of Management, in partnership with the Northwestern Institute for\nSustainability and Energy at Northwestern University. Second, in support of nature\nconservation organizations and their pursuits in preserving and protecting the\nglobal environment, we will sponsor a gift of $1 million to the Nature\nConservancy, which is a global environmental nonprofit organization working to\ncreate a world where people and nature can thrive, having over one million members\nin chapters around the globe, and impacting conservation efforts in seventy-six\n(76) countries and territories. Mr. Montag was not aware of these gifts prior to\nannouncing his retirement, did not have any involvement in determining the gifts\u0092\namounts, and will not receive any pecuniary benefit from them; therefore, we do\nnot consider them to be reportable compensation to him. Though included in the\n\u0093Summary compensation table\u0094 as \u0093All other compensation,\u0094 this table does not\ninclude any incremental cost to us for tax reimbursements of less than $10,000,\ncertain meals received by named executive officers while working in the office,\nany travel expenses to attend company meetings by named executive officers\u0092\nspouses or guests, or any other incidental event-related expenses incurred during\nthe year.

Deferred\ncompensation plan. Each of our named executive officers is eligible to participate\nin the Bank of America Deferred Compensation Plan (Deferred Compensation Plan),\nwhich is a nonqualified retirement savings plan that allows for deferrals above\nthe IRS limits on qualified plans. Participants may elect to defer up to 50% of\nbase salary and up to 75% of certain eligible incentive awards. Employer\ncontributions made under the plan, if any, when combined with the employer\ncontributions under the 401(k) plan, will not exceed the maximum employer\ncontributions allowable under the 401(k) Plan\u0097$12,500 for matching contributions\nand $7,500 for annual company contributions. Participants may generally elect to\nreceive their distribution in a lump-sumpayment or installments payable up to 15\nyears. Participants are not subject to U.S. federal income tax on amounts that\nthey deferred or any notional investment earnings (based on elections of the same\ninvestment options as under the 401(k) Plan) until those amounts are distributed\nto them, and we do not take a tax deduction on these amounts until they are\ndistributed. Legacy deferred compensation plan. Mr. Moynihan has an account under\nthe FleetBoston Financial Corporation Executive Deferred Compensation Plan No. 2\n(Legacy Deferred Compensation Plan), which is a nonqualified retirement savings\nplan. Prior to being closed to deferrals in 2002, participants could defer base\nsalary and certain bonuses under the plan. Participants can elect payments in a\nlump-sumor up to 15 annual installments either on or after termination of\nemployment, but not beyond the year in which the participant turns 65. Legacy\nsupplemental plan. Mr. Moynihan has an account under the FleetBoston Financial\nCorporation Executive Supplemental Plan (Legacy Supplemental Plan), which is a\nnonqualified retirement savings plan that allowed deferrals above the IRS limits\non qualified plans. This plan was closed to contributions in 2004. Payments are\nmade in a lump-sumor up to 15 annual installments beginning in the year of\ntermination of employment or any later year elected by the participant, but not\nbeyond the year in which the participant turns 65.\n                              \n  2022 PROXY STATEMENT    79  \n                              \nExecutive compensation Potential payments upon termination or change in control We\ndo not have any agreements with our named executive officers that provide for cash\nseverance payments upon termination of employment or a change in control. In\naddition, under our policy regarding executive severance agreements, we will not\nenter into employment or severance agreements with our executive officers that\nprovide severance benefits exceeding two times base salary and bonus (as defined\nunder our policy), unless the agreement has been approved by our shareholders.\nPotential payments from equity-based awards Our equity-based awards to our named\nexecutive officers include standard provisions that cause awards to vest or be\nforfeited upon termination of employment, depending on the reason for termination.\nThese provisions for awards granted in 2021 are described in more detail on page\n73, and those details can be found for awards granted in prior years in our prior\nproxy statements. In general, our awards provide for continued payments on the\noriginal schedule after certain types of termination of employment, subject to the\nfollowing conditions, as applicable in individual award agreements:\n                                                                                  \n      In case of a \u0093Qualifying Termination\u0094 (sometimes referred to in prior years   \n      as \u0093Rule of 60\u0094), the award                                                   \n      continues to be paid according to the award\u0092s payment schedule if the        \n      executive complies with certain covenants, including not working for a      \n      competitive business. A Qualifying Termination means any voluntary or       \n      involuntary termination (other                                              \n      than for death, disability, or cause) after the executive has met certain   \n      specified age and/or service requirements. For most of the named executive  \n      officers, the executive must have at least 10 years of service and his or   \n      her age and years of                                                        \n      service must add up to at least 60. Mr. Montag, who retired from the        \n      company effective February 28, 2022, had a special eligibility standard     \n      set forth in his applicable offer letter, which he had satisfied at his     \n      retirement, but otherwise met the                                           \n      general age and service standard. Currently, each of the named executive    \n      officers meets the applicable requirements for a Qualifying Termination     \n      (including Mr.\u00a0Montag upon his retirement).                                 \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      Awards remain subject to performance-based cancellation prior to payment,   \n      and may be cancelled in whole or in part if losses                          \n      occur. Awards also can be cancelled or recouped if the executive engages    \n      in detrimental conduct. Further, under our Incentive Compensation           \n      Recoupment Policy, the Board can require reimbursement of any incentive     \n      compensation paid to an executive                                           \n      officer whose fraud or intentional misconduct causes our company to         \n      restate its financial statements. Awards also will be subject to any        \n      policies we may adopt to implement final, released, and effective rules     \n      implementing Section\u00a0954 of the                                             \n      Dodd-Frank Act.                                                             \n                                                                                  \nAwards to our named executive officers under the BACEP are generally designed to\nbe paid per schedule if an executive\u0092s employment is terminated without \u0093cause\u0094 or\nfor \u0093good reason\u0094 within two years after a change in control. This change in\ncontrol treatment is often referred to as \u0093double trigger\u0094 vesting, because it\nrequires both: (i) a change in control and (ii) a subsequent involuntary\ntermination (either by our company without \u0093cause\u0094 or by the executive for \u0093good\nreason\u0094). The BACEP does not provide our executive officers \u0093single trigger\u0094\nvesting upon a change in control. If a named executive officer is terminated for\n\u0093cause,\u0094 our equity-based awards provide that the awards will be forfeited. The\nfollowing table shows the value of equity awards that would have been payable,\nsubject to the non-competeor compliance with covenants, as applicable, for a\ntermination of employment as of December 31, 2021. For this purpose, restricted\nstock units were valued at our closing price as of December 31, 2021, which was\n$44.49 per share.

As a      \n       result of his retirement, he will receive his                              \n       outstanding restricted stock units, which had a value of $43,640,742,      \n  (6)  according to the closing price of our common stock, $44.20 per share, at   \n       the time of his retirement, and will be paid in the same manner as set     \n       forth in the \u0093All other                                                     \n       terminations except for cause\u0094 column above.                                \n                                                                                  \nOther potential payments Following termination of employment, our named executive\nofficers receive payment of retirement benefits and nonqualified deferred\ncompensation benefits under our various plans in which they participate. The value\nof those benefits as of December 31, 2021 is set forth in the sections above\nentitled \u0093Pension benefits table\u0094 and \u0093Nonqualified deferred compensation table.\u0094\nThere are no special or enhanced benefits under those plans for our named\nexecutive officers, and all of our named executive officers are fully vested in\nthe benefits discussed in those sections. We make tax and financial planning\nadvisory services available to our named executive officers during their\nemployment with us. The standard form of this benefit continues through the end of\nthe year in which the executive ceases employment, including preparation of that\nyear\u0092s tax returns. This benefit may continue for an extended term of up to five\nyears if the executive meets the age and service standard for a Qualifying\nTermination and does not engage in any full-time employment. The benefit offered\nduring the extended term will end during the calendar year any other full-time\nemployment begins; the benefit, however, will end immediately following\ntermination for cause, or if the executive engages in detrimental conduct or\nbegins employment with a named competitor. Bank of America employees who retire\nand meet the applicable requirements for a Qualifying Termination have access to\ncontinued coverage under our group health plan, but the employee generally must\npay for the full cost of that coverage on an after-taxbasis without any employer\nsubsidy. By legacy agreement, Mr. Montag, who retired from the company effective\nFebruary 28, 2022, will now be able to access non-subsidized retiree medical\ncoverage, so long as he does not work for or accept another position with a\ncompetitor. An employee who is a former NationsBank employee and who was hired\nbefore January 1, 2000 is eligible for an annual supplement to help cover the cost\nof retiree medical benefits if they meet the \u0093Rule of 75\u0094 at termination. The\namount of this supplement equals $30 per year of service. An employee meets the\nRule of 75 if they retire after age 50, with at least 15 years of vesting service\nunder our pension plan, and with a combined age and years of service of 75 or\nmore. As of the end of the last fiscal year, the only named executive officer\neligible for these benefits was Mr. Donofrio. The amount of the annual retiree\nmedical benefit supplement for Mr. Donofrio based on his years of service through\nDecember 31, 2021 is $630. If Mr. Donofrio predeceases his spouse, this supplement\nwill continue at a rate of 50% for the life of his surviving spouse. Also, all\neligible employees hired before January 1, 2006 who meet the Rule of 75 when they\nterminate receive $5,000 of retiree life insurance coverage. As of December 31,\n2021, Mr. Donofrio was the only named executive officer who would have qualified\nfor this benefit.\n                              \n  2022 PROXY STATEMENT    81  \n                              \nCEO pay ratio CEO pay ratio Below is: (i) the 2021 annual total compensation of\nour CEO; (ii) the 2021 annual total compensation of our median employee; (iii) the\nratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to that of our median employee;\nand (iv) the methodology we used to calculate our CEO pay ratio:\n                                                            \n  CEO pay ratio                                             \n  CEO annual total compensation*               $23,739,465  \n  Median employee annual total compensation       $102,497  \n  CEO to median employee pay ratio                   232:1  \n                                                            \n* This annual total compensation is the \u0093Summary compensation table\u0094 amount, plus\ncertain nondiscriminatory benefits (including health insurance).

In selecting and approving a lead engagement\npartner, the Committee relies on relevant succession criteria established by\nmanagement and the Committee, interactions with prospective candidates,\nassessments of their professional experience, and input from our company\u0092s\nindependent registered public accounting firm. The Committee also engages in an\nannual evaluation of the independent registered public accounting firm. It\nconsiders, in particular, whether the retention of the firm is in the best\ninterests of our company and its shareholders, taking into account the firm\u0092s\nquality of service, the firm\u0092s institutional knowledge and experience, the firm\u0092s\ninternational capabilities, the firm\u0092s sufficiency of resources, the quality of\nthe communication and interaction with the firm, and the firm\u0092s independence,\nobjectivity, and professional skepticism. The Committee also considers the\nadvisability and potential impact of selecting a different independent registered\npublic accounting firm. After assessing the qualifications, performance, and\nindependence of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), which has served as our\ncompany\u0092s independent registered public accounting firm since 1958, the Committee\nbelieves that retaining PwC is in the best interests of our company. The Committee\nhas appointed PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm to audit\nthe 2022 consolidated financial statements of Bank of America Corporation and its\nsubsidiaries. Although it is not required to do so, our Board is asking\nshareholders to ratify PwC\u0092s appointment. If our shareholders do not ratify PwC\u0092s\nappointment, the Committee will consider changing our independent registered\npublic accounting firm for 2023. Whether or not shareholders ratify PwC\u0092s\nappointment, the Committee may appoint a different independent registered public\naccounting firm at any time if it determines that such a change is appropriate.\nPwC has advised the Committee that it is an independent accounting firm with\nrespect to our company and its affiliates in accordance with the requirements of\nthe SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Representatives of PwC\nare expected to be present at our annual meeting, will have an opportunity to make\na statement if they choose, and are expected to be available to respond to\nappropriate shareholder questions.

Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, and\ndiscussions with the Committee\u0092s independent disclosure counsel, the Committee\nrecommended to our Board that the audited financial statements for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 and the related footnotes be included in our company\u0092s annual\nreport on Form 10-Kfor the year ended December 31, 2021.

See Appendix B for the full text\nof our Bylaws\u0092 Delaware exclusive forum provision (the Delaware Exclusive Forum\nProvision). You should read Appendix B in its entirety before making a decision on\nhow to vote your shares on this Proposal 4. The Board is asking our shareholders\nto ratify its decision to amend the Bylaws to provide for the Delaware Exclusive\nForum Provision. The Board is taking this proactive step because upon consulting\nwith many of our largest shareholders, the Board determined it to be the most\nappropriate way to effect this provision. Following extensive review, and for the\nreasons stated below, the Board believes the Delaware Exclusive Forum Provision\nprotects shareholders\u0092 rights, is an appropriate risk mitigation measure, is\nnarrowly tailored to apply to only the specified Claims, is consistent with the\nmajority practice of S&P 100 and S&P 500 companies incorporated in the State of\nDelaware, and is in shareholders\u0092 and the company\u0092s best interests. While the vote\non this Proposal 4 is advisory, in the event a majority of shareholder votes cast\nvote against ratifying the Delaware Exclusive Forum Provision, the Board will\namend our Bylaws to remove the Delaware Exclusive Forum Provision. Reasons for the\nDelaware Exclusive Forum Provision The Board believes that the Delaware Exclusive\nForum Provision is in the best interests of the company and our shareholders for a\nvariety of reasons. The legal actions involving our company\u0092s internal corporate\naffairs that are subject to the Delaware Exclusive Forum Provision can continue to\nbe asserted but would need to be brought in a forum widely regarded as the\npreeminent U.S. court for corporate law and related business disputes. Having a\ndesignated forum is intended to help provide a streamlined, efficient and\norganized process for resolution of these disputes. The Delaware Exclusive Forum\nProvision helps to avoid the procedural and substantive problems and expense\nassociated with navigating multiple lawsuits, including derivative suits brought\non behalf of the company, across multiple jurisdictions on matters relating to the\ncorporate law of Delaware which would be expected to govern many such disputes. As\nnoted above, the Delaware Court of Chancery is widely regarded as the preeminent\ncourt for adjudicating disputes involving a Delaware corporation\u0092s internal\naffairs in terms of precedent, experience and focus. That court has experienced\njurists who have a deep understanding of Delaware corporate law and the duties of\ndirectors, officers, and employees, as well as procedures that can provide\nrelatively quick decisions that can limit the time, cost and uncertainty of\nprotracted litigation for all parties. This provides the company and our\nshareholders with more predictability regarding the outcome of these disputes and\ncan limit the time, cost, and uncertainty of litigation for all parties. The\nselection of the Delaware Court of Chancery as the exclusive forum for certain\ndisputes reduces the risks that the company could be forced to waste resources\ndefending against duplicative suits and that the outcome of cases in multiple\njurisdictions could be inconsistent, even though each forum purports to follow\nDelaware law. The Board understands that the Delaware Exclusive Forum Provision\nmay limit a plaintiff\u0092s ability to bring the specified Claims (including a Claim\nagainst directors, officers or employees) in a judicial forum other than Delaware,\nthough such plaintiff could request the company\u0092s consent to an\n                              \n  2022 PROXY STATEMENT    85  \n                              \nProposal 4: Ratifying the Delaware Exclusive Forum Provision in our Bylaws\nalternative forum. However, the Delaware Exclusive Forum Provision is narrowly\ntailored to only regulate the forum where plaintiffs may file Claims relating to\nthe specified actions\u0097it does not restrict the ability of plaintiffs to bring such\nClaims, nor the remedies available if such Claims are ultimately successful under\nDelaware law. Also, the Delaware Exclusive Forum Provision permits the company to\nconsent to the selection of an alternative forum if the company believes that such\nother forum is in the best interests of the company and our shareholders. The\nDelaware Exclusive Forum Provision was not adopted by the Board in reaction to any\nspecific litigation confronting the company. As of the date the Board adopted the\nDelaware Exclusive Forum Provision, and as of the date of this proxy statement,\nthere are no pending lawsuits relating to any Claim against the company, or any\nofficer, director, employee, agent, or shareholder of the company. Rather, it was\nadopted on a prospective basis to help mitigate potential future harm to the\ncompany and our shareholders. In particular, the Board believes that it is more\nprudent and beneficial to the company and our shareholders to take preventive\nmeasures before the company and the interests of most of our shareholders are\nharmed by the costly, common practice of filing claims in multiple jurisdictions.\nAs noted, the Delaware Exclusive Forum Provision increases the likelihood of\nspeedy and efficient application of Delaware corporate law by the Delaware Court\nof Chancery, and decreases the likelihood of unpredictable misapplication of\nDelaware corporate law by jurisdictions outside Delaware. Importantly, while the\napproach of our company and Board differs from typical practice in asking our\nshareholders to ratify the Delaware Exclusive Forum Provision, exclusive forum\nprovisions are very prevalent for large U.S. companies. Among S&P 500 companies,\n48% have adopted an exclusive forum provision, and 46% of S&P 100 companies have\nadopted such provisions. Among companies incorporated in Delaware, exclusive forum\nprovisions are even more prevalent: 64% of S&P 500 and 63% of S&P 100 companies\nincorporated in Delaware have adopted exclusive forum provisions. (1) As described\nelsewhere in this proxy statement, our Lead Independent Director and management\nroutinely engage with our shareholders and other stakeholders on corporate\ngovernance, ESG and business matters, as well as other items that may be of\nimportance to our investors and key constituencies. Prior to the Board adopting\nthe Delaware Exclusive Forum Provision, we met with shareholders representing over\napproximately 30% of our outstanding shares to, among other things, solicit their\nviews on adopting a Delaware Exclusive Forum Provision as well as the process for\neffecting the provision. Based on these discussions, we believe that our\nshareholders are generally supportive of the company having a Delaware Exclusive\nForum Provision. Although the Delaware Exclusive Forum Provision took effect\nimmediately upon adoption by the Board, the Board determined, including based on\ninput from our shareholders during the engagement process, that it would be\nbeneficial in this instance, to submit this Bylaw amendment to shareholders for\nvoluntary ratification at the 2022 annual meeting of shareholders with the\nunderstanding that, if shareholders fail to ratify the Delaware Exclusive Forum\nProvision, the Board will amend the Bylaws to remove the Delaware Exclusive Forum\nProvision.\n                                                \n  Accordingly, our Board recommends a vote \u0093FOR\u0094  \n  this proposal (Proposal 4).                   \n                                                \n                                \n  ((1)  As of January\u00a014, 2022  \n                                \n                         \n  86    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nProposals 5-7: Shareholder proposals Proposals 5-7: Shareholder proposals\n                                                        \n  Our Board recommends a vote                           \n  \u0093AGAINST\u0094 these shareholder proposals (Proposals\u00a05-7).  \n                                                        \nAs noted elsewhere in this proxy statement, we actively seek engagement with\nshareholders to solicit their views on different matters of importance to them. We\nencourage this dialogue and believe this engagement is beneficial to our company\nand Board. Of the three shareholder proposals set forth below, none of the\nproponents attempted to engage with our company prior to submitting their\nproposal. We sought to engage with the proponents after we received their\nproposals; we met with representatives of The National Center for Public Policy\nResearch, Trillium Asset Management, and National Legal and Policy Center. We\nacknowledge the rights of shareholders to submit proposals for inclusion in our\nproxy statement in accordance with SEC rules. We also encourage shareholders that\nhave questions or would like additional information about our practices or\npolicies, or that are contemplating submitting a proposal for inclusion in our\nproxy statement, to contact us beforehand to allow for a constructive discussion\nof their concerns. See \u0093Shareholder proposals for our 2023 annual meeting\u0094 on page\n99. Proposal 5: Shareholder proposal requesting a civil rights and\nnondiscrimination audit The National Center for Public Policy Research, 20 F\nStreet NW, Suite 700, Washington, DC 20001, has advised us that it intends to\npresent the following resolution: Civil Rights and Non-DiscriminationAudit\nProposal Resolved:Shareholders of the Bank of America Corporation (\u0093the Company\u0094)\nrequest that the Board of Directors commission a racial equity audit analyzing the\nCompany\u0092s impacts on civil rights and non-discrimination,and the impacts of those\nissues on the Company\u0092s business. The audit may, in the Board\u0092s discretion, be\nconducted by an independent and unbiased third party with input from civil rights\norganizations, employees, communities in which the Company operates and other\nstakeholders, of all viewpoints and perspectives. A report on the audit, prepared\nat reasonable cost and omitting confidential or proprietary information, should be\npublicly disclosed on the Company\u0092s website. Supporting Statement:Tremendous\npublic attention has focused recently on workplace practices and employee\ntraining. All agree that employee success should be fostered and that no employees\nshould face discrimination, but there is much disagreement about what non-\ndiscriminationmeans. Concern stretches across the ideological spectrum. Some have\npressured companies to adopt \u0093anti-racism\u0094 programs that seek to establish \u0093racial\nequity,\u0094 which appears to mean the distribution of pay and authority on the basis\nof race, sex, orientation and ethnic categories rather than by merit. (1)Where\nadopted, however, such programs raise significant objection, including concern\nthat the \u0093anti-racist\u0094 programs are themselves deeply racist and otherwise\ndiscriminatory. (2) Many companies have been found to be sponsoring and promoting\novertly and implicitly discriminatory employee-training programs, including Bank\nof America, American Express, Verizon, Pfizer and CVS. (3) This concern,\ndisagreement and controversy creates massive reputational, legal and financial\nrisk. If the Company is, in the name of racial equity, diversity and inclusion,\ncommitting illegal discrimination against employees deemed \u0093non-diverse,\u0094then the\nCompany will suffer in myriad ways \u0096 all of them both unforgivable and avoidable.\nIn developing the audit and report, the Company should consult civil-rights groups\n\u0096 but it must not compound error with bias by relying only on left-leaning civil-\nrights groups. Rather, it must consult groups all across the spectrum of\nviewpoints. This includes right-leaning civil rights groups representing people of\ncolor, such as the Woodson Institute (4)and Project 21. (5)It must also include\ngroups that defend the civil rights and liberties of all Americans, not merely the\nones that many companies label \u0093diverse.\u0094 All Americans have civil rights; to\nbehave otherwise is to invite disaster. Similarly, when including employees in its\naudit, the Company must allow employees to speak freely without fear of reprisal\nor disfavor, and in confidential ways. Too often employers like those mentioned\nabove have initiated discriminatory programming that itself chills contributions\nfrom employees who disagree with the premises of the programming, and then have\npretended that the employees who have been empowered to express themselves by the\nprogramming represent the true and only voice of all employees. This by itself\ncreates a deeply hostile workplace for some groups of employees, and is both\nimmoral and likely illegal.\n                                                                                  \n       https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1048911/000120677421002182/fdx38\u2026  \n       https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cf-noaction/14a-8/2021/asyousownik\u2026  \n  (1)  https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cf-noaction/14a-8/2021/nyscrfamazo\u2026  \n       https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1666700/000119312521079533/d1087\u2026  \n       08785_58                                                                   \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       https://www.americanexperiment.org/survey-says-americans-oppose-critical\u2026  \n       https://www.newsweek.com/majority-americans-hold-negative-view-critical-\u2026  \n  (2)  https://www.newsweek.com/coca-cola-facing-backlash-says-less-white-learn\u2026  \n       https://nypost.com/2021/08/11/american-express-tells-its-workers-capital\u2026  \n       https://www.city-journal.org/verizon-critical-race-theory-training         \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       https://www.city-journal.org/bank-of-america-racial-reeducation-program;

Our Board actively oversees management in our\npursuit of Responsible Growth, and considers racial equity and economic mobility\nas part of their oversight of strategic, operational, reputational, and compliance\nrisks among others. Our company management has established governance framework\nand oversight processes to improve transparency in our products and business\npractices, help clients access the capital they need to achieve their goals, work\nto develop our communities, and foster economic mobility. Oversight begins with\nglobal leaders representing every line of business and support function, including\nthe ESG, HR, Market President, and Public Policy groups. Through their service and\nparticipation on our Global ESG Committee, they provide overall leadership for the\ncompany in helping to identify, escalate, and oversee our response to emerging ESG\nrisks and opportunities. The committee discusses and addresses social and\nenvironmental issues that are significant to our company\u0092s business, including,\nbut not limited to diversity and inclusion, racial equity and economic inclusion,\nassessment of the societal and environmental implications of our product and\nservice offerings, and investments with the goal of contributing to creating an\nenvironmentally sustainable economy. The ESG Committee is also charged with\nproviding overall leadership of our progress against the $1.25 billion commitment\nto advance racial equity and economic mobility. The ESG Committee\u0092s leadership\nregularly reports to the Board\u0092s Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability\nCommittee (CGESC) on the company\u0092s ESG activities and emerging ESG opportunities,\nreviews human capital management considerations with the Board\u0092s Compensation and\nHuman Capital Committee (CHCC), and provides ESG risk updates to the Board\u0092s\nEnterprise Risk Committee through the Management Risk Committee. Given the\nimportance of this topic, the committee\u0092s leadership also regularly reports to the\nBoard on the company\u0092s ESG activities and progress, including on racial equity and\neconomic opportunity. For example, since announcing our $1.25 billion commitment\nto advance racial equity and support economic opportunity initiatives in June 2020\nand March 2021, the CGESC discussed related topics during nine meetings, the CHCC\nduring 10 meetings, and the Board during 10 meetings.\n                                                                                  \n  Regular reports to the board and its committees. For example, in 2021, the      \n  Board or its committees received                                                \n  information about the following programs addressing our focus on racial         \n  equality, diversity and inclusion and economic opportunity:                     \n  \u0095\u2002\u2009our $1.25\u00a0billion commitment to advance racial equality and economic          \n  opportunity, including the status of activity;                                  \n  \u0095\u2002\u2009our $17\u00a0million in funding, including                                         \n  capital investments and philanthropic grants to nonprofits, to support Native   \n  American communities;                                                           \n  \u0095\u2002\u2009our banking strategies for low- and moderate-income (LMI) communities,        \n  including communities of color, with information about products, employment,    \n  professional development, and investment, and philanthropic capital in LMI      \n  communities;                                                                    \n  \u0095\u2002\u2009our progress in exceeding the five-year                                       \n  goal to hire 10,000 individuals from LMI communities and our commitment to      \n  10,000 additional LMI\u00a0hires\u00a0by 2025;                                            \n  \u0095\u2002\u2009our progress to raising our U.S. minimum                                      \n  hourly wage to $25 by 2025; \u00a0 \u0095\u2002\u2009our provision of a record $6.6\u00a0billion in       \n  loans, tax credit equity investments, and other real estate development         \n  solutions through our Community\u00a0Development                                     \n  Banking (CDB); \u00a0 \u0095\u2002\u2009our strategies for enhancing representation of, and          \n  professional development for, our diverse teammates for each of our eight       \n  lines of business and each of our staff                                         \n  areas, including information about representation at management levels, our     \n  Employee Engagement Satisfaction Survey results, and results of pay equity      \n  analyses for people of color teammates; and                                     \n  \u0095\u2002\u2009our campus recruiting and talent                                              \n  acquisition efforts that produced our most diverse summer internship class on   \n  record during 2020 through increased efforts with Hispanic-serving              \n  institutions and expanded recruiting efforts at more than 60 Historically       \n  Black Colleges/Universities,                                                    \n  and the continued progress with diverse representation in the summer 2021       \n  internship class.                                                               \n                                                                                  \nWe have engaged with investors to understand the types of information useful to\nthem in assessing risks related to our impacts on civil rights and\nnondiscrimination, and we responded with additional disclosures.At our 2021 annual\nshareholders meeting, our shareholders voted on a shareholder proposal requesting\nthe company perform a racial equity audit and report on the results, similar to\nthis proposal, although by a different shareholder proponent. Over 73% of votes\nwere cast against that proposal at the 2021 annual shareholders meeting.\nSubsequent to the 2021 annual shareholders meeting, management continued to learn\nand receive input about racial equity audits, including: research about the\ncomponents and scope of a racial equity audit; engaging with peers and other\ncompanies that have conducted or agreed to conduct racial equity audits; meeting\nwith key stakeholders that have submitted such shareholder proposals, including\nthe Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, the New York State Comptroller,\nand SOC Investment Group; and meeting with key stakeholders that have published\nresearch about racial equity audits such as the Ford Foundation. We also discussed\nracial equity audits with our NCAC. During our shareholder engagements in late\n2021, our Lead Independent Director and management met with investors owning over\n30%, or more than 2.6 billion shares of our outstanding common stock. At these\nmeetings, we asked investors their perspectives about racial equity audits and\nspecifically discussed the advisability of such audits at our company. While these\ninvestors did not all share an identical perspective, they were in harmony in\ntheir: recognition of our company\u0092s leadership in activities and commitment to\nfurther diversity, equity and inclusion, and our focus on\n                         \n  92    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nProposals 5-7: Shareholder proposals racial equity and economic opportunity;\nrecognition of our company\u0092s transparency and disclosure of actions to further\nracial equity and economic opportunity; and interest in our ongoing process to\nsolicit input and feedback from independent stakeholders such as the NCAC on our\ncompany\u0092s products, services, and business practices. They shared an overall\nbelief that our company does not currently face issues of specific concern that a\nracial equity audit would help rectify. During our discussions, some investors\nexpressed a desire for increased consolidation of our disclosures and additional\ntransparency on the company\u0092s activities regarding racial equity, civil rights and\nnondiscrimination, and our activities to improve economic opportunity, which we\nhave addressed through the disclosures in our 2021 Annual Report that accompanies\nthis proxy statement. Consistent with our shareholder engagement process, we have\nprovided our Board with the input received from these investors. Our Board\nsupports the additional disclosures included in the Annual Report and believes\nthat a racial equity audit as requested in this proposal would not be in the best\ninterest of shareholders. Our shareholders, employees, customers, and communities\nare well served by our continuous and holistic pursuit of Responsible Growth that\nincludes continued engagement and progress on racial equality, civil rights and\nnondiscrimination. The Board believes the moment-in-time audit as requested by the\nproposal will not provide helpful information to investors. As we have described\nabove, protecting and promoting civil rights, racial equality, diversity and\ninclusion, nondiscrimination, and economic opportunity, both inside our company\nwith employees and outside our company in our communities, are critical components\nof Responsible Growth. We recognize that we have more work to do on these issues.\nBy continuing to pursue sustainable Responsible Growth that requires a focus on\nsharing our success, being a great place to work for our teammates, and driving\noperational excellence to invest in our employees and our communities, we believe\nwe already are on the right path in our journey for continued improvement. Our\nongoing efforts in the matters described above, including our continuous\nengagement with shareholders, employees, and external experts and stakeholders\nrepresenting a wide range of perspectives, and our Board\u0092s oversight and\nleadership of our efforts, demonstrate our commitment to understanding and\nimproving our company\u0092s impacts on all stakeholders. Our Board believes that\nResponsible Growth is the right path to making meaningful progress for our\ncustomers, communities, and teammates and is best achieved through ongoing\nengagement and collaboration with experts on civil rights, racial equity,\ndiversity and inclusion, and nondiscrimination. These ongoing engagements help\ndrive progress and hold us accountable for our actions. The proposal\u0092s one-time\naudit would distract time, attention and resources from the continuous engagement\nwe already undertake. As a result, our Board believes that the racial equity audit\nand related report are unnecessary as demonstrated by: our numerous evolving\ninitiatives to advance economic opportunity for our customers, communities, and\nteammates; our ongoing engagement with outside experts and stakeholders to review,\nassess, and enhance our business; and the specific actions and demonstrable\nprogress we have made with respect to those commitments.\n                                                    \n  Accordingly, our Board recommends a vote \u0093AGAINST\u0094  \n  this proposal (Proposal 5).                       \n                                                    \nProposal 6: Shareholder proposal requesting adoption of policy to cease financing\nnew fossil fuel supplies Sada Geuss, c/o Trillium Asset Management, Two Financial\nCenter, 60 South Street, Suite 1100, Boston, MA, 02111, and other co-filershave\nadvised us that they intend to present the following resolution: Bank of America \u0096\n2022 Climate change is a global challenge that continues to gain widespread\nattention for its numerous, significant environmental and social impacts. Fossil\nfuels are hot button political and significant policy issues, because of their\nimpacts on the global climate, local environments, and human rights. Exceeding 1.5\ndegrees Celsius presents risks to the economy, investors, and banks\u0092\nprofitability: limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees versus 2 degrees has been\nprojected to save $20 trillion globally by 2100, and exceeding 2 degrees could\nlead to climate damages in the hundreds of trillions. Estimates find 10% of total\nglobal economic value stands to be lost by 2050 under current emissions\ntrajectories. (1) In 2021, the International Energy Agency (IEA) found that in\norder to ensure global warming of no higher than 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2100 and\nnet zero emissions by 2050, \u0094there is no need for investment in new fossil fuel\nsupply.\u0094 (2)Bank of America (BAC) has publicly committed to reach net-\nzerogreenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and to aim to limit warming to 1.5 degrees.\nAlthough BAC has restricted financing for Arctic drilling and coal operations, it\nhas not committed to halt financing for all new fossil fuel development that a\nnet-zerocommitment requires. According to the 2021 Banking on Climate Chaosreport,\nBAC is the third-highest financier of companies expanding fossil fuels, and has\ndramatically increased financing for such companies since 2016. BAC acknowledges\n\u0094a range of risks associated with our current levels of fossil fuel financing\u0094 in\nits most recent Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures report, and\nreferences efforts to reduce emissions by \u0094engaging with clients and accelerating\ntheir progress toward low-carbonbusiness models.\u0094 (3)The IEA\u0092s 1.5 degree\nscenario, however, does not allow for any new fossil fuel development, which BAC\ncontinues to finance, irrespective of its engagement efforts.\n                                                                                  \n  (1)  https://www.swissre.com/institute/research/topics-and-risk-dialogues/cli\u2026  \n                                                                                  \n                                                      \n  (2)  https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050.  \n                                                      \n                                                                                  \n  (3)  https://about.bankofamerica.com/content/dam/about/pdfs/task-force-climat\u2026  \n                                                                                  \n                              \n  2022 PROXY STATEMENT    93  \n                              \nProposals 5-7: Shareholder proposals Physical and transition risks from fossil\nfuel present increased credit, market, reputation, and operational risks to banks.\nEven short-term financing for carbon intensive activities today contribute to\nlong-term financial and physical risks from climate change in the future: the\nIPCC\u0092s 2021 report confirmed that historic and current emissions have locked in\nwarming for the next two decades. Public calls for an end to fossil fuel finance\nhave grown, and could threaten BAC\u0092s reputation, particularly if BAC is seen as\nnot living up to its publicly stated commitments. For example, in September 2021,\nBAC and other large banks were called out in an op-edby youth climate activists\nengaging in direct action to pressure banks to stop financing the expansion of\nfossil fuels. (4) RESOLVED: Shareholders request the Company build upon its net\nzero commitment by adopting a policy by the end of 2022 in which the company takes\navailable actions to help ensure that its financing does not contribute to new\nfossil fuel supplies that would be inconsistent with the IEA\u0092s Net Zero Emissions\nby 2050 Scenario.

We\nunderstand and recognize our responsibility to help address and build resilience\nto climate change by using our expertise and resources, as well as our scale, to\nassist in accelerating the transition from a high-carbon to a low-carbonsociety.\nOur company supports the Paris Agreement on climate change, the importance of\ntaking action to help keep global temperature rise this century to below 2\u00b0C above\npre-industriallevels, and efforts to limit the temperature increase to no more\nthan 1.5\u00b0C. Doing so will require the transformation of critical areas including\nenergy, power, transportation, and real estate. In light of our ongoing efforts to\nfinance the transition to a low-carbonenvironment, our robust environmental and\nsocial risk management programs, and our net zero commitment, our Board believes\nthe policy change requested by the proposal is unnecessary and that its\nimplementation would unduly restrain our ability to pursue our carefully\nconsidered and tailored climate strategy. We engage and partner with clients\nacross energy, power, and other fossil fuel intensive sectors to share our\nexpertise and perspectives, create positive and constructive dialogues with key\nstakeholders, and encourage and influence clients to consider their role in the\ntransition to a low-carboneconomy.Our company is committed to improving the\nenvironment, and this commitment is integral to our global business model, the\nwork we do with partners, and our focus on making our operations more sustainable,\nmanaging risks and governing our activities. Our ESG leadership is also part of\nhow we drive sustainable Responsible Growth. We have a comprehensive, well-\nconsidered and pragmatic strategy for supporting the transition of energy and\npower systems toward a low-carbonfuture. As discussed below, our company is\ndedicated to supporting low-carbonenergy sources through our lending, investments,\nproducts and services, and operations. In addition, we have implemented a\ncomprehensive environmental and social risk framework and robust mechanisms for\nmanaging environmental, social and financial risks across our enterprise, which\nare discussed in more detail below. A critical part of our strategy is strong\nengagement and partnership with clients across energy, power, and other sectors,\nincluding those that are fossil fuel intensive. Through this engagement, we are\nable to share our expertise and perspectives, engage in constructive dialogues\nwith key stakeholders, and assist clients in their transition to a low-\ncarboneconomy. A key element of this engagement is helping clients access the\ncapital they need to affect this transition within their companies. Transitioning\nentire sectors of the economy before 2050 must be approached with urgency and yet\nthoughtfully. We acknowledge that some stakeholders desire this transition to\noccur much faster than others. We recognize this challenge but strive for a just\ntransition in every dimension, including balancing the need to support\ntraditional, affordable energy sources in the near-term with the recognition that\nemissions exacerbate risk in the longer term. We are committed to achieving net\nzero emissions from our operations, supply chain and financing activities before\n2050, in alignment with the Paris Agreement and climate science.Building on our\nlongstanding support for the Paris Agreement, we have a goal to achieve net zero\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in our financing activities, operations, and supply\nchain before 2050.

In collaboration with 15 other financial\ninstitutions, we participated in the development of the Global GHG Accounting and\nReporting Standard for the Financial Industry, providing a consistent methodology\nto assess and disclose emissions associated with financing activities. In line\nwith our PCAF and NZBA commitments, we expect to begin to disclose our financed\nemissions no later than 2023 and we expect to set 2030 emission reduction\ntargetsthat align with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway for a significant majority of emissions in\nour portfolio in 2024. We plan to announce our first set of emission reduction\ntargets in 2022. As set forth in the NZBA guidelines, we will regularly review our\ntargets so they remain consistent with current climate science. In our work to\nexecute on these commitments, we evaluate climate risks and opportunities,\nincluding those related to a transition to a low-carbon economy, through our\nenvironmental and social risk framework, and by conducting a range of scenario\nanalyses to assess climate-related risks to our financial condition. More\ninformation on how we approach climate change-related risk and opportunities is\navailable in our Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\nReport available on our website. (1)We will issue a new TCFD Report in 2022 with\nupdates on progress towards our net zero commitment. We are dedicated to\nsupporting low-carbonenergy sources through our lending, investments, products and\nservices, and operations.As we work to achieve our net zero commitment, we are\nfocused on financing the transition to a low-carbonenvironment. Our goal is to\nrebalance our portfolios over time and support the low-carboneconomy. We expect to\nachieve this shift through engaging with our clients and accelerating their\nprogress toward low-carbonbusiness models, and through partnering with our clients\nto finance the adoption of low-carbonsolutions. We are exploring innovative\nproducts that promote this transition, such as credit facilities that are\nstructured to link pricing to a client\u0092s carbon reduction efforts. Our\nEnvironmental Business Initiative (2)will deploy and mobilize $1 trillion by 2030\nto accelerate the transition to a low-carbon,sustainable economy, as part of a\nbroader $1.5 trillion sustainable finance goal aligned to addressing the United\nNations\u0092 Sustainable Development Goals. Our multi-year financing commitment\nprovides financial capital, along with significant intellectual capital, to\ndevelop solutions to climate change and other environmental challenges. It focuses\non low-carbonenergy, energy efficiency, and sustainable transportation, in\naddition to addressing other important areas like water conservation, land use and\nwaste. We believe that our financing policies and practices strongly align with\nour net zero commitment and the Paris Agreement goal. Further, we also believe\nthat our policy positions prohibiting Arctic drilling, prohibiting the\nconstruction or expansion of coal-fired plants, and prohibiting the financing of\nnew thermal coal and expansion of existing mines support our climate goals and\ndemonstrate our ongoing efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy by phasing\nout activities most appropriate to achieving our net zero commitment. We have\nimplemented a comprehensive environmental and social risk framework and robust\nmechanisms for managing environmental, social and financial risks across our\nenterprise.To provide oversight and rigor to these climate-related activities, we\nhave established strong governance and control mechanisms. Our Board oversees\nclimate-related risk and environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, and\nreceives reporting from management, including our Global Climate Risk Executive,\non climate risk and our climate-related initiatives. Our Board\u0092s Enterprise Risk\nCommittee oversees all of our company\u0092s risks, including climate and ESG risk.\nFurther, our Board\u0092s Corporate Governance, ESG and Sustainability Committee\noversees our climate-related and ESG activities.\n                                                                                  \n       See Responsible Growth and a Low-Carbon Economy Bank of America\u0092s Task      \n  (1)  force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures                             \n       Report, available at                                                       \n       https://about.bankofamerica.com/content/dam/about/pdfs/task-force-climat\u2026  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       For more information on our Environmental Business Initiative, please      \n  (2)  visit                                                                      \n       https://about.bankofamerica.com/en/making-an-impact/environmental-sustai\u2026  \n                                                                                  \n                              \n  2022 PROXY STATEMENT    95  \n                              \nProposals 5-7: Shareholder proposals To further strengthen our oversight of ESG\nissues, we established our Global Environmental, Social and Governance Committee\n(ESG Committee), which is a management-level committee composed of senior leaders\nacross every line of business and support function. The ESG Committee reports to\nour Board\u0092s CGESC, and also reports to our Management Risk Committee and our\nBoard\u0092s Enterprise Risk Committee on matters related to environmental and social\nrisk. As part of our focus on ESG principles, we established our Environmental and\nSocial Risk Policy Framework (ESRP Framework) (3)to provide additional clarity and\ntransparency on how our company approaches environmental and social risks. The\nESRP Framework governs our approach to climate-related risk management and already\nlimits, and in some cases prohibits, financing of fossil fuel suppliers. The ESRP\nFramework is aligned with our Board-approved Risk Framework, which outlines the\ncompany\u0092s approach to risk management and each employee\u0092s responsibilities for\nrisk management across the enterprise. As part of their duties, the ESG Committee\nand Management Risk Committee review and approve the ESRP Framework at least every\ntwo years. Our Risk Framework outlines the seven key risk types that we\nface\u0097strategic, credit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance and\nreputational\u0097and also addresses climate risk. Increasingly, environmental and\nsocial issues impact many of the seven key risk areas. Managing environmental and\nsocial risks requires coordinated governance, clearly defined roles and\nresponsibilities, and well-developed processes so these risks are identified,\nmeasured, monitored and controlled in a timely manner. As set out in our ESRP\nFramework, there are certain business activities that have increased investor,\nclient, employee, and regulatory scrutiny. These transactions are evaluated\nthrough our Risk Framework, as are all transaction and client decisions, in the\nordinary course of business. This process is client-specific, deal-specific, and\nsubject to governance review. This process considers portfolio-level credit,\noperational, reputational, and other risks, including climate and concentration\nrisk. As part of our commitment to Responsible Growth and our focus on ESG\nprinciples, we have not participated in project finance for oil and gas\nexploration in the Arctic. The ESRP Framework prohibits direct financing of new\nthermal coal mines or the expansion of existing coal mines. By 2025, we will phase\nout all financing, including facilitating capital markets transactions and\nadvising on mergers and acquisitions, of companies deriving 25% or more of their\nrevenue from thermal coal mining, unless the company has a public commitment to\nalign its business (across Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions) with the goals of the\nParis Agreement, and the transaction facilitates the diversification of that\nclient\u0092s business away from thermal coal. Our ESRP Framework also prohibits\nproviding lending or capital markets or advisory services to coal extraction\ncompanies involved in mountain top removal mining. In addition, any transactions\ninvolving coal extraction are subject to enhanced due diligence, which includes\nreview of evolving market dynamics, specific risks and regulations related to coal\nextraction and the client\u0092s commitment, capacity and track record on ESG\nperformance. Over the past several years, we have reduced exposure to companies\nfocused on coal extraction, with pure play coal extraction now representing only\n$109 million, or 0.3% of our energy sector exposure, down nearly 85% from $762\nmillion at fiscal year-end2015. Our Board believes the policy requested by the\nproposal is unnecessary in light of our commitment to financing a low-\ncarbonenvironment, our robust risk management programs and policies and our net\nzero commitment. Our Board believes our company, our shareholders, and our\ncommunity are best served by our continued focus on executing our climate\nstrategy. We are transparent about our comprehensive, well-considered and\npragmatic strategy for supporting the transition of our energy and power systems\ntoward a low-carbon future, and we publicly discuss our strategy in many public\ndisclosures including our TCFD Report and ESRP Framework. We continue to make\nsignificant investments in financing the low-carbon transition through our\nEnvironmental Business Initiative and related programs and initiatives. In\naddition, as described above, our Board oversees our climate-related risks and\nopportunities, and we take a proactive approach to identifying and managing risks,\nwhich includes an ongoing and rigorous process for identifying the issues that are\nmost significant to our company. We also have implemented robust risk oversight\nand management frameworks and policies with respect to environmental and social\nrisks. Our management, bankers and risk managers are well-positioned to analyze\nour overall exposures as well as individual transactions and react to the nuances\nand circumstances presented in each transaction, with overriding goals of\nachieving the GHG and net zero goals we have described above. Our Board is in the\nbest position to provide oversight of our ESG commitments and progress toward\nachieving them. Our Board believes that the policy change requested by the\nproposal is unnecessary and would restrict our company\u0092s ability to implement our\nclimate strategy, which we believe provides the most effective path for our\ncompany to address climate change.\n                                                    \n  Accordingly, our Board recommends a vote \u0093AGAINST\u0094  \n  this proposal (Proposal 6).                       \n                                                    \n                                                                                  \n  (3)  Our Environmental and Social Risk Policy Framework is available at         \n       https://about.bankofamerica.com/assets/pdf/Environmental-and-Social-Risk\u2026  \n                                                                                  \n                         \n  96    BANK OF AMERICA  \n                         \nProposals 5-7: Shareholder proposals Proposal 7: Shareholder proposal requesting a\nreport on charitable donations National Legal and Policy Center, 107 Park\nWashington Court, Falls Church, Virginia 22046, has advised us that it intends to\npresent the following resolution: Request for Charitable Donation Disclosure\nRESOLVED: The shareholders request that Bank of America Corporation provide a\nreport, published on the company\u0092s website and updated semi-annually\u0097and omitting\nproprietary information and at reasonable cost\u0097that discloses, itemizes and\nquantifies all Company charitable donations, aggregated by recipient name &\naddress each year for contributions that exceed $999 annually.

SUPPORTING\nSTATEMENT: Bank of America\u0092s assets belong to its shareholders. The expenditure or\ndistribution of corporate assets, including charitable contributions, should be\nconsistent with shareholder interests. Accordingly, the Company\u0092s policies and\nprocedures for charitable contributions should be disclosed to shareholders.\nCompany executives exercise wide discretion over the use of corporate assets for\ncharitable purposes. Absent a system of transparency and accountability for\ncharitable contributions, Company executives may use Company assets for objectives\nthat are not shared by and may be inimical to the interests of the Company and its\nshareholders.

Our Board\nbelieves we already provide our shareholders with fulsome information about our\ncharitable activities and the disclosure requested by the proposal would not\nprovide meaningful new information to our shareholders. We have long operated our\ncompany to drive and deliver Responsible Growth. One of the ways we make\nResponsible Growth sustainable is by sharing our success with the communities we\nserve. This includes partnerships with nonprofit organizations to help drive\neconomic opportunity and prosperity, and to support important local and societal\npriorities. We provide extensive disclosure regarding our philanthropic\ninitiatives, our philanthropic commitments and other charitable activities and how\nthey align to Responsible Growth on our website at\nhttps://about.bankofamerica.com/en/making-an-impact(including a link to reporting\nthat discloses all charitable giving by our foundation), and through press\nreleases and public filings so that we and our stakeholders can hold us\naccountable. We align our policies, practices, products, and programs, including\nour philanthropic initiatives, to deliver Responsible Growth.Our company is guided\nby a common purpose to help make financial lives better, and we are dedicated to\ncreating tangible value for our clients and the communities we serve. We have long\noperated our company to drive and deliver Responsible Growth, the fourth tenet of\nwhich is \u0093we must grow in a sustainable manner.\u0094 Our commitment to our\nstakeholders and communities is embedded in how we make Responsible Growth\nsustainable. By driving Responsible Growth, we help create jobs, develop\ncommunities, foster economic opportunity and mobility, and address some of the key\nchallenges facing the world today. By sharing our success with our communities, we\nseek to elevate economic opportunity, which is a beneficial business strategy for\nus and our shareholders. This provides our customers more opportunity to use the\nservices and products we can offer, helps us attract new customers, and\ncontributes to job growth and prosperity. Our philanthropic initiatives are a\ncomponent of our overall business strategies and deeply rooted in making\nResponsible Growth sustainable.\n                              \n  2022 PROXY STATEMENT    97  \n                              \nProposals 5-7: Shareholder proposals Our philanthropic initiatives are focused on\nsharing our success with our communities.In supporting and sharing our success\nwith our communities, we have developed strong partnerships with nonprofit\norganizations addressing issues fundamental to economic mobility and social\nprogress in low-and moderate-income communities. We focus on improving the lives\nof individuals and families by investing in basic needs, workforce development and\neducation, while also strengthening broader community vitality by addressing needs\nrelated to affordable housing, small businesses, and neighborhood revitalization.\nThrough our partnerships, we support vulnerable populations, including working\nfamilies, youth and young adults out of school and work, seniors, individuals\nliving with disabilities, veterans, and those impacted by the criminal justice\nsystem\u0096enabling them to move forward toward their goals. We drive Responsible\nGrowth bysupporting our communities through initiatives to:\n                                                                                  \n      Advance economic mobility. We are committed to promoting economic mobility  \n      in the communities we serve through                                         \n      partnerships with nonprofits, our own charitable programs and the power of  \n      our employee volunteers.(1) To help communities thrive, we partner with     \n      Community Development Financial Institutions                                \n      (CDFIs) and other nonprofits that know their local populations well. Our    \n      Neighborhood Builders program is one widespread way we work with these      \n      organizations to create sustainable change. We also support efforts that    \n      provide important services like                                             \n      affordable housing, workforce development and hunger relief. In addition,   \n      we support various art and cultural institutions that are vital to          \n      vibrant, successful communities. Our employees are also active in           \n      charitable efforts worldwide,                                               \n      helping offer stable housing through Habitat for Humanity and educating     \n      families on finances through Better Money Habits.                           \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      Advance racial equality and economic opportunity. In response to ongoing    \n      challenges that people and communities of                                   \n      color face, Responsible Growth is working to advance racial equality and    \n      economic opportunity throughout many of our partnerships. In 2020 and       \n      2021, we committed to fund $1.25 billion over a five-year timeframe to      \n      advance racial equality and                                                 \n      economic opportunity. This work will span across the company, and include   \n      philanthropy, education, healthcare, sustainable finance through lending    \n      and investing, CDFIs and Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs)            \n      partnerships, our hiring practices,                                         \n      development of financing solutions for small businesses and more. We have   \n      committed over $450 million of our $1.25 billion commitment to four key     \n      areas across 93 U.S. markets and globally in support of: jobs initiatives   \n      in Black and Hispanic/Latino                                                \n      communities; community outreach and initiatives, including philanthropic    \n      support to underserved and minority communities adversely impacted by the   \n      global health and humanitarian crisis, and personal protection equipment    \n      to communities in need;                                                     \n      direct equity investments to MDIs, plus over $100 million in deposits in    \n      MDIs to facilitate benefits across multiple states in the communities they  \n      serve through lending, housing, neighborhood revitalization, and other      \n      banking services; and                                                       \n      proprietary equity investments in minority entrepreneurs, businesses and    \n      funds.                                                                      \n                                                                                  \nTo advance economic mobility, The Bank of America Charitable Foundation\n(Foundation) issued two requests for proposals (RFPs) in 2022: economic mobility\nfocused on the needs of individuals and families; and economic mobility focused on\nthe needs of the broader community.\n                                                                                  \n      Economic Mobility focused on the needs of individuals and families. The     \n      COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate                                \n      impact on vulnerable populations who have experienced increased             \n      unemployment and higher levels of infection, and require attention on       \n      health and economic recovery as the world emerges from this crisis. We are  \n      partnering with organizations addressing                                    \n      the economic and social conditions that affect an individual\u0092s health,       \n      access to community-based health services, crisis prevention tied to        \n      family stabilization programs, and other poverty related issues. We are     \n      also building pathways to                                                   \n      employment by supporting a range of workforce development opportunities,    \n      including education, upskilling and reskilling programs.                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      Economic Mobility focused on the needs of the broader community. Vibrant    \n      communities are places where individuals can                                \n      thrive and succeed and have the opportunity to live and work with safe,     \n      decent housing, transportation to jobs, strong business corridors, and      \n      thriving arts and culture districts. The importance of safe, decent         \n      housing is plainly understood, yet for                                      \n      many, access to affordable housing has become further out of reach while    \n      others struggle with the possibility of eviction, foreclosure and           \n      homelessness. That is why we support the efforts of organizations working   \n      to preserve and increase access to a                                        \n      mix of affordable housing options as well as other essential assistance.    \n      In response to the challenges small business owners face in today\u0092s          \n      environment, we\u0092re also supporting nonprofits assisting entrepreneurs,       \n      especially minority- and                                                    \n      indigenous-owned, as they address their short-term needs and strengthen     \n      their overall recovery. In addition, we actively support local and          \n      regional revitalization efforts to create economic opportunity and livable  \n      neighborhoods.                                                              \n                                                                                  \nGrant amounts vary by market and organization size.

(2)Furthermore,\nsignificant charitable donations are made only after a process of internal reviews\nand payment controls. We already provide extensive disclosure about our\nphilanthropic activities on our company\u0092s website, including information \u0093by the\nnumbers.\u0094In addition to the disclosure we already provide about our philanthropic\ninitiatives and commitments, the Foundation files a tax return annually on Form\n990-PFwith the IRS. The Foundation\u0092s Form 990-PFsas filed with the IRS are\naccessible to the public and provide a listing of allcharitable payments made from\nthe Foundation to nonprofit organizations in all amounts, including matching gifts\nmade in connection with employee giving. Our website has a link to the\nFoundation\u0092s Form 990-PFand is available at\nhttps://about.bankofamerica.com/en/making-an-impact/charitable-foundation-funding.\nWe also provide extensive numerical disclosures about our philanthropic\ninitiatives, commitments and activities on our company\u0092s website at\nhttps://about.bankofamerica.com/en/making-an-impact, in our press releases, and in\npublic filings. These quantitative disclosures demonstrate how our giving aligns\nwith and drives Responsible Growth. We believe the level of disclosure we already\nprovide through these channels is more relevant to shareholders than the above\n$999 level requested by the proposal. Given the overall dollar size and global\nscope of our philanthropic activities, we believe providing itemized disclosure at\nthe level requested by the proponent\u0097in amounts in excess of $999\u0097would not\nprovide information relevant or beneficial to shareholders, and instead would\npresent such a vast amount of information as to be confusing for shareholders to\nparse through.

The\ninformation we already make available on the company website regarding this\ncommitment to our stakeholders and communities, including our philanthropic\nstrategy and related activities, provides a fulsome, transparent description for\nour shareholders and other stakeholders to better understand the nature of our\ncharitable activities and how they align with Responsible Growth. (3)This\ndisclosure is supplemented by the granular details the Foundation already makes\navailable to the IRS in the Form 990-PF,and which is available on our website. We\nhave demonstrated the strategic considerations that are used in framing our\noverall philanthropic objectives and how these activities are synchronized in\nResponsible Growth. Our Board believes that adoption of the reporting requirements\ncontemplated by the proposal would increase administrative costs, incur\nunnecessary expense, and impose inefficient procedures. Moreover, our Board\nbelieves that the additional disclosure requested by the proposal would either be\nduplicative of our existing disclosures or would not otherwise provide useful or\nmeaningful additional information to or benefit our shareholders.\n                                                    \n  Accordingly, our Board recommends a vote \u0093AGAINST\u0094  \n  this proposal (Proposal 7).                       \n                                                    \nShareholder proposals for our 2023 annual meeting Shareholder proposals submitted\nfor inclusion in the proxy statement for our 2023 annual meeting must comply with\napplicable requirements and conditions established by the SEC, including Rule\n14a-8of the Exchange Act, and must be received by our Corporate Secretary no later\nthan the close of business on November 7, 2022. Pursuant to our proxy access Bylaw\nprovision, one, or a group of up to 20 shareholders who, in aggregate, own\ncontinuously for at least three years, shares of our company representing an\naggregate of at least 3% of the voting power entitled to vote in the election of\ndirectors, may nominate and include in our proxy materials director nominees\nconstituting up to 20% of our Board, provided that the shareholder(s) and the\nnominee(s) satisfy the requirements in our Bylaws. Notice of proxy access director\nnominees must be received by our Corporate Secretary at the address below no\nearlier than October 8, 2022 and no later than the close of business on November\n7, 2022, assuming we do not change the date of our 2023 annual meeting by more\nthan 30 days before or 70 days after the anniversary date of our 2022 annual\nmeeting. If you would like to submit a matter for consideration at our 2023 annual\nmeeting (including any shareholder proposal not submitted under Rule 14a-8or any\ndirector nomination) that will not be included in the proxy statement for that\nannual meeting, it must be received by our Corporate Secretary no earlier than the\nclose of business on December 27, 2022 and no later than the close of business on\nFebruary 10, 2023, assuming we do not change the date of our 2023 annual meeting\nby more than 30 days before or 70 days after the anniversary date of our 2022\nannual meeting. Any matter must comply with our Bylaws. Finally, the deadline for\nproviding notice to the company under Rule 14a-19, the SEC\u0092s universal proxy rule,\nof a shareholder\u0092s intent to solicit proxies in support of nominees submitted\nunder the company\u0092s advance notice bylaws for our 2023 annual meeting is February\n25, 2023.

You are entitled to vote at our annual meeting if, as of the close\nof business on March 1, 2022, you were a shareholder of record of the company\u0092s\ncommon stock, Series B Preferred Stock, and Series 1, 2, 4, and 5 Preferred Stock\n(Series 1\u00965 Preferred Stock). As of March 1, 2022, the following shares were\noutstanding and entitled to vote:\n                                                            \n  Shares                      Number\u00a0of\u00a0shares\u00a0outstanding  \n                                      and entitled to vote  \n  Common Stock                               8,064,854,850  \n  Series B Preferred Stock                           7,110  \n  Series 1 Preferred Stock                           3,275  \n  Series 2 Preferred Stock                           9,967  \n  Series 4 Preferred Stock                           7,010  \n  Series 5 Preferred Stock                          14,056  \n                                                            \nEach share of our common stock and Series B Preferred Stock is entitled to one\nvote. Although each share of the Series 1\u00965 Preferred Stock is entitled to 150\nvotes, we do not have \u0093dual-class\u0094 voting as all shareholders vote together\nwithout regard to class, except as otherwise required by law. Holders of the\nSeries 1\u00965 Preferred Stock hold their shares through depositary receipts that each\nrepresent 1/1200th of a share of Series 1\u00965 Preferred Stock (or a vote\nrepresenting 0.125 shares of our common stock). Therefore the aggregate vote\nrepresented by the Series 1\u00965 Preferred Stock is de minimis. As of the record\ndate, the Series 1\u00965 Preferred Stock represent 5,146,200 votes, or approximately\n0.064% of the total eligible votes at the 2022 annual meeting of shareholders. We\nissued the Series 1\u00965 Preferred Stock as part of our merger with Merrill Lynch &\nCo., Inc., that became effective January 1, 2009, as required under Delaware law\nto holders of respective outstanding shares of Merrill Lynch series 1\u00965 preferred\nstock. Since the issuance of the Series 1\u00965 Preferred Stock in 2009, our company\nhas not issued any additional shares of Series 1\u00965 Preferred Stock, does not have\nany current plans to issue any additional shares of Series 1\u00965 Preferred Stock,\nand redeemed the Series 3 Preferred Stock in 2018. In accordance with Delaware\nlaw, for the 10 days prior to our annual meeting, a list of registered holders\nentitled to vote at our annual meeting will be available for inspection in the\nOffice of the Corporate Secretary, Bank of America Corporation, Bank of America\nCorporate Center, 100 North Tryon Street, NC1-007-56-06,Charlotte, North Carolina\n28255.
