The increase in\nnet income was primarily due to higher\nnoninterest income and net interest\nincome, partially offset by higher\nnoninterest expense. Total assets\nincreased $87.9 billion from December\n31, 2024 to $3.3 trillion primarily\ndriven by higher securities borrowed or\npurchased under agreements to resell to\nsupport Global Markets client activity,\nhigher trading account assets and debt\nsecurities, and loan growth. Total\nliabilities increased $87.9 billion from\nDecember 31, 2024 to $3.1 trillion\nprimarily driven by higher securities\nloaned or sold under agreements to\nrepurchase to support Global Markets\nclient activity, higher deposits due to\nseasonal deposit inflows and client\nactivity, and long-term debt issuances.\nShareholders\u2019 equity was $295.6 billion\nat March 31, 2025, relatively unchanged\ncompared to December 31, 2024, as net\nincome and market value increases on\nderivatives were largely offset by\nreturns of capital to shareholders\nthrough common stock repurchases and\ncommon and preferred stock dividends, as\nwell as preferred stock redemptions. Net\nInterest Income Net interest income\nincreased $411 million to $14.4 billion\nfor the three months ended March 31,\n2025 compared to the same period in\n2024. Net interest yield on a fully\ntaxable-equivalent (FTE) basis was 1.99\npercent, unchanged from the same period\na year ago. The increase in net interest\nincome was primarily driven by lower\ndeposit costs, higher net interest\nincome related to Global Markets\nactivity and fixed-rate asset repricing,\npartially offset by the impacts of lower\nrates and one less day of interest\naccrual.

Non-GAAP financial measures\nexclude certain items or otherwise\ninclude components that differ from the\nmost directly comparable measures\ncalculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-\nGAAP financial measures are provided as\nadditional useful information to assess\nour financial condition, results of\noperations (including period-to-period\noperating performance) or compliance\nwith prospective regulatory\nrequirements. These non-GAAP financial\nmeasures are not intended as a\nsubstitute for GAAP financial measures\nand may not be defined or calculated the\nsame way as non-GAAP financial measures\nused by other companies.\n\nWhen presented on a consolidated basis,\nwe view net interest income on an FTE\nbasis as a non-GAAP financial measure.\nTo derive the FTE basis, net interest\nincome is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt\nincome on an equivalent before-tax basis\nwith a corresponding increase in income\ntax expense. For purposes of this\ncalculation, we use the federal\nstatutory tax rate of 21 percent and a\nrepresentative state tax rate. Net\ninterest yield, which measures the basis\npoints we earn over the cost of funds,\nutilizes net interest income on an FTE\nbasis. We believe that presentation of\nthese items on an FTE basis allows for\ncomparison of amounts from both taxable\nand tax-exempt sources and is consistent\nwith industry practices.\n\nWe may present certain key performance\nindicators and ratios excluding certain\nitems (e.g., debit valuation adjustment\n(DVA) gains (losses)), which result in\nnon-GAAP financial measures. We believe\nthat the presentation of measures that\nexclude these items is useful because\nsuch measures provide additional\ninformation to assess the underlying\noperational performance and trends of\nour businesses and to allow better\ncomparison of period-to-period operating\nperformance.\n\nWe may present an adjusted ETR to\nexclude the tax rate effects of certain\ntax credits and discrete tax items\n(adjusted ETR). We believe the\npresentation of adjusted ETR is useful\nbecause it provides additional\ninformation to assess the Corporation\u2019s\nresults of operations.\n\nWe also evaluate our business based on\ncertain ratios that utilize tangible\nequity, a non-GAAP financial measure.\nTangible equity represents shareholders\u2019\nequity or common shareholders\u2019 equity\nreduced by goodwill and intangible\nassets (excluding mortgage servicing\nrights (MSRs)), net of related deferred\ntax liabilities (\u201cadjusted\u201d\nshareholders\u2019 equity or common\nshareholders\u2019 equity). These measures\nare used to\n\nevaluate our use of equity. In addition,\nprofitability, relationship and\ninvestment models use both return on\naverage tangible common shareholders\u2019\nequity and return on average tangible\nshareholders\u2019 equity as key measures to\nsupport our overall growth objectives.\nThese ratios are:\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible common\nshareholders\u2019 equity measures our net\nincome applicable to common shareholders\nas a percentage of adjusted average\ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity. The\ntangible common equity ratio represents\nadjusted ending common shareholders\u2019\nequity divided by total tangible assets.\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible\nshareholders\u2019 equity measures our net\nincome as a percentage of adjusted\naverage total shareholders\u2019 equity. The\ntangible equity ratio represents\nadjusted ending shareholders\u2019 equity\ndivided by total tangible assets.\n\n\u25cf Tangible book value per common share\nrepresents adjusted ending common\nshareholders\u2019 equity divided by ending\ncommon shares outstanding.\n\nWe believe ratios utilizing tangible\nequity provide additional useful\ninformation because they present\nmeasures of those assets that can\ngenerate income. Tangible book value per\ncommon share provides additional useful\ninformation about the level of tangible\nassets in relation to outstanding shares\nof common stock.\n\nThe aforementioned supplemental data and\nperformance measures are presented in\nTable 5 on page 6.\n\nFor more information on the\nreconciliation of these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to the corresponding\nGAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP\nReconciliations on page 43.\n                                                                                  \n  Key Performance Indicators                                                      \n                                                                                  \nWe present certain key financial and\nnonfinancial performance indicators (key\nperformance indicators) that management\nuses when assessing our consolidated\nand/or segment results. We believe they\nare useful to investors because they\nprovide additional information about our\nunderlying operational performance and\ntrends. These key performance indicators\n(KPIs) may not be defined or calculated\nin the same way as similar KPIs used by\nother companies.

The operating\nmargin was 22 percent compared to 24\npercent a year ago.\n\nNet interest income decreased $49\nmillion to $1.8 billion primarily due to\nthe impact of lower interest rates and\nlower average deposit balances.\n\nNoninterest income, which primarily\nincludes investment and brokerage\nservices income, increased $474 million\nto $4.3 billion. The increase was\nprimarily due to higher asset management\nfees driven by higher average equity\nmarket valuations and the impact of\npositive AUM flows.\n\nNoninterest expense increased $395\nmillion to $4.7 billion primarily due to\nhigher revenue-related incentives and\ninvestments in the business, including\npeople and technology.\n\nThe return on average allocated capital\nwas 21 percent, down from 22 percent,\ndue to an increase in allocated capital.\nFor information on capital allocated to\nthe business segments, see Business\nSegment Operations on page 8.\n\nAverage loans and leases increased $13.7\nbillion to $232.3 billion, primarily\ndriven by custom lending, securities\nbased lending and residential mortgage\nloans. Average deposits decreased $11.0\nbillion to $286.4 billion primarily\ndriven by clients moving deposits to\nhigher yielding investment cash\nalternatives, including offerings on our\ninvestment and

The seven key types of risk\nfaced by the Corporation are strategic,\ncredit, market, liquidity, compliance,\noperational and reputational. Sound risk\nmanagement enables us to serve our\ncustomers and deliver for our\nshareholders. If not managed well, risk\ncan result in financial loss, regulatory\nsanctions and penalties, and damage to\nour reputation, each of which may\nadversely impact our ability to execute\nour business strategies. We take a\ncomprehensive approach to risk\nmanagement with a defined Risk Framework\nand an articulated Risk Appetite\nStatement, which are approved annually\nby the Board\u2019s Enterprise Risk Committee\n(ERC) and the Board.\n\nOur Risk Framework serves as the\nfoundation for the consistent and\neffective management of risks facing the\nCorporation. The Risk Framework sets\nforth roles and responsibilities for the\nmanagement of risk and provides a\nblueprint for how the Board, through\ndelegation of authority to committees\nand executive officers, establishes risk\nappetite and associated limits for our\nactivities.\n\nOur risk appetite provides a common\nframework that includes a set of\nmeasures to assist senior management and\nthe Board in assessing the Corporation\u2019s\nrisk profile across all risk types\nagainst our risk appetite and risk\ncapacity. Our risk appetite is formally\narticulated in the Risk Appetite\nStatement, which includes both\nqualitative statements and quantitative\nlimits.\n\nFor more information on the\nCorporation\u2019s risks, see Item 1A.

In April 2025, we submitted our\n2025 CCAR capital plan and related\nsupervisory stress tests. The Federal\nReserve has indicated that it will\ndisclose CCAR capital plan supervisory\nstress test results by June 30, 2025.\n\nThe Board authorized a $25 billion\ncommon stock repurchase program,\neffective August 1, 2024. Pursuant to\nBoard authorization, during the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2025, we\nrepurchased $4.5 billion of common\nstock. For more information, see Part\nII, Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity\nSecurities and Use of Proceeds on page\n93 and Capital Management \u2013 CCAR and\nCapital Planning in the MD&A of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2024 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n\nThe timing and amount of common stock\nrepurchases are subject to various\nfactors, including the Corporation\u2019s\ncapital\n\nposition, liquidity, financial\nperformance and alternative uses of\ncapital, stock trading price, regulatory\nrequirements and general market\nconditions, and may be suspended at any\ntime. Such repurchases may be effected\nthrough open market purchases or\nprivately negotiated transactions,\nincluding repurchase plans that satisfy\nthe conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (Exchange Act).\n\nAdditionally, as part of our planned\ncapital actions, during the first\nquarter of 2025, the Corporation paid\ncommon stock dividends of $1.9 billion.\n                                                                                  \n  Regulatory Capital                                                              \n                                                                                  \nAs a BHC, we are subject to regulatory\ncapital rules, including Basel 3, issued\nby U.S. banking regulators. The\nCorporation's depository institution\nsubsidiaries are also subject to the\nPrompt Corrective Action (PCA)\nframework. The Corporation and its\nprimary affiliated banking entity, BANA,\nare Advanced approaches institutions\nunder Basel 3 and are required to report\nregulatory risk-based capital ratios and\nrisk weighted assets (RWA) under both\nthe Standardized and Advanced\napproaches. The lower of the capital\nratios under Standardized or Advanced\napproaches compared to their respective\nregulatory capital ratio requirements is\nused to assess capital adequacy,\nincluding under the PCA framework. As of\nMarch 31, 2025, the Corporation\u2019s\nbinding ratio was the Tier 1 capital\nratio under the Standardized approach.\n                                                                                  \n  Minimum Capital Requirements                                                    \n                                                                                  \nIn order to avoid restrictions on\ncapital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments to executive officers,\nthe Corporation must meet risk-based\ncapital ratio requirements that include\na capital conservation buffer of 2.5\npercent (under the Advanced approaches\nonly), an SCB (under the Standardized\napproach only), plus any applicable\ncountercyclical capital buffer and a\nglobal systemically important bank\n(G-SIB) surcharge. The buffers and\nsurcharge must be comprised solely of\nCET1 capital. For the period from\nOctober 1, 2024 through September 30,\n2025, the Corporation\u2019s minimum CET1\nrequirements are 10.7 percent under the\nStandardized approach and 10.0 percent\nunder the Advanced approaches.\n\nThe Corporation is required to calculate\nits G-SIB surcharge on an annual basis\nunder two methods and is subject to the\nhigher of the resulting two surcharges.\nMethod 1 is consistent with the approach\nprescribed by the Basel Committee\u2019s\nassessment methodology and is calculated\nusing specified indicators of systemic\nimportance. Method 2 modifies the Method\n1 approach by, among other factors,\nincluding a measure of the Corporation\u2019s\nreliance on short-term wholesale\nfunding. The Corporation\u2019s G-SIB\nsurcharge, which is higher under Method\n2, is expected to increase to 3.5\npercent from 3.0 percent on January 1,\n2027, unless its surcharge calculated as\nof December 31, 2025 is lower than 3.5\npercent. At March 31, 2025, the\nCorporation\u2019s CET1 capital ratio of 11.8\npercent under the Standardized approach\nexceeded its CET1 capital ratio\nrequirement.\n\nThe Corporation is also required to\nmaintain a minimum supplementary\nleverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus\na leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in\norder to avoid certain restrictions on\ncapital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments to executive officers. At\nMarch 31, 2025, our insured depository\ninstitution subsidiaries exceeded their\nrequirement to maintain a minimum 6.0\npercent SLR to be considered well\ncapitalized under the PCA framework.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America16                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Capital Composition and Ratios                                                  \n                                                                                  \nTable 7 presents Bank of America Corporation\u2019s capital ratios and related\ninformation in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as\nmeasured at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.

The\nSLR regulatory minimum includes a\nleverage buffer of 2.0 percent.\n\n(3) Total capital under the Advanced\napproaches differs from the Standardized\napproach due to differences in the\namount permitted in Tier 2 capital\nrelated to the qualifying allowance for\ncredit losses.\n\n(4) Reflects total average assets\nadjusted for certain Tier 1 capital\ndeductions.\n\nAt March 31, 2025, CET1 capital was\n$201.2 billion, an increase of $94\nmillion from December 31, 2024,\nprimarily due to earnings, largely\noffset by capital distributions. Tier 1\ncapital decreased $1.8 billion driven by\nthe same factors as CET1 capital as well\nas preferred stock redemptions. Total\ncapital under the Standardized approach\nincreased $1.1 billion driven by the\nsame factors as Tier 1 capital, as well\nas subordinated\n\ndebt issuances and an increase in the\nadjusted allowance for credit losses\nincluded in Tier 2 capital. RWA under\nthe Standardized approach, which yielded\nthe lower CET1 capital ratio at March\n31, 2025, increased $15.3 billion during\n2025 to $1,711 billion primarily driven\nby client activity in

BofAS is also\nrequired to hold a certain percentage of\nits customers' and affiliates' risk-\nbased margin in order to meet its CFTC\nminimum net capital requirement. At\nMarch 31, 2025, BofAS had tentative net\ncapital of $20.3 billion.

To achieve that objective,\nwe analyze and monitor our liquidity\nrisk under expected and stressed\nconditions, maintain liquidity and\naccess to diverse funding sources,\nincluding our stable deposit base, and\nseek to align liquidity-related\nincentives and risks. These liquidity\nrisk management practices have allowed\nus to effectively manage market\nfluctuations from the rising interest\nrate environment, inflationary pressures\nand changes in the macroeconomic\nenvironment. We define liquidity as\nreadily available assets, limited to\ncash and high-quality, liquid,\nunencumbered securities that we can use\nto meet our contractual and contingent\nfinancial obligations as they arise. We\nmanage our liquidity position through\nline of business and ALM activities, as\nwell as through our legal entity funding\nstrategy, on both a forward and current\n(including intraday) basis under both\nexpected and stressed conditions. We\nbelieve that a centralized approach to\nfunding and liquidity management\nenhances our ability to monitor\nliquidity requirements, maximizes access\nto funding sources, minimizes borrowing\ncosts and facilitates timely responses\nto liquidity events. We provide\ncentralized funding and liquidity\nmanagement through a variety of\nactivities, including monitoring of\nestablished limits, assessing exposures\nunder both normal and stressed\nconditions and reviewing liquidity risk\nmanagement processes and controls.\nGlobal Risk Management (GRM) provides\noversight of liquidity management across\nthe Corporation, including front-line\nunits and legal entities. GRM oversees\nthe liquidity risk management governance\nstructure, establishes liquidity risk\npolicies, and provides independent\nreview and challenge of the\nCorporation's liquidity risk management\nprocesses.

NB Holdings Corporation Bank of\nAmerica Corporation, as the parent\ncompany (the Parent), which is a\nseparate and distinct legal entity from\nour bank and nonbank subsidiaries, has\nan intercompany arrangement with our\nwholly-owned holding company subsidiary,\nNB Holdings Corporation (NB Holdings).\nWe have transferred, and agreed to\ntransfer, additional Parent assets not\nrequired to satisfy anticipated near-\nterm expenditures to NB Holdings. The\nParent is expected to continue to have\naccess to the same flow of dividends,\ninterest and other amounts of cash\nnecessary to service its debt, pay\ndividends and perform other obligations\nas it would have had it not entered into\nthese arrangements and transferred any\nassets. These arrangements support our\npreferred single point of entry\nresolution strategy, under which only\nthe Parent would be resolved under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code.\n\nGlobal Liquidity Sources and Other\nUnencumbered Assets We maintain\nliquidity available to the Corporation,\nincluding the Parent and selected\nsubsidiaries, in the form of cash and\nhigh- quality, liquid, unencumbered\nsecurities. Our liquidity buffer,\nreferred to as Global Liquidity Sources\n(GLS), is comprised of assets that are\nreadily available to the Parent and\nselected subsidiaries, including holding\ncompany, bank and broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries, even during stressed\nmarket conditions. Our cash is primarily\non deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank\nand, to a lesser extent, central banks\noutside of the U.S. We limit the\ncomposition of high-quality, liquid,\nunencumbered securities to U.S.\ngovernment securities, U.S. agency\nsecurities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities and other investment-grade\nsecurities, and a select group of\nnon-U.S. government securities. We can\nobtain cash for these securities, even\nin stressed conditions, through\nrepurchase agreements or outright sales.\nWe hold our GLS in legal entities that\nallow us to meet the liquidity\nrequirements of our global businesses,\nand we consider the impact of potential\nregulatory, tax, legal and other\nrestrictions that could limit the\ntransferability of funds among entities.\nTable 12 presents average GLS for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2025 and\nDecember 31, 2024.\n                                                                                  \n                                                  Three Months                    \n  Table 12                                               Ended                    \n  (Dollars in         Average Global                  March 31       December 31  \n  billions)           Liquidity Sources                   2025              2024  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Bank entities                            $               763    $          777  \n  Nonbank and                                                                     \n  other                                                    179               176  \n  entities(1)                                                                     \n  Total Average                                                                   \n  Global Liquidity                         $               942    $          953  \n  Sources                                                                         \n                                                                                  \n(1) Nonbank includes Parent, NB Holdings\nand other regulated entities. Our bank\nsubsidiaries\u2019 liquidity is primarily\ndriven by deposit and lending activity,\nas well as securities valuation and net\ndebt activity. Bank subsidiaries can\nalso generate incremental liquidity by\npledging a range of unencumbered loans\nand securities to certain Federal Home\nLoan Banks (FHLBs) and the Federal\nReserve Discount Window. The cash we\ncould have obtained by borrowing against\nthis pool of specifically-identified\neligible assets was $333 billion and\n$328 billion at March 31, 2025 and\nDecember 31, 2024. We have established\noperational procedures to enable us to\nborrow against these assets, including\nregularly monitoring our total pool of\neligible loans and securities\ncollateral. Eligibility is defined in\nguidelines from the FHLBs and the\nFederal Reserve and is subject to change\nat their discretion. Due to regulatory\nrestrictions, liquidity generated by the\nbank subsidiaries can generally be used\nonly to fund obligations within the bank\nsubsidiaries, and transfers to the\nParent or nonbank subsidiaries may be\nsubject to prior regulatory approval.\nLiquidity is also held in nonbank\nentities, including the Parent, NB\nHoldings and other regulated entities.\nThe Parent and NB Holdings liquidity is\ntypically in the form of cash deposited\nat BANA, which is excluded from the\nliquidity at bank subsidiaries, and\nhigh-quality, liquid, unencumbered\nsecurities. Liquidity held in other\nregulated entities, comprised primarily\nof broker-dealer subsidiaries, is\nprimarily available to meet the\nobligations of that entity, and\ntransfers to the Parent or to any other\nsubsidiary may be subject to prior\nregulatory approval due to regulatory\nrestrictions and minimum requirements.\nOur other regulated entities also hold\nunencumbered investment-grade securities\nand equities that we believe could be\nused to generate additional liquidity.\n                                                                                  \n  21Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nTable 13 presents the composition of\naverage GLS for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 .\n                                                                                  \n                      Average Global              Three Months                    \n  Table 13            Liquidity                          Ended                    \n  (Dollars in         Sources                         March 31       December 31  \n  billions)           Composition                         2025              2024  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Cash on deposit                         $                268    $          315  \n  U.S. Treasury                                            345               313  \n  securities                                                                      \n  U.S. agency                                                                     \n  securities,                                                                     \n  mortgage-backed                                                                 \n  securities, and                                          296               296  \n  other                                                                           \n  investment-grade                                                                \n  securities                                                                      \n  Non-U.S.                                                                        \n  government                                                33                29  \n  securities                                                                      \n  Total Average                                                                   \n  Global Liquidity                        $                942    $          953  \n  Sources                                                                         \n                                                                                  \nOur GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High\nQuality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)\nrules. However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market\nvalue, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the\nexclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated\nas the amount of a financial institution\u2019s unencumbered HQLA relative to the\nestimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period\nof significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average\nconsolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $629 billion and $623 billion for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 . For the same periods, the\naverage consolidated LCR was 112 percent and 113 percent. Our LCR fluctuates due\nto normal business flows from customer activity. Liquidity Stress Analysis We\nutilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate\namounts of liquidity to maintain at the Parent and our subsidiaries to meet\ncontractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. For more\ninformation on liquidity stress analysis, see Liquidity Risk \u2013 Liquidity Stress\nAnalysis in the MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Net\nStable Funding Ratio The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is a liquidity\nrequirement for large banks to maintain a minimum level of stable funding over a\none-year period. The requirement is intended to support the ability of banks to\nlend to households and businesses in both normal and adverse economic conditions\nand is complementary to the LCR, which focuses on short-term liquidity risks. The\nU.S. NSFR applies to the Corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured\ndepository institutions. At March 31, 2025, the Corporation and its insured\ndepository institutions were in compliance with the U.S. NSFR. For more\ninformation, see the Pillar 3 U.S. NSFR Disclosure report for the quarters ended\nDecember 31, 2024 and September 30, 2024\n\non the Corporation\u2019s website, the contents of which are not incorporated by\nreference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Diversified Funding Sources We\nfund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured\nliabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach\ndiversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups. We\nfund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which\nwere $1.99 trillion and $1.97 trillion at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\nOur trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a\nsecured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements, and these\namounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. Deposits Our\ndeposit base is well-diversified by clients, geography and product type across our\nbusiness segments. At March 31, 2025, 49 percent of our deposits were in Consumer\nBanking , 14 percent in GWIM and 30 percent in Global Banking . We consider a\nsubstantial portion of our deposit base to be a stable, low-cost and consistent\nsource of liquidity. At March 31, 2025 approximately 69 percent of consumer and\nsmall business deposits and approximately 80 percent of U.S. deposits in Global\nBanking were held by clients who have had accounts with us for 10 or more years.\nIn addition, at both March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, 27 percent of our\ndeposits were noninterest bearing and included operating accounts of our consumer\nand commercial clients. Deposits at March 31, 2025 increased $24.1 billion from\nDecember 31, 2024 primarily due to seasonal deposit inflows and client activity .\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, rates paid on deposits were\n61 bps and 55 bps in Consumer Banking , 250 bps and 289 bps in GWIM , and 273 bps\nand 312 bps in Global Banking . For information on rates paid on consolidated\ndeposit balances, see Table 6 on page 7. Long-term Debt During the three months\nended March 31, 2025, we issued $33.3 billion of long-term debt consisting of\n$21.5 billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, substantially all of\nwhich were TLAC compliant, $5.2 billion of notes issued by Bank of America, N.A.\nand $6.6 billion of other debt. During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we\nhad total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $16.0\nbillion consisting of $9.9 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $2.9 billion\nfor Bank of America, N.A. and $3.2 billion of other debt.

For more information on our\nTLAC eligible and callable outstanding\nnotes, see Liquidity Risk \u2013 Diversified\nFunding Sources in the MD&A of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2024 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n\n(2) Represents liabilities of\nconsolidated variable interest entities\n(VIEs) included in total long-term debt\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nTotal long-term debt increased $20.9\nbillion to $304.1 billion during the\nthree months ended March 31, 2025\nprimarily due to debt issuances and\nvaluation adjustments, partially offset\nby maturities. We may, from time to\ntime, repurchase outstanding debt\ninstruments in various transactions,\ndepending on market conditions,\nliquidity and other factors. Our other\nregulated entities may also make markets\nin our debt instruments to provide\nliquidity for investors.\n\nDuring the three months ended March 31,\n2025, we issued $8.9 billion of\nstructured notes, which are debt\nobligations that pay investors returns\nlinked to other debt or equity\nsecurities, indices, currencies or\ncommodities. These structured notes are\ntypically issued to meet client demand,\nand notes with certain attributes may\nalso be TLAC eligible. We typically\nhedge the returns we are obligated to\npay on these liabilities with\nderivatives and/or investments in the\nunderlying instruments, so that from a\nfunding perspective, the cost is similar\nto our other unsecured long-term debt.\nWe could be required to settle certain\nstructured note obligations for cash or\nother securities prior to maturity under\ncertain circumstances, which we consider\nfor liquidity planning purposes. We\nbelieve, however, that a portion of such\nborrowings will remain outstanding\nbeyond the earliest put or redemption\ndate.\n\nSubstantially all of our senior and\nsubordinated debt obligations contain no\nprovisions that could trigger a\nrequirement for an early repayment,\nrequire additional collateral support,\nresult in changes to terms, accelerate\nmaturity or create additional financial\nobligations upon an adverse change in\nour credit ratings, financial ratios,\nearnings, cash flows or stock price. For\nmore information on long-term debt\nfunding,\n\nincluding issuances and maturities and\nredemptions, see Note 11 \u2013 Long-term\nDebt to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements of the Corporation\u2019s 2024\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nWe use derivative transactions to manage\nthe duration, interest rate and currency\nrisks of our borrowings, considering the\ncharacteristics of the assets they are\nfunding.

Commercial reservable\ncriticized exposure increased compared\nto December 31, 2024 driven by\ncommercial real estate due to the\nsustained high interest rate\nenvironment. Nonperforming loans\nremained relatively unchanged compared\nto December 31, 2024. Uncertainty\nremains regarding broader economic\nimpacts as a result of ongoing\nnegotiations regarding international\ntrade policies, higher costs associated\nwith inflationary pressures experienced\nover the past several years, elevated\nrates as well as the current\ngeopolitical environment, and could lead\nto adverse impacts to credit quality\nmetrics in future periods.\n                                                                                  \n   Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management                                      \n                                                                                  \nCredit risk management for the consumer\nportfolio begins with initial\nunderwriting and continues throughout a\nborrower\u2019s credit cycle. Statistical\ntechniques in conjunction with\nexperiential judgment are used in all\naspects of portfolio management\nincluding underwriting, product pricing,\nrisk appetite, setting credit limits,\nand establishing operating processes and\nmetrics to quantify and balance risks\nand returns. Statistical models are\nbuilt using detailed behavioral\ninformation from external sources, such\nas credit bureaus, and/or internal\nhistorical experience and are a\ncomponent of our consumer credit risk\nmanagement process. These models are\nused in part to assist in making both\nnew and ongoing credit decisions as well\nas portfolio management strategies,\nincluding authorizations and line\nmanagement, collection practices and\nstrategies, and determination of the\nallowance for loan and lease losses and\nallocated capital for credit risk.\n                                                                                  \n  Consumer Credit Portfolio                                                       \n                                                                                  \nDuring the three months ended March 31,\n2025, the U.S. unemployment rate and\nhome prices remained relatively stable.\nDuring the three months ended March 31,\n2025, net charge-offs increased $91\nmillion to $1.1 billion compared to the\nsame period in 2024, primarily due to\nthe credit card portfolio.\n\nThe consumer allowance for loan and\nlease losses was $8.6 billion,\nrelatively unchanged from December 31,\n2024.

balances in\nthe residential mortgage portfolio\nremained relatively unchanged during the\nthree months ended March 31, 2025. Of\nthe nonperforming residential mortgage\nloans at March 31, 2025, $1.3 billion,\nor 62 percent, were current on\ncontractual payments. Excluding fully-\ninsured loans, loans accruing past due\n30 days or more of $1.0 billion also\nremained relatively unchanged.\n\nOf the $225.6 billion in total\nresidential mortgage loans outstanding\nat March 31, 2025, $64.0 billion, or 28\npercent, of loans were originated as\ninterest-only. The outstanding balance\nof interest-only residential mortgage\nloans that had entered the amortization\nperiod was $3.5 billion, or six percent,\nat March 31, 2025. Residential mortgage\nloans that have entered the amortization\nperiod generally experience a higher\nrate of early stage delinquencies and\nnonperforming status compared to the\nresidential mortgage portfolio as a\nwhole. At March 31, 2025, $68 million,\nor two percent, of outstanding interest-\nonly residential mortgages that had\nentered the amortization period were\naccruing past due 30 days or more\ncompared to $1.0 billion, or less than\none percent, for the entire residential\nmortgage portfolio. In addition, at\nMarch 31, 2025, $191\n\nmillion, or five percent, of outstanding\ninterest-only residential mortgage loans\nthat had entered the amortization period\nwere nonperforming, of which $60 million\nwere contractually current. Loans that\nhave yet to enter the amortization\nperiod in our interest-only residential\nmortgage portfolio are primarily well-\ncollateralized loans to our wealth\nmanagement clients and have an interest-\nonly period of three years to 10 years.\nSubstantially all of these loans that\nhave yet to enter the amortization\nperiod will not be required to make a\nfully-amortizing payment until 2026 or\nlater.\n\nTable 19 presents outstandings,\nnonperforming loans and net charge-offs\nby certain state concentrations for the\nresidential mortgage portfolio. In the\nNew York area, the New York-Northern New\nJersey-Long Island Metropolitan\nStatistical Area (MSA) made up 15\npercent of outstandings at both March\n31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. The Los\nAngeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within\nCalifornia represented 14 percent of\noutstandings at both March 31, 2025 and\nDecember 31, 2024.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America26                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                           T\u2026                     \n  T\u2026                                                       M\u2026                     \n  19    R\u2026       Ou\u2026                No\u2026                    E\u2026                     \n  (\u2026    M\u2026       Ma\u2026       D\u2026       Ma\u2026       D\u2026           M\u2026                     \n  in    S\u2026        31       31        31       31           31       Net           \n  m\u2026    C\u2026       20\u2026       2\u2026       20\u2026       2\u2026    20\u2026    2\u2026       Ch\u2026           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  C\u2026          $  81\u2026    $  8\u2026    $  606    $  6\u2026                 $  \u2014      $   3  \n  N\u2026             26\u2026       2\u2026       319       3\u2026                    \u2014          \u2014  \n  Y\u2026                                                                              \n  F\u2026             16\u2026       1\u2026       142       1\u2026                    \u2014         -1  \n  M\u2026             9,\u2026       7\u2026        46       43                    \u2014          \u2014  \n  N\u2026             9,\u2026       8\u2026        86       88                    \u2014          \u2014  \n  J\u2026                                                                              \n  O\u2026             82\u2026       7\u2026       837       8\u2026                    \u2014          1  \n  R\u2026                                                                              \n  m\u2026          $  22\u2026    $  2\u2026    $  2,\u2026    $  2\u2026                 $  \u2014      $   3  \n  l\u2026                                                                              \n  F\u2026                                                                              \n  l\u2026             9,\u2026       9\u2026                                                     \n  p\u2026                                                                              \n  T\u2026                                                                              \n  r\u2026                                                                              \n  m\u2026          $  23\u2026    $  2\u2026                                                     \n  l\u2026                                                                              \n  p\u2026                                                                              \n                                                                                  \n(1) Outstandings and nonperforming loans exclude loans accounted for under the\nfair value option.\n                                                                                  \n  Home Equity                                                                     \n                                                                                  \nAt March 31, 2025, the home equity\nportfolio made up five percent of the\nconsumer portfolio and was comprised of\nhome equity lines of credit (HELOCs),\nhome equity loans and reverse mortgages.\nHELOCs generally have an initial draw\nperiod of 10 years, and after the\ninitial draw period ends, the loans\ngenerally convert to 15- or 20-year\namortizing loans.

Of the\nnonperforming home equity loans at March\n31, 2025, $249 million, or 61 percent,\nwere current on contractual payments. In\naddition, $85 million, or 21 percent,\nwere 180 days or more past due and had\nbeen written down to the estimated fair\nvalue of the collateral, less costs to\nsell. Accruing loans that were 30 days\nor more past d ue remained relatively\nunchanged during the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2025 .\n\nOf the $25.7 billion in total home\nequity portfolio outstandings at March\n31, 2025, as shown in Table 20, eight\npercent require interest-only payments.\nThe outstanding balance of HELOCs that\nhad reached the end of their draw period\nand entered the amortization period was\n$3.3 billion at March 31, 2025. The\nHELOCs that have entered the\namortization period have experienced a\nhigher percentage of early stage\ndelinquencies and nonperforming status\nwhen compared to the HELOC portfolio as\na whole. At March 31, 2025, $31 million,\nor one percent, of outstanding HELOCs\nthat had entered the\n\namortization period were accruing past\ndue 30 days or more. In addition, at\nMarch 31, 2025, $239 million, or seven\npercent, were nonperforming.\n\nFor our interest-only HELOC portfolio,\nwe do not actively track how many of our\nhome equity customers pay only the\nminimum amount due on their home equity\nloans and lines; however, we can infer\nsome of this information through a\nreview of our HELOC portfolio that we\nservice and is still in its revolving\nperiod. During the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2025 , 24 percent of these\ncustomers with an outstanding balance\ndid not pay any principal on their\nHELOCs.\n\nTable 21 presents outstandings,\nnonperforming balances and net\nrecoveries by certain state\nconcentrations for the home equity\nportfolio.

In addition, within\nour non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate\nexposures by region and by country.\nTables 29, 31 and 34 summarize our\nconcentrations.

During the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2025, commercial credit\nquality deteriorated as reservable\ncriticized utilized exposure increased\nprimarily driven by commercial real\nestate due to the sustained high\ninterest rate environment. Nonperforming\ncommercial loans increased $142 million\nduring the three months ended March 31,\n2025, primarily in non-U.S. commercial\nand commercial real estate. Commercial\nnet charge-offs decreased $137 million\ncompared\n\nto the same period in 2024 primarily due\nto lower charge-offs in the commercial\nreal estate office portfolio.\n\nWith the exception of the office\nproperty type, which is further\ndiscussed in the Commercial Real Estate\nsection herein, credit quality of\ncommercial borrowers has remained\nrelatively stable since December 31,\n2024; however, we are closely monitoring\nemerging trends, including ongoing\nnegotiations regarding international\ntrade policies, as well as borrower\nperformance in the current environment.\nRecent demand for office space continues\nto be stagnant, and future demand for\noffice space continues to be uncertain\nas companies evaluate space needs with\nemployment models that utilize a mix of\nremote and conventional office use.\n\nThe commercial allowance for loan and\nlease losses of $4.7 billion remained\nrelatively unchanged during the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2025. For more\ninformation, see Allowance for Credit\nLosses on page 36.\n\nTotal commercial utilized credit\nexposure increased $1.3 billion during\nthe three months ended March 31, 2025 to\n$740.8 billion driven by higher loans\nand leases partially offset by decreases\nin derivative assets and loans held-for-\nsale.

To lower the\ncost of obtaining our desired credit\nprotection levels, we may add credit\nexposure within an industry, borrower or\ncounterparty group by selling\nprotection.

We recorded net gains of $3\nmillion for the three months ended March\n31, 2025 compared to net losses of $25\nmillion for the three months ended March\n31, 2024. The gains and losses on these\ninstruments were largely offset by gains\nand losses on the related exposures.

We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic\nand political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in\ngovernment policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor\nand manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing\nbusiness in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g.,\nrelated to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to\nclient clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal\ncourse of business through credit, market and operational risk governance rather\nthan through country risk governance. For more information on our non-U.S. credit\nand trading portfolios, see Non-U.S. Portfolio in the MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s\n2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information on risks related to our\nnon-U.S. portfolio, see the Geopolitical section within Item 1A. Risk Factors of\nthe Corporation\u2019s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Table 34 presents our 20\nlargest non-U.S. country exposures at March 31, 2025. These exposures accounted\nfor 89 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at both March 31, 2025 and December\n31, 2024. Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $6.1 billion from\nDecember 31, 2024 primarily driven by increases in Germany, India and Singapore.\n

For more information on market\nrisks, see the Market section within\nItem 1A. Risk Factors of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2024 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in\nmarket conditions may adversely impact\nthe value of assets or liabilities, or\notherwise negatively impact earnings.\nThis risk is inherent in the financial\ninstruments associated with our\noperations, primarily within our Global\nMarkets segment. We are also exposed to\nthese risks in other areas of the\nCorporation (e.g., our ALM activities).\nIn the event of market stress, these\nrisks could have a material impact on\nour results.\n                                                                                  \n   Trading Risk Management                                                        \n                                                                                  \nTo evaluate risks in our trading\nactivities, we focus on the actual and\npotential volatility of revenues\ngenerated by individual positions as\nwell as portfolios of positions. VaR is\na common statistic used to measure\nmarket risk. Our primary VaR statistic\nis equivalent to a 99 percent confidence\nlevel, which means that for a VaR with a\none-day holding period, there should not\nbe losses in excess of VaR, on average,\n99 out of 100 trading days.\n\nTable 37 presents the total market-based\nportfolio VaR, which is the combination\nof the total trading positions portfolio\n\nand the fair value option portfolio.\nPrior to the first quarter of 2025, the\nCorporation presented its VaR using a\ntotal market-based portfolio VaR, which\nwas primarily a combination of our total\ncovered positions and certain less\nliquid trading positions. An\ninsignificant amount of banking book\npositions was included in these\nportfolios. Beginning in the first\nquarter of 2025, the VaR amounts for all\nperiods presented in Table 37 and Table\n38 exclude those banking book positions\nand include only the financial\ninstruments used in the Corporation\u2019s\nmarket risk management of its trading\nportfolios.

Under\ninstantaneous upward parallel shifts,\nthe near-term adverse impact to Basel 3\ncapital would be reduced over time by\noffsetting positive impacts to net\ninterest income generated from banking\nbook activities. For more information on\nBasel 3, see Capital Management \u2013\nRegulatory Capital on page 16.\n\nAs part of our ALM activities, we use\nsecurities, certain residential\nmortgages, and interest rate and foreign\nexchange derivatives in managing\ninterest rate sensitivity. The\nsensitivity analysis in Table 40 assumes\nthat we take no action in response to\nthese rate shocks and does not assume\nany change in other macroeconomic\nvariables normally correlated with\nchanges in interest rates. In higher\nrate scenarios, the analysis assumes\nthat a portion of low-cost or\nnoninterest-bearing deposits is replaced\nwith higher yielding deposits or market-\nbased funding. Conversely, in lower rate\nscenarios, the analysis assumes that a\nportion of higher yielding deposits or\nmarket-based funding is replaced with\nlow-cost or noninterest-bearing\ndeposits.\n\nFor larger interest rate shift\nscenarios, the interest rate sensitivity\nmay behave in a non-linear manner as\nthere are numerous estimates and\nassumptions, which require a high degree\nof judgment and are often interrelated,\nthat could impact the outcome.\nPertaining to the mortgage-backed\nsecurities and residential mortgage\nportfolio, if long-end interest rates\nwere to significantly decrease over the\nnext twelve months, for example over 200\nbps, there would generally be an\nincrease in customer prepayment\nbehaviors with an incremental reduction\nto net interest income, noting that the\nextent of changes in customer prepayment\nactivity can be impacted by multiple\nfactors and is not necessarily limited\nto long-end interest rates. Conversely,\nif long-end interest rates were to\nsignificantly increase over the next\ntwelve months, for example, over 200\nbps, customer prepayments would likely\nmodestly decrease and result in an\nincremental increase to net interest\nincome. In addition, deposit pricing is\nrate sensitive in nature. This\nsensitivity is assumed to have non-\nlinear impacts to larger short-end rate\nmovements. In decreasing interest rate\nscenarios, and particularly where\ninterest rates have decreased to small\namounts, the ability to further reduce\nrates paid is reduced as customer rates\nnear zero. In higher short-end rate\nscenarios, deposit pricing will likely\nincrease at a faster rate, leading to\nincremental interest expense and\nreducing asset sensitivity. While the\nimpact related to the above assumptions\nused in the asset sensitivity analysis\ncan provide directional analysis on how\nnet interest income will\n\nbe impacted in changing environments,\nthe ultimate impact is dependent upon\nthe interrelationship of the assumptions\nand factors, which vary in different\nmacroeconomic scenarios.\n                                                                                  \n  Economic Value of Equity                                                        \n                                                                                  \nIn addition to interest rate sensitivity\ndescribed above, the Corporation\u2019s\nmanagement of its interest rate\nexposures in the banking book also\nconsiders a long-term view of interest\nrate sensitivity through the measurement\nof Economic Value of Equity (EVE). EVE\ncaptures changes in the net present\nvalue of banking book assets and\nliabilities under various interest rate\nscenarios and its impact to Tier 1\ncapital. Similar to net interest income,\nthe Corporation establishes limits for\nEVE. EVE is largely driven by the\nCorporation\u2019s longer duration fixed-rate\nproducts, such as investment securities,\nresidential mortgages and deposits. For\nassets or liabilities that have no\nstated maturity, such as deposits, the\nCorporation estimates the duration for\nmeasurement purposes.\n\nInterest Rate and Foreign Exchange\nDerivative Contracts\n\nWe use interest rate and foreign\nexchange derivative contracts in our ALM\nactivities to manage our interest rate\nand foreign exchange risks.\nSpecifically, we use those derivatives\nto manage both the variability in cash\nflows and changes in fair value of\nvarious assets and liabilities arising\nfrom those risks. Our interest rate\nderivative contracts are generally non-\nleveraged swaps tied to various\nbenchmark interest rates and foreign\nexchange basis swaps, options, futures\nand forwards, and our foreign exchange\ncontracts include cross-currency\ninterest rate swaps, foreign currency\nfutures contracts, foreign currency\nforward contracts and options.\n\nThe derivatives used in our ALM\nactivities can be split into two broad\ncategories: designated accounting hedges\nand other risk management derivatives.\nDesignated accounting hedges are\nprimarily used to manage our exposure to\ninterest rates as described in the\nInterest Rate Risk Management for the\nBanking Book section and are included in\nthe sensitivities presented in Table 40.\nThe Corporation also uses foreign\ncurrency derivatives in accounting\nhedges to manage substantially all of\nthe foreign exchange risk of our foreign\noperations. By hedging the foreign\nexchange risk of our foreign operations,\nthe Corporation's market risk exposure\nin this area is not significant.\n\nRisk management derivatives are\npredominantly used to hedge foreign\nexchange risks related to various\nforeign currency-denominated assets and\nliabilities and eliminate substantially\nall foreign currency exposures in the\ncash flows of the Corporation\u2019s non-\ntrading foreign currency-denominated\nfinancial instruments. These foreign\nexchange derivatives are sensitive to\nother market risk exposures such as\ncross-currency basis\n                                                                                  \n  41Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nspreads and interest rate risk. However,\nas these features are not a significant\ncomponent of these foreign exchange\nderivatives, the market risk related to\nthis exposure is not significant. For\nmore information on the accounting for\nderivatives, see Note 3 \u2013 Derivatives to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements.\n                                                                                  \n  Mortgage Banking Risk Management                                                \n                                                                                  \nWe originate, fund and service mortgage\nloans, which subject us to credit,\nliquidity and interest rate risks, among\nothers. We determine whether loans will\nbe held for investment or held for sale\nat the time of commitment and manage\ncredit and liquidity risks by selling or\nsecuritizing a portion of the loans we\noriginate.\n\nChanges in interest rates impact the\nvalue of interest rate lock commitments\n(IRLCs) and the related residential\nfirst mortgage loans held-for-sale\n(LHFS), as well as the value of the\nMSRs. Because the interest rate risks of\nthese hedged items offset, we combine\nthem into one overall hedged item with\none combined economic hedge portfolio\nconsisting of derivative contracts and\nsecurities. For more information on\nIRLCs and the related residential\nmortgage LHFS, see Mortgage Banking Risk\nManagement in the MD&A of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2024 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n                                                                                  \n  Climate Risk                                                                    \n                                                                                  \nClimate risk is divided into two major\ncategories, both of which span the seven\nkey risk types discussed in Managing\nRisk on page 16: (1) Physical Risk:\nrisks related to the physical impacts of\nclimate change, driven by extreme\nweather events such as hurricanes and\nfloods, as well as chronic longer-term\nshifts such as rising average global\ntemperatures and sea levels, and (2)\nTransition Risk: risks related to the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy,\nwhich may entail extensive policy,\nlegal, technology and market changes.\n\nPhysical risks of climate change, such\nas more frequent and severe extreme\nweather events, can increase the\nCorporation\u2019s risks, including credit\nrisk by diminishing borrowers\u2019 repayment\ncapacity or collateral values, and\noperational risk by negatively impacting\nthe Corporation\u2019s facilities, employees,\nor third parties. Transition risks of\nclimate change may amplify credit risks\nthrough the financial impacts of changes\nin policy, technology or the market on\nthe Corporation or our counterparties.\nUnanticipated market changes can lead to\nsudden price adjustments and give rise\nto heightened market risk.\n\nOur approach to managing climate risk is\nconsistent with our risk management\ngovernance structure, from senior\nmanagement to our Board and its\ncommittees, including the ERC and the\nCorporate Governance Committee (CGC) of\nthe Board, which regularly discuss\nclimate-related topics. The ERC oversees\nclimate risk as set forth in our Risk\nFramework and Risk Appetite Statement.\nThe CGC is responsible for overseeing\nthe Corporation\u2019s environmental\nsustainability-related activities and\npractices, and regularly reviews the\nCorporation\u2019s related initiatives and\npolicies.\n\nOur Climate Risk Council consists of\nleaders across risk, Front Line Unit\n(FLU) and control functions, and meets\nroutinely to discuss our approach to\nmanaging climate-related risks. The\nCorporation has a Climate and\nEnvironmental Risk Management function\nthat is responsible for overseeing\nclimate risk management. They are\nresponsible for establishing the Climate\nRisk Framework (described below) and\ngovernance structure, and providing an\nindependent assessment of enterprise-\nwide climate risks.\n\nBased on the Corporation\u2019s Risk\nFramework, we created our internal\nClimate Risk Framework, which addresses\nvarious global climate-related laws,\nrules, regulations and guidance. The\nframework describes how the Corporation\nidentifies, measures, monitors and\ncontrols climate risk by enhancing\nexisting risk management processes,\nincludes examples of how climate risk\nmanifests across the seven risk types,\nand details the roles and\nresponsibilities for climate risk\nmanagement across our three lines of\ndefense (i.e., FLUs, Global Risk\nManagement and Corporate Audit).\n\nFor more information on our governance\nframework, see the Managing Risk section\nin the MD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2024\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.

Summary of Significant Accounting\nPrinciples\n\nBank of America Corporation, a bank\nholding company and a financial holding\ncompany, provides a diverse range of\nfinancial services and products\nthroughout the U.S. and in certain\ninternational markets. The term \u201cthe\nCorporation\u201d as used herein may refer to\nBank of America Corporation,\nindividually, Bank of America\nCorporation and its subsidiaries, or\ncertain of Bank of America Corporation\u2019s\nsubsidiaries or affiliates. Principles\nof Consolidation and Basis of\nPresentation The Consolidated Financial\nStatements include the accounts of the\nCorporation and its majority-owned\nsubsidiaries and those variable interest\nentities (VIEs) where the Corporation is\nthe primary beneficiary. Intercompany\naccounts and transactions have been\neliminated. Results of operations of\nacquired companies are included from the\ndates of acquisition, and for VIEs, from\nthe dates that the Corporation became\nthe primary beneficiary. Assets held in\nan agency or fiduciary capacity are not\nincluded in the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. The Corporation accounts for\ninvestments in companies for which it\n\nowns a voting interest and for which it\nhas the ability to exercise significant\ninfluence over operating and financing\ndecisions using the equity method of\naccounting. These investments, which\ninclude the Corporation\u2019s interests in\naffordable housing and renewable energy\npartnerships, are recorded in other\nassets. Equity method investments are\nsubject to impairment testing, and the\nCorporation\u2019s proportionate share of\nincome or loss is included in other\nincome. The preparation of the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in\nconformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States\nof America requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect\nreported amounts and disclosures. Actual\nresults could materially differ from\nthose estimates and assumptions. These\nunaudited Consolidated Financial\nStatements should be read in conjunction\nwith the audited Consolidated Financial\nStatements, and related notes thereto,\nof the Corporation\u2019s 2024 Annual Report\non Form 10-K. The nature of the\nCorporation\u2019s business is such that the\nresults of any interim period are not\nnecessarily indicative of results for a\nfull year. In the opinion of management,\nall adjustments, which consist of normal\nrecurring adjustments necessary for a\nfair statement of the interim period\nresults, have been made. The Corporation\nevaluates subsequent events through the\ndate of filing with the Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC).\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America48                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  NOTE 2                                                                          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Net Interest Income and Noninterest Income                                      \n                                                                                  \nThe table below presents the Corporation\u2019s net interest income and noninterest\nincome disaggregated by revenue source for the three months ended March 31, 2025\nand 2024.

Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges The table below summarizes\ncertain information related to cash flow hedges and net investment hedges for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.

These net losses reclassified into earnings are expected to primarily\ndecrease net interest income related to the respective hedged items.

At both March 31, 2025 and\nDecember 31, 2024, the Corporation had\ntransferred $ 3.9billion of non-U.S.\ngovernment-guaranteed mortgage-backed\nsecurities to a third-party trust and\nretained economic exposure to the\ntransferred assets through derivative\ncontracts. In connection with these\ntransfers, the Corporation received\ngross cash proceeds of $ 3.9billion at\nboth transfer dates. At March 31, 2025\nand December 31, 2024, the fair value of\nthe transferred securities was $\n3.7billion and $ 3.6billion. Sales and\nTrading Revenue The Corporation enters\ninto trading derivatives to facilitate\nclient transactions and to manage risk\nexposures arising from trading account\nassets and liabilities. It is the\nCorporation\u2019s policy to include these\nderivative instruments in its trading\nactivities, which include derivatives\nand non-derivative cash instruments. The\nresulting risk from these derivatives is\nmanaged on a portfolio basis as part of\nthe Corporation\u2019s Global Markets\nbusiness segment.

However, the Corporation does not monitor its exposure to\ncredit derivatives based solely on the notional amount because this measure does\nnot take into consideration the probability of occurrence. As such, the notional\namount is not a reliable indicator of the Corporation\u2019s exposure to these\ncontracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to define risk tolerances and\nestablish limits so that certain credit risk-related losses occur within\nacceptable, predefined limits. Credit-related notes in the table above include\ninvestments in securities issued by collateralized debt obligation (CDO),\ncollateralized loan obligation (CLO) and credit-linked note vehicles. These\ninstruments are primarily classified as trading securities. The carrying value of\nthese instruments equals the Corporation\u2019s maximum exposure to loss. The\nCorporation is not obligated to make any payments to the entities under the terms\nof the securities owned. Credit-related Contingent Features and Collateral Certain\nof the Corporation\u2019s derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent\nfeatures, primarily in the form of ISDA master netting agreements and credit\nsupport documentation that enhance the creditworthiness of these instruments\ncompared to other obligations of the respective counterparty with whom the\nCorporation has transacted. These contingent features may be for the benefit of\nthe Corporation as well as its\n                                                                                  \n  55Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \ncounterparties with respect to changes in the Corporation\u2019s creditworthiness and\nthe mark-to-market exposure under the derivative transactions. At March 31, 2025\nand December 31, 2024, the Corporation held cash and securities collateral of $\n102.8billion and $ 105.9billion and posted cash and securities collateral of $\n83.0billion and $ 83.1billion in the normal course of business under derivative\nagreements, excluding cross-product margining agreements where clients are\npermitted to margin on a net basis for both derivative and secured financing\narrangements. In connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other\ntrading agreements, the Corporation can be required to provide additional\ncollateral or to terminate transactions with certain counterparties in the event\nof a downgrade of the senior debt ratings of the Corporation or certain\nsubsidiaries. The amount of additional collateral required depends on the contract\nand is usually a fixed incremental amount and/or the market value of the exposure.\nFor more information on credit-related contingent features and collateral, see\nNote 3 \u2013 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s\n2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. At March 31, 2025, the amount of collateral,\ncalculated based on the terms of the contracts, that the Corporation and certain\nsubsidiaries could be required to post to counterparties but had not yet posted to\ncounterparties was $ 3.1billion, including $ 1.5billion for Bank of America,\nNational Association (BANA). Some counterparties are currently able to\nunilaterally terminate certain contracts, or the Corporation or certain\nsubsidiaries may be required to take other action such as find a suitable\nreplacement or obtain a guarantee.

For more information on the\nportfolio segments, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2024 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K . Within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment, the primary credit\nquality indicators are refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) and refreshed Fair Isaac\nCorporation (FICO) score. Refreshed LTV measures the carrying value of the loan as\na percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly.\nHome equity loans are evaluated using combined loan-to-value (CLTV), which\nmeasures the carrying value of the Corporation\u2019s loan and available line of credit\ncombined with any outstanding senior liens against the property as a percentage of\nthe value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. FICO score\nmeasures the creditworthiness of the borrower based on the financial obligations\nof the borrower and the borrower\u2019s credit history. FICO scores are typically\nrefreshed quarterly or more frequently. Certain borrowers (e.g., borrowers that\nhave had debts discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding) may not have their FICO\nscores updated. FICO scores are also a primary credit quality indicator for the\nCredit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment and the business card portfolio\nwithin U.S. small business commercial. Within the Commercial portfolio segment,\nloans are evaluated using the internal classifications of pass rated or reservable\ncriticized as the primary credit quality indicators. The term reservable\ncriticized refers to those commercial loans that are internally classified or\nlisted by the Corporation as Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful, which are\nasset quality categories defined by regulatory authorities. These assets have an\nelevated level of risk and may have a high probability of default or total loss.\nPass rated refers to all loans not considered reservable criticized. In addition\nto these primary credit quality indicators, the Corporation uses other credit\nquality indicators for certain types of loans. The following tables present\ncertain credit quality indicators and gross charge-offs for the Corporation's\nConsumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio\nsegments by year of origination, except for revolving loans and revolving loans\nthat were modified into term loans, which are shown on an aggregate basis at March\n31, 2025.\n

Consumer Real Estate The\nfollowing modification programs are offered for consumer real estate loans to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Forbearance and Other Payment\nPlans: Forbearance plans generally consist of the Corporation suspending the\nborrower\u2019s payments for a defined period, with those payments then due over a\ndefined period of time or at the conclusion of the forbearance period. The aging\nstatus of a loan is generally frozen when it enters into a forbearance plan. If a\nborrower is unable to fulfill their obligations under the forbearance plans, they\nmay be offered a trial offer or permanent modification.\n\nTrial Offer and Permanent Modifications : Trial offer for modification plans\ngenerally consist of the Corporation offering a borrower modified loan terms that\nreduce their contractual payments temporarily over a three-to- four-monthtrial\nperiod. If the customer successfully makes the modified payments during the trial\nperiod and formally accepts the modified terms, the modified loan terms become\npermanent. Some borrowers may enter into permanent modifications without a trial\nperiod. In a permanent modification, the borrower\u2019s payment terms are typically\nmodified in more than one manner, but generally include a term extension and an\ninterest rate reduction. At times, the permanent modification may also include\nprincipal forgiveness and/or a deferral of past due principal and interest amounts\nto the end of the loan term. The combinations utilized are based on modifying the\nterms that give the borrower an improved ability to meet the contractual\nobligations. The term extensions granted for residential mortgage and home equity\npermanent modifications vary widely and can be up to 30years, but most are in the\nrange of 1to 20years. Principal forgiveness and payment deferrals were\ninsignificant during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.

The carrying value of consumer real estate\nloans, including fully-insured loans, for which formal foreclosure proceedings\nwere in process at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, was $ 467million and $\n633million. During the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, the Corporation\nreclassified $ 12million and $ 30million of consumer real estate loans to\nforeclosed properties or, for properties acquired upon foreclosure of certain\ngovernment-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured loans), to other assets. The\nreclassifications represent non-cash investing activities and, accordingly, are\nnot reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Credit Card and Other\nConsumer Credit card and other consumer loans are primarily modified by placing\nthe customer on a fixed payment plan with a significantly reduced fixed interest\nrate, with terms ranging from 6months to 72months, most of which had a\n60-monthterm at March 31, 2025. In certain circumstances, the Corporation will\nforgive a portion of the outstanding balance if the borrower makes payments up to\na set amount. The Corporation makes modifications directly with borrowers for\nloans held by the Corporation (internal programs) as well as through third-party\nrenegotiation agencies that provide solutions to customers\u2019 entire unsecured debt\nstructures (external programs). The March 31, 2025 amortized cost of credit card\nand other consumer loans that were modified through these programs during the\nthree months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 and was $ 217million and $ 231million.\nThe financial effect of modifications resulted in a weighted-average interest rate\nreduction of 18.37percent compared to 19.80percent and, principal forgiveness of $\n25million and $ 28million during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.\nThe Corporation tracks the performance of modified loans to assess effectiveness\nof modification programs. As of March 31, 2025 and 2024, defaults of credit card\nand other consumer loans that had been modified within 12 months were\ninsignificant. At March 31, 2025, modified credit card and other consumer loans to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty over the last 12 months totaled $\n632million, of which $ 530million were current, $ 54million were 30-89 days past\ndue, and $ 48million were greater than 90 days past due. At March 31, 2024,\nmodified credit card and other consumer loans to borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty over the last 12 months totaled $ 658million, of which $ 537million\nwere current, $ 62million were 30-89 days past due, and $ 59million were greater\nthan 90 days past due. Commercial Loans Modifications of loans to commercial\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty are designed to reduce the\nCorporation\u2019s loss exposure while providing borrowers with an opportunity to work\nthrough financial difficulties, often to avoid foreclosure or bankruptcy. Each\nmodification is unique, reflects the borrower\u2019s individual circumstances and is\ndesigned to benefit the borrower while mitigating the Corporation\u2019s risk exposure.\nCommercial modifications are primarily term extensions and payment forbearances.\nPayment forbearances involve the Corporation forbearing its contractual right to\ncollect certain payments or payment in full (maturity forbearance) for a defined\nperiod of time. Reductions in interest rates and principal forgiveness occur\ninfrequently for commercial borrowers. Principal forgiveness may occur in\nconnection with foreclosure, short sales or other settlement agreements, leading\nto termination or sale of the loan.

Qualitative reserves cover losses that\nare expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not adequately be reflected\nin the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. The Corporation\nincorporates forward-looking information through the use of several macroeconomic\nscenarios in determining the weighted economic outlook over the forecasted life of\nthe assets. These scenarios include key macroeconomic variables such as gross\ndomestic product, unemployment rate, real estate prices and corporate bond\nspreads. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the weighting given to\neach scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events,\nleading economic indicators, internal and third-party economist views, and\nindustry trends. For more information on the Corporation's credit loss accounting\npolicies including the allowance for credit losses, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The March 31, 2025 estimate for\nallowance for credit losses was based on various economic scenarios, including a\nbaseline scenario derived from consensus estimates, an adverse scenario reflecting\nan extended moderate recession, a downside scenario reflecting continued inflation\nand interest rates with minimal rate cuts, a tail risk scenario similar to the\nseverely adverse scenario used in stress testing and an upside scenario that\nconsiders the potential for improvement above the baseline scenario. The overall\nweighted economic outlook of the above scenarios has deteriorated modestly\ncompared to the weighted economic outlook estimated as of December 31, 2024. The\nweighted economic outlook for the Corporation\u2019s modeled reserves assumes that the\nU.S. average unemployment rate will be just below fivepercent in the fourth\nquarter of 2025 and will remain near this level through the fourth quarter of\n2026. The weighted economic outlook assumes steady growth with U.S. real gross\ndomestic product forecasted to grow at 1.0percent and 1.7percent year-over-year in\nthe fourth quarters of 2025 and 2026. The above factors are used in the\nCorporation\u2019s modeled reserves. As previously disclosed, the allowance for credit\nlosses is determined using a combination of quantitative (i.e., modeled reserves)\nand qualitative methods (i.e., imprecision and judgmental reserves). The\nqualitative methods, which comprise a portion of the total allowance for credit\nlosses, incorporate those risks that are not fully captured in the modeled\nreserves. For example, as of March 31, 2025, the risks captured in the qualitative\nadjustments have the equivalent impact of a 100 basis point level shift in the\nCorporation\u2019s weighted-average unemployment rate. There were no significant\nchanges to the qualitative reserves at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. The\nallowance for credit losses increased $ 30million from December 31, 2024 to $\n14.4billion at March 31, 2025. The change in the allowance for credit losses was\ncomprised of a net increase of $ 16million in the allowance for loan and lease\nlosses and an increase of $ 14million in the reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments. The increase in the allowance for credit losses was attributed to\nincreases in the commercial portfolio of $ 48million and the consumer real estate\nportfolio of $ 47million, partially offset by a decrease in the credit card and\nother consumer portfolios of $ 65million. The provision for credit losses\nincreased $ 161million to $ 1.5billion for the three months ended March 31, 2025\ncompared to the same period in 2024. The provision for credit losses for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2025 was primarily driven by credit card loans. Outstanding\nloans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option\nincreased $ 13.7billion during the three months ended March 31, 2025 driven by\ncommercial, which increased $ 10.6billion due to broad-based growth, and consumer\ndriven by a $ 7.0billion increase in residential mortgage primarily due to a loan\nportfolio acquisition, partially offset by a $ 3.8billion seasonal decline in\ncredit card. The changes in the allowance for credit losses, including net charge-\noffs and provision for loan and lease losses, are detailed in the table below.\n

utilizes VIEs in the ordinary course of business to support its\nown and its customers\u2019 financing and investing needs. The Corporation routinely\nsecuritizes loans and debt securities using VIEs as a source of funding for the\nCorporation and as a means of transferring the economic risk of the loans or debt\nsecurities to third parties. The assets are transferred into a trust or other\nsecuritization vehicle such that the assets are legally isolated from the\ncreditors of the Corporation and are not available to satisfy its obligations.\nThese assets can only be used to settle obligations of the trust or other\nsecuritization vehicle. The Corporation also administers, structures or invests in\nother VIEs including CDOs, investment vehicles and other entities. For more\ninformation on the Corporation\u2019s use of VIEs, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant\nAccounting Principles and Note 6 \u2013 Securitizations and Other Variable Interest\nEntities to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2024 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K . The tables in this Note present the assets and liabilities\nof consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 in\nsituations where the Corporation has a loan or security interest and involvement\nwith transferred assets or if the Corporation otherwise has an additional interest\nin the VIE. The tables also present the Corporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure at\nMarch 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 resulting from its involvement with\nconsolidated VIEs and unconsolidated VIEs. The Corporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure\nis based on the unlikely event that all of the assets in the VIEs become worthless\nand incorporates not only potential losses associated with assets recorded on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet but also potential losses associated with off-balance\nsheet commitments, such as unfunded liquidity commitments and other contractual\narrangements. The Corporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure does not include losses\npreviously recognized through write-downs of assets. The Corporation invests in\nABS, CLOs and other similar investments issued by third-party VIEs with which it\nhas no other form of involvement other than a loan or debt security issued by the\nVIE. In addition, the Corporation also enters into certain commercial lending\narrangements that may utilize VIEs for\n\nactivities secondary to the lending arrangement, for example to hold collateral.\nThe Corporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure to these VIEs is the investment balances.\nThese securities and loans are included in Note 4 \u2013 Securities or Note 5 \u2013\nOutstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses and are not included\nin the following tables. The Corporation did not provide financial support to\nconsolidated or unconsolidated VIEs during the three months ended March 31, 2025\nor the year ended December 31, 2024 that it was not previously contractually\nrequired to provide, nor does it intend to do so. The Corporation had liquidity\ncommitments, including written put options and collateral value guarantees, with\ncertain unconsolidated VIEs of $ 1.1billion and $ 1.0billion at March 31, 2025 and\nDecember 31, 2024. First-lien Mortgage Securitizations As part of its mortgage\nbanking activities, the Corporation securitizes a portion of the first-lien\nresidential mortgage loans it originates or purchases from third parties,\ngenerally in the form of residential mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises, FNMA and FHLMC (collectively the GSEs), or the\nGovernment National Mortgage Association (GNMA) primarily in the case of FHA-\ninsured and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-guaranteed mortgage loans.\nSecuritization usually occurs in conjunction with or shortly after origination or\npurchase, and the Corporation may also securitize loans held in its residential\nmortgage portfolio. In addition, the Corporation may, from time to time,\nsecuritize commercial mortgages it originates or purchases from other entities.\nThe Corporation typically services the loans it securitizes. Further, the\nCorporation may retain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts including\nsenior and subordinate securities and equity tranches issued by the trusts. Except\nas described in Note 10 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies , the Corporation does not\nprovide guarantees or recourse to the securitization trusts other than standard\nrepresentations and warranties. The table below summarizes select information\nrelated to first-lien mortgage securitizations for the three months ended March\n31, 2025 and 2024.\n                                                                                  \n  First-lien                                                                      \n  Mortgage                                                                        \n  Securitiz\u2026                                                                      \n                   Residential                Commercial                          \n                    Mortgage -                Mortgage                            \n                        Agency                                                    \n                         Three                                                    \n                        Months                                                    \n                   Ended March                                                    \n                            31                                                    \n  (Dollars                                                                        \n  in                      2025        2024                      2025        2024  \n  millions)                                                                       \n  Proceeds                                                                        \n  from loan     $        1,095    $  1,209                  $  5,490    $  1,309  \n  sales(1)                                                                        \n  Gains                                                                           \n  (losses)                  -2           \u2014                        46          19  \n  on                                                                              \n  securitiz\u2026                                                                      \n  Repurchas\u2026                                                                      \n  from                      21           8                         \u2014           \u2014  \n  securitiz\u2026                                                                      \n  trusts(3)                                                                       \n                                                                                  \n(1) The Corporation transfers residential mortgage loans to securitizations\nsponsored primarily by the GSEs or GNMA in the normal course of business and\nprimarily receives residential mortgage-backed securities in exchange.\nSubstantially all of these securities are classified as Level 2 within the fair\nvalue hierarchy and are typically sold shortly after receipt.\n\n(2) A majority of the first-lien residential mortgage loans securitized are\ninitially classified as LHFS and accounted for under the fair value option. Gains\nrecognized on these LHFS prior to securitization, which totaled $ 6million and $\n5million, net of hedges, during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024,\nare not included in the table above.\n\n(3) The Corporation may have the option to repurchase delinquent loans out of\nsecuritization trusts, which reduces the amount of servicing advances it is\nrequired to make. The Corporation may also repurchase loans from securitization\ntrusts to perform modifications. Repurchased loans include FHA-insured mortgages\ncollateralizing GNMA securities.\nThe Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale or securitization of\nconsumer real estate loans. The unpaid principal balance of loans serviced for\ninvestors, including residential mortgage and home equity loans, totaled $\n82.7billion and $ 90.5billion at March 31, 2025 and 2024. Servicing fee and\nancillary fee income on serviced loans was $ 55million and $ 62million during the\nthree months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. Servicing advances on serviced loans,\nincluding loans serviced for others and loans held for investment, were $\n973million and $ 1.0billion at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. For more\ninformation on MSRs, see Note 14 \u2013 Fair Value Measurements .\n                                                                                  \n  71Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nHome Equity Loans The Corporation retains interests, primarily senior securities,\nin home equity securitization trusts to which it transferred home equity loans. In\naddition, the Corporation may be obligated to provide subordinate funding to the\ntrusts during a rapid amortization event. This obligation is included in the\nmaximum loss exposure in the preceding table. The charges that will ultimately be\nrecorded as a result of the rapid amortization events depend on the undrawn\nportion of the home equity lines of credit, performance of the loans, the amount\nof subsequent draws and the timing of related cash flows. Mortgage and Home Equity\nSecuritizations During the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, the\nCorporation deconsolidated agency residential mortgage securitization trusts with\ntotal assets of $ 127million and $ 793million.

For both consolidated and unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs,\nthe maximum loss exposure excludes the reserve for representations and warranties\nobligations and corporate guarantees. For more information, see Note 10 \u2013\nCommitments and Contingencies .\n\n(2) Maximum loss exposure includes obligations under loss-sharing reinsurance and\nother arrangements for non-agency residential mortgage and commercial mortgage\nsecuritizations, but excludes the reserve for representations and warranties\nobligations and corporate guarantees and also excludes servicing advances and\nother servicing rights and obligations. For more information, see Note 10 \u2013\nCommitments and Contingencies and Note 14 \u2013 Fair Value Measurements .\n\n(3) Principal balance outstanding includes loans where the Corporation was the\ntransferor to securitization VIEs with which it has continuing involvement, which\nmay include servicing the loans.\nOther Asset-backed Securitizations The following paragraphs summarize select\ninformation related to other asset-backed VIEs in which the Corporation had a\nvariable interest at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. Credit Card and\nAutomobile Loan Securitizations The Corporation securitizes originated and\npurchased credit card and automobile loans as a source of financing. The loans are\nsold on a non-recourse basis to consolidated trusts. The securitizations are\nongoing, whereas additional receivables will be funded into the trusts by either\nloan repayments or proceeds from securities issued to third parties, depending on\nthe securitization structure. The Corporation\u2019s continuing involvement with the\nsecuritization trusts includes servicing the receivables and holding various\nsubordinated interests, including an undivided seller\u2019s interest in the credit\ncard receivables and owning certain retained interests. At March 31, 2025 and\nDecember 31, 2024, the carrying values of the receivables in the trusts totaled $\n17.0billion and $ 18.1billion, which are included in loans and leases, and the\ncarrying values of senior debt securities that were issued to third-party\ninvestors from the trusts totaled $ 7.6billion and $ 8.0billion, which are\nincluded in long-term debt. Resecuritization Trusts The Corporation transfers\nsecurities, typically MBS, into resecuritization VIEs generally at the request of\ncustomers seeking securities with specific characteristics. Generally, there are\nno significant ongoing activities performed in a resecuritization trust, and no\nsingle investor has the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust. The Corporation\nresecuritized $ 11.4billion and $ 2.8billion of securities during the three months\nended March 31, 2025 and 2024. Securities transferred into resecuritization VIEs\nwere\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America72                                                               \n                                                                                  \nmeasured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in market making and\nsimilar activities prior to the resecuritization and, accordingly, no gain or loss\non sale was recorded. During the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024,\nresecuritization proceeds included securities with an initial fair value of $\n2.0billion and $ 88million, of which substantially all of the securities were\nclassified as trading account assets for both periods. Substantially all of the\ntrading account securities carried at fair value were categorized as Level 2\nwithin the fair value hierarchy. Customer VIEs Customer VIEs include credit-\nlinked, equity-linked and commodity-linked note VIEs, repackaging VIEs and asset\nacquisition VIEs, which are typically created on behalf of customers who wish to\nobtain market or credit exposure to a specific company, index, commodity or\nfinancial instrument. The Corporation\u2019s involvement in the VIE is limited to its\nloss exposure. The Corporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure to consolidated and\nunconsolidated customer VIEs totaled $ 1.2billion and $ 1.1billion at March 31,\n2025 and December 31, 2024, including the notional amount of derivatives to which\nthe Corporation is a counterparty, net of losses previously recorded, and the\nCorporation\u2019s investment, if any, in securities issued by the VIEs. Municipal Bond\nTrusts The Corporation administers municipal bond trusts that hold highly-rated,\nlong-term, fixed-rate municipal bonds. The trusts obtain financing by issuing\nfloating-rate trust certificates that reprice on a weekly or other short-term\nbasis to third-party investors. The Corporation\u2019s liquidity commitments to\nunconsolidated municipal bond trusts, including those for which the Corporation\nwas transferor, totaled $ 1.8billion at both March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\nThe weighted-average remaining life of bonds held in the trusts at March 31, 2025\nwas 10.7years. There were no significant write-downs or downgrades of assets or\nissuers during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. Collateralized Debt\nObligation VIEs The Corporation receives fees for structuring CDO VIEs, which hold\ndiversified pools of fixed-income securities, typically corporate debt or ABS,\nwhich the CDO VIEs fund by issuing multiple tranches of debt and equity\nsecurities. CDOs are generally managed by third-party portfolio managers. The\nCorporation typically transfers assets to these CDOs, holds securities issued by\nthe CDOs and may be a derivative counterparty to the CDOs. The Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated CDOs totaled $ 65million\nat both March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. Investment VIEs The Corporation\nsponsors, invests in or provides financing, which may be in connection with the\nsale of assets, to a variety of investment VIEs that hold loans, real estate, debt\nsecurities or other financial instruments and are designed to provide the desired\ninvestment profile to investors or the Corporation. At March 31, 2025 and December\n31, 2024, the Corporation\u2019s consolidated investment VIEs had total assets of $\n5million and $ 6million. The Corporation also held investments in unconsolidated\nVIEs with total assets of $ 23.2billion and $ 23.0billion at March 31, 2025 and\nDecember 31, 2024. The Corporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure associated with both\nconsolidated and unconsolidated investment VIEs totaled $ 2.5billion at both March\n31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 comprised primarily of on-balance sheet assets less\nnon-recourse liabilities. Leveraged Lease Trusts The Corporation\u2019s net investment\nin consolidated leveraged lease trusts totaled $ 1.0billion at both March 31, 2025\nand December 31, 2024. The trusts hold long-lived equipment such as rail cars,\npower generation and distribution equipment, and commercial aircraft. The\nCorporation structures the trusts and holds a significant residual interest. The\nnet investment represents the Corporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure to the trusts in\nthe unlikely event that the leveraged lease investments become worthless. Debt\nissued by the leveraged lease trusts is non-recourse to the Corporation. The\nfollowing table summarizes the maximum loss exposure and assets held by the\nCorporation that related to other asset-backed VIEs at March 31, 2025 and December\n31, 2024.\n

and similar\nentities that construct, own and operate\naffordable housing, renewable energy and\ncertain other projects. The total assets\nof these unconsolidated tax credit VIEs\nwere $ 85.0billion and $ 85.7billion as\nof March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\nAn unrelated third party is typically\nthe general partner or managing member\nand has control over the significant\nactivities of the VIE. As an investor,\ntax credits associated with the\ninvestments in these entities are\nallocated to the Corporation, as\nprovided by the U.S. Internal Revenue\nCode and related regulations, and are\nrecognized as income tax benefits in the\nCorporation\u2019s Consolidated Statement of\nIncome in the year they are earned,\nwhich varies based on the type of\ninvestments. Tax credits from\ninvestments in affordable housing are\nrecognized ratably over a term of up to\n10 years, and tax credits from renewable\nenergy investments are recognized either\nat inception for transactions electing\nInvestment Tax Credits (ITCs) or as\nenergy is produced for transactions\nelecting Production Tax Credits (PTCs),\nwhich is generally up to a 10-year time\nperiod. The volume and types of\ninvestments held by the Corporation will\ninfluence the amount of tax credits\nrecognized each period. The\nCorporation\u2019s equity investments in\naffordable housing and other\nprojectstotaled $ 16.4billion and $\n16.7billion at March 31, 2025 and\nDecember 31, 2024, which included\nunfunded capital contributions of $\n7.1billion and $ 7.5billion that are\nprobable to be paid over the next five\nyears. The Corporation may be asked to\ninvest additional amounts to support a\ntroubled affordable housing project.\nSuch additional investments have not\nbeen and are not expected to be\nsignificant. During the three months\nended March 31, 2025 and 2024, the\nCorporation recognized tax credits and\nother tax benefitsrelated to affordable\nhousing equity investments of $\n570million and $ 576million and reported\npretax losses in\n\nother incomeof $ 426million and $\n412million. The Corporation\u2019s equity\ninvestments in renewable energy totaled\n$ 12.6billion and $ 13.0billion at March\n31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.

or practice to sell or repledge. At March 31, 2025 and\nDecember 31, 2024, the fair value of this collateral was $ 1.0trillion and $\n925.7billion, of which $ 945.7billion and $ 882.2billion were sold or repledged.\nThe primary source of this collateral is securities borrowed or purchased under\nagreements to resell. For more information on collateral, see Note 10 \u2013 Securities\nFinancing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings, Collateral and Restricted Cash to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2024 Annual Report on Form\n10-K . Restricted Cash At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Corporation\nheld restricted cash included within cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet of $ 5.9billion and $ 6.1billion, predominantly related to cash\nsegregated in compliance with securities regulations and cash held on deposit with\ncentral banks to meet reserve requirements.\n\nNOTE 10 Commitments and Contingencies\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Corporation enters into a number of off-\nbalance sheet commitments. These commitments expose the Corporation to varying\ndegrees of credit and market risk and are subject to the same credit and market\nrisk limitation reviews as those instruments recorded on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. For more information on commitments and contingencies, see Note 12 \u2013\nCommitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K .\n\nCredit Extension Commitments The Corporation enters into commitments to extend\ncredit such as loan commitments, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and commercial\nletters of credit to meet the financing needs of its customers. The following\ntable includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments\nnet of amounts distributed (i.e., syndicated or participated) to other financial\ninstitutions. The distributed amounts were $ 10.6billion and $ 10.4billion at\nMarch 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. The carrying value of the Corporation\u2019s\ncredit extension commitments at both March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024,\nexcluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option, was $ 1.1billion,\nwhich predominantly related to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The\ncarrying value of these commitments is classified in accrued expenses and other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Legally binding commitments to\nextend credit generally have specified rates and maturities. Certain of these\ncommitments have adverse change clauses that help to protect the Corporation\nagainst deterioration in the borrower\u2019s ability to pay. The following table\nincludes the notional amount of commitments of $ 2.0billion and $ 2.2billion at\nMarch 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 that are accounted for under the fair value\noption. However, the table excludes the cumulative net fair value for these\ncommitments of $ 64million and $ 144million at March 31, 2025 and December 31,\n2024, which is classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities.

classified as\ninvestment grade and non-investment grade based on the credit quality of the\nunderlying reference name within the instrument were $ 25.1billion and $\n10.1billion at March 31, 2025, and $ 25.0billion and $ 10.1billion at December 31,\n2024. Amounts in the table include consumer SBLCs of $ 1.1billion and $ 1.0billion\nat March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\n\n(3) Primarily includes second-loss positions on lease-end residual value\nguarantees.\n\n(4) Includes business card unused lines of credit.\nOther Commitments At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Corporation had\ncommitments to purchase loans (e.g., residential mortgage and commercial real\nestate) of $ 704million and $ 242million, which upon settlement will be included\nin trading account assets, loans or LHFS, and commitments to purchase commercial\nloans of $ 877million and $ 768million, which upon settlement will be included in\ntrading account assets. At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Corporation\nhad commitments to enter into resale and forward-dated resale and securities\nborrowing agreements of $ 169.8billion and $ 109.8billion, and commitments to\nenter into forward-dated repurchase and securities lending agreements of $\n124.7billion and $ 87.1billion. A significant portion of these commitments will\nexpire within the next 12months. At both March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the\nCorporation had a commitment to originate or purchase up to $ 4.0billion, on a\nrolling 12-month basis, of auto loans and leases from a strategic partner. This\ncommitment extends through November 2026 and can be terminated with 12months prior\nnotice. At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Corporation had unfunded\nequity investment commitments of $ 396million and $ 787million. As a Federal\nReserve member bank, the Corporation is required to subscribe to a certain amount\nof shares issued by its Federal Reserve district bank, which pays cumulative\ndividends at a prescribed rate. At both March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the\nCorporation had paid $ 5.4billion for half of its subscribed shares, with the\nremaining half subject to call by the Federal Reserve district bank board, which\nthe Corporation believes is remote. Other Guarantees Bank-owned Life Insurance\nBook Value Protection The Corporation sells products that offer book value\nprotection to insurance carriers who offer group life insurance policies to\ncorporations, primarily banks. At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the\nnotional amount of these guarantees totaled $ 3.1billion and $ 3.3billion. At\nMarch 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Corporation\u2019s maximum exposure related\nto these guarantees totaled $ 474million and $ 506million, with estimated maturity\ndates between 2034 and 2037. Merchant Services The Corporation in its role as\nmerchant acquirer or as a sponsor of other merchant acquirers may be held liable\nfor any reversed charges that cannot be collected from the merchants due to, among\nother things, merchant fraud or insolvency. If charges are properly reversed after\na purchase and cannot be collected from either the merchants or merchant\nacquirers, the Corporation may be held liable for these reversed charges. The\nability to reverse a charge is primarily governed by the applicable payment\nnetwork rules and regulations, which include, but are not limited to, the type of\ncharge, type of payment used and time limits. The total amount of transactions\nsubject to reversal under payment network rules and regulations processed for the\npreceding six-month period, which was approximately $ 188billion, is an estimate\nof the Corporation\u2019s maximum potential exposure as of March 31, 2025. The\nCorporation\u2019s risk in this area primarily relates to circumstances where a\ncardholder has purchased goods or services for future delivery. The Corporation\nmitigates this risk by requiring cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit or\nother types of collateral from certain merchants. The Corporation\u2019s reserves for\ncontingent losses, and the losses incurred related to the merchant processing\nactivity were not significant.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America78                                                               \n                                                                                  \nRepresentations and Warranties\nObligations and Corporate Guarantees For\nmore information on representations and\nwarranties obligations and corporate\nguarantees, see Note 12 \u2013 Commitments\nand Contingencies to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2024 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. The reserve for representations\nand warranties obligations and corporate\nguarantees was $ 184million at both\nMarch 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 and\nis included in accrued expenses and\nother liabilities on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet, and the related provision\nis included in other income in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income. The\nrepresentations and warranties reserve\nrepresents the Corporation\u2019s best\nestimate of incurred losses, is based on\nits experience in previous negotiations,\nand is subject to judgment, a variety of\nassumptions and known or unknown\nuncertainties. At March 31, 2025, the\nestimated range of possible loss in\nexcess of the accrued representations\nand warranties reserve was not\nsignificant. Future representations and\nwarranties losses may occur in excess of\nthe amounts recorded for these\nexposures; however, the Corporation does\nnot expect such amounts to be material\nto the Corporation's financial condition\nand liquidity. Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation Sponsored Member Repo\nProgram The Corporation acts as a\nsponsoring member in a repo program\nwhereby the Corporation clears certain\neligible resale and repurchase\nagreements through the Government\nSecurities Division of the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation on behalf of\nclients that are sponsored members in\naccordance with the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation\u2019s rules. As part of\nthis program, the Corporation guarantees\nthe payment and performance of its\nsponsored members to the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation. The Corporation\u2019s\nguarantee obligation is secured by a\nsecurity interest in cash or high-\nquality securities collateral placed by\nclients with the clearinghouse and\ntherefore, the potential for the\nCorporation to incur significant losses\nunder this arrangement is remote. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum potential\nexposure, without taking into\nconsideration the related collateral,\nwas $ 207.1billion and $ 191.9billion at\nMarch 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\nOther Guarantees In the normal course of\nbusiness, the Corporation periodically\nguarantees the obligations of its\naffiliates in a variety of transactions\nincluding ISDA-related transactions and\nnon-ISDA related transactions such as\ncommodities trading, repurchase\nagreements, prime brokerage agreements\nand other transactions.\n\nGuarantees of Certain Long-term Debt The\nCorporation, as the parent company,\nfully and unconditionally guarantees the\nsecurities issued by BofA Finance LLC, a\nconsolidated finance subsidiary of the\nCorporation, and effectively provides\nfor the full and unconditional guarantee\nof trust securities and capital\nsecurities issued by certain statutory\ntrust companies that are 100percent\nowned finance subsidiaries of the\nCorporation. Other Contingencies In\n2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC) issued a final rule\nto impose a special assessment to\nrecover certain estimated losses to the\nDeposit Insurance Fund (DIF) arising\nfrom the closures of Silicon Valley Bank\nand Signature Bank. The estimated losses\nwill be recovered through quarterly\nspecial assessments collected from\ncertain insured depository institutions,\nincluding the Corporation, and\ncollection began during the three months\nended June 30, 2024. At March 31, 2025\nand December 31, 2024, the Corporation\u2019s\naccrual for its estimated share of the\nFDIC special assessment was $ 1.4billion\nand $ 1.7billion. The Corporation\ncontinues to monitor the FDIC\u2019s\nestimated loss to the DIF, which could\naffect the amount of its accrued\nliability.\n\nLitigation and Regulatory Matters The\nfollowing disclosures supplement the\ndisclosure in Note 12 \u2013 Commitments and\nContingencies to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2024 Annual Report on Form\n10-K (the prior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure). In the\nordinary course of business, the\nCorporation and its subsidiaries are\nroutinely defendants in or parties to\nmany pending and threatened legal,\nregulatory and governmental actions and\nproceedings. In view of the inherent\ndifficulty of predicting the outcome of\nsuch matters, particularly where the\nclaimants seek very large or\nindeterminate damages or where the\nmatters present novel legal theories or\ninvolve a large number of parties, the\nCorporation generally cannot predict the\neventual outcome of the pending matters,\ntiming of the ultimate resolution of\nthese matters, or eventual loss, fines\nor penalties related to each pending\nmatter. As a matter develops, the\nCorporation, in conjunction with any\noutside counsel handling the matter,\nevaluates whether such matter presents a\nloss contingency that is probable and\nestimable, and, for the matters\ndisclosed below and in the prior\ncommitments and contingencies\ndisclosure, whether a loss in excess of\nany accrued liability is reasonably\npossible in future periods. Once the\nloss contingency is deemed to be both\nprobable and estimable, the Corporation\nwill establish an accrued liability and\nrecord a corresponding amount of\nlitigation-related expense. The\nCorporation continues to monitor the\nmatter for further developments that\ncould affect the amount of the accrued\nliability that has been previously\nestablished. Excluding expenses of\ninternal and external legal service\nproviders, litigation and regulatory\ninvestigation-related expense of $\n156million and $ 97million was\nrecognized for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2025 and 2024.\n                                                                                  \n  79Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nFor any matter disclosed in this Note\nand in the prior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure for which a\nloss in future periods is reasonably\npossible and estimable (whether in\nexcess of an accrued liability or where\nthere is no accrued liability), the\nCorporation\u2019s estimated range of\npossible loss is $ 0 to $ 0.8billion in\nexcess of the accrued liability, if any,\nas of March 31, 2025. The accrued\nliability and estimated range of\npossible loss are based upon currently\navailable information and subject to\nsignificant judgment, a variety of\nassumptions and known and unknown\nuncertainties. The matters underlying\nthe accrued liability and estimated\nrange of possible loss are unpredictable\nand may change from time to time, and\nactual losses may vary significantly\nfrom the current estimate and accrual.\nThe estimated range of possible loss\ndoes not represent the Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum loss exposure. Information is\nprovided below and in the prior\ncommitments and contingencies disclosure\nregarding the nature of the litigation\nor other contingency and, where\nspecified, associated claimed damages.\nBased on current knowledge, and taking\ninto account accrued liabilities,\nmanagement does not believe that loss\ncontingencies arising from pending\nmatters, including the matters described\nbelow and in the prior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure, will have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the\nconsolidated financial condition or\nliquidity of the Corporation. However,\nin light of the significant judgment,\nvariety of assumptions and uncertainties\ninvolved in those matters, some of which\nare beyond the Corporation\u2019s control,\nand the very large or indeterminate\ndamages sought in some of those matters,\nan adverse outcome in one or more of\nthose matters could be material to the\nCorporation\u2019s business or results of\noperations for any particular reporting\nperiod, or cause significant\nreputational harm. CFPB Lawsuit Related\nto Processing Electronic Payments On\nMarch 4, 2025, the CFPB dismissed the\nlawsuit with prejudice. Deposit\nInsurance Assessment On March 31, 2025,\nthe U.S. District Court for the District\nof Columbia (District Court) granted the\nFDIC\u2019s motion for summary judgment in\nthe amount of $ 540million plus\ninterest, related to assessments to the\nDIF for the period from the second\nquarter of 2013 to the fourth quarter of\n2014, which has been fully accrued by\nthe Corporation.

The\nCorporation determines the fair values of its financial instruments under\napplicable accounting standards and conducts a review of fair value hierarchy\nclassifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of fair value\nhierarchy\n\nclassifications are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models\nmeasuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities become unobservable or\nobservable in the current marketplace. During the three months ended March 31,\n2025, there were no changes to valuation approaches or techniques that had, or are\nexpected to have, a material impact on the Corporation\u2019s consolidated financial\nposition or results of operations. For more information regarding the fair value\nhierarchy, how the Corporation measures fair value and valuation techniques, see\nNote 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 20 \u2013 Fair Value\nMeasurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2024\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. The Corporation accounts for certain financial\ninstruments under the fair value option.
