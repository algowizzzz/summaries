This\nsummary does not describe all of the risks and investment considerations with\nrespect to such an investment, including risks and considerations relating to a\nprospective investor\u0092s particular circumstances. For information regarding risks\nand uncertainties that may materially affect Bank of America\u0092s business and\nresults, please refer to the information under the caption \u0093Item 1A. Risk\nFactors\u0094 in its annual report on Form 10-Kfor the year ended December 31, 2021,\nwhich is incorporated by reference in this prospectus, as well as those risks\nand uncertainties discussed in subsequent filings of Bank of America that are\nincorporated by reference in this prospectus. You also should review the risk\nfactors that will be set forth in other documents that Bank of America will file\nafter the date of this prospectus, together with the risk factors set forth in\nany applicable supplement for a particular offering of securities. Prospective\ninvestors should consult their own financial, legal, tax, and other professional\nadvisors as to the risks associated with an investment in the securities and the\nsuitability of the investment for the investor.\n\nRisks Relating to Regulatory Resolution Strategies and Long-Term Debt\nRequirements\n\nA resolution under Bank of America\u0092s single point of entry resolution strategy\ncould materially adversely affect its liquidity and financial condition and its\nability to make payments on its debt securities and under its guarantee of BofA\nFinance\u0092s payment obligations on the BofA Finance debt securities.\n\nBank of America is required periodically to submit a plan to the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (\u0093FDIC\u0094) and the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (\u0093Federal Reserve\u0094) describing its\nresolution strategy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of material\nfinancial distress or failure. In Bank of America\u0092s current plan, its preferred\nresolution strategy is a single point of entry (\u0093SPOE\u0094) strategy. This strategy\nprovides that only Bank of America (the parent holding company) would file for\nbankruptcy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and contemplates providing certain key\noperating subsidiaries with sufficient capital and liquidity to operate through\nsevere stress and to enable such subsidiaries to continue operating or be wound\ndown in a solvent manner following a Bank of America bankruptcy. Bank of America\nhas\nentered into intercompany arrangements governing the contribution of most of its\ncapital and liquidity with these key subsidiaries. As part of these\narrangements, Bank of America has transferred most of its assets (and has agreed\nto transfer\nadditional assets) to a wholly-owned holding company subsidiary in exchange for\na subordinated note. Certain of Bank of America\u0092s remaining assets secure its\nongoing obligations under these intercompany arrangements. The wholly-owned\nholding\ncompany subsidiary also has provided Bank of America with a committed line of\ncredit that, in addition to Bank of America\u0092s cash, dividends and interest\npayments, including interest payments Bank of America receives in respect of the\nsubordinated note, may be used to fund Bank of America\u0092s obligations. These\nintercompany arrangements include provisions to terminate the line of credit and\nforgive the subordinated note and require Bank of America to contribute its\nremaining\nfinancial assets to the wholly-owned holding company subsidiary if Bank of\nAmerica\u0092s projected liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution\nbecomes imminent, which could materially and adversely affect Bank of America\u0092s\nliquidity and ability to meet its payment obligations, including on its debt\nsecurities and under its guarantee of payment obligations of BofA Finance on the\ndebt securities. In addition, Bank of America\u0092s preferred resolution strategy\ncould\nresult in holders of BofA Finance\u0092s debt securities being in a worse position\nand suffering greater losses than would have been the case under a bankruptcy\nproceeding or other resolution scenarios or plans.\n\n7\n\nUnder Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\nof 2010 (the\n\u0093Financial Reform Act\u0094), when a global systemically important banking\norganization (\u0093G-SIB\u0094), such as Bank of America, is in default or danger of\ndefault, the FDIC may be appointed\nreceiver in order to conduct an orderly liquidation of such institution. In the\nevent of such appointment, the FDIC could, among other things, invoke the\norderly liquidation authority, instead of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, if the\nSecretary of the\nU.S. Department of Treasury makes certain financial distress and systemic risk\ndeterminations. In 2013, the FDIC issued a notice describing its preferred SPOE\nstrategy for resolving a G-SIB. Under this\napproach, the FDIC could replace Bank of America with a bridge holding company,\nwhich could continue operations and result in an orderly resolution of the\nunderlying bank, but whose equity would be held solely for the benefit of Bank\nof\nAmerica\u0092s creditors. The FDIC\u0092s single point of entry strategy may result in\nholders of Bank of America\u0092s debt securities suffering greater losses than would\nhave been the case under a bankruptcy proceeding or a different resolution\nstrategy. To the extent that Bank of America is resolved under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code or the FDIC\u0092s orderly liquidation authority, third-party\ncreditors of Bank of America\u0092s subsidiaries may receive significant or full\nrecoveries on\ntheir claims while holders of Bank of America\u0092s debt securities could face\nsignificant or complete losses.\n\nIf Bank of America enters into a resolution proceeding, holders of its debt\nsecurities would be at risk of absorbing its losses.\n\nIf Bank of America\nenters a resolution proceeding under either the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or Title II\nof the Financial Reform Act, its losses would be imposed first on holders of its\nequity securities and thereafter on holders of its unsecured debt, including its\ndebt\nsecurities, and some or all of such securities could be significantly reduced or\neliminated as a result of such resolution proceeding.\n\nUnder Bank of America\u0092s SPOE resolution strategy, and the single point of entry\nstrategy preferred by the FDIC under Title II of the\nFinancial Reform Act, the value that would be distributed to holders of its\nunsecured debt, including its debt securities, may not be sufficient to repay\nall or part of the principal amount and interest on such debt, and holders of\nsuch debt could\nreceive no consideration at all under these resolution scenarios. Either of\nthese resolution strategies could result in holders of Bank of America\u0092s debt\nsecurities being in a worse position and suffering greater losses than would\nhave been the\ncase under a different resolution strategy. Although SPOE is Bank of America\u0092s\npreferred resolution strategy, neither Bank of America nor a bankruptcy court\nwould be obligated to follow its SPOE strategy. Additionally, the FDIC is not\nobligated\nto follow its SPOE strategy to resolve Bank of America under Title II of the\nFinancial Reform Act. For more information regarding the financial consequences\nof any such resolution proceeding, see \u0093Description of Debt Securities of Bank\nof\nAmerica Corporation\u0097Financial Consequences to Unsecured Debtholders of Single\nPoint of Entry Resolution Strategy\u0094 below.\n\nBank of America is subject to the Federal Reserve\u0092s final rules requiring U.S.\nG-SIBsto maintain minimum amounts of long-term debt meeting specified\neligibility requirements.\n\nUnder the rules of the Federal Reserve\nrelating to total loss-absorbing capacity (the \u0093TLAC Rules\u0094), Bank of America,\nas a U.S. G-SIB, is required to, among other things, maintain minimum amounts of\nunsecured external long-term debt\nsatisfying certain eligibility criteria (\u0093eligible LTD\u0094) and other loss-\nabsorbing capacity for the purpose of absorbing its losses in a resolution\nproceeding under either the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or Title II of the Financial\nReform Act.\nAny senior long-term debt must include terms required by the TLAC Rules in order\nto qualify as eligible LTD. Actions required to comply with the TLAC Rules could\nimpact Bank of America\u0092s funding and liquidity risk management plans.\n\n8\n\nRisks Relating to Debt Securities Generally\n\nBofA Finance is a finance subsidiary and, as such, has no independent assets,\noperations or revenues.\n\nBofA Finance is a finance subsidiary of Bank of America, has no operations other\nthan those related to the issuance, administration and\nrepayment of its debt securities that are guaranteed by Bank of America as\ndescribed in this prospectus and other debt securities of BofA Finance\nguaranteed by Bank of America, and is dependent upon Bank of America and/or Bank\nof America\u0092s\nother subsidiaries to meet its obligations under the debt securities in the\nordinary course. However, BofA Finance will have no assets available for\ndistributions to holders of its debt securities if they make claims in respect\nof such debt\nsecurities in a bankruptcy, resolution or similar proceeding. Accordingly, any\nrecoveries by such holders in respect of such claims in any such proceeding will\nbe limited to those available under Bank of America\u0092s guarantee of such debt\nsecurities, and any obligations under that guarantee will rank equally in right\nof payment with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Bank of\nAmerica, except obligations that are subject to any priorities or preferences by\nlaw, and\nsenior in right of payment to Bank of America\u0092s subordinated obligations.\nHolders of BofA Finance\u0092s debt securities will have recourse only to a single\nclaim against Bank of America and its assets under Bank of America\u0092s guarantee\nof\nthe debt securities, and holders of the debt securities should accordingly\nassume that in any bankruptcy, resolution or similar proceeding, they would not\nhave priority over, and should be treated equally with, the claims of all other\nunsecured and\nunsubordinated obligations of Bank of America, including claims of holders of\nunsecured senior debt securities issued by Bank of America.\n\nBank of America\u0092s ability to make payments on its debt securities and under its\nguarantee of BofA Finance\u0092s debt securities will depend upon its receipt of\nfunds from its subsidiaries, and applicable laws and regulations, and actions\ntaken under Bank of America\u0092s resolution plan, could restrict the ability of its\nsubsidiaries to transfer such funds.\n\nBank of America is a holding company and conducts substantially all of its\noperations through its subsidiaries. Bank of America depends on\ndividends and other distributions, loans and other payments from its\nsubsidiaries to fund payments on its debt securities and under its guarantee of\nthe debt securities of BofA Finance. Any inability of these subsidiaries to pay\ndividends or make\npayments to Bank of America may adversely affect its cash flow and financial\ncondition. Many of these subsidiaries, including bank and broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries, are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments or authorize\nregulatory bodies to\nblock or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to Bank of America or\nto Bank of America\u0092s other subsidiaries. In addition, Bank of America\u0092s bank and\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to\nlend or transact with affiliates and to minimum regulatory capital and liquidity\nrequirements. Lower earnings in Bank of America\u0092s subsidiaries can reduce the\namount of funds available to Bank of America as a holding company. Adverse\nbusiness\nand economic conditions, including changes in interest and currency exchange\nrates, illiquidity or volatility in areas where Bank of America has concentrated\ncredit risk, and a failure in or breach of Bank of America\u0092s operational or\nsecurity\nsystems or infrastructure, could affect Bank of America\u0092s business and results\nof operations. Intercompany arrangements Bank of America has entered into in\nconnection with its resolution planning could restrict the amount of funding\navailable\nto it from its subsidiaries under certain adverse conditions, as described below\nunder \u0093\u0097A resolution under Bank of America\u0092s single point of entry resolution\nstrategy could materially adversely affect its liquidity and financial\ncondition and its ability to make payments on its debt securities and under its\nguarantee of BofA Finance\u0092s payment obligations on the BofA Finance debt\nsecurities.\u0094 These restrictions could prevent those Bank of America subsidiaries\nfrom\npaying dividends or making other distributions to Bank of America or otherwise\nproviding funds to Bank of America that Bank of America needs in order to\n\n9\n\nmake payments under its guarantee of the debt securities of BofA Finance. In\naddition, Bank of America\u0092s right to participate in any distribution of assets\nof any of its subsidiaries upon\nsuch subsidiary\u0092s liquidation or otherwise, will be subject to the prior claims\nof creditors of that subsidiary, except to the extent that any of Bank of\nAmerica\u0092s claims as a creditor of such subsidiary may be recognized.\n\nBank of America\u0092s obligations on its debt securities and under its guarantee of\nBofA Finance\u0092s debt securities will be structurally subordinated to liabilities\nof Bank of America\u0092s subsidiaries.\n\nBecause Bank of America is a holding company, its\nright to participate in any distribution of the assets of any subsidiary,\nincluding BofA Finance, upon such subsidiary\u0092s liquidation or reorganization or\notherwise is subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary, except\nto the\nextent Bank of America may itself be recognized as a creditor of that\nsubsidiary. As a result, Bank of America\u0092s obligations under its debt securities\nor under its guarantee of BofA Finance\u0092s debt securities will be structurally\nsubordinated to all existing and future liabilities of Bank of America\u0092s\nsubsidiaries, and claimants under its debt securities or under its guarantee of\nBofA Finance\u0092s debt securities should look only to Bank of America\u0092s assets for\npayments. Further, creditors of Bank of America\u0092s subsidiaries recapitalized\npursuant to Bank of America\u0092s resolution plan generally would be entitled to\npayment of their claims from the assets of the subsidiaries, including Bank of\nAmerica\u0092s contributed assets. In addition, any obligations of Bank of America\nunder its debt securities or under its guarantee of BofA Finance\u0092s debt\nsecurities will be unsecured and, therefore, in a bankruptcy or similar\nproceeding, will\neffectively rank junior to Bank of America\u0092s secured obligations to the extent\nof the value of the assets securing such obligations.\n\nHolders of the debt securities of Bank of America and claimants under Bank of\nAmerica\u0092s guarantees of the BofA Finance debt securities could be at greater\nrisk of being structurally subordinated if Bank of America sells or conveys all\nor substantially all of its assets to one or more of its majority-owned\nsubsidiaries.\n\nBank of America and BofA Finance each may sell, convey or transfer all or\nsubstantially all of its assets to one or more entities that are\ndirect or indirect majority-owned subsidiaries of Bank of America in which Bank\nof America and/or one or more of Bank of America\u0092s subsidiaries owns more than\n50% of the combined voting power, and under the indentures under which the debt\nsecurities will be issued, including the provisions thereof relating to Bank of\nAmerica\u0092s guarantee of such debt securities, such subsidiary or subsidiaries\nwill not be required to assume the obligations of Bank of America under its debt\nsecurities, the obligations of BofA Finance under its debt securities or the\nobligations of Bank of America under its guarantee of the debt securities of\nBofA Finance, as the case may be. In any such event, Bank of America will remain\nthe sole\nobligor on its debt securities, BofA Finance will remain the sole obligor on its\ndebt securities and Bank of America will remain the sole obligor on such\nguarantee, as the case may be. In such event, creditors of any such subsidiary\nor subsidiaries\nwould have additional assets from which to recover on their claims, while\nobligations of Bank of America under its debt securities or under its guarantee\nof BofA Finance\u0092s debt securities, as the case may be, would be structurally\nsubordinated\nto creditors of such subsidiary or subsidiaries with respect to such transferred\nassets. See \u0093Description of Debt Securities of Bank of America\u0097Limitation on\nMergers and Sales of Assets\u0094 and \u0093Description of Debt Securities of\nBofA Finance\u0097Limitation on Mergers and Sales of Assets\u0094 below for more\ninformation.\n\n10\n\nDebt securities issued by BofA Finance will not have the benefit of any cross-\ndefault or cross-acceleration with other indebtedness of Bank of America or BofA\nFinance; events of bankruptcy or insolvency or resolution proceedings relating\nto Bank of America and covenant breach by Bank of America will not constitute an\nevent of default with respect to the guaranteed debt securities of BofA Finance.\nDebt securities issued by BofA Finance will not have the benefit of any cross-\ndefault or cross-acceleration with other indebtedness of Bank of America or BofA\nFinance. In addition, events of bankruptcy or insolvency or resolution or\nsimilar proceedings relating to Bank of America will not constitute an event of\ndefault with respect to the debt securities of BofA Finance that are guaranteed\nby Bank of America. Furthermore, it will not constitute an event of default with\nrespect to the debt securities of BofA Finance if the guarantee thereof by Bank\nof America ceases to be in full force and effect for any reason. Therefore,\nevents of bankruptcy or insolvency or resolution or similar proceedings relating\nto Bank of America (in the absence of any such event occurring with respect to\nBofA Finance) will not permit BofA Finance\u0092s debt securities to be declared due\nand payable. In addition, a breach of a covenant by Bank of America (including,\nfor example, a breach of Bank of America\u0092s covenants with respect to mergers or\nthe sale of all or substantially all its assets), will not permit BofA Finance\u0092s\ndebt securities to be declared due and payable. The value you receive on the\ndebt securities may be significantly less than what you otherwise would have\nreceived had the debt securities been declared due and payable immediately upon\ncertain events of bankruptcy or insolvency or resolution or similar proceedings\nrelating to Bank of America or the breach of a covenant by Bank of America or\nupon Bank of America\u0092s guarantee ceasing to be in full force and effect. Events\nfor which acceleration rights under Bank of America\u0092s senior debt securities may\nbe exercised are more limited than those available pursuant to the terms of its\noutstanding senior debt securities issued prior to January 13, 2017. In response\nto the TLAC Rules, on January 13, 2017, Bank of America modified the terms of\nits senior debt securities to be issued on or after that date to, among other\nthings, limit the circumstances under which the payment of the principal amount\nof such senior debt securities can be accelerated (unless specified otherwise in\nthe applicable supplement). All or substantially all of Bank of America\u0092s\noutstanding senior debt securities issued prior to January 13, 2017 (the\n\u0093Pre-2017Senior Debt Securities\u0094) provide acceleration rights for nonpayment or\nbankruptcy. The Pre-2017Senior Debt Securities also provide acceleration rights\nif Bank of America defaults in the performance of its covenants in those senior\ndebt securities or the indenture under which those securities were issued. In\naddition, the Pre-2017Senior Debt Securities do not require a 30-day cureperiod\nbefore a nonpayment of principal becomes an event of default and acceleration\nrights become exercisable with respect to such nonpayment. However, under the\nBAC Senior Indenture (as defined below), unless Bank of America specifies\notherwise in the applicable supplement, payment of the principal amount of its\nsenior debt securities issued under such indenture:\n                                                                                  \n      may be accelerated only (i)\u00a0if Bank of America defaults in the payment of   \n      the principal of or interest on                                             \n      those senior debt securities and, in each case, the default continues for   \n      a period of 30 days, or (ii)\u00a0upon Bank of America\u0092s voluntary or             \n      involuntary bankruptcy and, in the case of Bank of America\u0092s involuntary     \n      bankruptcy, the event                                                       \n      continues for a period of 60 days; and                                      \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      may not be accelerated if Bank of America defaults in the performance of    \n      any other covenants contained in such                                       \n      debt securities or the BAC Senior Indenture.                                \n                                                                                  \n11\n\nAs a result of these differing provisions, if Bank of America breaches or\notherwise defaults in the performance of a covenant (other than a payment\ncovenant) that applies both to senior debt securities that it issued on or after\nJanuary 13, 2017 and the Pre-2017 SeniorDebt Securities, the Pre-2017Senior Debt\nSecurities would have acceleration rights that would not be available to the\nholders of its other senior debt securities. In addition, if Bank of America fails\nto pay principal when due with respect to its senior debt securities issued on or\nafter on or after January 13, 2017 and the Pre-2017Senior Debt Securities, an\nevent of default would occur immediately with respect to the Pre-2017Senior Debt\nSecurities (and the exercise of acceleration rights could proceed immediately in\naccordance with the provisions of the indenture under which those senior debt\nsecurities were issued), while the holders of its other senior debt securities\nmust wait for the 30-day cureperiod to expire before such nonpayment of principal\nbecomes an event of default and any acceleration rights are triggered with respect\nto such nonpayment. Any repayment of the principal amount of Pre-2017Senior Debt\nSecurities following the exercise of acceleration rights in circumstances in which\nsuch rights are not available to the holders of Bank of America\u0092s other senior\ndebt securities (including its senior debt securities offered by this prospectus)\ncould adversely affect its ability to make timely payments on such other senior\ndebt securities thereafter. The market value of the debt securities of Bank of\nAmerica and BofA Finance may be less than the principal amount of such debt\nsecurities. The market for, and market value of, the debt securities of Bank of\nAmerica and BofA Finance may be affected by a number of factors. These factors\ninclude:\n                                                                                  \n      the method of calculating the principal of or any premium, interest or      \n      other amounts payable on the debt                                           \n      securities;                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                              \n      the time remaining to maturity of the debt securities;  \n                                                              \n                                                                         \n      the aggregate amount outstanding of the relevant debt securities;  \n                                                                         \n                                                                    \n      any redemption or repayment features of the debt securities;  \n                                                                    \n                                                                                \n      the level, direction, and volatility of market interest rates generally;  \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n      general economic conditions of the capital markets in the United States;  \n                                                                                \n                                                                                  \n      geopolitical conditions and other financial, political, regulatory and      \n      judicial events that affect the financial                                   \n      markets generally; and                                                      \n                                                                                  \n                                                                         \n      any market-making activities with respect to the debt securities.  \n                                                                         \nOften, the only way to liquidate your investment in the debt securities of Bank of\nAmerica and BofA Finance prior to maturity will be to sell the debt securities. At\nthat time, there may be a very illiquid market for the debt securities or no\nmarket at all. If you sell your debt securities prior to maturity, you may receive\nless than the principal amount of such debt securities. Redemption of the debt\nsecurities of Bank of America and/or BofA Finance prior to maturity may result in\na reduced return on your investment. The terms of the debt securities of Bank of\nAmerica and BofA Finance may permit or require redemption of the debt securities\nprior to maturity. That redemption may occur at a time when prevailing interest\nrates are relatively low. As a result, a holder of the redeemed debt securities\nmay not be able to invest the redemption proceeds in a new investment that yields\na similar return. 12\n\nActual or perceived changes in the creditworthiness of Bank of America may affect\nthe value of the Bank of America\u0092s debt securities and BofA Finance\u0092s guaranteed\ndebt securities.\n\nBank of America\u0092s credit\nratings are an assessment of its ability to pay its obligations, including its\nobligations under its debt securities and its guarantee of BofA Finance\u0092s debt\nsecurities. Consequently, Bank of America\u0092s perceived creditworthiness and actual\nor anticipated changes in its credit ratings may affect the market value of Bank\nof America\u0092s debt securities and BofA Finance\u0092s guaranteed debt securities.\nHowever, because the return on Bank of America\u0092s securities generally depends\nupon factors in addition to its ability to pay its obligations, an improvement in\nBank of America\u0092s credit rating will not reduce the other investment risks, if\nany, related to Bank of America\u0092s debt securities or BofA Finance\u0092s\nguaranteed debt securities.\n\nBank of America and/or BofA Finance cannot assure you that a trading market for\nyour debt securities will ever develop or be maintained.\n\nBank of America and/or BofA Finance may not list the debt securities on any\nsecurities exchange.\nNeither Bank of America nor BofA Finance can predict how these debt securities\nwill trade in the secondary market or whether that market will be liquid or\nilliquid. The number of potential buyers of Bank of America\u0092s and/or BofA\nFinance\u0092s\ndebt securities in any secondary market may be limited. Although any underwriters,\ndealers or agents may purchase and sell these debt securities in the secondary\nmarket from time to time, these underwriters, dealers or agents will not be\nobligated\nto do so and may discontinue making a market for the securities at any time\nwithout giving Bank of America and/or BofA Finance notice. Neither Bank of America\nnor BofA Finance can assure you that a secondary market for its debt securities\nwill\ndevelop, or that if one develops, it will be maintained.\n\nThe hedging activities of affiliates of Bank of America and/or BofA Finance may\ncreate conflicts of interest with you.\n\nBank of America, BofA Finance or one or more of their broker-dealer affiliates,\nincluding\nBofA Securities, Inc., may engage in trading activities that are not for your\naccount or on your behalf. These trading activities may present a conflict of\ninterest between the interest of holders of the debt securities and the interests\nBank of\nAmerica, BofA Finance and their affiliates may have in its proprietary accounts,\nin facilitating transactions, including block trades, for its other customers, and\nin accounts under Bank of America\u0092s management. These trading activities could\ninfluence secondary trading (if any) in the debt securities, or otherwise could be\nadverse to the interests of a beneficial owner of the debt securities.\n\nRisks Relating to Debt Securities Denominated in a Currency Other than the\nInvestor\u0092s Home Currency\n\nBank of America and/or BofA Finance may issue debt securities denominated in, or\nwith respect to which principal, interest and/or other amounts payable are payable\nin, a currency other than the currency of the country in which you reside or the\ncurrency in which you conduct your business or activities (the \u0093home currency\u0094).\nIf you intend to invest in debt securities denominated or payable in a currency\nother than your home currency, you should consult your own financial and legal\nadvisors as to the currency risks related to your investment. Such debt securities\nare not an appropriate investment for you if you are not knowledgeable about the\nsignificant terms and conditions of such debt securities, foreign currency\ntransactions or financial matters in general.\n\n13\n\nAn investment in debt securities denominated or payable in a currency other than\nyour home currency involves currency-related risks.\n\nAn investment in debt securities denominated or payable in a currency other than\nyour\nhome currency entails significant risks that are not associated with a similar\ninvestment in debt securities that are payable solely in your home currency. These\nrisks include possible significant changes in rates of exchange between your home\ncurrency and the applicable specified currency of the debt securities, and the\nimposition or modification of foreign exchange controls or other conditions by\napplicable governmental entities. These risks generally depend on factors over\nwhich Bank\nof America and BofA Finance have no control, such as economic and political events\nand the supply of and demand for the relevant currencies in the global markets.\n\nChanges in currency exchange rates can be volatile and may adversely affect an\ninvestment in debt securities denominated or payable in a currency other than your\nhome currency.\n\nIn recent years, exchange rates between certain foreign currencies have been\nhighly volatile.\nThis volatility may continue and could spread to other currencies in the future.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates could affect adversely an investment in\ndebt securities denominated or payable in a currency other than your home\ncurrency, and\nsuch changes in exchange rates may vary considerably during the life of those debt\nsecurities. Depreciation of the applicable specified currency for a series of debt\nsecurities against your home currency could result in a decrease in your home\ncurrency equivalent value of payments on such debt securities, including the\nprincipal or other amounts payable at maturity or the redemption amount payable\nupon those debt securities. That in turn could cause the market value such debt\nsecurities\nto fall.\n\nBank of America and/or BofA Finance will not adjust debt securities denominated or\npayable in a currency other than your home currency to compensate for changes in\nforeign currency exchange rates.\n\nExcept as described below or in the applicable\nsupplement, Bank of America and/or BofA Finance will not make any adjustment in or\nchange to the terms of debt securities denominated or payable in currencies other\nthan your home currency for changes in the foreign currency exchange rate for the\nrelevant specified currency for a series of debt securities, including any\ndevaluation, revaluation, or imposition of exchange or other regulatory controls\nor taxes, or for other developments affecting that currency or any other currency.\nConsequently, you will bear the risk that your investment may be affected\nadversely by these types of events.\n\nGovernment policy can adversely affect foreign currency exchange rates and an\ninvestment in debt securities denominated or payable in a currency other than your\nhome currency.\n\nForeign currency exchange rates either can float or be fixed by sovereign\ngovernments. Governments or governmental bodies, including the\nEuropean Central Bank, may intervene from time to time in their economies to alter\nthe exchange rate or exchange characteristics of their currencies. For example, a\ncentral bank may intervene to devalue or revalue a currency or to replace an\nexisting currency. In addition, a government may impose regulatory controls or\ntaxes to affect the exchange rate of its currency or may issue a new currency or\nreplace an existing currency. As a result, the amounts payable on and rate of\nreturn of\ndebt securities denominated or payable in a currency other than your home currency\ncould be affected significantly and unpredictably by governmental actions. Even in\nthe absence of governmental action directly affecting currency exchange rates,\npolitical or economic developments in the country or region issuing the specified\ncurrency for an applicable series of debt securities or elsewhere could result in\n\n14\n\nsignificant and sudden changes in the exchange rate between your home currency and\nthe specified currency. Changes in exchange rates could affect the value of debt\nsecurities denominated or\npayable in a currency other than your home currency as participants in the global\ncurrency markets move to buy or sell the specified currency or your home currency\nin reaction to these developments.\n\nIf a governmental authority imposes exchange controls or other conditions, such as\ntaxes on the exchange or transfer of the specified\ncurrency, there may be limited availability of the specified currency for payment\non debt securities denominated or payable in a currency other than your home\ncurrency at their maturity or on any other payment date. In addition, the ability\nof a\nholder to move currency freely out of the country in which payment in the currency\nis received or to convert the currency at a freely determined market rate could be\nlimited by governmental actions.\n\nDebt securities denominated or payable in currencies other than U.S. dollars\npermit Bank of America and/or BofA Finance to make payments in U.S. dollars if\nBank of America nor BofA Finance is able to obtain the specified currency.\n\nThe terms of any series of debt securities\ndenominated or payable in a currency other than U.S. dollars provide that Bank of\nAmerica and/or BofA Finance has the right to make a payment in U.S. dollars\ninstead of the specified currency, if at or about the time when the payment on\nsuch series\nof debt securities comes due, the specified currency is subject to convertibility,\ntransferability, market disruption, or other conditions affecting its availability\nbecause of circumstances beyond the control of Bank of America and/or BofA\nFinance.\nThese circumstances could include the imposition of exchange controls, inability\nof Bank of America and/or BofA Finance to obtain the specified currency because of\na disruption in the currency markets for the specified currency, or unavailability\nbecause the specified currency is no longer used by the government of the relevant\ncountry or for settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the\ninternational banking community. In addition, if the specified currency for a\nseries\nof debt securities has been replaced by a new currency, Bank of America and/or\nBofA Finance will have the option to choose whether it makes payments on such\nseries of debt securities in the replacement currency or in U.S. dollars. In\neither case,\nthe exchange rate used to make payment in U.S. dollars or the replacement\ncurrency, if any, may be based on limited information and would involve\nsignificant discretion on the part of the exchange rate agent, which may be an\naffiliate of Bank of\nAmerica and/or BofA Finance, to be appointed by Bank of America and/or BofA\nFinance. As a result, the value of the payment in the home currency of Bank of\nAmerica and BofA Finance may be less than the value of the payment you would have\nreceived in\nthe specified currency if the specified currency had been available. The exchange\nrate agent generally will not have any liability for its determinations.\n\nSee \u0093Description of Debt Securities of Bank of America Corporation\u0097Payment of\nPrincipal, Interest, and Other Amounts\nPayable\u0097Payments Due in Other Currencies\u0097Unavailability of Currencies and\nReplacement Currencies\u0094 and \u0093Description of Debt Securities of BofA Finance\nLLC\u0097Payment of Principal, Interest, and Other Amounts\nPayable\u0097Payments Due in Other Currencies\u0097Unavailability of Currencies and\nReplacement Currencies\u0094 below. Any payment in respect of the debt securities so\nmade in U.S. dollars where the required payment is in an unavailable specified\ncurrency will not constitute an event of default under the relevant indenture or\nthe debt securities. If your home currency is not U.S. dollars, any such payment\nwill expose you to the significant risks described above in this section\n\u0093\u0097Risks Relating to Debt Securities Denominated in a Currency Other Than an\nInvestor\u0092s Home Currency.\u0094\n\n15\n\nAn investor may bear currency exchange risk in a lawsuit for payment on debt\nsecurities denominated or payable in a currency other than U.S. dollars.\n\nAny debt securities issued under the BAC Senior Indenture or the BofA\nFinance Indenture (as defined below) will be governed by New York law. Under\nSection 27 of the New York Judiciary Law, a state court in the State of New York\nrendering a judgment on debt securities denominated or payable in a currency other\nthan U.S. dollars and governed by New York law would be required to render the\njudgment in such non-U.S. currency. In turn, the judgment would be converted into\nU.S. dollars at the exchange rate\nprevailing on the date of entry of the judgment. Consequently, in a lawsuit for\npayment on debt securities denominated or payable in a non-U.S. currency and\ngoverned by New York law, you would bear currency\nexchange risk until judgment is entered, which could be a long time.\n\nIn courts outside of New York, you may not be able to obtain\njudgment in a specified currency other than U.S. dollars. For example, a judgment\nfor money in an action based on debt securities denominated or payable in a\nnon-U.S. currency in many other U.S. federal or\nstate courts ordinarily would be enforced in the United States only in U.S.\ndollars. The date and method used to determine the rate of conversion of the\nspecified currency into U.S. dollars will depend on various factors, including\nwhich court\nrenders the judgment.\n\nInformation about foreign currency exchange rates may not be indicative of future\nperformance.\n\nIf Bank of America or BofA Finance issues debt securities denominated or payable\nin a currency other than your home currency, it may include\nin the applicable supplement information about historical exchange rates for the\nrelevant currency or currencies. Any information about exchange rates that Bank of\nAmerica or BofA Finance may provide will be furnished as a matter of information\nonly, and you should not regard the information as indicative of the range of, or\ntrends in, fluctuations in currency exchange rates that may occur in the future.\n\n16\n\nBANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION Bank of America Corporation is a Delaware corporation,\na bank holding company, and a financial holding company.

In addition, BofA Finance may use a\nportion of net proceeds from the sale of its debt securities to hedge its\nobligations under the debt securities by entering into hedging arrangements with\none or more affiliates. 17\n\nDESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES OF BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION\n\nIn this \u0093Description of Debt Securities of Bank of America Corporation\u0094 section,\n\u0093we,\u0094 \u0093us\u0094 or\n\u0093our\u0094 refer only to Bank of America Corporation and not to any of its affiliates,\nincluding BofA Finance LLC; and references to \u0093debt securities\u0094 refer only to\nsenior debt securities issued by Bank of America Corporation and not\nto any debt securities issued by any subsidiary or affiliate.\n\nGeneral\n\nWe may issue debt securities, and such debt securities will not be secured by any\nof our property or assets. As a result, by owning a debt\nsecurity, you are one of our unsecured creditors.\n\nThe debt securities will constitute part of our senior debt, will be issued under\nour\nBAC Senior Indenture described below, and will rank equally in right of payment\nwith all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt from time to time\noutstanding, except obligations that are subject to any priorities or preferences\nby law.\n\nThis section of the prospectus provides a summary of the material terms and\nprovisions of the BAC Senior Indenture (as defined below) and\ncertain specific terms of debt securities that may be applicable if so specified\nin the applicable supplement for such debt securities.\n\nFinancial Consequences to Unsecured Debtholders of Single Point of Entry\nResolution Strategy\n\nWe are subject to the TLAC Rules,\nwhich aim to improve the resiliency and resolvability of U.S. global systemically\nimportant bank holding companies (\u0093covered BHCs\u0094), including Bank of America, in\nthe event of failure or material financial distress. The TLAC Rules include\nthe requirement that each covered BHC maintain a minimum amount of eligible LTD\nand other loss- absorbing capacity. The eligible LTD would absorb the covered\nBHC\u0092s losses, following the depletion of its equity, upon its entry into a\nresolution\nproceeding under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or a resolution proceeding administered\nby the FDIC under Title II of the Financial Reform Act.\n\nUnder Title I of the Financial Reform Act, we are required by the Federal Reserve\nand the FDIC to periodically submit a plan for a rapid and\norderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of material\nfinancial distress or failure. Our preferred resolution strategy under this plan\nis our SPOE strategy under which only Bank of America would enter bankruptcy\nproceedings.\nUnder this strategy, and pursuant to existing intercompany arrangements under\nwhich we have transferred most of our assets to a wholly-owned holding company\nsubsidiary, which holds the equity interests in our key operating subsidiaries, we\nwould\ncontribute our remaining financial assets, less a holdback to cover our bankruptcy\nexpenses, to this wholly-owned holding company subsidiary prior to filing for\nbankruptcy. We would then file for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S.\nBankruptcy\nCode. Pursuant to an order from the bankruptcy court under section 363 of the\nBankruptcy Code, we, as debtor-in-possession, would transfer our subsidiaries to a\nnewly-formed entity (\u0093NewCo\u0094) that would be held in trust for the sole and\nexclusive benefit of our bankruptcy estate.\n\nUnder\nour SPOE resolution strategy, the obligations of Bank of America on its unsecured\ndebt, including the debt securities offered pursuant to this prospectus, would not\nbe assumed by NewCo; instead, the claims on such obligations would be left behind\nin\nthe bankruptcy proceeding. After the transferred subsidiaries were stabilized,\nNewCo\u0092s residual value in the form of shares or proceeds from the sale of shares\nwould be distributed to the holders of claims against the bankruptcy estate in\naccordance with the priority of their claims, including to holders of our debt\nsecurities.\n\n18\n\nIn 2013, the FDIC issued a notice describing its similar preferred SPOE\nrecapitalization model for resolving a global systemically important banking\ngroup, such as Bank of America, under Title II of the Financial Reform Act. Under\nTitle II, when a covered BHC is in default or danger of default, the FDIC may be\nappointed receiver in order to conduct an orderly liquidation of such institution\nas an alternative to resolution of the entity under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code if\nthe Secretary of the Treasury makes certain financial distress and systemic risk\ndeterminations. Pursuant to the single point of entry recapitalization model, the\nFDIC would use its power to create a \u0093bridge entity\u0094 for the covered BHC; transfer\nthe systemically important and viable parts of the covered BHC\u0092s business to the\nbridge entity; recapitalize those subsidiaries using assets of the covered BHC\nthat have been transferred to the bridge entity; and exchange external debt claims\nagainst the covered BHC, including claims of holders of our debt securities and\nother unsecured debt, for equity in the bridge entity. This strategy would allow\noperating subsidiaries of the covered BHC to continue to operate and impose losses\non stockholders and creditors of the covered BHC, which could include holders of\nour debt securities. The Indenture The debt securities are governed by a document\ncalled an indenture, which is a contract between us and the applicable trustee.\nThe debt securities will be issued under the Indenture for Senior Debt Securities\ndated as of June 27, 2018 (as supplemented from time to time, the \u0093BAC Senior\nIndenture\u0094) between us, as issuer, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company,\nN.A., as trustee. The trustee under the BAC Senior Indenture has two principal\nfunctions:\n                                                                                  \n      First, the trustee can enforce your rights against us if we default.        \n      However, there are limitations on the extent                                \n      to which the trustee may act on your behalf, which we describe below under  \n      \u0093\u0097Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.\u0094            \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      Second, the trustee performs administrative duties for us, including the    \n      delivery of interest and other payments                                     \n      and notices.                                                                \n                                                                                  \nThe BAC Senior Indenture does not limit the aggregate amount of debt securities\nthat we may issue or the number of series or the aggregate amount of any\nparticular series of debt securities. The BAC Senior Indenture and the debt\nsecurities also do not limit our ability to incur other indebtedness or to issue\nother securities. This means that we may issue additional debt securities and\nother securities at any time without your consent and without notifying you. In\naddition, the BAC Senior Indenture does not contain provisions protecting holders\nagainst a decline in our credit quality resulting from takeovers,\nrecapitalizations, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, or restructuring. If\nour credit quality declines as a result of an event of this type, or otherwise,\nany ratings of our debt securities then outstanding may be withdrawn or\ndowngraded. This section is a summary of the material terms and provisions of the\nBAC Senior Indenture. We have filed the BAC Senior Indenture with the SEC as an\nexhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. See\n\u0093Where You Can Find More Information\u0094 below for information on how to obtain a\ncopy of the BAC Senior Indenture. Whenever we refer to the defined terms of the\nBAC Senior Indenture in this section of this prospectus or in a supplement hereto\nwithout defining them, the terms have the meanings given to them in the BAC Senior\nIndenture. You must look to the BAC Senior Indenture for the most complete\ndescription of the information summarized in this prospectus. 19\n\nForm and Denomination of Debt Securities\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, we will issue each debt\nsecurity in book-entry only form. Debt securities in\nbook-entry only form will be represented by a global security registered in the\nname of a depository or its nominee. Accordingly, the depository or its nominee\nwill be the registered holder of all the debt securities represented by the global\nsecurity. Those who own beneficial interests in a global security will do so\nthrough participants in the depository\u0092s securities clearing system, and the\nrights of these indirect owners will be governed solely by the applicable\nprocedures of\nthe depository and its participants. We describe the procedures applicable to\nbook-entry only securities below under the heading \u0093Registration and Settlement.\u0094\n\nGenerally, all debt securities represented by the same global security will have\nthe same terms. We may, however, issue a global security that\nrepresents multiple debt securities that have different terms and are issued at\ndifferent times. We call this kind of global security a master global security.\nThe applicable supplement will indicate whether your debt securities will be\nrepresented\nby a master global security.\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, we will issue our debt\nsecurities in fully\nregistered form. If we issue a debt security in bearer form, we will describe the\nspecial considerations applicable to bearer securities in the applicable\nsupplement. Some of the features that we describe in this prospectus may not apply\nto bearer\nsecurities.\n\nOur debt securities may be denominated in U.S. dollars or in another currency as\nmay be specified in the applicable\nsupplement. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the debt\nsecurities will be denominated in U.S. dollars, and unless we specify otherwise in\nthe applicable supplement, the debt securities will be issued in minimum\ndenominations\nof $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess of $1,000.\n\nPayment for Non-U.S.Dollar-Denominated Debt Securities\n\nFor any debt securities denominated or payable in\na currency other than U.S. dollars (referred to as \u0093non-U.S. dollar-denominated\ndebt securities\u0094), the initial investors will be required to pay for the debt\nsecurities in that foreign currency. The\napplicable selling agent may arrange for the conversion of U.S. dollars into the\napplicable foreign currency to facilitate payment for the non-U.S. dollar-\ndenominated debt securities by U.S. purchasers\ndesiring to make the initial payment in U.S. dollars. Any such conversion will be\nmade by that selling agent on the terms and subject to the conditions,\nlimitations, and charges as it may establish from time to time in accordance with\nits regular\nforeign exchange procedures, and subject to U.S. laws and regulations. All costs\nof any such conversion for the initial purchase of the non-U.S. dollar-denominated\ndebt securities will be borne by the initial\ninvestors using those conversion arrangements. We describe some of those\ninvestment considerations relating to securities denominated or payable in a\ncurrency other than U.S. dollars above under the heading \u0093Risk Factors.\u0094\n\nDifferent Series of Debt Securities\n\nWe may issue our debt securities from time to time in one or more series with the\nsame or different maturities. We also may \u0093reopen\u0094\na series of our debt securities. This means that we can increase the principal\namount of a series of our debt securities by selling additional debt securities\nwith the same terms, provided that such additional debt securities shall be\nfungible for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes. We may do so without notice to the existing\nholders of debt securities of that series. However, any new debt securities of\nthis kind may have a different offering price and may begin to bear interest (if\nany) at a\ndifferent date.\n\n20\n\nThis section of the prospectus summarizes the material terms of the debt\nsecurities that are common to all series under the BAC Senior Indenture. We will\ndescribe the financial and other specific terms of the series of debt securities\nbeing offered in the applicable supplement. The applicable supplement also may\ndescribe any differences from the material terms described in this prospectus. If\nthere are any differences between the applicable supplement and this prospectus,\nthe applicable supplement will control. The terms of your series of debt\nsecurities as described in the applicable supplement may include the following:\n                                                  \n      the title and type of the debt securities;

or  \n                                                                            \n                                                                                  \n      any other terms of the debt securities that are permitted under the BAC     \n      Senior Indenture.                                                           \n                                                                                  \nTypes of Debt Securities We may issue the types of debt securities described in\nthis section, and we also may issue debt securities that do not bear interest\n(which we refer to as \u0093zero coupon notes\u0094). Fixed-Rate Notes We may issue debt\nsecurities that bear interest at one or more fixed rates of interest, as specified\nin the applicable supplement. We refer to these debt securities as \u0093fixed-rate\nnotes.\u0094 We also may issue fixed-rate notes that combine principal and interest\npayments in installment payments over the life of the notes which we refer to as\n\u0093amortizing notes.\u0094 We will make payments on fixed-rate notes as described below\nunder the heading \u0093\u0097Payment of Principal, Interest, and Other Amounts Payable\u0094 and\nin the applicable supplement. Floating Rate Notes We may issue debt securities\nthat will bear interest at a floating rate of interest determined by reference to\none or more interest rate bases, referred to as the \u0093base rate.\u0094 We refer to these\ndebt securities as \u0093floating rate notes.\u0094 The base rate for a series of floating\nrate notes will be specified in, and will be determined in accordance with the\nspecific formula and/or applicable terms and provisions set forth in, the\napplicable supplement. Fixed/Floating Rate Notes We may issue a debt security with\nelements of each of the fixed-rate and floating rate notes described above. For\nexample, a debt security may bear interest at a fixed rate for some interest\nperiods and at a floating rate in other interest periods. We refer to these debt\nsecurities as \u0093fixed/floating rate notes.\u0094 We will describe the determination of\ninterest or other amounts payable for any of these debt securities in the\napplicable supplement. Original Issue Discount Notes Any of the types of notes\ndescribed above may be an original issue discount note. Original issue discount\nnotes are debt securities that are issued at a price lower than their stated\nprincipal amount or lower than their minimum guaranteed repayment amount at\nmaturity. Original issue discount notes may be zero coupon notes or may bear\ninterest at a rate that is below market rates at the time of issuance. Amounts\npayable in the event of redemption, repayment or upon an acceleration of the\nmaturity of an original issue discount note will be determined in accordance with\nthe terms of that debt security, as described in the applicable supplement. That\namount normally is less than the amount payable at the maturity date. A debt\nsecurity issued at a discount to its principal may, for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, be considered an original issue discount 22\n\nnote, regardless of the amount payable upon redemption or acceleration of\nmaturity. See \u0093U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\u0097Taxation of Debt Securities\u0094\nbelow for a summary of\nthe U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning an original issue discount\nnote.\n\nPayment of Principal, Interest, and Other Amounts Payable\n\nPaying Agents\n\nWe may appoint one or more financial institutions to act as our paying agents.\nInitially, under the BAC Senior Indenture we have appointed The\nBank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. to act as our paying agent with\nrespect to the debt securities through its corporate trust office currently\nlocated at 4655 Salisbury Road, Suite 300, Jacksonville, Florida 32256. We may\nadd, replace or\nterminate any paying agent from time to time in accordance with the BAC Senior\nIndenture, in each case without your consent and without notifying you of such\nchange. In addition, we may decide to act as our own paying agent with respect to\nsome or\nall of the debt securities, and the paying agent may resign, in each case without\nyour consent and without notifying you of such event.\n\nPayments to Holders and Record Dates for Interest\n\nWe refer to each date on which interest is payable on a debt security as an\n\u0093interest payment date.\u0094 Subject to any applicable\nbusiness day convention set forth in the applicable supplement, interest payments\non the debt securities will be made on each interest payment date applicable to,\nand at the maturity date, or earlier redemption date, of, the applicable debt\nsecurities. Interest payable on any interest payment date other than the maturity\ndate, or earlier redemption date, will be paid to the registered holder of the\ndebt security at the close of business on the regular record date for that\ninterest\npayment date. However, unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement,\nthe initial interest payment on a debt security issued between a regular record\ndate and the interest payment date immediately following the regular record date\nwill be\nmade on the second interest payment date following the original issue date to the\nholder of record on the regular record date preceding the second interest payment\ndate. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the principal and\ninterest payable at maturity, or earlier redemption, will be paid to the holder of\nthe debt security at the time of payment by the paying agent.\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the record date for any\ninterest payment for a debt security in book-entry only form\nwill be the date that is one business day prior to the payment date, unless such\ndebt security is a non-U.S. dollar denominated debt security held through DTC, in\nwhich case the record date for an interest\npayment date will be the fifteenth calendar day prior to such interest payment\ndate, whether or not such record date is a business day. If the debt security is\nin a form that is other than book-entry only, and unless we specify otherwise in\nthe\napplicable supplement, the regular record date for an interest payment date will\nbe the fifteenth calendar day prior to such interest payment date, whether or not\nsuch record date is a business day.\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the term \u0093business day\u0094\nmeans any weekday that is not a legal holiday in\nNew York, New York, Charlotte, North Carolina, or any other place of payment of\nthe applicable debt security, and is not a date on which banking institutions in\nthose cities are authorized or required by law or regulation to be closed.\n\nPayments Due in U.S. Dollars\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, our debt securities will\nbe denominated, and payments with respect to the debt\nsecurities will be made, in U.S. dollars. Unless\n\n23\n\nwe specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, we will follow the practices\ndescribed in this section when we pay amounts that are due in U.S. dollars.\n\nWe will make payments on debt securities in book-entry only form in accordance\nwith arrangements then in place between the paying agent and\nthe depository or its nominee, as holder.\n\nAn indirect owner\u0092s right to receive those payments will be governed by the rules\nand\npractices of the depository and its participants, as described below under the\nheading \u0093Registration and Settlement.\u0094\n\nIndirect owners should contact their banks or brokers for information on how they\nwill receive payments on their debt securities.\n\nWe will pay any interest on debt securities in definitive form on each interest\npayment date other than the maturity date, or earlier\nredemption date, by, in our discretion, wire transfer of immediately available\nfunds or check mailed to holders of the debt securities on the applicable record\ndate at the address appearing on our or the security registrar\u0092s records. We will\npay principal and any premium, interest, or other amounts payable at the maturity\ndate, or earlier redemption date, of a debt security in definitive form by wire\ntransfer of immediately available funds to the registered holders of the debt\nsecurity\nat the time of payment.\n\nPayments Due in Other Currencies\n\nGeneral\n\nIf any\nof the debt securities are denominated, or if principal and any premium, interest,\nor other amounts payable on any of the debt securities is payable, in a foreign\ncurrency, the specified currency, as well as any additional investment\nconsiderations,\nrisk factors, restrictions, tax consequences, specific terms and other information\nrelating to that series of debt securities and the specified currency will be\ndescribed in the applicable supplement.\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, we will follow the\npractices described in this section when we pay amounts that are\ndue on non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt securities. Unless we specify otherwise in\nthe applicable supplement, and except as described below, holders of non-U.S.\ndollar-denominated debt securities are not entitled to receive payments in U.S.\ndollars of an amount due in another currency, either on a global debt security or\na debt security in definitive form.\n\nWe will make payments on non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt securities in book-entry\nonly form in the\napplicable specified currency in accordance with arrangements then in place\nbetween the paying agent and the depository or its nominee, as holder. An indirect\nowner\u0092s right to receive those payments will be governed by the rules and\npractices\nof the depository and its participants, as described below under the heading\n\u0093Registration and Settlement.\u0094\n\nNon-U.S.Dollar-Denominated Debt Securities Held Through DTC\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the\napplicable supplement, holders of beneficial interests in non-U.S. dollar-\ndenominated debt securities through a participant in The Depository Trust Company,\nor \u0093DTC,\u0094 will receive payments in U.S.\ndollars, unless they elect to receive payments on those debt securities in the\napplicable foreign currency. If a holder of such beneficial interests through DTC\ndoes not make an election through its DTC participant to receive payments in the\n\n24\n\napplicable foreign currency, the exchange rate agent for the relevant non-U.S.\ndollar-denominated debt securities to be appointed by us will convert\npayments to that holder into U.S. dollars, and all costs of those conversions will\nbe borne by that holder by deduction from the applicable payments.\n\nThe holder of a beneficial interest in global non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt\nsecurities held through\na DTC participant may elect to receive payments on those debt securities in the\nforeign currency by notifying the DTC participant through which it holds its\nbeneficial interests on or prior to the fifteenth business day prior to the record\ndate for\nthe applicable debt securities of (1) that holder\u0092s election to receive all or a\nportion of the payment in the applicable foreign currency and (2) wire transfer\ninstructions to an account for the applicable foreign currency outside\nthe United States. DTC must be notified of the election and wire transfer\ninstructions (a) on or prior to the fifth business day after the record date for\nany payment of interest and (b) on or prior to the tenth business day prior to the\ndate for any payment of principal. DTC will notify the trustee or other applicable\npaying agent of the election and wire transfer instructions (1) on or prior to the\nfifth business day after the record date for any payment of interest and\n(2) on or prior to the tenth business day prior to the date for any payment of\nprincipal. If complete instructions are forwarded to and received by DTC through a\nDTC participant and forwarded by DTC to the trustee or other applicable paying\nagent and received on or prior to the dates described above, the holder will\nreceive payment in the applicable foreign currency outside DTC; otherwise, only\nU.S. dollar payments will be made by the trustee or other applicable paying agent\nto DTC.\n\nFor holders of non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt securities held through a DTC\nparticipant not\nelecting payment in the applicable foreign currency, the U.S. dollar amount of any\npayment will be the amount of the applicable foreign currency otherwise payable,\nconverted into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate prevailing as of 11:00\na.m. (New York City time) on the second business day prior to the relevant payment\ndate, less any costs incurred by the exchange rate agent for that conversion\nunless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement. The costs of those\nconversions\nwill be shared pro rata among the holders of beneficial interests in the\napplicable global debt securities receiving U.S. dollar payments in the proportion\nof their respective holdings. The exchange rate agent, to be appointed by us at\nthe time of\nissuance for such non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt securities held through a DTC\nparticipant, will make those conversions in accordance with prevailing market\npractice and the terms of the applicable debt\nsecurity and with any applicable arrangements between us and the exchange rate\nagent.\n\nIf an exchange rate quotation is unavailable from\nthe entity or source ordinarily used by the exchange rate agent in the normal\ncourse of business, the exchange rate agent will obtain a quotation from a leading\nforeign exchange bank in New York City, which may be an affiliate of the exchange\nrate\nagent or another entity selected by the exchange rate agent for that purpose after\nconsultation with us. If no quotation from a leading foreign exchange bank is\navailable, payment will be made in the applicable foreign currency to the account\nor\naccounts specified by DTC to the trustee or other applicable paying agent, unless\nthe applicable foreign currency is unavailable due to the imposition of exchange\ncontrols or other circumstances beyond our control.\n\nUnavailability of Currencies and Replacement Currencies\n\nIf, at or about the time of payment of any principal, premium or interest on a\nnon-U.S. dollar-\ndenominated debt security, the relevant specified currency is not legal tender for\nthe payment of public and private debts in the country issuing the currency as of\nthe original issue date of such debt security or is otherwise unavailable, and the\nrelevant specified currency has been replaced by another currency that has become\nlegal tender for the payment of public and private debts in such country (a\n\u0093replacement currency\u0094), any amount payable pursuant to such debt security may be\npaid, at our option, in the replacement currency or in U.S. dollars, at a rate of\nexchange which\n\n25\n\ntakes into account the conversion, at the rate prevailing on the most recent date\non which official conversion rates were quoted or set by the national government\nor other authority responsible for issuing the replacement currency, from the\nspecified currency to the replacement currency or to U.S. dollars, if applicable,\nand, if necessary, the conversion of the replacement currency into U.S. dollars at\nthe rate prevailing on the date of such conversion. In this circumstance, we will\nappoint a financial institution to act as exchange rate agent for purposes of\nmaking the required conversions in accordance with prevailing market practice and\nthe terms of the applicable debt security and with any applicable arrangements\nbetween us and the exchange rate agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the\nrelevant specified currency may not be available to us for making payments of\nprincipal of or any premium, interest or other amounts payable on any\nnon-U.S.dollar-denominated debt securities. This could occur due to the imposition\nof exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control, or if the\nspecified currency is no longer used by the government of the country issuing that\ncurrency or by public institutions within the international banking community for\nthe settlement of transactions. If the specified currency is unavailable and has\nnot been replaced, and unless otherwise specified in the applicable supplement, we\nmay satisfy our obligations to holders of the relevant non-U.S.dollar-denominated\ndebt securities by making those payments due in the relevant specified currency on\nthe date of payment in U.S. dollars. The amount of such payments made in U.S.\ndollars will be determined by an exchange rate agent to be appointed by us on the\nbasis of the noon dollar buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers\nof the specified currency or currencies in which a payment on any such\nnon-U.S.dollar-denominated debt securities was to be made, published by the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York, which is referred to as the \u0093market exchange\nrate,\u0094 or such other rate as may be set forth in the applicable supplement. If\nthat rate of exchange is not then available or is not published for a particular\npayment currency, the market exchange rate will be based on the highest bid\nquotation in The City of New York received by the exchange rate agent at\napproximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second business day preceding\nthe applicable payment date from three recognized foreign exchange dealers for the\npurchase by the quoting dealer:\n                                                                                  \n      of the specified currency for U.S. dollars for settlement on the payment    \n      date;                                                                       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      in the aggregate amount of the specified currency payable to those holders  \n      or beneficial owners of non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt securities; and    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                     \n      at which the applicable dealer commits to execute a contract.  \n                                                                     \nOne of the dealers providing quotations may be the exchange rate agent unless the\nexchange rate agent is our affiliate. If those bid quotations are not available,\nthe exchange rate agent will determine the market exchange rate at its sole\ndiscretion in accordance with prevailing market practice and the terms of the\napplicable debt security and with any applicable arrangements between us and the\nexchange rate agent. The above provisions do not apply if a specified currency is\nunavailable because it has been replaced by the euro. If the euro has been\nsubstituted for a specified currency of the relevant non-U.S.dollar-denominated\ndebt security, we may, at our option, or will, if required by applicable law,\nwithout the consent of the holders of the affected debt securities, pay the\nprincipal of and any premium, interest or other amounts payable on any\nnon-U.S.dollar-denominated debt securities in euro instead of the specified\ncurrency, in conformity with legally applicable measures taken pursuant to, or by\nvirtue of, the Treaty establishing the European Community, as amended. Any payment\nmade in U.S. dollars, an applicable replacement currency, or in euro as described\nabove where the required payment is in an unavailable specified currency will not\nconstitute an event of default under the BAC Senior Indenture or the applicable\ndebt securities. 26\n\nThe exchange rate agent to be appointed by us may be one of our affiliates, and,\nfrom time\nto time after the initial appointment of an exchange rate agent, we may appoint\none or more different exchange rate agents for the relevant non-U.S. dollar-\ndenominated debt security without your consent and\nwithout notifying you of the change. The exchange rate agent will determine the\napplicable rate of exchange that would apply to a payment made in U.S. dollars or\na replacement currency in its sole discretion unless we state in the applicable\nsupplement that any determination requires our approval. Absent manifest error,\nthose determinations will be final and binding on you and us.\n\nFor purposes of the above discussion about currency conversions and payments on\nnon-U.S.\ndollar-denominated debt securities, unless otherwise specified in the applicable\nsupplement, the term \u0093business day\u0094 means any weekday that is not a legal holiday\nin New York, New York or Charlotte, North Carolina and is not a day on which\nbanking institutions in those cities are authorized or required by law or\nregulation to be closed.\n\nIndirect owners of a debt security with a specified currency other than U.S.\ndollars should contact their banks or brokers for information about how to receive\npayments in the specified currency or in U.S. dollars.\n\nNon-U.S.Dollar-Denominated Securities in Definitive Form\n\nWe will pay any interest on non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt securities in\ndefinitive form on each\ninterest payment date other than the maturity date, or earlier redemption date,\nby, in our discretion, wire transfer of immediately available funds or check\nmailed to holders of the debt securities on the applicable record date at the\naddress\nappearing on our or the security registrar\u0092s records. Unless we specify otherwise\nin the applicable supplement, we will pay principal and any premium, interest, or\nother amounts payable at the maturity date, or earlier redemption date, of a\nnon-U.S. dollar-denominated debt security in definitive form by wire transfer of\nimmediately available funds to the registered holders of the debt security at the\ntime of payment.\n\nNo Sinking Fund\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, our debt securities will\nnot be entitled to the benefit of any sinking fund. This\nmeans that we will not deposit money on a regular basis into any separate\ncustodial account to repay the debt securities.\n\nRedemption\n\nThe applicable supplement will indicate whether we may redeem the debt securities\nprior to their stated maturity. If we may redeem the debt\nsecurities prior to their stated maturity, the applicable supplement will indicate\nthe redemption price, the method for redemption, and the date or dates upon which\nwe may redeem the debt securities. Debt securities to be redeemed in part may only\nbe redeemed in increments of their minimum denomination. The redemption of any\ndebt security that is our eligible LTD will require the prior approval of the\nFederal Reserve if after such redemption we would fail to satisfy our requirements\nas to\neligible LTD or total loss-absorbing capacity under the TLAC Rules.\n\nNotice of Redemption\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, we may exercise our\nright to redeem debt securities by giving notice to the holders\nunder the BAC Senior Indenture at least 5 business\n\n27\n\ndays but not more than 60 calendar days before the specified redemption date. The\nnotice will specify:\n                                      \n      the date fixed for redemption;  \n                                      \n                                                                                  \n      the redemption price (or, if not then ascertainable, the manner of          \n      calculation thereof);                                                       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      the CUSIP number and any other identifying number of the debt securities    \n      to be redeemed;                                                             \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      the amount to be redeemed, if less than all of the outstanding debt         \n      securities of a series are to be redeemed;                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                    \n      the place of payment for the debt securities to be redeemed;  \n                                                                    \n                                                                                  \n      that interest (if any) accrued on the debt securities to be redeemed will   \n      be paid as specified in the notice; and                                     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      that, subject to satisfaction of any conditions to such redemption set      \n      forth in the notice of redemption and                                       \n      unless we default in payment of the redemption price, on and after the      \n      date fixed for redemption, interest (if any) will cease to accrue on the    \n      debt securities to be redeemed.                                             \n                                                                                  \nSuch redemption may be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions\nprecedent, in which case the notice of redemption will describe each condition\nand, if applicable, state that the redemption date may, in our discretion, be\ndelayed until such time as any or all conditions have been satisfied, or such\nredemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or\nall of the conditions have not been satisfied by the redemption date stated in the\nnotice of redemption, or by the redemption date as it may be delayed in our\ndiscretion. If notice of redemption has been given in accordance with the BAC\nSenior Indenture, the debt securities being redeemed shall, subject to the\nsatisfaction of any conditions to the redemption as specified in the notice of\nredemption, become due and payable on the date fixed for redemption. So long as a\ndepository is the record holder of the applicable debt securities to be redeemed,\nwe, or the trustee on our behalf if we so request, will deliver any notice of our\nelection to exercise our redemption right only to that depository. Repayment The\napplicable supplement will indicate whether the debt securities can be repaid at\nthe holder\u0092s option prior to their stated maturity. If the debt securities may be\nrepaid prior to their stated maturity, the applicable supplement will indicate the\napplicable repayment price or prices, the procedures for repayment and the date or\ndates on or after which the holder can request repayment. Repurchase We may\npurchase at any time and from time to time, including through a subsidiary or\naffiliate of ours, outstanding debt securities by tender, in the open market, or\nby private agreement. The repurchase of any debt security that is our eligible LTD\nwill require the prior approval of the Federal Reserve if after such repurchase we\nwould fail to satisfy our requirements as to eligible LTD or total loss-absorbing\ncapacity under the TLAC Rules. We, or our affiliates, have the discretion to hold\nor resell any repurchased debt securities. We also have the discretion to cancel\nany repurchased debt securities. 28\n\nExchange, Registration, and Transfer Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable\nsupplement, we will issue each debt security in global, or book-entry only, form.\nDebt securities in global form may be exchanged for debt securities in definitive\nform only in the limited circumstances described in the relevant debt securities\nor in the BAC Senior Indenture. Debt securities represented by a master note may\nbe exchanged by us at any time upon our request to the trustee for one or more\nother debt securities in global form, as described in the relevant debt\nsecurities. Subject to the terms of the BAC Senior Indenture, debt securities of\nany series in definitive form may be exchanged at the option of the holder for\nother debt securities of the same series and of an equal aggregate principal\namount and type in any authorized denominations. Debt securities in definitive\nform may be presented for registration of transfer at the office of the security\nregistrar or at the office of any transfer agent that we designate and maintain.\nThe security registrar or the transfer agent will make the registration of\ntransfer only if it is satisfied with the documents of title and identity of the\nperson making the request. There will not be a service charge for any exchange or\nregistration of transfer of debt securities, but we may require payment of a sum\nsufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in\nconnection with the exchange or transfer. Unless we specify otherwise in the\napplicable supplement, initially, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A.\nwill be the authenticating agent, security registrar and transfer agent for the\ndebt securities issued under the BAC Senior Indenture. We may change the security\nregistrar or the transfer agent or approve a change in the location through which\nany security registrar or transfer agent acts at any time, in each case without\nyour consent and without notifying you of such event. We will be required to\nmaintain a security registrar and transfer agent in each place of payment for each\nseries of debt securities. At any time, we may designate additional transfer\nagents for any series of debt securities. We will not be required to (1) issue,\nexchange, or register the transfer of any debt security of any series to be\nredeemed for a period of 15 days before the date on which we deliver the notice of\nredemption, or (2) exchange or register the transfer of any debt security (i) that\nwas selected, called, or is being called for redemption, except the unredeemed\nportion of any debt security being redeemed in part or (ii) as to which the holder\nhas exercised any right to require us to repay such debt security, except the\nportion to remain outstanding of any debt security being repaid in part. For a\ndiscussion of restrictions on the exchange, registration, and transfer of book-\nentry only securities, see \u0093Registration and Settlement\u0094 below. Sale or Issuance\nof Capital Stock of Principal Subsidiary Bank The BAC Senior Indenture prohibits\nthe issuance, sale, or other disposition of capital stock, or securities\nconvertible into or options, warrants, or rights to acquire capital stock, of any\nPrincipal Subsidiary Bank (as defined below) or of any subsidiary which owns\nshares of capital stock, or securities convertible into or options, warrants, or\nrights to acquire capital stock, of any Principal Subsidiary Bank, with the\nfollowing exceptions:\n                                                                   \n      sales or other dispositions of directors\u0092 qualifying shares;  \n                                                                   \n                                                                                  \n      sales or other dispositions for fair market value, if, after giving effect  \n      to the disposition and to conversion                                        \n      of any shares or securities convertible into capital stock of a Principal   \n      Subsidiary Bank, we would own at least 80% of each class of the capital     \n      stock of that Principal Subsidiary Bank;                                    \n                                                                                  \n29\n                                                                                  \n      sales or other dispositions made in compliance with an order of a court or  \n      regulatory authority of competent                                           \n      jurisdiction;                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      any sale by a Principal Subsidiary Bank of additional shares of its         \n      capital stock, securities convertible into                                  \n      shares of its capital stock, or options, warrants, or rights to subscribe   \n      for or purchase shares of its capital stock, to its stockholders at any     \n      price, so long as before that sale we owned, directly or indirectly,        \n      securities of the same class and                                            \n      immediately after the sale, we owned, directly or indirectly, at least as   \n      great a percentage of each class of securities of the Principal Subsidiary  \n      Bank as we owned before the sale of additional securities; and              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      any issuance of shares of capital stock, or securities convertible into or  \n      options, warrants, or rights to                                             \n      subscribe for or purchase shares of capital stock, of a Principal           \n      Subsidiary Bank or any subsidiary which owns shares of capital stock, or    \n      securities convertible into or options, warrants, or rights to acquire      \n      capital stock, of any Principal                                             \n      Subsidiary Bank, to us or our wholly owned subsidiary.                      \n                                                                                  \nA \u0093Principal Subsidiary Bank\u0094 is defined in the BAC Senior Indenture as any\nsubsidiary bank with total assets equal to more than 10% of our total consolidated\nassets. As of the date of this prospectus, Bank of America, N.A. is our only\nPrincipal Subsidiary Bank. Limitation on Mergers and Sales of Assets The BAC\nSenior Indenture generally permits a consolidation or merger between us and\nanother entity, subject to certain requirements. It also permits the sale,\nconveyance or transfer by us of all or substantially all of our assets, subject to\ncertain requirements. These transactions are permitted if:\n                                                                                  \n      the resulting or acquiring entity, if other than us, is organized and       \n      existing under the laws of the United                                       \n      States, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia and      \n      expressly assumes all of our obligations under the BAC Senior Indenture;    \n      and                                                                         \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      immediately after the transaction, we (or any successor entity) are not in  \n      default in the performance of any                                           \n      covenant or condition under the BAC Senior Indenture.                       \n                                                                                  \nThe foregoing requirements do not apply in the case of a sale, conveyance or\ntransfer by us of all or substantially all of our assets to one or more entities\nthat are direct or indirect subsidiaries in which we and/or one or more of our\nsubsidiaries own more than 50% of the combined voting power. Upon any\nconsolidation, merger, sale, conveyance or transfer of this kind (other than,\nwhere permitted as described above, a sale, conveyance or transfer of all or\nsubstantially all of our assets to our direct or indirect subsidiary or\nsubsidiaries in which we own more than 50% of the combined voting power as\ndescribed in the preceding paragraph), the resulting or acquiring entity will be\nsubstituted for us in the BAC Senior Indenture with the same effect as if it had\nbeen an original party to the BAC Senior Indenture. As a result, the successor\nentity may exercise our rights and powers under the BAC Senior Indenture. Waiver\nof Covenants The holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities\nof all affected series then outstanding under the BAC Senior Indenture may waive\ncompliance with some of the covenants or conditions of the BAC Senior Indenture.\n30\n\nModification of the Indenture We and the trustee may modify the BAC Senior\nIndenture and the rights of the holders of the debt securities with the consent of\nthe holders of not less than a majority of the aggregate principal amount of all\nseries of outstanding debt securities under the BAC Senior Indenture affected by\nthe modification. No modification may extend the fixed maturity of, reduce the\nprincipal amount or redemption premium of, or reduce the rate of interest, or\nextend the time of payment of interest or other amounts due, on any debt security\nwithout the consent of each holder affected by the modification. No modification\nmay reduce the percentage of debt securities that is required to consent to\nmodification of the BAC Senior Indenture without the consent of all holders of the\ndebt securities outstanding under the BAC Senior Indenture. In addition, we and\nthe trustee may execute supplemental indentures in some circumstances without the\nconsent of any holders of outstanding debt securities. For purposes of determining\nthe aggregate principal amount of the debt securities outstanding at any time in\nconnection with any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, or\nwaiver under the BAC Senior Indenture, (1) the principal amount of any debt\nsecurity issued with original issue discount is that amount of principal that\nwould be due and payable at that time upon a declaration of acceleration of the\nmaturity of the original issue discount note, and (2) the principal amount of a\ndebt security denominated in a foreign currency or currency unit is the U.S.\ndollar equivalent on the date of original issuance of the debt security,\ndetermined as specified in the applicable supplement for that debt security.\nMeetings and Action by Securityholders The trustee may call a meeting in its\ndiscretion, or upon request by us or the holders of at least 10% in principal\namount of a series of outstanding debt securities, by giving notice. If a meeting\nof holders is duly held, any resolution raised or decision taken in accordance\nwith the BAC Senior Indenture will be binding on all holders of debt securities of\nthat series. Events of Default and Rights of Acceleration; Covenant Breaches The\nBAC Senior Indenture defines an event of default for a series of debt securities\nas any one of the following events:\n                                                                                  \n      our failure to pay principal of or any premium on any debt securities of    \n      that series when due and payable, and                                       \n      continuance of such default for a period of 30 days;                        \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      our failure to pay interest on any debt securities of that series when due  \n      and payable, and continuance of such                                        \n      default for a period of 30 days;                                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      specified events involving our bankruptcy, insolvency, or liquidation; and  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      any other events of default specified for a series of debt securities       \n      pursuant to the BAC Senior Indenture.                                       \n                                                                                  \nAny additional or different events of default for a series of debt securities will\nbe specified in the applicable supplement. 31\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable supplement, if an event of default\nunder the\nBAC Senior Indenture occurs and is continuing, either the trustee or the holders\nof 25% in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities outstanding under the\nBAC Senior Indenture (or, in the case of an event of default with respect to a\nseries\nof debt securities under the BAC Senior Indenture, the holders of 25% in aggregate\nprincipal amount of the outstanding debt securities of all series affected) may\ndeclare the principal amount, or, if the debt securities are issued with original\nissue discount, such amount as described in the applicable supplement, of all debt\nsecurities (or the outstanding debt securities of all series affected, as the case\nmay be) to be due and payable immediately. The holders of a majority in aggregate\nprincipal amount of the debt securities then outstanding (or of all series\naffected, as the case may be), in some circumstances, may annul the declaration of\nacceleration and waive past defaults.\n\nWith respect to a failure on our part to observe or perform any of the covenants\nor agreements contained in the debt securities or in the BAC\nSenior Indenture (other than those for which acceleration rights are available as\ndiscussed above), which failure continues for a period of 90 days after the date\non which written notice of such failure is given (a \u0093covenant breach\u0094), the\ntrustee and the holders of the debt securities may pursue certain remedies as\ndescribed below or as set forth in the BAC Senior Indenture.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable supplement, an event of default will\nnot occur under our debt securities, and neither the trustee\nnor the holders of any debt securities will have the right to accelerate the\npayment of principal of such debt securities, as a result of a covenant breach. In\naddition, an event of default will not occur, and neither the trustee nor the\nholders of\nsuch debt securities will have the right to accelerate the payment of principal of\nsuch debt securities, as a result of our failure to pay principal of or premium on\nsuch debt securities when due and payable until such default has continued for a\nperiod of 30 days.\n\nWe are required periodically to file with the trustee a certificate stating that\nwe are not in default under any of\nthe terms of the BAC Senior Indenture.\n\nCollection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee\n\nIf (i) we fail to pay the principal of or any premium on any debt securities, or\n(ii) we are over 30 calendar days late on an\ninterest payment on the debt securities, the trustee can demand that we pay to it,\nfor the benefit of the holders of those debt securities, the amount which is due\nand payable on those debt securities, including any interest incurred because of\nour\nfailure to make that payment. If we fail to pay such required amount on demand,\nthe trustee may take appropriate action, including instituting judicial\nproceedings against us.\n\nIn addition, a holder of our debt securities also may file suit to enforce our\nobligation to make payment of principal and any premium,\ninterest, or other amounts payable on such debt securities regardless of the\nactions taken by the trustee.\n\nThe holders of a majority in\nprincipal amount of each series of the affected debt securities then outstanding\nunder the BAC Senior Indenture may direct the time, method, and place of\nconducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee under the BAC\nSenior\nIndenture. The trustee may decline to act if the direction is contrary to law and\nin certain other circumstances set forth in the BAC Senior Indenture. The trustee\nis not obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers under the BAC Senior\nIndenture at the request or direction of the holders of the debt securities unless\nthe holders offer the trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the\ntrustee against costs, expenses and liabilities.\n\n32\n\nLimitation on Suits The BAC Senior Indenture provides that no individual holder of\ndebt securities of any series may institute any action against us under the BAC\nSenior Indenture, except actions for payment of overdue principal and interest,\nunless the following actions have occurred:\n                                                                                  \n      the holder must have previously given written notice to the trustee of a    \n      continuing event of default or covenant                                     \n      breach;                                                                     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of such outstanding    \n      debt securities issued under the BAC                                        \n      Senior Indenture must have (1)\u00a0requested the trustee to institute           \n      proceedings in respect of such event of default or covenant breach and (2)  \n      offered the trustee indemnity against liabilities incurred by the trustee   \n      for taking such action,                                                     \n      which indemnity is reasonably satisfactory to the trustee;                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      the trustee must have failed to institute proceedings within 60 days after  \n      receipt of the request referred to                                          \n      above; and                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      the holders of a majority in principal amount of such outstanding debt      \n      securities issued under the BAC Senior                                      \n      Indenture must not have given direction to the trustee inconsistent with    \n      the request of the holders referred to above.                               \n                                                                                  \nHowever, the holder of any debt securities will have an absolute right to receive\npayment of principal of and any premium and interest on the senior debt security\nwhen due and to institute suit to enforce this payment. Payment of Additional\nAmounts If we so specify in the applicable supplement, and subject to the\nexceptions and limitations set forth below, we will pay to the holder of any debt\nsecurity that is a \u0093non-U.S.person\u0094 additional amounts to ensure that every net\npayment on that debt security will not be less, due to the payment of U.S.\nwithholding tax, than the amount then otherwise due and payable. For this purpose,\na \u0093net payment\u0094 on a debt security means a payment by us or any paying agent,\nincluding payment of principal and interest, after deduction for any present or\nfuture tax, assessment, or other governmental charge of the United States (other\nthan a territory or possession). These additional amounts will constitute\nadditional interest on the debt security. For this purpose, U.S. withholding tax\nmeans a withholding tax of the United States, other than a territory or\npossession. However, notwithstanding our obligation, if so specified, to pay\nadditional amounts, we will not be required to pay additional amounts in any of\nthe circumstances described in items (1) through (15) below, unless we specify\notherwise in the applicable supplement.\n                                                                                  \n       Additional amounts will not be payable if a payment on a debt security is  \n  (1)  reduced as a result of any tax,                                            \n       assessment, or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld       \n       solely by reason of the beneficial owner of the debt security:             \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      having a relationship with the United States as a citizen, resident, or     \n      otherwise;

For\npurposes of determining whether the payment of additional amounts is required, the\nterm \u0093U.S. person\u0094 means any individual who is a citizen or resident of the United\nStates; any corporation, partnership, or other entity created or organized in or\nunder the laws of the United States; any estate if the income of such estate falls\nwithin the federal income tax jurisdiction of the United States regardless of the\nsource of that income; and any trust if a U.S. court is able to exercise primary\nsupervision over its administration and one or more U.S. persons have the\nauthority to control all of the substantial decisions of the trust. Additionally,\nfor this purpose, \u0093non-U.S.person\u0094 means a person who is not a U.S. person, and\n\u0093United States\u0094 means the United States of America, including each state of the\nUnited States and the District of Columbia, its territories, its possessions, and\nother areas within its jurisdiction. Redemption for Tax Reasons If we so specify\nin the applicable supplement, we may redeem the debt securities in whole, but not\nin part, at any time before maturity, if we have or will become obligated to pay\nadditional amounts, as described above under \u0093\u0097Payment of Additional Amounts,\u0094 as\na result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws or regulations of the United\nStates or any political subdivision or any authority of the United States having\npower to tax, or any change in the application or official interpretation of such\nlaws or regulations, which change or amendment becomes effective on or after the\ndate of the applicable supplement for the issuance of those debt securities. If we\nexercise such right to redeem the debt securities, unless we specify otherwise in\nthe applicable supplement, we will give not less than 5 business days\u0092 nor more\nthan 60 calendar days\u0092 notice to the trustee under the BAC Senior Indenture and to\nthe holders of the debt securities. 36\n\nIn connection with any notice of redemption for tax reasons, we will deliver to\nthe trustee under the BAC Senior Indenture any required certificate, request, or\norder. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, any debt\nsecurities redeemed for tax reasons will be redeemed at a redemption price equal\nto 100% of the principal amount of such debt securities, plus accrued and unpaid\ninterest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption.\nDefeasance and Covenant Defeasance If we so specify in the applicable supplement,\nthe provisions for full defeasance and covenant defeasance described below will\napply to the debt securities of a series if certain conditions are satisfied. Full\nDefeasance If there is a change in the U.S. federal income tax law, as described\nbelow, we can legally release ourselves from all payment and other obligations on\nthe debt securities of a series. This is called full defeasance. For us to do so,\namong other conditions set forth in the BAC Senior Indenture, each of the\nfollowing must occur:\n                                                                                  \n      We must deposit in trust with the trustee for the benefit of the holders    \n      of those debt securities a combination                                      \n      of money and U.S. government or U.S. government agency notes or bonds       \n      that, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public  \n      accountants, will generate enough cash to make interest, principal, and     \n      any other payments on those debt                                            \n      securities when due;                                                        \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      There must be a change in current U.S. federal income tax law or an         \n      Internal Revenue Service ruling that lets us                                \n      make the above deposit without causing the beneficial owners to be taxed    \n      on those debt securities any differently than if we did not make the        \n      deposit and repaid those debt securities ourselves. Under current U.S.      \n      federal income tax law, the deposit,                                        \n      and our legal release from your debt security, would be treated as though   \n      we took back your debt security and gave you your share of the cash and     \n      notes or bonds deposited in trust. In that event, you could recognize gain  \n      or loss on your debt                                                        \n      security; and                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      We must deliver to the trustee under the BAC Senior Indenture a legal       \n      opinion of our counsel confirming the tax                                   \n      law treatment described above.                                              \n                                                                                  \nIf we ever fully defeased your debt security, you would have to rely solely on the\ntrust deposit for payments on your debt security. Covenant Defeasance Under\ncurrent U.S. federal income tax law, we can make the same type of deposit\ndescribed above and be released from restrictive covenants relating to your debt\nsecurity. This is called covenant defeasance. In that event, you would lose the\nprotection of those restrictive covenants. In order to achieve covenant defeasance\nfor a series of debt securities, among other conditions set forth in the BAC\nSenior Indenture, we must do both of the following:\n                                                                                  \n      We must deposit in trust with the trustee for the benefit of the holders    \n      of those debt securities a combination                                      \n      of money and U.S. government or U.S. government agency notes or bonds       \n      that, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public  \n      accountants, will generate enough cash to make interest, principal, and     \n      any other payments on those debt                                            \n      securities on their due dates; and                                          \n                                                                                  \n37\n                                                                                  \n      We must deliver to the trustee under the BAC Senior Indenture a legal       \n      opinion of our counsel confirming that                                      \n      under current U.S. federal income tax law we may make the above deposit     \n      without causing the beneficial owners to be taxed on those debt securities  \n      any differently than if we did not make the deposit and repaid the debt     \n      securities ourselves.                                                       \n                                                                                  \nIf we achieve covenant defeasance with respect to your debt security, you can\nstill look to us for repayment of your debt security in the event of any shortfall\nin the trust deposit. You should note, however, that if one of the remaining\nevents of default occurred, such as our bankruptcy, and your debt security became\nimmediately due and payable, there may be a shortfall. Depending on the event\ncausing the default, you may not be able to obtain payment of the shortfall.\nSatisfaction and Discharge of the Indenture The BAC Senior Indenture will cease to\nbe of further effect with respect to the debt securities of such series, if at any\ntime:\n                                                                                  \n      We have delivered to the trustee for cancellation all debt securities of    \n      such series; or                                                             \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      All debt securities of such series not delivered to the trustee for         \n      cancellation have become due and payable, or                                \n      will become due and payable within one year, or are to be called for        \n      redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the trustee   \n      for the giving of notice of redemption, and we have irrevocably deposited   \n      with the trustee or the                                                     \n      applicable paying agent as trust funds for the entire amount in cash due    \n      with respect to such debt securities on or after the date of such deposit,  \n      including at maturity or upon redemption of all such debt securities,       \n      including principal and any                                                 \n      premium, interest and other amounts payable, and any mandatory sinking      \n      fund payments, on the dates on which such payments are due and payable.     \n                                                                                  \nThe trustee, on our demand, accompanied by an officer\u0092s certificate of ours and an\nopinion of counsel and at our cost and expense, will execute proper instruments\nacknowledging such satisfaction of and discharging the BAC Senior Indenture with\nrespect to such debt securities. Notices We or the trustee on our behalf, if so\nrequested, will provide the holders with any required notices by first-class mail\nto the addresses of the holders as they appear in the security register. So long\nas a depository is the record holder of a series of debt securities with respect\nto which a notice is given, we or the trustee, if so requested, will deliver the\nnotice only to that depository in accordance with the procedures of that\ndepository then in place. Concerning the Trustee We and certain of our affiliates\nhave from time to time maintained deposit accounts and conducted other banking\ntransactions with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. and its\naffiliates in the ordinary course of business. We expect to continue these\nbusiness transactions. The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. is\ninitially serving as the trustee for the debt securities issued under the BAC\nSenior Indenture. The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. and its\naffiliates also serve as trustee for a number of series of outstanding\nindebtedness of us and our affiliates under other indentures. Consequently, if an\nactual or potential event of default occurs with respect to any of these\nsecurities, the trustee may be considered to have a conflicting interest for\npurposes of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. In that 38\n\ncase, the trustee may be required to resign under the BAC Senior Indenture, and we\nwould be required to appoint a successor trustee. For this purpose, a \u0093potential\u0094\nevent of default\nmeans an event that would be an event of default if the requirements for giving us\ndefault notice or for the default having to exist for a specific period of time\nwere disregarded. In addition, the trustee can resign for any reason by giving at\nleast 30 calendar days\u0092 written notice of resignation, and we would be required to\nappoint a successor trustee. The trustee will remain the trustee under the BAC\nSenior Indenture until a successor is appointed.\n\nGoverning Law\n\nThe BAC Senior Indenture is and the debt securities will be governed by New York\nlaw.\n\n39\n\nDESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES OF BOFA FINANCE LLC In this \u0093Description of Debt\nSecurities of BofA Finance LLC\u0094 section, \u0093we,\u0094 \u0093us\u0094 or \u0093our\u0094 refer only to BofA\nFinance LLC and not to any of its affiliates, including Bank of America\nCorporation; references to \u0093Guarantor\u0094 refer only to Bank of America Corporation\nand not to any of its subsidiaries or affiliates; and references to \u0093debt\nsecurities\u0094 refer only to senior debt securities issued by BofA Finance LLC and\nnot to any debt securities issued by any subsidiary or affiliate, including Bank\nof America Corporation. General We may issue debt securities, and such debt\nsecurities will not be secured by any of our property or assets. As a result, by\nowning a debt security, you are one of our unsecured creditors. The debt\nsecurities will constitute part of our senior debt, will be issued under our BofA\nFinance Indenture described below, and will rank equally in right of payment with\nall our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt from time to time. The payment\nobligations of BofA Finance under the debt securities will be fully and\nunconditionally guaranteed by Bank of America as described in this prospectus.\nBank of America\u0092s guarantee of the debt securities will be its unsecured senior\nobligation and will rank equally in right of payment with all other unsecured and\nunsubordinated obligations of Bank of America outstanding from time to time. BofA\nFinance is a finance subsidiary, has no operations other than those related to the\nissuance, administration and repayment of its debt securities guaranteed by Bank\nof America, and is dependent upon Bank of America and/or Bank of America\u0092s other\nsubsidiaries to meet its obligations under the debt securities in the ordinary\ncourse. However, BofA Finance will have no assets available for distributions to\nholders of its debt securities if they make claims in respect of such debt\nsecurities in a bankruptcy, resolution or similar proceeding. Holders of BofA\nFinance\u0092s debt securities will have recourse only to a single claim against Bank\nof America and its assets under Bank of America\u0092s guarantee of the debt\nsecurities. See \u0093Risk Factors\u0097BofA Finance is a finance subsidiary and, as such,\nhas no independent assets, operations or revenues\u0094 above and \u0093\u0097Bank of America\nGuarantee\u0094 below. This section of the prospectus provides a summary of the\nmaterial terms and provisions of the BofA Finance Indenture (as defined below) and\ncertain specific terms of debt securities that may be applicable if so specified\nin the applicable supplement for such debt securities. The Indenture The debt\nsecurities are governed by a document called an indenture, which is a contract\nbetween us and the applicable trustee. The debt securities will be issued under\nthe Indenture for Senior Debt Securities dated as of August 23, 2016 (as\nsupplemented from time to time, the \u0093BofA Finance Indenture\u0094) among us, as issuer,\nBank of America, as guarantor, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company,\nN.A., as trustee. The trustee under the BofA Finance Indenture has two principal\nfunctions:\n                                                                                  \n      First, the trustee can enforce your rights against us or the Guarantor if   \n      we or the Guarantor default. However,                                       \n      there are limitations on the extent to which the trustee may act on your    \n      behalf, which we describe below under \u0093\u0097Collection of Indebtedness and Suits  \n      for Enforcement by Trustee.\u0094                                                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      Second, the trustee performs administrative duties for us, including the    \n      delivery of interest and other payments                                     \n      and notices.                                                                \n                                                                                  \n40\n\nThe BofA Finance Indenture does not limit the aggregate amount of debt securities\nthat we\nmay issue or the number of series or the aggregate amount of any particular series\nof debt securities. The BofA Finance Indenture and the debt securities also do not\nlimit our ability to incur other indebtedness or to issue other securities. This\nmeans that we may issue additional debt securities and other securities at any\ntime without your consent and without notifying you.\n\nWe\nhave filed the BofA Finance Indenture with the SEC as an exhibit to the\nregistration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. See \u0093Where You Can\nFind More Information\u0094 below for information on how to obtain a copy of the BofA\nFinance Indenture. Whenever we refer to the defined terms of the BofA Finance\nIndenture in this section of this prospectus or in a supplement hereto without\ndefining them, the terms have the meanings given to them in the BofA Finance\nIndenture. You\nmust look to the BofA Finance Indenture for the most complete description of the\ninformation summarized in this prospectus.\n\nForm and Denomination of Debt Securities\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, we will issue each debt\nsecurity in book-entry only form. Debt securities in\nbook-entry only form will be represented by a global security registered in the\nname of a depository or its nominee. Accordingly, the depository or its nominee\nwill be the registered holder of all the debt securities represented by the global\nsecurity. Those who own beneficial interests in a global security will do so\nthrough participants in the depository\u0092s securities clearing system, and the\nrights of these indirect owners will be governed solely by the applicable\nprocedures of\nthe depository and its participants. We describe the procedures applicable to\nbook-entry only securities below under the heading \u0093Registration and Settlement.\u0094\n\nGenerally, all debt securities represented by the same global security will have\nthe same terms. We may, however, issue a global security that\nrepresents multiple debt securities that have different terms and are issued at\ndifferent times. We call this kind of global security a master global security.\nThe applicable supplement will indicate whether your debt securities will be\nrepresented\nby a master global security.\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, we will issue our debt\nsecurities in fully\nregistered form. If we issue a debt security in bearer form, we will describe the\nspecial considerations applicable to bearer securities in the applicable\nsupplement. Some of the features that we describe in this prospectus may not apply\nto bearer\nsecurities.\n\nOur debt securities may be denominated in U.S. dollars or in another currency as\nmay be specified in the applicable\nsupplement. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the debt\nsecurities will be denominated in U.S. dollars, and unless we specify otherwise in\nthe applicable supplement, the debt securities will be issued in minimum\ndenominations\nof $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess of $1,000.\n\nPayment for Non-U.S.Dollar-Denominated Debt Securities\n\nFor any debt securities denominated or payable in\na currency other than U.S. dollars (referred to as \u0093non-U.S. dollar-denominated\ndebt securities\u0094), the initial investors will be required to pay for the debt\nsecurities in that foreign currency. The\napplicable selling agent may arrange for the conversion of U.S. dollars into the\napplicable foreign currency to facilitate payment for the non-U.S. dollar-\ndenominated debt securities by U.S. purchasers\ndesiring to make the initial payment in U.S. dollars. Any such conversion will be\nmade by that selling agent on the terms and subject to the conditions,\nlimitations, and charges as it may establish from time to time in accordance with\nits\n\n41\n\nregular foreign exchange procedures, and subject to U.S. laws and regulations. All\ncosts of any such conversion for the initial purchase of the non-U.S.dollar-\ndenominated debt securities will be borne by the initial investors using those\nconversion arrangements. We describe some of those investment considerations\nrelating to securities denominated or payable in a currency other than U.S.\ndollars above under the heading \u0093Risk Factors.\u0094 Different Series of Debt\nSecurities We may issue our debt securities from time to time in one or more\nseries with the same or different maturities. We also may \u0093reopen\u0094 a series of our\ndebt securities. This means that we can increase the principal amount of a series\nof our debt securities by selling additional debt securities with the same terms,\nprovided that such additional debt securities shall be fungible for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes. We may do so without notice to the existing holders of debt\nsecurities of that series. However, any new debt securities of this kind may have\na different offering price and may begin to bear interest (if any) at a different\ndate. This section of the prospectus summarizes the material terms of the debt\nsecurities that are common to all series under the BofA Finance Indenture. We will\ndescribe the financial and other specific terms of the series of debt securities\nbeing offered in the applicable supplement. The applicable supplement also may\ndescribe any differences from the material terms described in this prospectus. If\nthere are any differences between the applicable supplement and this prospectus,\nthe applicable supplement will control. The terms of your series of debt\nsecurities as described in the applicable supplement may include the following:\n                                                  \n      the title and type of the debt securities;

                                                          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      the percentage of the stated principal amount at which the debt securities  \n      will be sold and, if applicable, the                                        \n      method of determining the price;                                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      the person to whom any interest is payable, if other than the registered    \n      holder of the debt securities;                                              \n                                                                                  \n                                   \n      the maturity date or dates;

Fixed-Rate Notes We may issue debt\nsecurities that bear interest at one or more fixed rates of interest, as specified\nin the applicable supplement. We refer to these debt securities as \u0093fixed-rate\nnotes.\u0094 We also may issue fixed-rate notes that combine principal and interest\npayments in installment payments over the life of the notes which we refer to as\n\u0093amortizing notes.\u0094 We will make payments on fixed-rate notes as described below\nunder the heading \u0093\u0097Payment of Principal, Interest, and Other Amounts Payable\u0094 and\nin the applicable supplement. Floating Rate Notes We may issue debt securities\nthat will bear interest at a floating rate of interest determined by reference to\none or more interest rate bases, referred to as the \u0093base rate.\u0094 We refer to these\ndebt securities as \u0093floating rate notes.\u0094 The base rate for a series of floating\nrate notes will be specified in, and will be determined in accordance with the\nspecific formula and/or applicable terms and provisions set forth in, the\napplicable supplement. 43\n\nIndexed Notes\n\nWe may issue debt securities that provide that the rate of return, including the\nprincipal and/or any premium, interest, or other amounts\npayable, is determined by reference, either directly or indirectly, to the price\nor performance of one or more interest rates, equity securities, indices, exchange\ntraded funds, commodities, currency exchange rates, futures contracts or any other\nrates, instruments, assets, market measures or other factors or any other measure\nof economic or financial risk or value, or one or more baskets, indices or other\ncombinations of the foregoing, in each case as specified in the applicable\nsupplement.\nWe refer to these as \u0093indexed notes.\u0094 Information relating to indexed notes,\nincluding terms and provisions thereof and information relating to payments\nthereon, will be set forth in the applicable supplement.\n\nFixed/Floating Rate/Indexed Notes\n\nWe may issue a debt security with elements of each of the fixed-rate, floating\nrate, and/or indexed notes described above. For example, a debt\nsecurity may bear interest at a fixed rate for some interest periods and at a\nfloating rate in other interest periods or at a rate linked to an index for some\ninterest periods. Similarly, a debt security may provide for a payment of\nprincipal at\nmaturity linked to an index and also may bear interest at a fixed or floating rate\nor at a rate linked to an index. We will describe the determination of interest or\nother amounts payable for any of these debt securities in the applicable\nsupplement.\n\nOriginal Issue Discount Notes\n\nAny of the types of notes described above may be an original issue discount note.\nOriginal issue discount notes are debt securities that are\nissued at a price lower than their stated principal amount or lower than their\nminimum guaranteed repayment amount at maturity. Original issue discount notes may\nbear no interest or may bear interest at a rate that is below market rates at the\ntime\nof issuance. Amounts payable in the event of redemption, repayment or upon an\nacceleration of the maturity of an original issue discount note will be determined\nin accordance with the terms of that debt security, as described in the applicable\nsupplement. That amount normally is less than the amount payable at the maturity\ndate. A debt security issued at a discount to its principal may, for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes, be considered an original issue discount note, regardless of\nthe\namount payable upon redemption or acceleration of maturity. See \u0093U.S. Federal\nIncome Tax Considerations\u0097Taxation of Debt Securities\u0094 below for a summary of the\nU.S. federal income tax consequences of owning an original issue discount\nnote.\n\nPayment of Principal, Interest, and Other Amounts Payable\n\nPaying Agents\n\nWe\nmay appoint one or more financial institutions to act as our paying agents.\nInitially, under the BofA Finance Indenture we have appointed The Bank of New York\nMellon Trust Company, N.A. to act as our paying agent with respect to the debt\nsecurities\nthrough its corporate trust office currently located at 4655 Salisbury Road, Suite\n300, Jacksonville, Florida 32256. We may add, replace or terminate any paying\nagent from time to time in accordance with the BofA Finance Indenture, in each\ncase\nwithout your consent and without notifying you of such change. In addition, we may\ndecide to act as our own paying agent with respect to some or all of the debt\nsecurities, and the paying agent may resign, in each case without your consent and\nwithout notifying you of such event.\n\n44\n\nPayments to Holders and Record Dates for Interest\n\nWe refer to each date on which interest is payable on a debt security as an\n\u0093interest payment date.\u0094 Subject to any applicable\nbusiness day convention set forth in the applicable supplement, interest payments\non the debt securities will be made on each interest payment date applicable to,\nand at the maturity date, or earlier redemption date, of, the applicable debt\nsecurities. Interest payable on any interest payment date other than the maturity\ndate, or earlier redemption date, will be paid to the registered holder of the\ndebt security at the close of business on the regular record date for that\ninterest\npayment date. However, unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement,\nthe initial interest payment on a debt security issued between a regular record\ndate and the interest payment date immediately following the regular record date\nwill be\nmade on the second interest payment date following the original issue date to the\nholder of record on the regular record date preceding the second interest payment\ndate. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the principal and\ninterest payable at maturity, or earlier redemption, will be paid to the holder of\nthe debt security at the time of payment by the paying agent.\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the record date for any\ninterest payment for a debt security in book-entry only form\nwill be the date that is one business day prior to the payment date, unless such\ndebt security is a non-U.S. dollar denominated debt security held through DTC, in\nwhich case the record date for an interest\npayment date will be the fifteenth calendar day prior to such interest payment\ndate, whether or not such record date is a business day. If the debt security is\nin a form that is other than book-entry only, and unless we specify otherwise in\nthe\napplicable supplement, the regular record date for an interest payment date will\nbe the fifteenth calendar day prior to such interest payment date, whether or not\nsuch record date is a business day.\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the term \u0093business day\u0094\nmeans any weekday that is not a legal holiday in\nNew York, New York, Charlotte, North Carolina, or any other place of payment of\nthe applicable debt security, and is not a date on which banking institutions in\nthose cities are authorized or required by law or regulation to be closed.\n\nPayments Due in U.S. Dollars\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, our debt securities will\nbe denominated, and payments with respect to the debt\nsecurities will be made, in U.S. dollars. Unless we specify otherwise in the\napplicable supplement, we will follow the practices described in this section when\nwe pay amounts that are due in U.S. dollars.\n\nWe will make payments on debt securities in book-entry only form in accordance\nwith arrangements then in place between the paying agent and\nthe depository or its nominee, as holder.\n\nAn indirect owner\u0092s right to receive those payments will be governed by the rules\nand\npractices of the depository and its participants, as described below under the\nheading \u0093Registration and Settlement.\u0094\n\nIndirect owners should contact their banks or brokers for information on how they\nwill receive payments on their debt securities.\n\nWe will pay any interest on debt securities in definitive form on each interest\npayment date other than the maturity date, or earlier\nredemption date, by, in our discretion, wire transfer of immediately available\nfunds or check mailed to holders of the debt securities on the applicable record\ndate at the address appearing on our or the security registrar\u0092s records. We will\npay\n\n45\n\nprincipal and any premium, interest, or other amounts payable at the maturity\ndate, or earlier redemption date, of a debt security in definitive form by wire\ntransfer of immediately available\nfunds to the registered holders of the debt security at the time of payment.\n\nPayments Due in Other Currencies\n\nGeneral\n\nIf any\nof the debt securities are denominated, or if principal and any premium, interest,\nor other amounts payable on any of the debt securities is payable, in a foreign\ncurrency, the specified currency, as well as any additional investment\nconsiderations,\nrisk factors, restrictions, tax consequences, specific terms and other information\nrelating to that series of debt securities and the specified currency will be\ndescribed in the applicable supplement.\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, we will follow the\npractices described in this section when we pay amounts that are\ndue on non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt securities. Unless we specify otherwise in\nthe applicable supplement, and except as described below, holders of non-U.S.\ndollar-denominated debt securities are not entitled to receive payments in U.S.\ndollars of an amount due in another currency, either on a global debt security or\na debt security in definitive form.\n\nWe will make payments on non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt securities in book-entry\nonly form in the\napplicable specified currency in accordance with arrangements then in place\nbetween the paying agent and the depository or its nominee, as holder. An indirect\nowner\u0092s right to receive those payments will be governed by the rules and\npractices\nof the depository and its participants, as described below under the heading\n\u0093Registration and Settlement.\u0094\n\nNon-U.S.Dollar-Denominated Debt Securities Held Through DTC\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the\napplicable supplement, holders of beneficial interests in non-U.S. dollar-\ndenominated debt securities through a participant in The Depository Trust Company,\nor \u0093DTC,\u0094 will receive payments in U.S.\ndollars, unless they elect to receive payments on those debt securities in the\napplicable foreign currency. If a holder of such beneficial interests through DTC\ndoes not make an election through its DTC participant to receive payments in the\napplicable foreign currency, the exchange rate agent for the relevant non-U.S.\ndollar-denominated debt securities to be appointed by us will convert payments to\nthat holder into U.S. dollars, and all costs of\nthose conversions will be borne by that holder by deduction from the applicable\npayments.\n\nThe holder of a beneficial interest in global non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt\nsecurities held through a DTC participant may elect to receive payments on those\ndebt securities in the foreign currency by notifying the DTC participant through\nwhich it holds its\nbeneficial interests on or prior to the fifteenth business day prior to the record\ndate for the applicable debt securities of (1) that holder\u0092s election to receive\nall or a portion of the payment in the applicable foreign currency and\n(2) wire transfer instructions to an account for the applicable foreign currency\noutside the United States. DTC must be notified of the election and wire transfer\ninstructions (a) on or prior to the fifth business day after the record date\nfor any payment of interest and (b) on or prior to the tenth business day prior to\nthe date for any payment of principal. DTC will notify the trustee or other\napplicable paying agent of the election and wire transfer instructions (1) on or\nprior to the fifth business day after the record date for any payment of interest\nand (2) on or prior to the tenth business day prior to the date for any payment of\nprincipal. If complete instructions are forwarded to and received by DTC\nthrough a DTC participant and forwarded by DTC to the trustee or other applicable\npaying agent and received on or prior to the dates described above, the holder\nwill\n\n46\n\nreceive payment in the applicable foreign currency outside DTC; otherwise, only\nU.S. dollar payments will be made by the trustee or other applicable paying agent\nto DTC.\n\nFor holders of non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt securities held through a DTC\nparticipant not electing\npayment in the applicable foreign currency, the U.S. dollar amount of any payment\nwill be the amount of the applicable foreign currency otherwise payable, converted\ninto U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate prevailing as of 11:00 a.m. (New\nYork City time) on the second business day prior to the relevant payment date,\nless any costs incurred by the exchange rate agent for that conversion unless we\nspecify otherwise in the applicable supplement. The costs of those conversions\nwill be\nshared pro rata among the holders of beneficial interests in the applicable global\ndebt securities receiving U.S. dollar payments in the proportion of their\nrespective holdings. The exchange rate agent, to be appointed by us at the time of\nissuance\nfor such non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt securities held through a DTC\nparticipant, will make those conversions in accordance with prevailing market\npractice and the terms of the applicable debt security and\nwith any applicable arrangements between us and the exchange rate agent.\n\nIf an exchange rate quotation is unavailable from the entity or\nsource ordinarily used by the exchange rate agent in the normal course of\nbusiness, the exchange rate agent will obtain a quotation from a leading foreign\nexchange bank in New York City, which may be an affiliate of the exchange rate\nagent or\nanother entity selected by the exchange rate agent for that purpose after\nconsultation with us. If no quotation from a leading foreign exchange bank is\navailable, payment will be made in the applicable foreign currency to the account\nor accounts\nspecified by DTC to the trustee or other applicable paying agent, unless the\napplicable foreign currency is unavailable due to the imposition of exchange\ncontrols or other circumstances beyond our control.\n\nUnavailability of Currencies and Replacement Currencies\n\nIf, at or about the time of payment of any principal, premium or interest on a\nnon-U.S. dollar-\ndenominated debt security, the relevant specified currency is not legal tender for\nthe payment of public and private debts in the country issuing the currency as of\nthe original issue date of such debt security or is otherwise unavailable, and the\nrelevant specified currency has been replaced by another currency that has become\nlegal tender for the payment of public and private debts in such country (a\n\u0093replacement currency\u0094), any amount payable pursuant to such debt security may be\npaid, at our option, in the replacement currency or in U.S. dollars, at a rate of\nexchange which takes into account the conversion, at the rate prevailing on the\nmost recent date on which official conversion rates were quoted or set by the\nnational\ngovernment or other authority responsible for issuing the replacement currency,\nfrom the specified currency to the replacement currency or to U.S. dollars, if\napplicable, and, if necessary, the conversion of the replacement currency into\nU.S.\ndollars at the rate prevailing on the date of such conversion. In this\ncircumstance, we will appoint a financial institution to act as exchange rate\nagent for purposes of making the required conversions in accordance with\nprevailing market practice\nand the terms of the applicable debt security and with any applicable arrangements\nbetween us and the exchange rate agent.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the relevant specified currency may not be\navailable to us for making payments of principal of or any premium,\ninterest or other amounts payable on any non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt\nsecurities. This could occur due to the imposition of exchange controls or other\ncircumstances beyond our control, or if the specified\ncurrency is no longer used by the government of the country issuing that currency\nor by public institutions within the international banking community for the\nsettlement of transactions. If the specified currency is unavailable and has not\nbeen\nreplaced, and unless otherwise specified in the applicable supplement, we may\nsatisfy our obligations to holders of the relevant non-U.S. dollar-denominated\ndebt securities by making those payments due in the\nrelevant specified currency on the date of\n\n47\n\npayment in U.S. dollars. The amount of such payments made in U.S. dollars will be\ndetermined by an exchange rate agent to be appointed by us on the basis of the\nnoon dollar buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers of the\nspecified currency or currencies in which a payment on any such non-U.S.dollar-\ndenominated debt securities was to be made, published by the Federal Reserve Bank\nof New York, which is referred to as the \u0093market exchange rate,\u0094 or such other\nrate as may be set forth in the applicable supplement. If that rate of exchange is\nnot then available or is not published for a particular payment currency, the\nmarket exchange rate will be based on the highest bid quotation in The City of New\nYork received by the exchange rate agent at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York\nCity time, on the second business day preceding the applicable payment date from\nthree recognized foreign exchange dealers for the purchase by the quoting dealer:\n                                                                                  \n      of the specified currency for U.S. dollars for settlement on the payment    \n      date;                                                                       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      in the aggregate amount of the specified currency payable to those holders  \n      or beneficial owners of non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt securities; and    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                     \n      at which the applicable dealer commits to execute a contract.  \n                                                                     \nOne of the dealers providing quotations may be the exchange rate agent unless the\nexchange rate agent is our affiliate. If those bid quotations are not available,\nthe exchange rate agent will determine the market exchange rate at its sole\ndiscretion in accordance with prevailing market practice and the terms of the\napplicable debt security and with any applicable arrangements between us and the\nexchange rate agent. The above provisions do not apply if a specified currency is\nunavailable because it has been replaced by the euro. If the euro has been\nsubstituted for a specified currency of the relevant non-U.S.dollar-denominated\ndebt security, we may, at our option, or will, if required by applicable law,\nwithout the consent of the holders of the affected debt securities, pay the\nprincipal of and any premium, interest or other amounts payable on any\nnon-U.S.dollar-denominated debt securities in euro instead of the specified\ncurrency, in conformity with legally applicable measures taken pursuant to, or by\nvirtue of, the Treaty establishing the European Community, as amended. Any payment\nmade in U.S. dollars, an applicable replacement currency, or in euro as described\nabove where the required payment is in an unavailable specified currency will not\nconstitute an event of default under the BofA Finance Indenture or the applicable\ndebt securities. The exchange rate agent to be appointed by us may be one of our\naffiliates, and, from time to time after the initial appointment of an exchange\nrate agent, we may appoint one or more different exchange rate agents for the\nrelevant non-U.S.dollar-denominated debt security without your consent and without\nnotifying you of the change. The exchange rate agent will determine the applicable\nrate of exchange that would apply to a payment made in U.S. dollars or a\nreplacement currency in its sole discretion unless we state in the applicable\nsupplement that any determination requires our approval. Absent manifest error,\nthose determinations will be final and binding on you and us. For purposes of the\nabove discussion about currency conversions and payments on non-U.S.dollar-\ndenominated debt securities, unless otherwise specified in the applicable\nsupplement, the term \u0093business day\u0094 means any weekday that is not a legal holiday\nin New York, New York or Charlotte, North Carolina and is not a day on which\nbanking institutions in those cities are authorized or required by law or\nregulation to be closed. Indirect owners of a debt security with a specified\ncurrency other than U.S. dollars should contact their banks or brokers for\ninformation about how to receive payments in the specified currency or in U.S.\ndollars. 48\n\nNon-U.S.Dollar-Denominated Securities in Definitive Form We will pay any interest\non non-U.S.dollar-denominated debt securities in definitive form on each interest\npayment date other than the maturity date, or earlier redemption date, by, in our\ndiscretion, wire transfer of immediately available funds or check mailed to\nholders of the debt securities on the applicable record date at the address\nappearing on our or the security registrar\u0092s records. Unless we specify otherwise\nin the applicable supplement, we will pay principal and any premium, interest, or\nother amounts payable at the maturity date, or earlier redemption date, of a\nnon-U.S.dollar-denominated debt security in definitive form by wire transfer of\nimmediately available funds to the registered holders of the debt security at the\ntime of payment. No Sinking Fund Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable\nsupplement, our debt securities will not be entitled to the benefit of any sinking\nfund. This means that we will not deposit money on a regular basis into any\nseparate custodial account to repay the debt securities. Redemption The applicable\nsupplement will indicate whether we may redeem the debt securities prior to their\nstated maturity. If we may redeem the debt securities prior to their stated\nmaturity, the applicable supplement will indicate the redemption price, the method\nfor redemption, and the date or dates upon which we may redeem the debt\nsecurities. Debt securities to be redeemed in part may only be redeemed in\nincrements of their minimum denomination. Notice of Redemption Unless we specify\notherwise in the applicable supplement, we may exercise our right to redeem debt\nsecurities by giving notice to the holders under the BofA Finance Indenture at\nleast 5 business days but not more than 60 calendar days before the specified\nredemption date. The notice will specify:\n                                      \n      the date fixed for redemption;  \n                                      \n                                                                                  \n      the redemption price (or, if not then ascertainable, the manner of          \n      calculation thereof);                                                       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      the CUSIP number and any other identifying number of the debt securities    \n      to be redeemed;                                                             \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      the amount to be redeemed, if less than all of the outstanding debt         \n      securities of a series are to be redeemed;                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                    \n      the place of payment for the debt securities to be redeemed;  \n                                                                    \n                                                                                  \n      that interest (if any) accrued on the debt securities to be redeemed will   \n      be paid as specified in the notice; and                                     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      that interest (if any) will cease to accrue on the debt securities to be    \n      redeemed.                                                                   \n                                                                                  \nIf notice of redemption has been given in accordance with the BofA Finance\nIndenture, the debt securities being redeemed shall become due and payable on the\ndate fixed for redemption. 49\n\nSo long as a depository is the record holder of the applicable debt securities to\nbe\nredeemed, we, or the trustee on our behalf if we so request, will deliver any\nnotice of our election to exercise our redemption right only to that depository.\n\nRepayment\n\nThe applicable supplement will indicate whether the debt securities can be repaid\nat the holder\u0092s option prior to their stated maturity.\nIf the debt securities may be repaid prior to their stated maturity, the\napplicable supplement will indicate the applicable repayment price or prices, the\nprocedures for repayment and the date or dates on or after which the holder can\nrequest\nrepayment.\n\nRepurchase\n\nWe may purchase at any time and from time to time, including through a subsidiary\nor affiliate of ours, outstanding debt securities by tender,\nin the open market, or by private agreement. We, or our affiliates, have the\ndiscretion to hold or resell any repurchased debt securities. We also have the\ndiscretion to cancel any repurchased debt securities.\n\nBank of America Guarantee\n\nPursuant to the BofA Finance Indenture, Bank of America fully and unconditionally\nguarantees, on an unsecured basis, the due and punctual\npayment of the principal of (and premium, if any, on) and any interest and all\nother amounts payable on the debt securities issued by BofA Finance, when the same\nbecomes due and payable, whether at maturity or upon redemption, repayment or\nacceleration, in accordance with the terms of the debt securities and the BofA\nFinance Indenture. If for any reason BofA Finance does not make any required\npayment on the debt securities when due, Bank of America will make such payment,\non demand,\nat the same place and in the same manner that applies to payments made by BofA\nFinance under the BofA Finance Indenture. The guarantee is of payment and not of\ncollection.\n\nBofA Finance is a finance subsidiary and has no operations other than those\nrelated to the issuance, administration and repayment of its debt\nsecurities guaranteed by Bank of America. In addition, BofA Finance will have no\nassets available for distributions to holders of its debt securities if they make\nclaims in respect of such debt securities in a bankruptcy, resolution or similar\nproceeding. Accordingly, any recoveries by such holders will be limited to those\navailable under Bank of America\u0092s guarantee of such debt securities, and any\nobligations under that guarantee will rank equally in right of payment with all\nother\nunsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Bank of America. Holders of BofA\nFinance\u0092s debt securities will have recourse only to a single claim against Bank\nof America and its assets under Bank of America\u0092s guarantee of the debt\nsecurities. See \u0093Risk Factors\u0097BofA Finance is a finance subsidiary and, as such,\nhas no independent assets, operations or revenues.\u0094\n\nBank of America\u0092s obligations under its guarantee of the debt securities are\nunconditional and absolute.\n\nIf BofA Finance were to merge into Bank of America, under the terms of the BofA\nFinance Indenture, the guarantee would terminate.\n\nExchange, Registration, and Transfer\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, we will issue each debt\nsecurity in global, or book-entry only, form. Debt\nsecurities in global form may be exchanged for debt securities\n\n50\n\nin definitive form only in the limited circumstances described in the relevant\ndebt securities or in the BofA Finance Indenture. Debt securities represented by a\nmaster note may be exchanged by us at any time upon our request to the trustee for\none or more other debt securities in global form, as described in the relevant\ndebt securities. Subject to the terms of the BofA Finance Indenture, debt\nsecurities of any series in definitive form may be exchanged at the option of the\nholder for other debt securities of the same series and of an equal aggregate\nprincipal amount and type in any authorized denominations. Debt securities in\ndefinitive form may be presented for registration of transfer at the office of the\nsecurity registrar or at the office of any transfer agent that we designate and\nmaintain. The security registrar or the transfer agent will make the registration\nof transfer only if it is satisfied with the documents of title and identity of\nthe person making the request. There will not be a service charge for any exchange\nor registration of transfer of debt securities, but we may require payment of a\nsum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed\nin connection with the exchange or transfer. Unless we specify otherwise in the\napplicable supplement, initially, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A.\nwill be the authenticating agent, security registrar and transfer agent for the\ndebt securities issued under the BofA Finance Indenture. We may change the\nsecurity registrar or the transfer agent or approve a change in the location\nthrough which any security registrar or transfer agent acts at any time, in each\ncase without your consent and without notifying you of such event. We will be\nrequired to maintain a security registrar and transfer agent in each place of\npayment for each series of debt securities. At any time, we may designate\nadditional transfer agents for any series of debt securities. We will not be\nrequired to (1) issue, exchange, or register the transfer of any debt security of\nany series to be redeemed for a period of 15 days before the date on which we\ndeliver the notice of redemption, or (2) exchange or register the transfer of any\ndebt security (i) that was selected, called, or is being called for redemption,\nexcept the unredeemed portion of any debt security being redeemed in part or (ii)\nas to which the holder has exercised any right to require us to repay such debt\nsecurity, except the portion to remain outstanding of any debt security being\nrepaid in part.

Limitation on Mergers and Sales of Assets Under the terms of the\nBofA Finance Indenture, we are, and the Guarantor is, permitted to merge or\nconsolidate with another entity, subject to certain requirements.

No modification\nmay reduce the percentage of debt securities that is required to consent to\nmodification of the BofA Finance Indenture without the consent of all holders of\nthe debt securities outstanding under the BofA Finance Indenture.\n\nIn addition, we, the Guarantor, and the trustee may execute supplemental\nindentures in some circumstances without the consent of any holders\nof outstanding debt securities.\n\nFor purposes of determining the aggregate principal amount of the debt securities\noutstanding at any time\nin connection with any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent,\nor waiver under the BofA Finance Indenture, (1) the principal amount of any debt\nsecurity issued with original issue discount is that amount of principal that\nwould be due and payable at that time upon a declaration of acceleration of the\nmaturity of the original issue discount note, and (2) the principal amount of a\ndebt security denominated in a foreign currency or currency unit is the U.S.\ndollar\nequivalent on the date of original issuance of the debt security, determined as\nspecified in the applicable supplement for that debt security.\n\nMeetings and Action by Securityholders\n\nThe trustee may call a meeting in its discretion, or upon request by us or the\nholders of\nat least 10% in principal amount of a series of outstanding debt securities, by\ngiving notice. If a meeting of holders is duly held, any resolution raised or\ndecision taken in accordance with the BofA Finance Indenture will be binding on\nall holders\nof debt securities of that series.\n\n53\n\nEvents of Default and Rights of Acceleration; Covenant Breaches Unless otherwise\nspecified in the applicable supplement, an event of default for any particular\ndebt securities of any series includes any one of the following events:\n                                                                                  \n      our failure to pay principal of or any premium on any such debt securities  \n      when due and payable;                                                       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      our failure to pay interest or other amounts due (other than principal,     \n      premium, if any, or other amounts payable                                   \n      at maturity or upon redemption) on any such debt securities when due and    \n      payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 calendar days;  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      our breach of any of our other covenants contained in such debt securities  \n      or in the BofA Finance Indenture, that                                      \n      is not cured within 90 calendar days after written notice to us by the      \n      trustee of the BofA Finance Indenture, or to us and the trustee of the      \n      BofA Finance Indenture by the holders of at least 25% in aggregate          \n      principal amount of all debt securities                                     \n      then outstanding under the BofA Finance Indenture and affected by the       \n      breach;                                                                     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                 \n      specified events involving our bankruptcy, insolvency, or liquidation; or  \n                                                                                 \n                                                                                 \n      any other event of default provided with respect to such debt securities.  \n                                                                                 \nAny additional or different events of default for a series of debt securities will\nbe specified in the applicable supplement. Unless otherwise specified in the\napplicable supplement, if an event of default occurs and is continuing, either the\ntrustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the\ndebt securities outstanding under the BofA Finance Indenture and affected by such\nevent of default (or, in the case of an event of default under the BofA Finance\nIndenture relating to specified events involving our bankruptcy, insolvency, or\nliquidation, the holders of 25% in principal amount of all outstanding debt\nsecurities) may declare the principal amount, or, if the debt securities are\nissued with original issue discount, a specified portion of the principal amount,\nof all affected debt securities (or all debt securities, as the case may be) to be\ndue and payable immediately. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal\namount of the affected debt securities then outstanding, in some circumstances,\nmay annul the declaration of acceleration and waive past defaults. We and the\nGuarantor are required periodically to file with the trustee a certificate stating\nthat we or the Guarantor, as the case may be, are not in default under any of the\nterms of the BofA Finance Indenture. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for\nEnforcement by Trustee If (i) we fail to pay the principal of or any premium on\nany debt securities, or (ii) we are over 30 calendar days late on an interest\npayment or other amounts due (other than principal, any premium, or other amounts\npayable at maturity or upon redemption) on the debt securities, the trustee can\ndemand that we pay to it, for the benefit of the holders of those debt securities,\nthe amount which is due and payable on those debt securities, including any\ninterest incurred because of our failure to make that payment. If we fail to pay\nsuch required amount on demand, the trustee may take appropriate action, including\ninstituting judicial proceedings against us. In addition, a holder of our debt\nsecurities also may file suit to enforce our obligation to make payment of\nprincipal, and any premium, interest, or other amounts payable on such debt\nsecurities regardless of the actions taken by the trustee. 54\n\nThe holders of a majority in principal amount of each series of the affected debt\nsecurities then outstanding under the BofA Finance Indenture may direct the time,\nmethod, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the\ntrustee under the BofA Finance Indenture. The trustee may decline to act if the\ndirection is contrary to law and in certain other circumstances set forth in the\nBofA Finance Indenture. The trustee is not obligated to exercise any of its rights\nor powers under the BofA Finance Indenture at the request or direction of the\nholders of the debt securities unless the holders offer the trustee security or\nindemnity reasonably satisfactory to the trustee against costs, expenses and\nliabilities. Limitation on Suits The BofA Finance Indenture provides that no\nindividual holder of debt securities of any series may institute any action\nagainst us under the BofA Finance Indenture, except actions for payment of overdue\nprincipal or any premium, interest or other amounts due, unless the following\nactions have occurred:\n                                                                                  \n      the holder must have previously given written notice to the trustee of a    \n      continuing event of default or covenant                                     \n      breach;                                                                     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of such outstanding    \n      debt securities issued under the BofA                                       \n      Finance Indenture must have (1)\u00a0requested the trustee to institute          \n      proceedings in respect of such event of default or covenant breach and (2)  \n      offered the trustee indemnity against liabilities incurred by the trustee   \n      for taking such action,                                                     \n      which indemnity is reasonably satisfactory to the trustee;                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      the trustee must have failed to institute proceedings within 60 days after  \n      receipt of the request referred to                                          \n      above; and                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      the holders of a majority in principal amount of such outstanding debt      \n      securities issued under the BofA Finance                                    \n      Indenture must not have given direction to the trustee inconsistent with    \n      the request of the holders referred to above.                               \n                                                                                  \nHowever, the holder of any debt securities will have an absolute right to receive\npayment of principal of and any premium and interest on the senior debt security\nwhen due and to institute suit to enforce this payment. Payment of Additional\nAmounts If we so specify in the applicable supplement, and subject to the\nexceptions and limitations set forth below, we will pay to the holder of any debt\nsecurity that is a \u0093non-U.S.person\u0094 additional amounts to ensure that every net\npayment on that debt security will not be less, due to the payment of U.S.\nwithholding tax, than the amount then otherwise due and payable. For this purpose,\na \u0093net payment\u0094 on a debt security means a payment by us or any paying agent,\nincluding payment of principal and interest, after deduction for any present or\nfuture tax, assessment, or other governmental charge of the United States (other\nthan a territory or possession). These additional amounts will constitute\nadditional interest on the debt security. For this purpose, U.S. withholding tax\nmeans a withholding tax of the United States, other than a territory or\npossession. 55\n\nHowever, notwithstanding our obligation, if so specified, to pay additional\namounts, we will not be required to pay additional amounts in any of the\ncircumstances described in items (1) through (15) below, unless we specify\notherwise in the applicable supplement.\n                                                                                  \n       Additional amounts will not be payable if a payment on a debt security is  \n  (1)  reduced as a result of any tax,                                            \n       assessment, or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld       \n       solely by reason of the beneficial owner of the debt security:             \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      having a relationship with the United States as a citizen, resident, or     \n      otherwise;

Redemption for Tax Reasons If we so specify\nin the applicable supplement, we may redeem the debt securities in whole, but not\nin part, at any time before maturity, if we have or will become obligated to pay\nadditional 58\n\namounts, as described above under \u0093\u0097Payment of Additional Amounts,\u0094 as a result of\nany change in, or amendment to, the laws or regulations of the United States or\nany political subdivision or any authority of the United States having power to\ntax, or any change in the application or official interpretation of such laws or\nregulations, which change or amendment becomes effective on or after the date of\nthe applicable supplement for the issuance of those debt securities. If we\nexercise such right to redeem the debt securities, unless we specify otherwise in\nthe applicable supplement, we will give not less than 5 business days\u0092 nor more\nthan 60 calendar days\u0092 notice to the trustee under the BofA Finance Indenture and\nto the holders of the debt securities. In connection with any notice of redemption\nfor tax reasons, we will deliver to the trustee under the BofA Finance Indenture\nany required certificate, request, or order. Unless we specify otherwise in the\napplicable supplement, any debt securities redeemed for tax reasons will be\nredeemed at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such debt\nsecurities, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding,\nthe date fixed for redemption. Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance If we so specify\nin the applicable supplement, the provisions for full defeasance and covenant\ndefeasance described below will apply to the debt securities of a series if\ncertain conditions are satisfied. Full Defeasance If there is a change in the U.S.\nfederal income tax law, as described below, Bank of America and BofA Finance can\nlegally release themselves from all payment and other obligations on the debt\nsecurities of a series. This is called full defeasance. For us to do so, among\nother conditions set forth in the BofA Finance Indenture, each of the following\nmust occur:\n                                                                                  \n      We or Bank of America must deposit in trust with the trustee for the        \n      benefit of the holders of those debt                                        \n      securities a combination of money and U.S. government or U.S. government    \n      agency notes or bonds that, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm  \n      of independent public accountants, will generate enough cash to make        \n      interest, principal, and any                                                \n      other payments on those debt securities when due;                           \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      There must be a change in current U.S. federal income tax law or an         \n      Internal Revenue Service ruling that lets us                                \n      make the above deposit without causing the beneficial owners to be taxed    \n      on those debt securities any differently than if we did not make the        \n      deposit and repaid those debt securities ourselves. Under current U.S.      \n      federal income tax law, the deposit,                                        \n      and our legal release from your debt security, would be treated as though   \n      we took back your debt security and gave you your share of the cash and     \n      notes or bonds deposited in trust. In that event, you could recognize gain  \n      or loss on your debt                                                        \n      security; and                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      We or Bank of America must deliver to the trustee under the BofA Finance    \n      Indenture a legal opinion of our counsel                                    \n      confirming the tax law treatment described above.                           \n                                                                                  \nIf we ever fully defeased your debt security, you would have to rely solely on the\ntrust deposit for payments on your debt security. Covenant Defeasance Under\ncurrent U.S. federal income tax law, we can make the same type of deposit\ndescribed above and be released from restrictive covenants relating to your debt\nsecurity. This is called 59\n\ncovenant defeasance. In that event, you would lose the protection of those\nrestrictive covenants. In order to achieve covenant defeasance for a series of\ndebt securities, among other conditions set forth in the BofA Finance Indenture,\nwe must do both of the following:\n                                                                                  \n      We or Bank of America must deposit in trust with the trustee for the        \n      benefit of the holders of those debt                                        \n      securities a combination of money and U.S. government or U.S. government    \n      agency notes or bonds that, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm  \n      of independent public accountants, will generate enough cash to make        \n      interest, principal, and any                                                \n      other payments on those debt securities on their due dates; and             \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      We must deliver to the trustee under the BofA Finance Indenture a legal     \n      opinion of our counsel confirming that                                      \n      under current U.S. federal income tax law, we may make the above deposit    \n      without causing the beneficial owners to be taxed on those debt securities  \n      any differently than if we did not make the deposit and repaid the debt     \n      securities ourselves.                                                       \n                                                                                  \nIf we achieve covenant defeasance with respect to your debt security, you can\nstill look to us for repayment of your debt security in the event of any shortfall\nin the trust deposit. You should note, however, that if one of the remaining\nevents of default occurred, such as our bankruptcy, and your debt security became\nimmediately due and payable, there may be a shortfall. Depending on the event\ncausing the default, you may not be able to obtain payment of the shortfall.\nSatisfaction and Discharge of the Indenture The BofA Finance Indenture will cease\nto be of further effect with respect to the debt securities of such series, if at\nany time:\n                                                                                  \n      We have delivered to the trustee for cancellation all debt securities of    \n      such series; or                                                             \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      All debt securities of such series not delivered to the trustee for         \n      cancellation have become due and payable, or                                \n      will become due and payable within one year, or are to be called for        \n      redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the trustee   \n      for the giving of notice of redemption, and we or the Guarantor has         \n      irrevocably deposited with the trustee                                      \n      or the applicable paying agent as trust funds for the entire amount in      \n      cash due with respect to such debt securities on or after the date of such  \n      deposit, including at maturity or upon redemption of all such debt          \n      securities, including principal and                                         \n      any premium, interest and other amounts payable, and any mandatory sinking  \n      fund payments, on the dates on which such payments are due and payable.     \n                                                                                  \nThe trustee, on our or the Guarantor\u0092s demand, accompanied by an officer\u0092s\ncertificate of ours or the Guarantor\u0092s and an opinion of counsel and at our or the\nGuarantor\u0092s cost and expense, will execute proper instruments acknowledging such\nsatisfaction of and discharging the BofA Finance Indenture with respect to such\ndebt securities. Notices We or the trustee on our behalf, if so requested, will\nprovide the holders with any required notices by first-class mail to the addresses\nof the holders as they appear in the security register. So long as a depository is\nthe record holder of a series of debt securities with respect to which a notice is\ngiven, we or the trustee, if so requested, will deliver the notice only to that\ndepository in accordance with the procedures of that depository then in place. 60\n\nConcerning the Trustee\n\nBank of America and certain of its affiliates have from time to time maintained\ndeposit accounts and conducted other banking transactions with\nThe Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. and its affiliates in the ordinary\ncourse of business. We expect to continue these business transactions. The Bank of\nNew York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. is initially serving as the trustee for the\ndebt securities issued under the BofA Finance Indenture. The Bank of New York\nMellon Trust Company, N.A. and its affiliates also serve as trustee for a number\nof series of outstanding indebtedness of Bank of America and its affiliates under\nother\nindentures. Consequently, if an actual or potential event of default occurs with\nrespect to any of these securities, the trustee may be considered to have a\nconflicting interest for purposes of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.\nIn that\ncase, the trustee may be required to resign under the BofA Finance Indenture, and\nwe would be required to appoint a successor trustee. For this purpose, a\n\u0093potential\u0094 event of default means an event that would be an event of default if\nthe\nrequirements for giving us default notice or for the default having to exist for a\nspecific period of time were disregarded. In addition, the trustee can resign for\nany reason by giving at least 30 calendar days\u0092 written notice of resignation,\nand we would be required to appoint a successor trustee. The trustee will remain\nthe trustee under the BofA Finance Indenture until a successor is appointed.\n\nGoverning Law\n\nThe BofA Finance Indenture is and the debt securities and the guarantee will be\ngoverned by New York law.\n\n61\n\nREGISTRATION AND SETTLEMENT\n\nUnless specified otherwise in the applicable supplement, Bank of America and/or\nBofA Finance will issue the debt securities in registered, and\nnot bearer, form. This means that Bank of America\u0092s and/or BofA Finance\u0092s\nobligation runs to the holder of the security named on the face of the security.\nEach debt security issued in registered form will be represented either by a\ncertificate issued in definitive form to a particular investor or by one or more\nglobal securities representing the entire series of securities.\n\nBank of America and BofA Finance refer to those persons who have debt securities\nregistered in their own names, on the books that Bank of\nAmerica, BofA Finance or the trustee or other agent maintain for this purpose, as\nthe \u0093holders\u0094 of those debt securities. These persons are the legal holders of the\ndebt securities. Bank of America and BofA Finance refer to those who,\nindirectly through others, own beneficial interests in debt securities that are\nnot registered in their own names as indirect owners or beneficial owners of those\ndebt securities. As discussed below, indirect owners are not legal holders, and\ninvestors in debt securities issued in global, or book-entry only, form or in\nstreet name will be indirect owners.\n\nA global security may\nrepresent one or any number of individual debt securities. Generally, all debt\nsecurities represented by the same global security will have the same terms. Bank\nof America and/or BofA Finance may, however, issue a global security that\nrepresents\nmultiple debt securities that have different terms and are issued at different\ntimes. This kind of global security is called a master global security. Each debt\nsecurity evidenced by a master global security will be identified by the trustee\non a\nschedule to such master global security. Your prospectus supplement or applicable\nsupplement will indicate whether your debt securities are represented by a master\nglobal security.\n\nBook-Entry Only Issuance\n\nUnless specified otherwise in the applicable supplement, Bank of America and/or\nBofA Finance will issue each debt security in global, or\nbook-entry, form. This means that securities in definitive form will not be issued\nto investors. Instead, global securities in registered form representing the\nentire series of debt securities will be issued. Each global security will be\nregistered\nin the name of a financial institution or clearing system that holds the global\nsecurity as depository on behalf of other financial institutions that participate\nin that depository\u0092s book-entry system. These participating institutions, in turn,\nhold beneficial interests in the global securities on behalf of themselves or\ntheir customers.\n\nBecause debt securities issued in global\nform are registered in the name of the depository, Bank of America and BofA\nFinance will recognize only the depository as the holder of the debt securities.\nThis means that Bank of America and/or BofA Finance, as applicable, will make all\npayments\non the debt securities, including deliveries of any property other than cash, to\nthe depository. The depository passes along the payments it receives from Bank of\nAmerica and/or BofA Finance to its participants, which in turn pass the payments\nalong\nto their customers who are the beneficial owners. The depository and its\nparticipants are not obligated to pass these payments along under the terms of the\ndebt securities. Instead, they do so under agreements they have made with one\nanother or with\ntheir customers.\n\nAs a result, investors will not own debt securities issued in book-entry only form\ndirectly. Instead, they will own\nbeneficial interests in a global security, through a bank, broker, or other\nfinancial institution that participates in the depository\u0092s book-entry system or\nholds an interest through a participant in the depository\u0092s book-entry system. As\nlong as the debt securities are issued in global form, investors will be indirect\nowners, and not holders, of the debt securities. The depository will not have\nknowledge of the actual beneficial owners of the debt securities.\n\n62\n\nDefinitive Securities\n\nIn the future, Bank of America and/or BofA Finance may cancel a global security or\nmay issue debt securities initially in non-global, or definitive, form. Bank of\nAmerica and BofA Finance do not expect to exchange global securities for\ncertificated securities in definitive form registered in the names of the\nbeneficial owners of the\nglobal securities representing the debt securities except in the limited\ncircumstances described in the relevant debt securities or in the relevant\nindenture.\n\nStreet Name Owners\n\nIf certificated securities in definitive form registered in the names of the\nbeneficial owners are issued, investors may choose to hold their\ndebt securities in their own names or in street name. Debt securities held by an\ninvestor in street name would be registered in the name of a bank, broker, or\nother financial institution that the investor chooses, and the investor would hold\nonly a\nbeneficial interest in those debt securities through an account that he or she\nmaintains at that institution.\n\nFor debt securities held in\nstreet name, Bank of America or BofA Finance, as the case may be, will recognize\nonly the intermediary banks, brokers, and other financial institutions in whose\nnames the debt securities are registered as the holders of those debt securities,\nand\nBank of America and/or BofA Finance, as applicable, will make all payments on\nthose debt securities, including deliveries of any property other than cash, to\nthem. These institutions pass along the payments they receive to their customers\nwho are\nthe beneficial owners, but only because they agree to do so in their customer\nagreements or because they are legally required to do so. Investors who hold debt\nsecurities in street name will be indirect owners, not holders, of those debt\nsecurities.\n\nLegal Holders\n\nBank of America\u0092s and BofA Finance\u0092s obligations, as well as the obligations of\nthe trustee under any indenture and the obligations,\nif any, of any other third parties employed by Bank of America and/or BofA Finance\nor the trustee, run only to the holders of the debt securities. Bank of America\nand BofA Finance do not have obligations to investors who hold beneficial\ninterests in\nglobal securities, who hold the debt securities in street name, or who hold the\ndebt securities by any other indirect means. This will be the case whether an\ninvestor chooses to be an indirect owner of a debt security or has no choice\nbecause the\ndebt securities are being issued only in global form. For example, once Bank of\nAmerica or BofA Finance, as applicable, makes a payment or gives a notice to the\nholder, it has no further responsibility for that payment or notice even if that\nholder\nis required, under agreements with depository participants or customers or by law,\nto pass it along to the indirect owners, but does not do so. Similarly, if Bank of\nAmerica or BofA Finance want to obtain the approval of the holders for any\npurpose,\nsuch as to amend the indenture for a series of debt securities or to relieve it of\nthe consequences of a default or of its obligation to comply with a particular\nprovision of an indenture, it would seek the approval only from the holders, and\nnot\nthe indirect owners, of the relevant debt securities. Whether and how the holders\ncontact the indirect owners is up to the holders.\n\nWhen\nBank of America or BofA Finance refers to \u0093you\u0094 in this prospectus, it means those\nwho invest in the debt securities being offered by this prospectus, whether they\nare the holders or only indirect owners of those debt securities. When Bank\nof America or BofA Finance refers to \u0093your debt securities\u0094 in this prospectus, it\nmeans the debt securities in which you will hold a direct or indirect interest.\n\n63\n\nSpecial Considerations for Indirect Owners If you hold debt securities through a\nbank, broker, or other financial institution, either in book-entry only form or in\nstreet name, you should check with your own institution to find out:\n                                                                    \n      how it handles payments on your debt securities and notices;  \n                                                                    \n                                           \n      whether it imposes fees or charges;  \n                                           \n                                                                           \n      how it would handle a request for the holders\u0092 consent, if required;  \n                                                                           \n                                                                                  \n      whether and how you can instruct it to send you the debt securities         \n      registered in your own name so you can be a                                 \n      holder, if that is permitted in the future;                                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      how it would exercise rights under the debt securities if there were a      \n      default or other event triggering the need                                  \n      for holders to act to protect their interests; and                          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      if the debt securities are in book-entry only form, how the depository\u0092s     \n      rules and procedures will affect                                            \n      these matters.                                                              \n                                                                                  \nDepositories for Global Securities Each debt security issued in book-entry only\nform will be represented by a global security that Bank of America or BofA Finance\ndeposits with and registers in the name of one or more financial institutions or\nclearing systems, which Bank of America or BofA Finance, as applicable, will\nselect, or their nominees. A financial institution or clearing system that is\nselected for this purpose is called the \u0093depository\u0094 for that debt security. A\ndebt security usually will have only one depository, but it may have more. Each\nseries of debt securities will have one or more of the following as the\ndepositories:\n                                                                                \n      The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York, which is known as \u0093DTC\u0094;  \n                                                                                \n                                                                                  \n      a financial institution holding the debt securities on behalf of Euroclear  \n      Bank SA/NV, which is known as                                               \n      \u0093Euroclear\u0094;                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      a financial institution holding the debt securities on behalf of            \n      Clearstream Banking S.A., Luxembourg, which is                              \n      known as \u0093Clearstream, Luxembourg\u0094; and                                       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      any other clearing system or financial institution identified in the        \n      applicable supplement.                                                      \n                                                                                  \nThe depositories named above also may be participants in one another\u0092s clearing\nsystems. For example, if DTC is the depository for a global security, investors\nmay hold beneficial interests in that security through Euroclear or Clearstream,\nLuxembourg as DTC participants. The depository or depositories for your debt\nsecurities will be named in the applicable supplement. If no depository is named,\nthe depository will be DTC. The Depository Trust Company The following is based on\ninformation made publicly available by DTC: Unless specified otherwise in the\napplicable supplement, DTC will act as securities depository for the securities.\nThe securities will be issued as fully-registered securities registered in the\nname 64\n\nof Cede & Co. (DTC\u0092s partnership nominee) or any other name as may be requested by\nan authorized representative of DTC. One fully-registered security certificate\nwill be issued for\neach issue of the securities, each in the aggregate principal amount of the issue,\nand will be deposited with DTC. If, however, the aggregate principal amount of any\nissue exceeds $500 million, one certificate will be issued with respect to\neach $500 million of principal amount, and an additional certificate will be\nissued with respect to any remaining principal amount of the issue. One or more\nglobal securities that represent multiple series of debt securities may also be\nissued.\n\nDTC, the world\u0092s largest securities depository, is a limited-purpose trust company\norganized under the New York Banking Law, a\n\u0093banking organization\u0094 within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of\nthe Federal Reserve System, a \u0093clearing corporation\u0094 within the meaning of the New\nYork Uniform Commercial Code, and a \u0093clearing agency\u0094\nregistered under Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(the \u0093Exchange Act\u0094). DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.5 million\nissues of U.S. and non-U.S.\nequity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments\n(from over 100 countries) that DTC\u0092s direct participants deposit with DTC. DTC\nalso facilitates the post-trade settlement among direct participants of sales and\nother securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic\ncomputerized book-entry transfers and pledges between direct participants\u0092\naccounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities\ncertificates. Direct\nparticipants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks,\ntrust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. DTC is a\nwholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository\nTrust & Clearing Corporation (\u0093DTCC\u0094). DTCC is the holding company for DTC,\nNational Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation,\nall of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users\nof its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to\nothers such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust\ncompanies, and clearing corporations that clear\nthrough or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, either\ndirectly or indirectly (\u0093indirect participants\u0094). The DTC rules applicable to its\nparticipants are on file with the SEC. More information about DTC can be found\nat www.dtcc.com. Information on that website is not included or incorporated by\nreference herein.\n\nPurchases of the securities under the\nDTC system must be made by or through direct participants, which will receive a\ncredit for the securities on DTC\u0092s records. The ownership interest of each actual\npurchaser of each security (\u0093beneficial owner\u0094) is in turn to be\nrecorded on the direct and indirect participants\u0092 records. Beneficial owners will\nnot receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial owners\nare, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the\ntransaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the direct or\nindirect participant through which the beneficial owner entered into the\ntransaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the securities are to be\naccomplished by\nentries made on the books of direct and indirect participants acting on behalf of\nbeneficial owners. Beneficial owners will not receive certificates representing\ntheir ownership interests in the securities, except in the event that use of the\nbook-entry system for the securities is discontinued.\n\nTo facilitate subsequent transfers, all securities deposited by direct\nparticipants\nwith DTC are registered in the name of DTC\u0092s partnership nominee, Cede & Co., or\nsuch other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The\ndeposit of securities with DTC and their registration in the name of\nCede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect any change in beneficial\nownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual beneficial owners of the securities;\nDTC\u0092s records reflect only the identity of the direct participants to whose\naccounts such securities are credited, which may or may not be the beneficial\nowners. The direct and indirect participants will remain responsible for keeping\naccount of their holdings on behalf of their customers.\n\n65\n\nConveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to direct participants, by\ndirect\nparticipants to indirect participants, and by direct and indirect participants to\nbeneficial owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any\nstatutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time.\nBeneficial\nowners of securities may wish to take certain steps to augment the transmission to\nthem of notices of significant events with respect to the securities, such as\nredemptions, tenders, defaults, and proposed amendments to the security documents.\nFor\nexample, beneficial owners of securities may wish to ascertain that the nominee\nholding the securities for its benefit has agreed to obtain and transmit notices\nto beneficial owners. In the alternative, beneficial owners may wish to provide\ntheir\nnames and addresses to the registrar and request that copies of notices be\nprovided directly to them.\n\nNeither DTC nor Cede & Co.\n(nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to securities unless\nauthorized by a direct participant in accordance with DTC\u0092s Money Market\nInstrument (\u0093MMI\u0094) procedures. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an\nomnibus proxy to Bank of America or BofA Finance, as applicable, as soon as\npossible after the record date. The omnibus proxy assigns Cede & Co.\u0092s consenting\nor voting rights to those direct participants to whose accounts the\nsecurities are credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to\nthe omnibus proxy).\n\nAny payments of principal, any\npremium, interest, or other amounts on the securities will be made to Cede & Co.,\nor any other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC.\nDTC\u0092s practice is to credit direct participants\u0092 accounts upon\nDTC\u0092s receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from us, on the\napplicable payment date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on\nDTC\u0092s records. Payments by participants to beneficial owners will be governed by\nstanding instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held\nfor the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in \u0093street name,\u0094 and\nwill be the responsibility of these participants and not of DTC or its\nnominee, us, the trustee, or any other agent or party, subject to any statutory or\nregulatory requirements that may be in effect from time to time. Payment of\ndividends or principal and any premium or interest to Cede & Co. (or any other\nnominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC) is the\nresponsibility of Bank of America or BofA Finance, as applicable. Disbursement of\nthe payments to direct participants is the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement\nof the\npayments to the beneficial owners is the responsibility of the direct or indirect\nparticipants.\n\nBank of America or BofA Finance, as\napplicable, will send any redemption notices to DTC. If less than all of the debt\nsecurities of a series are being redeemed, DTC\u0092s practice is to determine by lot\nthe amount of the interest of each direct participant in the issue to be\nredeemed.\n\nA beneficial owner shall give notice to elect to have its securities repurchased\nthrough the participant through which it holds\nits beneficial interest in the security to the applicable trustee or tender agent.\nThe beneficial owner shall effect delivery of its securities by causing the direct\nparticipant to transfer its interest in the securities on DTC\u0092s records. The\nrequirement for physical delivery of securities in connection with an optional\ntender or a mandatory purchase will be deemed satisfied when the ownership rights\nin the securities are transferred by the direct participant on DTC\u0092s records and\nfollowed by a book-entry credit of tendered securities to the applicable trustee\nor agent\u0092s DTC account.\n\nDTC may discontinue\nproviding its services as depository for the securities at any time by giving Bank\nof America and/or BofA Finance, as applicable, reasonable notice. If this occurs,\nand if a successor securities depository is not obtained, Bank of America and/or\nBofA Finance, as applicable, will print and deliver definitive securities.\n\nBank of America and/or BofA Finance, as applicable, may decide\nto discontinue use of the system of book-entry only transfers through DTC (or a\nsuccessor securities depository). In that\n\n66\n\nevent, Bank of America and/or BofA Finance, as applicable, will print and deliver\ndefinitive securities to DTC.\n\nThe information in this section concerning DTC and DTC\u0092s book-entry system has\nbeen obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but\nneither Bank of America nor BofA Finance takes responsibility for its accuracy.\n\nEuroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg\n\nEuroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg each hold securities for their customers and\nfacilitate the clearance and settlement of securities\ntransactions by electronic book-entry transfer between their respective account\nholders (each such account holder, a \u0093participant\u0094 and collectively, the\n\u0093participants\u0094). Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg provide various\nservices including safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of\ninternationally traded securities and securities lending and borrowing. Euroclear\nand Clearstream, Luxembourg also deal with domestic securities markets in several\ncountries\nthrough established depository and custodial relationships. Euroclear and\nClearstream, Luxembourg have established an electronic bridge between their two\nsystems across which their respective participants may settle trades with each\nother. Euroclear\nis incorporated under the laws of Belgium and Clearstream, Luxembourg is\nincorporated under the laws of Luxembourg.\n\nEuroclear and\nClearstream, Luxembourg customers are worldwide financial institutions, including\nunderwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing\ncorporations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg is\navailable\nto other institutions that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with\na participant of either system.\n\nThe address of\nEuroclear is Euroclear Bank SA/NV, 1 Boulevard du Roi Albert II, B-1210 Brussels\nand the address of Clearstream, Luxembourg is Clearstream Banking, 42 Avenue JF\nKennedy,\nL-1855, Luxembourg.\n\nEuroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg may be depositories for a global\nsecurity sold or traded outside the United States. In addition, if DTC is the\ndepository for a global security, Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg may hold\ninterests in the global security as participants in DTC. As long as any global\nsecurity is\nheld by Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg as depository, you may hold an\ninterest in the global security only through an organization that participates,\ndirectly or indirectly, in Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. If Euroclear or\nClearstream,\nLuxembourg is the depository for a global security and there is no depository in\nthe United States, you will not be able to hold interests in that global security\nthrough any securities clearing system in the United States.\n\nPayments, deliveries, transfers, exchanges, notices, and other matters relating to\nthe securities made through Euroclear or Clearstream,\nLuxembourg must comply with the rules and procedures of those clearing systems.\nThose clearing systems could change their rules and procedures at any time.\nNeither Bank of America nor BofA Finance has control over those clearing systems\nor their\nparticipants, and neither Bank of America nor BofA Finance takes responsibility\nfor their activities. Transactions between participants in Euroclear or\nClearstream, Luxembourg, on one hand, and participants in DTC, on the other hand,\nwhen DTC is the\ndepository, also would be subject to DTC\u0092s rules and procedures.\n\nInvestors will be able to make and receive through Euroclear and\nClearstream, Luxembourg payments, deliveries, transfers, exchanges, notices, and\nother transactions involving any securities\n\n67\n\nheld through those clearing systems only on days when those clearing systems are\nopen for business. Those clearing systems may not be open for business on days\nwhen banks, brokers, and other institutions are open for business in the United\nStates. In addition, because of time-zone differences, U.S. investors who hold\ntheir interests in the securities through these clearing systems and wish to\ntransfer their interests, or to receive or make a payment or delivery or exercise\nany other right with respect to their interests, on a particular day may find that\nthe transaction will not be effected until the next business day in Brussels or\nLuxembourg, as applicable. Thus, investors who wish to exercise rights that expire\non a particular day may need to act before the expiration date. In addition,\ninvestors who hold their interests through both DTC and Euroclear or Clearstream,\nLuxembourg may need to make special arrangements to finance any purchases or sales\nof their interests between the United States and European clearing systems, and\nthose transactions may settle later than would be the case for transactions within\none clearing system. The information in this section concerning Euroclear and\nClearstream, Luxembourg has been obtained from sources that are believed to be\nreliable, but neither Bank of America nor BofA Finance takes responsibility for\nits accuracy. Special Considerations for Global Securities As an indirect owner,\nan investor\u0092s rights relating to a global security will be governed by the account\nrules of the depository and those of the investor\u0092s financial institution or other\nintermediary through which it holds its interest (e.g., Euroclear or Clearstream,\nLuxembourg, if DTC is the depository), as well as general laws relating to\nsecurities transfers. Neither Bank of America nor BofA Finance recognizes this\ntype of investor or any intermediary as a holder of debt securities. Instead, Bank\nof America and BofA Finance deal only with the depository that holds the global\nsecurity. If debt securities are issued only in the form of a global security, an\ninvestor should be aware of the following:\n                                                                                  \n      an investor cannot cause the debt securities to be registered in his or     \n      her own name, and cannot obtain physical                                    \n      certificates for his or her interest in the debt securities, except in the  \n      limited circumstances described in the relevant debt securities or in the   \n      indenture governing the relevant securities;

The following discussion is\nnot exhaustive of all possible tax considerations. This summary is based upon the\nInternal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u0093Code\u0094), regulations\npromulgated under the Code by the U.S. Treasury Department (\u0093Treasury\u0094) (including\nproposed and temporary regulations), rulings, current administrative\ninterpretations and official pronouncements of the Internal Revenue Service (the\n\u0093IRS\u0094), and judicial decisions, all as currently in effect and all of which are\nsubject to differing interpretations or to change, possibly with retroactive\neffect. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court\nwould not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax consequences described\nbelow. This section constitutes the opinion of Sidley Austin LLP, United States\ntax counsel to Bank of America Corporation and BofA Finance LLC.\n\nThis summary is for general information only, and does not purport to discuss all\naspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be\nimportant to a particular holder in light of its investment or tax circumstances\nor to holders subject to special tax rules, such as: partnerships, or other\nentities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\nsubchapter S\ncorporations, any government (or instrumentality or agency thereof), banks,\nfinancial institutions, tax-exempt entities, insurance companies, regulated\ninvestment companies, real estate investment trusts,\ntrusts and estates, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities\nthat have elected to use the mark-to-market method of tax accounting for their\nsecurities,\npersons holding the debt securities as part of an integrated investment, including\na \u0093straddle,\u0094 \u0093hedge,\u0094 \u0093constructive sale,\u0094 or \u0093conversion transaction,\u0094 persons\n(other than\nNon-U.S. Holders) whose functional currency for tax purposes is not the U.S.\ndollar, and persons subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the Code.\nThis summary does not address special rules\napplicable to a person required for U.S. federal income tax purposes to conform\nthe timing of income accruals with respect to the debt securities to its financial\nstatements under Section 451(b) of the Code. This summary also does not include\nany description of the tax laws of any state or local governments, or of any\nforeign government, that may be applicable to a particular holder. This summary\nalso may not apply to all forms of debt securities that we may issue. If the tax\nconsequences associated with a particular form of debt security are different than\nthose described below, they will be described in the applicable supplement.\n\nAlthough certain of the debt securities will be issued by BofA Finance, they will\nbe treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as if they\nwere issued by Bank of America. Accordingly, throughout this discussion,\nreferences to \u0093we,\u0094 \u0093our\u0094 or \u0093us\u0094 are generally to Bank of America unless the\ncontext requires otherwise. References to \u0093debt\nsecurities\u0094 refer only to debt securities issued by Bank of America Corporation or\nBofA Finance LLC.\n\nThis discussion applies only to\nholders who, except as otherwise specifically noted, will purchase the debt\nsecurities offered in this prospectus upon original issuance and will hold such\nsecurities as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code, which\ngenerally means as property held for investment.\n\nYou should consult your own tax advisor concerning the U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences to you of acquiring, owning, and disposing of these securities, as\nwell as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local, foreign,\nor other tax jurisdiction and the possible effects of changes in U.S. federal or\nother tax laws.\n\n70\n\nAs used in this prospectus, the term \u0093U.S. Holder\u0094 means a beneficial owner of the\ndebt securities offered in this prospectus that is for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes:\n                                                              \n      a citizen or individual resident of the United States;  \n                                                              \n                                                                                  \n      a corporation (including an entity treated as a corporation for U.S.        \n      federal income tax purposes) created or                                     \n      organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any state of the  \n      United States or the District of Columbia; or                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      an estate or trust the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income    \n      taxation regardless of its source.                                          \n                                                                                  \nAs used in this prospectus, the term \u0093Non-U.S.Holder\u0094 is a beneficial owner that\nis not a U.S. Holder and is not a partnership for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes. If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes holds the debt securities offered in this prospectus, the U.S.\nfederal income tax treatment of a partner generally will depend upon the status of\nthe partner and the activities of the partnership and accordingly, this summary\ndoes not apply to partnerships. A partner of a partnership holding the debt\nsecurities should consult its own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income\ntax consequences to the partner of the acquisition, ownership, and disposition by\nthe partnership of the debt securities. General Consequences to U.S. Holders The\nfollowing is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences that\nwill apply to U.S. Holders of debt securities. Payment of Stated Interest. Except\nas described below in the case of interest on a debt security issued with original\nissue discount, as defined below under \u0093\u0097Original Issue Discount,\u0094 stated interest\non a debt security generally will be included in the income of a U.S. Holder as\ninterest income at the time it is accrued or is received in accordance with the\nU.S. Holder\u0092s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nand will be ordinary income. Original Issue Discount. Some of our debt securities\nmay be issued with original issue discount (\u0093OID\u0094). U.S. Holders of debt\nsecurities issued with OID, other than short-term debt securities with a maturity\nof one year or less from its date of issue (after taking into account the last\npossible date that the debt security could be outstanding under its terms), will\nbe subject to special tax accounting rules, as described in greater detail below.\nFor tax purposes, OID is the excess of the \u0093stated redemption price at maturity\u0094\nof a debt instrument over its \u0093issue price.\u0094 The \u0093stated redemption price at\nmaturity\u0094 of a debt security is the sum of all payments required to be made on the\ndebt security other than \u0093qualified stated interest\u0094 payments, as defined below.\nThe \u0093issue price\u0094 of a debt security is generally the first offering price to the\npublic at which a substantial amount of the issue was sold (ignoring sales to bond\nhouses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of\nunderwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers). The term \u0093qualified stated\ninterest\u0094 generally means stated interest that is unconditionally payable in cash\nor property (other than debt instruments of the issuer), or that is treated as\nconstructively received, at least annually at a single fixed rate or, under\ncertain circumstances, at a variable rate. If a debt security bears interest\nduring any accrual period at a rate below the rate applicable for the remaining\nterm of the debt security (for example, debt securities with teaser rates or\ninterest 71\n\nholidays), interest payable at the lowest stated fixed rate generally is qualified\nstated interest and the excess, if any, is included in the stated redemption price\nat maturity for purposes of\ndetermining whether the debt security will be issued with original issue discount.\n\nA U.S. Holder of a debt security with a maturity of\nmore than one year from its date of issue that has been issued with OID (an \u0093OID\ndebt security\u0094) is generally required to include any qualified stated interest\npayments in income as interest at the time such interest is accrued or is\nreceived in accordance with the U.S. Holder\u0092s regular accounting method for tax\npurposes, as described above under \u0093\u0097Payment of Stated Interest.\u0094 A U.S. Holder of\nan OID debt security is generally required to include in income\nthe sum of the daily accruals of the OID for the debt security for each day during\nthe taxable year (or portion of the taxable year) in which the U.S. Holder held\nthe OID debt security, regardless of such holder\u0092s regular method of accounting.\nThus, a U.S. Holder may be required to include OID in income in advance of the\nreceipt of some or all of the related cash payments. The daily portion is\ndetermined by allocating the OID for each day of the accrual period. An accrual\nperiod may be of\nany length and the accrual periods may even vary in length over the term of the\nOID debt security, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year\nand each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first day\nof an\naccrual period or on the final day of an accrual period. The amount of OID\nallocable to an accrual period is equal to the excess of: (1) the product of the\n\u0093adjusted issue price\u0094 of the OID debt security at the beginning of the\naccrual period and its yield to maturity (computed generally on a constant yield\nmethod and compounded at the end of each accrual period, taking into account the\nlength of the particular accrual period) over (2) the amount of any qualified\nstated interest allocable to the accrual period. OID allocable to a final accrual\nperiod is the difference between the amount payable at maturity, other than a\npayment of qualified stated interest, and the adjusted issue price at the\nbeginning of\nthe final accrual period. Special rules will apply for calculating OID for an\ninitial short accrual period. The \u0093adjusted issue price\u0094 of an OID debt security\nat the beginning of any accrual period is the sum of the issue price of the OID\ndebt security plus the amount of OID allocable to all prior accrual periods\nreduced by any payments received on the OID debt security that were not qualified\nstated interest. Under these rules, a U.S. Holder generally will have to include\nin income\nincreasingly greater amounts of OID in successive accrual periods.\n\nIf the excess of the \u0093stated redemption price at maturity\u0094\nof a debt security over its \u0093issue price\u0094 is less than 1/4 of 1% of the debt\ninstrument\u0092s stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the number of\ncomplete years from its issue date to its maturity, or weighted average maturity\nin the case of debt securities with more than one principal payment (\u0093de minimis\nOID\u0094), the debt security is not treated as issued with OID. The weighted average\nmaturity is the sum of the following amounts determined for each payment\nunder the debt security other than a payment of qualified stated interest: (i) the\nnumber of complete years from the issue date of the debt security until the\npayment is made, multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the\namount of the payment and the denominator of which is the debt security\u0092s stated\nredemption price at maturity. A U.S. Holder generally must include the de minimis\nOID in income at the time payments, other than qualified stated interest, on the\ndebt securities are made in proportion to the amount paid (unless the U.S. Holder\nmakes the election described below under \u0093\u0097Election to Treat All Interest as\nOriginal Issue Discount\u0094). Any amount of de minimis OID that is included in\nincome in this manner will be treated as capital gain.\n\nDebt Securities Subject to Early Redemption. A debt security subject to\nredemption prior to maturity may be subject to rules that differ from the general\nrules described above for purposes of determining the yield and maturity of the\ndebt security (which may affect whether the debt security is treated as issued\nwith OID\nand, if so, the timing of accrual of the OID). Under applicable Treasury\nregulations, we will generally be presumed to exercise an option to redeem a debt\nsecurity if the exercise of the option will lower the yield on the debt security.\nConversely,\na U.S. Holder will generally be presumed to exercise an option to require us to\nrepurchase a debt security if the\n\n72\n\nexercise of the option will increase the yield on the debt security. If such an\noption is not in fact exercised, the debt security will be treated, solely for\npurposes of calculating OID, as if\nit were redeemed and a new debt security were issued on the presumed exercise date\nfor an amount equal to the debt security\u0092s \u0093adjusted issue price\u0094 on that date.\n\nUnder these rules, if a debt security provides for a fixed rate of interest that\nincreases over the term of the debt security, the debt\nsecurity\u0092s issue price is not below its stated principal amount and we have an\noption to redeem the debt security for an amount equal to the stated principal\namount (plus accrued interest, if any) prior to the first date on which an\nincreased\nrate of interest is in effect, the yield on the debt security will be lowered if\nwe redeem the debt security before the initial increase in the interest rate, and\ntherefore our redemption option will be treated as exercised. Since the debt\nsecurity\nwill therefore be treated as if it were redeemed and reissued prior to the initial\nincrease in the interest rate, the debt security will not be treated as issued\nwith OID. If a debt security is not treated as issued with OID and if, contrary to\nthe\npresumption in the applicable Treasury regulations, we do not redeem the debt\nsecurity before the initial increase in the interest rate, the same analysis will\napply to all subsequent increases in the interest rate. This means that the debt\nsecurity\nthat is deemed reissued will be treated as redeemed prior to any subsequent\nincrease in the interest rate, and therefore as issued without OID. If such a\ndeemed reissuance occurs when the remaining term of the debt security is one year\nor less, it\nis possible that the debt security would thereafter be treated as a short-term\ndebt instrument. See \u0093\u0097Short-Term Debt Securities\u0094 below.\n\nAdditional rules applicable to debt securities with OID that are denominated in or\ndetermined by reference to a currency other than the U.S.\ndollar are described under \u0093\u0097Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Securities\u0094 below.\n\nVariable Rate Debt Securities. In the case of a debt security that is a variable\nrate debt security, special rules apply. A\ndebt security will qualify as a \u0093variable rate debt instrument\u0094 under Treasury\nregulations if (i) the debt security\u0092s issue price does not exceed the total\nnoncontingent principal payments by more than the lesser of: (a) 0.015\nmultiplied by the product of the total noncontingent principal payments and the\nnumber of complete years to maturity from the issue date, or (b) 15% of the total\nnoncontingent principal payments; and (ii) the debt security provides for stated\ninterest, compounded or paid at least annually, only at one or more qualified\nfloating rates, a single fixed rate and one or more qualified floating rates, a\nsingle objective rate, or a single fixed rate and a single objective rate that is\na\nqualified inverse floating rate.\n\nGenerally, a rate is a qualified floating rate if: (i) (a) variations in the value\nof the rate can\nreasonably be expected to measure contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly\nborrowed funds in the currency in which the debt security is denominated; or (b)\nthe rate is equal to such a rate multiplied by either a fixed multiple that is\ngreater than 0.65 but not more than 1.35 or a fixed multiple greater than 0.65 but\nnot more than 1.35 increased or decreased by a fixed rate, and (ii) the value of\nthe rate on any date during the term of the debt security is set no earlier than\nthree months prior to the first day on which that value is in effect and no later\nthan one year following that first day. If a debt security provides for two or\nmore qualified floating rates that are within 0.25 percentage points of each other\non\nthe issue date or can reasonably be expected to have approximately the same values\nthroughout the term of the debt security, the qualified floating rates together\nconstitute a single qualified floating rate. A debt security will not have a\nvariable\nrate that is a qualified floating rate, however, if the variable rate of interest\nis subject to one or more minimum or maximum rate floors or ceilings or one or\nmore governors limiting the amount of increase or decrease unless such floor,\nceiling,\nor governor is fixed throughout the term of the debt security or is not reasonably\nexpected as of the issue date to significantly affect the yield on the debt\nsecurity.\n\n73\n\nGenerally, an objective rate is a rate that is (i) not a qualified floating rate,\n(ii) is determined using a single fixed formula that is based on objective\nfinancial or economic information that is not within the control of the issuer or\na related party, and (iii) the value of the rate on any date during the term of\nthe debt security is set no earlier than three months prior to the first day on\nwhich that value is in effect and no later than one year following that first day.\nIf it is reasonably expected that the average value of the variable rate during\nthe\nfirst half of the term of a debt security will be either significantly less than\nor significantly greater than the average value of the rate during the final half\nof the term of the debt security, then the debt security will not have a variable\nrate\nthat is an objective rate. An objective rate is a qualified inverse floating rate\nif that rate is equal to a fixed rate minus a qualified floating rate and\nvariations in the rate can reasonably be expected to inversely reflect\ncontemporaneous\nvariations in the qualified floating rate.\n\nA debt security will also have a variable rate that is a single qualified floating\nrate or an\nobjective rate if interest on the debt security is stated at a fixed rate for an\ninitial period of one year or less followed by either a qualified floating rate or\nan objective rate for a subsequent period, and the value of the qualified floating\nrate or objective rate is intended to approximate the fixed rate (which is\npresumed if (a) the fixed rate and (b) the qualified floating rate or objective\nrate have values on the issue date of the debt security that do not differ by more\nthan 0.25 percentage points).\n\nIn the case of a debt security that provides for stated interest that is\nunconditionally payable at least\nannually at a variable rate that is a single qualified floating rate or objective\nrate, or one of those rates after a single fixed rate for an initial period of one\nyear or less (as described above), all stated interest on the debt security is\ntreated as qualified stated interest. In that case, both the debt security\u0092s yield\nto maturity and qualified stated interest will be determined, solely for purposes\nof calculating the accrual of OID, if any, as though the debt security will\nbear interest in all periods throughout its term (in the case of a single\nqualified floating rate or qualified inverse floating rate) at a fixed rate\ngenerally equal to the value of the rate on the issue date or, in the case of an\nobjective rate\n(other than a qualified inverse floating rate), the rate that reflects the yield\nto maturity that is reasonably expected for the debt security (the \u0093fixed rate\nsubstitute\u0094). A U.S. holder should then recognize OID, if any, that is\ncalculated based on the debt security\u0092s assumed yield to maturity. If the interest\nactually accrued or paid during an accrual period exceeds or is less than the\nassumed fixed interest, the qualified stated interest allocable to that period is\nincreased or decreased, as applicable.\n\nIf a debt security provides for stated interest at (x) multiple floating rates or\n(y) one or more floating rates in addition to a single fixed rate (other than a\nsingle fixed rate for an initial period of one year or less (as described above)),\nthe interest and OID accruals on the debt security must be determined by\n(i) determining a fixed rate substitute for each qualified floating rate or\nqualified inverse floating rate provided under the debt security (as described\nabove), (ii) constructing the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument, using the\nfixed rate\nsubstitutes, (iii) determining the amount of qualified stated interest and OID\nwith respect to the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument, and (iv) making\nappropriate adjustments to qualified stated interest or OID for actual variable\nrates\nduring the applicable accrual period.\n\nIn the case of a debt security that provides for stated interest either at one or\nmore qualified\nfloating rates or at a qualified inverse floating rate and also provides for\nstated interest at a single fixed rate other than at a single fixed rate for an\ninitial period (as described above), the interest and OID accruals on the debt\nsecurity must\nbe determined by using the method described above. However, the debt security will\nbe treated, for purposes of the first three steps of the determination, as if the\ndebt security had provided for a qualified floating rate, or a qualified inverse\nfloating rate, rather than the fixed rate. The qualified floating rate, or\nqualified inverse floating rate, that replaces the fixed rate must be such that\nthe fair market value of the debt security as of the issue date approximates the\nfair market\nvalue of an otherwise identical debt\n\n74\n\ninstrument that provides for the qualified floating rate, or qualified inverse\nfloating rate, rather than the fixed rate.\n\nAcquisition Premium. If a U.S. Holder purchases an OID debt security for an amount\ngreater than its adjusted issue price (as\ndetermined above) at the purchase date and less than or equal to the sum of all\namounts, other than qualified stated interest, payable on the OID debt security\nafter the purchase date, the excess is \u0093acquisition premium.\u0094 Under these\nrules, in general, the amount of OID which must be included in income for the debt\nsecurity for any taxable year (or any portion of a taxable year in which the debt\nsecurity is held) will be reduced (but not below zero) by the portion of the\nacquisition premium allocated to the period. The amount of acquisition premium\nallocated to each period is determined by multiplying the OID that otherwise would\nhave been included in income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the excess\nof the\ncost over the adjusted issue price of the OID debt security and the denominator of\nwhich is the excess of the OID debt security\u0092s stated redemption price at maturity\nover its adjusted issue price.\n\nAmortizable Bond Premium. If a U.S. Holder purchases a debt security (including an\nOID debt security) for an amount in\nexcess of the sum of all amounts payable on the debt security after the purchase\ndate, other than qualified stated interest, such holder will be considered to have\npurchased such debt security with \u0093amortizable bond premium\u0094 equal in\namount to such excess. A U.S. Holder may elect to amortize such premium as an\noffset to interest income using a constant yield method over the remaining term of\nthe debt security based on the U.S. Holder\u0092s yield to maturity with respect to the\ndebt security.\n\nA U.S. Holder generally may use the amortizable bond premium allocable to an\naccrual period to offset interest required to\nbe included in the U.S. Holder\u0092s income under its regular method of accounting\nwith respect to the debt security in that accrual period. If the amortizable bond\npremium allocable to an accrual period exceeds the amount of interest allocable to\nsuch accrual period, such excess would be allowed as a deduction for such accrual\nperiod, but only to the extent of the U.S. Holder\u0092s prior interest inclusions on\nthe debt security that have not been offset previously by bond premium. Any\nexcess is generally carried forward and allocable to the next accrual period.\n\nIf a debt security may be redeemed by us prior to its\nmaturity date, the amount of amortizable bond premium will be based on the amount\npayable at the applicable redemption date, but only if use of the redemption date\n(in lieu of the stated maturity date) results in a smaller amortizable bond\npremium\nfor the period ending on the redemption date.\n\nAn election to amortize bond premium applies to all taxable debt obligations held\nby the\nU.S. Holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election\napplies and thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder and may be revoked only with\nthe consent of the IRS. Generally, a holder may make an election to include in\nincome its\nentire return on a debt security (i.e., the excess of all remaining payments to be\nreceived on the debt security over the amount paid for the debt security by such\nholder) in accordance with a constant yield method based on the compounding of\ninterest, as discussed below under \u0093\u0097Election to Treat All Interest as Original\nIssue Discount.\u0094 If a holder makes such an election for a debt security with\namortizable bond premium, such election will result in a deemed election to\namortize bond premium for all of the holder\u0092s debt instruments with amortizable\nbond premium and may be revoked only with the permission of the IRS.\n\nA U.S. Holder that elects to amortize bond premium will be required to reduce its\ntax basis in the debt security by the amount of the premium\namortized during its holding period. OID debt securities purchased at a premium\nwill not be subject to the OID rules described above. If a U.S. Holder does not\nelect to amortize bond premium, the amount of bond premium will be included in its\ntax\nbasis in the debt security. Therefore, if a U.S. Holder does not elect to amortize\nbond\n\n75\n\npremium and it holds the debt security to maturity, the premium generally will be\ntreated as capital loss when the debt security matures.\n\nMarket Discount. If a U.S. Holder purchases a debt security for an amount that is\nless than its stated redemption price at\nmaturity, or, in the case of an OID debt security, its adjusted issue price, such\nholder will be considered to have purchased the debt security with \u0093market\ndiscount.\u0094 Any payment, other than qualified stated interest, or any gain on the\nsale, exchange, retirement, or other disposition of a debt security with market\ndiscount generally will be treated as ordinary interest income to the extent of\nthe market discount not previously included in income that accrued on the debt\nsecurity\nduring such holder\u0092s holding period. In general, market discount is treated as\naccruing on a straight-line basis over the term of the debt security unless an\nelection is made to accrue the market discount under a constant yield method. In\naddition, a U.S. Holder may be required to defer, until the maturity of the debt\nsecurity or its earlier disposition in a taxable transaction, the deduction of a\nportion of the interest paid on any indebtedness incurred or maintained to\npurchase or\ncarry the debt security in an amount not exceeding the accrued market discount on\nthe debt security.\n\nA U.S. Holder may elect to include\nmarket discount in income currently as it accrues (on either a straight-line or\nconstant yield basis), in lieu of treating a portion of any gain realized on a\nsale, exchange, retirement, or other disposition of the debt security as ordinary\nincome.\nIf an election is made to include market discount on a current basis, the interest\ndeduction deferral rule described above will not apply. If a U.S. Holder makes\nsuch an election, it will apply to all market discount debt instruments acquired\nby\nsuch holder on or after the first day of the first taxable year to which the\nelection applies. The election may not be revoked without the consent of the IRS.\nU.S. Holders should consult with their own tax advisors before making this\nelection.\n\nIf the difference between the stated redemption price at maturity of a debt\nsecurity or, in the case of an OID debt security, its adjusted\nissue price, and the amount paid for the debt security is less than 1/4 of 1% of\nthe debt instrument\u0092s stated redemption price at maturity or, in the case of an\nOID debt security, its adjusted issue price, multiplied by the number of remaining\ncomplete years to the debt security\u0092s maturity (\u0093de minimis market discount\u0094), the\ndebt security is not treated as issued with market discount.\n\nGenerally, a holder may make an election to include in income its entire return on\na debt security (i.e., the excess of all remaining payments\nto be received on the debt security over the amount paid for the debt security by\nsuch holder) in accordance with a constant yield method based on the compounding\nof interest, as discussed below under \u0093\u0097Election to Treat All Interest as\nOriginal Issue Discount.\u0094 If a holder makes such an election for a debt security\nwith market discount, the holder will be required to include market discount in\nincome currently as it accrues on a constant yield basis for all market discount\ndebt instruments acquired by such holder on or after the first day of the first\ntaxable year to which the election applies, and such election may be revoked only\nwith the permission of the IRS.\n\nElection to Treat All Interest as Original Issue Discount. A U.S. Holder may elect\nto include in income all interest that\naccrues on a debt security using the constant-yield method applicable to OID\ndescribed above, subject to certain limitations and exceptions. For purposes of\nthis election, interest includes stated interest, acquisition discount, OID, de\nminimis OID,\nmarket discount, de minimis market discount, and unstated interest, as adjusted by\nany amortizable bond premium or acquisition premium, each as described herein. If\nthis election is made for a debt security, then, to apply the constant-yield\nmethod:\n(i) the issue price of the debt security will equal its cost, (ii) the issue date\nof the debt security will be the date it was acquired, and (iii) no payments on\nthe debt security will be treated as payments of qualified stated\ninterest. A U.S. Holder must make this election for the taxable year in which the\ndebt security was acquired, and may not revoke the\n\n76\n\nelection without the consent of the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult with their\nown tax advisors before making this election.\n\nDebt Securities That Trade \u0093Flat.\u0094 We expect that certain debt securities will\ntrade in the secondary market with\naccrued interest. However, we may issue debt securities with terms and conditions\nthat would make it likely that such debt securities would trade \u0093flat\u0094 in the\nsecondary market, which means that upon a sale of a debt security a U.S. Holder\nwould not be paid a separate amount that reflects the accrued but unpaid interest\nwith respect to such debt security. Nevertheless, for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, a portion of the sales proceeds equal to the interest accrued with\nrespect to\nsuch debt security from the last interest payment date to the sale date must be\ntreated as interest income rather than as an amount realized upon the sale.\nAccordingly, a U.S. Holder that sells such a debt security between interest\npayment dates\nwould be required to recognize interest income and, in certain circumstances,\nwould recognize a capital loss (the deductibility of which is subject to\nlimitations) on the sale of the debt security. Concurrently, a U.S. Holder that\npurchases such a\ndebt security between interest payment dates would not be required to include in\nincome that portion of any interest payment received that is attributable to\ninterest that accrued prior to the purchase. Such payment is generally treated as\na return\nof capital which reduces the U.S. Holder\u0092s remaining cost basis in the debt\nsecurity. However, interest that accrues after the purchase date is included in\nincome in the year received or accrued (depending on the U.S. Holder\u0092s accounting\nmethod). U.S. Holders that purchase such debt securities between interest payment\ndates should consult their own tax advisors concerning such holder\u0092s adjusted tax\nbasis in the debt security and whether such debt securities should be treated as\nhaving been purchased with market discount, as described above.\n\nShort-Term Debt Securities. Some of our debt securities\nmay be issued with maturities of one year or less from the date of issue (after\ntaking into account the last possible date that the debt security could be\noutstanding under its terms), which we refer to as short-term debt securities.\nTreasury\nregulations provide that no payments of interest on a short-term debt security are\ntreated as qualified stated interest. Accordingly, in determining the amount of\ndiscount on a short-term debt security, all interest payments, including stated\ninterest, are included in the short-term debt security\u0092s stated redemption price\nat maturity.\n\nIn general, individual and certain\nother U.S. Holders using the cash basis method of tax accounting are not required\nto include accrued discount on short-term debt securities in income currently\nunless they elect to do so, but they are required to include any stated interest\nin\nincome as the interest is received, except to the extent already included under\nsuch election. However, a cash basis U.S. Holder will be required to treat any\ngain realized on a sale, exchange, or retirement of the short-term debt security\nas\nordinary income to the extent such gain does not exceed the discount accrued with\nrespect to the short-term debt security, which will be determined on a straight-\nline basis unless the holder makes an election to accrue the discount under the\nconstant-yield method, through the date of sale, exchange or retirement. Any gain\nin excess of this amount will be treated as short-term capital gain. Any loss\nrecognized will be treated as a capital loss. In addition, a cash basis U.S.\nHolder that\ndoes not elect to include accrued discount in income currently will not be allowed\nto deduct any of the interest paid or accrued on any indebtedness incurred or\nmaintained to purchase or carry a short-term debt security (in an amount not\nexceeding\nthe deferred income), but instead will be required to defer deductions for such\ninterest until the deferred income is realized upon the maturity of the short-term\ndebt security or its earlier disposition in a taxable transaction. Notwithstanding\nthe\nforegoing, a cash-basis U.S. Holder of a short-term debt security may elect to\ninclude accrued discount in income on a current basis. If this election is made,\nthe limitation on the deductibility of interest described above will not apply.\n\nA U.S. Holder using the accrual method of tax accounting generally will be\nrequired to include accrued discount on a short-term debt security\nin income on a current basis, on either a straight-\n\n77\n\nline basis or, at the election of the holder, under the constant-yield method\nbased on daily compounding.\n\nRegardless of whether a U.S. Holder is a cash-basis or accrual-basis holder it may\nelect to include accrued \u0093acquisition discount\u0094\nwith respect to a short-term debt security in income on a current basis.\nAcquisition discount is the excess of the remaining redemption amount of the\nshort-term debt security at the time of acquisition over the purchase price.\nAcquisition discount\nwill be treated as accruing on a straight-line basis or, at the election of the\nholder, under a constant yield method based on daily compounding. If a U.S. Holder\nelects to include accrued acquisition discount in income, the rules for including\nOID\nwill not apply. In addition, the market discount rules described above will not\napply to short-term debt securities.\n\nSale, Exchange, or Retirement of Debt Securities. Upon the sale, exchange,\nretirement, or other disposition of a debt security, a U.S. Holder will recognize\ngain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the sale,\nexchange,\nretirement, or other disposition (less an amount equal to any accrued interest not\npreviously included in income if the debt security is disposed of between interest\npayment dates, which will be included in income as interest income for U.S.\nfederal\nincome tax purposes) and the U.S. Holder\u0092s adjusted tax basis in the debt\nsecurity. The amount realized by the U.S. Holder will include the amount of any\ncash and the fair market value of any other property received for the debt\nsecurity. A\nU.S. Holder\u0092s adjusted tax basis in a debt security generally will be the cost of\nthe debt security to such U.S. Holder, increased by any OID, market discount, de\nminimis OID, de minimis market discount, or any discount with respect to a\nshort-term debt security previously included in income with respect to the debt\nsecurity, and decreased by the amount of any premium previously amortized to\nreduce interest on the debt security and the amount of any payment (other than a\npayment of\nqualified stated interest) received in respect of the debt security.\n\nExcept as discussed above with respect to market discount, or as\ndescribed below with respect to debt securities subject to contingencies and\nNon-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Securities, gain or loss realized on the sale,\nexchange, retirement, or other disposition of a debt\nsecurity generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain\nor loss if the debt security has been held for more than one year. Net long-term\ncapital gain recognized by an individual U.S. Holder is generally taxed at\npreferential rates. The ability of U.S. Holders to deduct capital losses is\nsubject to limitations under the Code.\n\nReopenings. Treasury regulations provide specific rules regarding whether\nadditional debt instruments issued in a reopening\nwill be considered part of the same issue, with the same issue price and yield to\nmaturity, as the original debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nExcept as provided otherwise in an applicable supplement, we expect that\nadditional\ndebt securities issued by us in any reopening will be issued such that they will\nbe considered part of the original issuance to which they relate.\n\nDebt Securities Subject to Contingencies. Certain of the debt securities may\nprovide for an alternative payment schedule or\nschedules applicable upon the occurrence of a contingency or contingencies, other\nthan a remote or incidental contingency, whether such contingency relates to\npayments of interest or of principal. In addition, subject to the discussion above\nunder\n\u0093\u0097Debt Securities Subject to Early Redemption,\u0094 certain of the debt securities may\ncontain provisions permitting them to be redeemed prior to their stated maturity\nat our option and/or at the option of the holder. Debt securities\ncontaining these features may be characterized as \u0093contingent payment debt\ninstruments\u0094 for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nIf the debt securities are properly characterized as contingent payment debt\ninstruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such debt\nsecurities generally will be subject to Treasury\n\n78\n\nregulations governing contingent payment debt instruments. Under those\nregulations, a U.S. Holder will be required to report OID based on a \u0093comparable\nyield\u0094 and a \u0093projected\npayment schedule,\u0094 both as described below, established by us for determining\ninterest accruals and adjustments with respect to the debt security. A U.S. Holder\nthat does not use the \u0093comparable yield\u0094 and follow the \u0093projected\npayment schedule\u0094 to calculate its OID on a debt security must timely disclose and\njustify the use of other estimates to the IRS. No payments on a contingent payment\ndebt instrument are treated as qualified stated interest.\n\nA \u0093comparable yield\u0094 with respect to a debt security generally is the yield at\nwhich we could issue a fixed-rate debt instrument\nwith terms similar to those of the debt security (taking into account for this\npurpose the level of subordination, term, timing of payments, and general market\nconditions, but ignoring any adjustments for liquidity or the riskiness of the\ncontingencies with respect to the debt security). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a\ncomparable yield must not be less than the applicable U.S. federal rate based on\nthe overall maturity of the debt security.\n\nA \u0093projected payment schedule\u0094 with respect to a debt security generally is a\nseries of projected payments, the amount and timing of\nwhich would produce a yield to maturity on that debt security equal to the\ncomparable yield. This projected payment schedule will consist of a projection for\ntax purposes of each non-contingent and contingent\npayment.\n\nBased on the comparable yield and the projected payment schedule of the debt\nsecurities, a U.S. Holder of a debt security\n(regardless of its tax accounting method) generally will be required to accrue as\nOID the sum of the daily portions of interest on the debt security for each day in\nthe taxable year on which the holder held the debt security, adjusted upward or\ndownward to reflect the difference, if any, between the actual and projected\namount of any contingent payments on the debt security, as set forth below. The\ndaily portions of interest for a debt security are determined by allocating to\neach day in\nan accrual period the ratable portion of interest on the debt security that\naccrues in the accrual period. The amount of interest on the debt security that\naccrues in an accrual period is the product of the comparable yield on the debt\nsecurity\n(adjusted to reflect the length of the accrual period) and the adjusted issue\nprice of the debt security at the beginning of the accrual period. The adjusted\nissue price of a debt security at the beginning of the first accrual period will\nequal its\nissue price (as described above). For any subsequent accrual period, the adjusted\nissue price will be (i) the sum of the issue price of the debt security and any\ninterest previously accrued on the debt security by a holder (without regard to\nany positive or negative adjustments, described below) minus (ii) the amount of\nany projected payments on the debt security for previous accrual periods.\n\nA U.S. Holder of a debt security generally will be required to include in income\nOID in excess of actual cash payments received for certain\ntaxable years. In addition to the accrued OID, a U.S. Holder will be required to\nrecognize interest income equal to the amount of any positive adjustment for a\ndebt security for the taxable year in which a contingent payment is paid\n(including a\npayment of interest at maturity). A positive adjustment is the excess of actual\npayments in respect of contingent payments over the projected amount of contingent\npayments. A U.S. Holder also will be required to account for any \u0093negative\nadjustment\u0094 for a taxable year in which a contingent payment is paid. A negative\nadjustment is the excess of the projected amounts of contingent payments over\nactual payments in respect of the contingent payments. A net negative adjustment\nis\nthe amount by which total negative adjustments in a taxable year exceed total\npositive adjustments in such taxable year. A net negative adjustment (i) will\nfirst reduce the amount of interest for the debt security that a U.S. Holder would\notherwise be required to include in income in the taxable year, and (ii) to the\nextent of any excess, will result in an ordinary loss equal to that portion of the\nexcess as does not exceed the excess of (a) the amount of all previous\ninterest inclusions under the debt security over (b) the total amount of the U.S.\nHolder\u0092s net negative adjustments treated as ordinary loss on the debt security in\nprior taxable years. A net negative adjustment is not treated as a\n\n79\n\ndeductible miscellaneous itemized deduction under Section 67 of the Code. Any net\nnegative adjustment in excess of the amounts described above in (i) and (ii) will\nbe carried forward to\noffset future interest income on the debt security or to reduce the amount\nrealized on a sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of the debt\nsecurity.\n\nIf a contingent payment becomes fixed (within the meaning of applicable Treasury\nregulations) more than six months before its due date, a\npositive or negative adjustment, as appropriate, is made to reflect the difference\nbetween the present value of the amount that is fixed and the present value of the\nprojected amount. The present value of each amount is determined by discounting\nthe\namount from the date the payment is due to the date the payment becomes fixed,\nusing a discount rate equal to the comparable yield. If all contingent payments on\nthe debt security become fixed, substantially contemporaneously, applicable\nTreasury\nregulations provide that, with regard to contingent payments that become fixed on\na day that is more than six months before their due date, U.S. Holders should take\ninto account positive or negative adjustments in respect of such contingent\npayments\nover the period to which they relate in a reasonable manner. For purposes of the\npreceding sentence, a payment (including an amount payable at maturity) will be\ntreated as fixed if (and when) all remaining contingencies with respect to it are\nremote\nor incidental within the meaning of the applicable Treasury regulations. A U.S.\nHolder\u0092s tax basis in the debt security and the character of any gain or loss on\nthe sale of the debt security will also be affected. U.S. Holders should consult\ntheir tax advisors concerning the application of these special rules, including as\nto what would be a \u0093reasonable manner\u0094 in their particular situation.\n\nWe expect that the applicable supplement will include a table that sets forth the\nfollowing information with respect to the principal amount\nof the debt securities for each of the applicable accrual periods through the\nmaturity date of the debt securities: (i) the amount of interest deemed to have\naccrued during the accrual period, and (ii) the total amount of interest deemed\nto have accrued from the original issue date through the end of the accrual\nperiod. The table will be based upon a projected payment schedule and a comparable\nyield. The comparable yield will be determined based upon market conditions as of\nthe date\nof the applicable supplement. The comparable yield is likely to change between the\ndate of any preliminary supplement and the date of the related final supplement.\nTherefore, the projected payment schedule included in any preliminary supplement\nwill\nbe subject to change. We will determine the actual projected payment schedule and\nthe actual comparable yield on the pricing date. Any tax accrual table included in\na preliminary supplement will be revised, and the revised table will be set forth\nin\nthe final supplement prepared in connection with the initial sale of the debt\nsecurities.\n\nUpon a sale, exchange, retirement, or other\ndisposition of a debt security prior to maturity, a U.S. Holder generally will\nrecognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized\non the sale, exchange, retirement, or other disposition and that holder\u0092s tax\nbasis in the debt security. A U.S. Holder\u0092s tax basis in a debt security generally\nwill equal the cost of that debt security, increased by the amount of OID\npreviously accrued by the holder for that debt security (without regard to any\npositive\nor negative adjustments) and reduced by any projected payments for previous\nperiods on the debt securities. A U.S. Holder generally will treat any gain as\ninterest income, and will treat any loss as ordinary loss to the extent of the\nexcess of\nprevious interest inclusions over the total negative adjustments previously taken\ninto account as ordinary losses, and the balance as long-term or short-term\ncapital loss depending upon the U.S. Holder\u0092s holding period for the debt\nsecurity.\nThe deductibility of capital losses by a U.S. Holder is subject to limitations.\n\nU.S. Holders considering the purchase of debt securities\nwith these features should carefully examine the applicable supplement and should\nconsult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences\nto a U.S. Holder of the purchase, ownership and disposition of such debt\nsecurities.\n\n80\n\nNon-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Securities. Additional considerations apply to a\nU.S. Holder of a debt security payable in a currency other than U.S. dollars\n(\u0093foreign currency\u0094).\n\nWe refer to these securities as \u0093Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Securities.\u0094 In\nthe case\nof payments of stated interest, U.S. Holders using the cash method of accounting\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes will be required to include in income the\nU.S. dollar value of the foreign currency payment on a\nNon-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Security (other than OID or market discount) when\nthe payment of interest is received. The U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency\npayment is determined by translating the\nforeign currency received at the spot rate for such foreign currency on the date\nthe payment is received, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to\nU.S. dollars at that time. The U.S. dollar value will be the U.S. Holder\u0092s tax\nbasis in the foreign currency received. The U.S. Holder will not recognize foreign\ncurrency exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment.\n\nU.S. Holders using the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar\nvalue of the amount of interest income that has accrued and is otherwise required\nto be taken into account with respect to a Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt\nSecurity during an accrual period. The U.S. dollar\nvalue of the accrued income will be determined by translating the income at the\naverage rate of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual\nperiod that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period\nwithin the\ntaxable year. A U.S. Holder may elect, however, to translate the accrued interest\nincome using the exchange rate on the last day of the accrual period or, with\nrespect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, using the exchange rate\non the\nlast day of the taxable year. If the last day of an accrual period is within five\nbusiness days of the date of receipt of the accrued interest, a U.S. Holder may\ntranslate the interest using the exchange rate on the date of receipt. The above\nelection will apply to all other debt obligations held by the U.S. Holder and the\nelection may not be changed without the consent of the IRS. U.S. Holders should\nconsult their own tax advisors before making the above election. Upon receipt of\nan\ninterest payment (including, upon the sale of the debt security, the receipt of\nproceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued interest previously\nincluded in income), the holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or\nloss in an\namount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of such payment\n(determined by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate for such\nforeign currency on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value\nof the\ninterest income previously included in income with respect to such payment. This\ngain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss.\n\nOID on a debt security that is also a Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Security\nwill be determined for\nany accrual period in the applicable foreign currency and then translated into\nU.S. dollars, in the same manner as interest income accrued by a holder on the\naccrual basis, as described above (regardless of such holder\u0092s regular method of\ntax\naccounting). A U.S. Holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss\nwhen OID is paid (including, upon the sale of such debt security, the receipt of\nproceeds which include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income)\nto\nthe extent of the difference between the U.S. dollar value of such payment\n(determined by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate for such\nforeign currency on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value\nof the\naccrued OID (determined in the same manner as for accrued interest). For these\npurposes, all receipts on a debt security will be viewed: (i) first, as the\nreceipt of any stated interest payment called for under the terms of the debt\nsecurity,\n(ii) second, as receipts of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with\npayments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first, and (iii) third,\nas the receipt of principal.\n\nThe amount of market discount on Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Securities\nincludible in income\ngenerally will be determined by translating the market discount determined in the\nforeign currency into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date the Non-U.S.\nDollar Denominated Debt\n\n81\n\nSecurity is retired or otherwise disposed of. If a U.S. Holder elected to accrue\nmarket discount currently, then the amount which accrues is determined in the\nforeign currency and then translated\ninto U.S. dollars on the basis of the average exchange rate in effect during such\naccrual period. A U.S. Holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or\nloss with respect to market discount which is accrued currently using the approach\napplicable to the accrual of interest income as described above.\n\nAmortizable bond premium on a\nNon-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Security will be computed in the applicable\nforeign currency. If a U.S. Holder elected to amortize the premium, the\namortizable bond premium will reduce interest income in the\napplicable foreign currency. At the time bond premium is amortized, foreign\ncurrency exchange gain or loss will be realized based on the difference between\nspot rates at such time and the time of acquisition of the\nNon-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Security. If a U.S. Holder does not elect to\namortize bond premium, the bond premium computed in the foreign currency must be\ntranslated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on\nthe maturity date and such bond premium will constitute a capital loss which may\nbe offset or eliminated by foreign currency exchange gain.\n\nIf a U.S. Holder purchases a Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Security with\npreviously owned foreign\ncurrency, foreign currency exchange gain or loss (which will be treated as\nordinary income or loss) will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference,\nif any, between the tax basis in the foreign currency and the U.S. dollar fair\nmarket value\nof the foreign currency used to purchase the Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt\nSecurity, determined on the date of purchase.\n\nUpon the sale, exchange, retirement, or other taxable disposition of a Non-U.S.\nDollar Denominated\nDebt Security, a U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference\nbetween the amount realized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, or other\ndisposition (less an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid interest not\npreviously included\nin income, which will be treated as a payment of interest for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes) and the adjusted tax basis in the Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt\nSecurity. The adjusted tax basis in a Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Security\nwill equal the amount paid for the Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Security,\nincreased by the amounts of any market discount or OID\npreviously included in income with respect to the Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt\nSecurity and reduced by any amortized acquisition or other premium and any\nprincipal payments received in respect of the Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt\nSecurity. The amount of any payment in or adjustments measured by foreign currency\nwill be equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency on the date of the\npurchase or\nadjustment. The amount realized will be based on the U.S. dollar value of the\nforeign currency on the date the payment is received or the Non-U.S. Dollar\nDenominated Debt Security is disposed of (or deemed\ndisposed of as a result of a material change in the terms of the debt security).\nIf, however, a Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Security is traded on an\nestablished securities market and the U.S. Holder uses\nthe cash basis method of tax accounting, the U.S. dollar value of the amount\nrealized will be determined by translating the foreign currency payment at the\nspot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase or sale. A U.S.\nHolder that uses\nthe accrual basis method of tax accounting may elect the same treatment with\nrespect to the purchase and sale of Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Securities\ntraded on an established securities market, provided\nthat the election is applied consistently. This election cannot be changed without\nthe consent of the IRS.\n\nExcept with respect to market\ndiscount as discussed above, and the foreign currency rules discussed below, gain\nor loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, or other taxable\ndisposition of a Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt\nSecurity will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss\nif at the time of sale, exchange, retirement, or other disposition, the Non-U.S.\nDollar Denominated Debt Security has been held\nfor more than one year. Net long-term\n\n82\n\ncapital gain recognized by an individual U.S. Holder is generally taxed at\npreferential rates. The ability of U.S. Holders to deduct capital losses is\nsubject to limitations under the Code.\n\nA portion of the gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of a Non-U.S.\nDollar Denominated\nDebt Security may be treated as foreign currency exchange gain or loss. Foreign\ncurrency exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss. For\nthese purposes, the principal amount of the\nNon-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Security is the purchase price for the Non-U.S.\nDollar Denominated Debt Security calculated in the foreign currency on the date of\npurchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the\ndifference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on\nthe date of the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of the Non-U.S.\nDollar Denominated Debt Security and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal\namount determined on the date the Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Security was\npurchased. The amount of foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be limited to\nthe amount of overall gain or loss realized on the disposition of the Non-U.S.\nDollar Denominated Debt Security.\n\nThe tax basis in foreign currency received as interest on a Non-U.S. Dollar\nDenominated Debt Security\nwill be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency determined at the spot rate\nin effect on the date the foreign currency is received. The tax basis in foreign\ncurrency received on the sale, exchange, retirement, or other disposition of a\nNon-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Security will be equal to the U.S. dollar value\nof the foreign currency, determined at the time of the sale, exchange, retirement\nor other disposition. As discussed above, if the Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt\nSecurities are traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S.\nHolder (or, upon election, an accrual basis U.S. Holder) will determine the U.S.\ndollar value of the\nforeign currency by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate of\nexchange on the settlement date of the sale, exchange, retirement, or other\ndisposition. Accordingly, in such case, no foreign currency exchange gain or loss\nwill\nresult from currency fluctuations between the trade date and settlement date of a\nsale, exchange, retirement, or other disposition. Any gain or loss recognized on a\nsale, exchange, retirement, or other disposition of foreign currency (including\nits\nexchange for U.S. dollars or its use to purchase debt securities) will be ordinary\nincome or loss.\n\nSpecial rules may apply to Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Securities that are\nalso treated as contingent payment debt instruments. For the special treatment, if\nany, of Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated\nDebt Securities that are also contingent payment debt securities, see the\napplicable supplement.\n\nAdditional Medicare Tax on Unearned Income. Certain U.S. Holders, including\nindividuals, estates and trusts, are subject to an additional 3.8% Medicare tax on\nunearned income. For individual U.S. Holders, the additional Medicare tax applies\nto the lesser of (i)\n\u0093net investment income\u0094 or (ii) the excess of \u0093modified adjusted gross income\u0094\nover $200,000 ($250,000 if married and filing jointly or $125,000 if married and\nfiling separately). \u0093Net investment income\u0094 generally\nequals the taxpayer\u0092s gross investment income reduced by the deductions that are\nallocable to such income. Investment income generally includes passive income such\nas interest and capital gains. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax\nadvisors regarding the implications of the additional Medicare tax resulting from\nan investment in the debt securities.\n\nConsequences to Non-U.S.Holders\n\nThe following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences\nthat will apply to\nNon-U.S. Holders of debt securities. Non-U.S. Holders should consult their own tax\nadvisors regarding the U.S. and non-U.S. tax\nconsiderations of acquiring, holding, and disposing of debt securities.\n\n83\n\nPayments of Interest. Under current U.S. federal income tax law and subject to the\ndiscussions below concerning backup withholding and The Foreign Account Tax\nCompliance Act (\u0093FATCA\u0094), principal (and premium, if any) and interest payments,\nincluding any OID, that are received from us or our agent and that are not\neffectively connected with the conduct by the Non-U.S.Holder of a trade or\nbusiness within the United States, or a permanent establishment maintained in the\nUnited States if certain tax treaties apply, generally will not be subject to U.S.\nfederal income or withholding tax except as provided below. Interest, including\nany OID, may be subject to a 30% withholding tax (or less under an applicable\ntreaty, if any) if:\n                                                                                 \n      a Non-U.S. Holder actually or constructively owns 10% or more of the       \n      total combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote;  \n                                                                                 \n                                                                                  \n      a Non-U.S. Holder is a \u0093controlled foreign corporation\u0094 for                   \n      U.S. federal income tax purposes that is related to us (directly or         \n      indirectly) through stock ownership;                                        \n                                                                                  \n                                                                              \n      a Non-U.S. Holder is a bank extending credit under a loan agreement in  \n      the ordinary course of its trade or business;                           \n                                                                              \n                                                                                  \n      the interest payments on the debt security are determined by reference to   \n      the income, profits, changes in the                                         \n      value of property or other attributes of the debtor or a related party      \n      (other than payments that are based on the value of a security or index of  \n      securities that are, and will continue to be, actively traded within the    \n      meaning of                                                                  \n      Section\u00a01092(d) of the Code, and that are not nor will be a \u0093United States   \n      real property interest\u0094 as described in Section\u00a0897(c)(1) or 897(g) of the   \n      Code); or                                                                   \n                                                                                  \n                                                                           \n      the Non-U.S. Holder does not satisfy the certification requirements  \n      described below.                                                     \n                                                                           \nA Non-U.S.Holder generally will satisfy the certification requirements if either:\n(A) the Non-U.S.Holder certifies to the applicable withholding agent, under\npenalties of perjury, that it is a non-UnitedStates person and provides its name\nand address (which certification may generally be made on an IRS Form W-8BENor\nW-8BEN-E,or a successor form), or (B) a securities clearing organization, bank, or\nother financial institution that holds customer securities in the ordinary course\nof its trade or business (a \u0093financial institution\u0094) and holds the debt security\ncertifies to the applicable withholding agent under penalties of perjury that\neither it or another financial institution has received the required statement\nfrom the Non-U.S.Holder certifying that it is a non-UnitedStates person and\nfurnishes us with a copy of the statement. Payments not meeting the requirements\nset forth above and thus subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax may\nnevertheless be exempt from withholding (or subject to withholding at a reduced\nrate) if the Non-U.S.Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a\nproperly executed IRS Form W-8BENor W-8BEN-E(or successor form) claiming an\nexemption from, or reduction in, withholding under the benefit of a tax treaty, or\nIRS Form W-8ECI(or other applicable form) stating that interest paid on the debt\nsecurities is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected\nwith the conduct of a trade or business within the United States as discussed\nbelow. To claim benefits under an income tax treaty, a Non-U.S.Holder must obtain\na taxpayer identification number and certify as to its eligibility under the\nappropriate treaty\u0092s limitations on benefits article. In addition, special rules\nmay apply to claims for treaty benefits made by Non-U.S.Holders that are entities\nrather than individuals. A Non-U.S.Holder that is eligible for a reduced rate of\nU.S. federal withholding tax pursuant to an income tax treaty may obtain a refund\nof any excess amounts withheld by filing an appropriate claim for refund with the\nIRS. Sale, Exchange, or Retirement of Debt Securities. A Non-U.S. Holdergenerally\nwill not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on any capital gain\nor market discount realized on 84\n\nthe sale, exchange, retirement, or other disposition of debt securities, provided\nthat: (a) the gain is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or\nbusiness within the United\nStates, or a permanent establishment maintained in the United States if certain\ntax treaties apply, (b) in the case of a Non-U.S. Holder that is an individual,\nthe\nNon-U.S. Holder is not present in the United States for 183 days or more in the\ntaxable year of the sale, exchange, or other disposition of the debt security, and\n(c) the\nNon-U.S. Holder is not subject to tax pursuant to certain provisions of U.S.\nfederal income tax law applicable to certain expatriates. An individual Non-U.S.\nHolder who\nis present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of sale,\nexchange, or other disposition of a debt security, provided that certain other\nconditions are met, will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% on\nthe\ngain realized on the sale, exchange, or other disposition of such debt security.\n\nIncome Effectively Connected with a Trade or Business within the United States. If\na Non-U.S. Holder of a debt security is engaged in the conduct of a trade or\nbusiness within the United States and if interest (including any OID) on the debt\nsecurity, or gain realized on the sale, exchange, or other disposition of the debt\nsecurity, is effectively connected with the conduct of such trade or business\n(and, if certain tax treaties apply, is attributable to a permanent establishment\nmaintained by the Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), the Non-U.S. Holder,\nalthough exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax (provided that the certification\nrequirements discussed above are satisfied), generally will be subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax on such interest (including any OID) or gain on a net income\nbasis in the same manner as if it were a U.S. Holder.\nNon-U.S. Holders should read the material under the heading \u0093\u0097Consequences to U.S.\nHolders\u0094 for a description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of\nacquiring, owning, and disposing of\ndebt securities. In addition, if such Non-U.S. Holder is a foreign corporation, it\nmay also be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or such lower rate\nprovided by an applicable U.S. income tax treaty)\nof a portion of its earnings and profits for the taxable year that are effectively\nconnected with its conduct of a trade or business in the United States, subject to\ncertain adjustments.\n\nDividend Equivalent Payments. A \u0093dividend equivalent\u0094 payment is treated as a\ndividend from sources within the\nUnited States and such payments generally would be subject to a 30% U.S.\nwithholding tax if paid to a Non-U.S. Holder. Under Treasury regulations, payments\n(including deemed payments) with respect to\nequity-linked instruments (\u0093ELIs\u0094) that are \u0093specified ELIs\u0094 may be treated as\ndividend equivalents if such specified ELIs reference an interest in an\n\u0093underlying security,\u0094 which is generally any interest in an entity\ntaxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if a payment with\nrespect to such interest could give rise to a U.S. source dividend. IRS guidance\nprovides that withholding on dividend equivalent payments will not apply to\nspecified\nELIs that are not delta-one instruments and that are issued before January 1,\n2025. However, it is possible that the debt securities could be treated as deemed\nreissued for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes upon the occurrence of certain events affecting a reference asset or the\ndebt securities, and following such occurrence the debt securities could be\ntreated as subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments. Non-U.S.\nHolders that enter, or have entered, into other transactions in respect of the\nreference assets or the debt securities should consult their tax advisors as to\nthe application of the dividend equivalent\nwithholding tax in the context of the debt securities and their other\ntransactions. If any payments are treated as dividend equivalents subject to\nwithholding, we (or the applicable paying agent) would be entitled to withhold\ntaxes without being\nrequired to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts so withheld.\n\nConvertible, Renewable, Extendible, Indexed, and Other Debt Securities\n\nSpecial U.S. federal income tax rules are applicable to certain other debt\nsecurities, including contingent Non-U.S. Dollar Denominated Debt Securities, debt\nsecurities that may be convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for our\ncommon or preferred stock or other securities or debt or\n\n85\n\nequity securities of one or more third parties, debt securities the payments on\nwhich are determined or partially determined by reference to any index and other\ndebt securities that are subject\nto the rules governing contingent payment obligations, any renewable and\nextendible debt securities and any debt securities providing for the periodic\npayment of principal over the life of the debt security. The material U.S. federal\nincome tax\nconsiderations with respect to these debt securities will be discussed in the\napplicable supplement.\n\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting\n\nIn general, in the case of a U.S. Holder, other than certain exempt holders, we\nand other payors are\nrequired to report to the IRS all payments of principal, any premium, and interest\non the debt security, and the accrual of OID on an OID debt security. In addition,\nwe and other payors generally are required to report to the IRS any payment of\nproceeds of the sale of a debt security before maturity. Additionally, backup\nwithholding generally will apply to any payments, including payments of OID, if a\nU.S. Holder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number and\ncertify that\nthe taxpayer identification number is correct, the U.S. Holder is notified by the\nIRS that it has failed to report all interest and dividends required to be shown\non its U.S. federal income tax returns or a U.S. Holder does not certify that it\nhas\nnot underreported its interest and dividend income.\n\nIn the case of a Non-U.S. Holder, backup\nwithholding and information reporting will not apply to payments made if the\nNon-U.S. Holder provides the required certification that it is not a United States\nperson, or the\nNon-U.S. Holder otherwise establishes an exemption, provided that the payor or\nwithholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the holder\nis a United States person, or that the\nconditions of any exemption are not satisfied. However, we and other payors are\nrequired to report payments of interest on the debt securities on IRS Form 1042-S\neven if the payments are not otherwise subject\nto information reporting requirements.\n\nAny amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a\nrefund or a credit\nagainst a holder\u0092s U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required\ninformation is furnished to the IRS.\n\nReportable Transactions\n\nApplicable Treasury regulations require taxpayers that participate in \u0093reportable\ntransactions\u0094 to disclose their participation to\nthe IRS by attaching Form 8886 to their U.S. federal tax returns and to retain a\ncopy of all documents and records related to the transaction. In addition,\n\u0093material advisors\u0094 with respect to such a transaction may be required to file\nreturns and maintain records, including lists identifying investors in the\ntransactions, and to furnish those records to the IRS upon demand. A transaction\nmay be a \u0093reportable transaction\u0094 based on any of several criteria, one or more of\nwhich may be present with respect to an investment in the securities that we are\noffering. Whether an investment in these securities constitutes a \u0093reportable\ntransaction\u0094 for any investor depends on the investor\u0092s particular\ncircumstances. The Treasury regulations provide that, in addition to certain other\ntransactions, a \u0093loss transaction\u0094 constitutes a \u0093reportable transaction.\u0094 A \u0093loss\ntransaction\u0094 is any transaction resulting in the\ntaxpayer claiming a loss under Section 165 of the Code, in an amount equal to or\nin excess of certain threshold amounts, subject to certain exceptions. The\nTreasury regulations specifically provide that a loss resulting from a\n\u0093Section 988 transaction\u0094 will constitute a Section 165 loss, and certain\nexceptions will not be available if the loss from sale or exchange is treated as\nordinary under Section 988. In general, certain securities issued in\na foreign currency will be subject to the rules governing foreign currency\nexchange gain or loss. Therefore, losses realized with respect to such a security\nmay constitute a Section 988 transaction, and a holder of such a security that\nrecognizes exchange loss in an amount that\n\n86\n\nexceeds the loss threshold amount applicable to that holder may be required to\nfile Form 8886. Investors should consult their own tax advisors concerning any\npossible disclosure obligation they\nmay have with respect to their investment in the securities that we are offering\nand should be aware that, should any \u0093material advisor\u0094 determine that the return\nfiling or investor list maintenance requirements apply to such a\ntransaction, they would be required to comply with these requirements.\n\nForeign Account Tax Compliance Act (\u0093FATCA\u0094)\n\nLegislation commonly known as \u0093FATCA\u0094 (sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code)\nimposes a 30% U.S.\nwithholding tax on certain U.S. source payments, including interest (and OID),\ndividends, other fixed or determinable annual or periodical gain, profits, and\nincome, and on the gross proceeds from a disposition of property of a type which\ncan\nproduce U.S. source interest or dividends (\u0093Withholdable Payments\u0094), if paid to a\nforeign financial institution (including amounts paid to a foreign financial\ninstitution on behalf of a holder), unless such institution enters into an\nagreement with the Treasury to collect and provide to the Treasury certain\ninformation regarding U.S. financial account holders, including certain account\nholders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners, with such institution or\notherwise\ncomplies with FATCA. FATCA also generally imposes a withholding tax of 30% on\nWithholdable Payments made to a non-financial foreign entity unless such entity\nprovides the withholding agent with a certification\nthat it does not have any substantial U.S. owners or a certification identifying\nthe direct and indirect substantial U.S. owners of the entity. Under certain\ncircumstances, a holder may be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes.\n\nThese withholding and reporting requirements generally apply to U.S. source\nperiodic payments and to payments of gross proceeds from a sale or\nredemption. However, under proposed Treasury regulations (the preamble to which\nspecifies that taxpayers are permitted to rely on them pending finalization), no\nwithholding under FATCA will apply to payments of gross proceeds from a sale or\nredemption (other than income treated as U.S.-source \u0093fixed or determinable annual\nor periodical\u0094 income). If we (or an applicable withholding agent) determine\nwithholding under FATCA is appropriate, we (or such agent) will withhold tax at\nthe applicable statutory rate, without being required to pay any additional\namounts in respect of such withholding. Foreign financial institutions and non-\nfinancial foreign entities located in jurisdictions\nthat have an intergovernmental agreement with the United States governing FATCA\nmay be subject to different rules.

If Bank of America or BofA Finance sells\ndebt securities to underwriters, it will enter into an agreement with them at the\ntime of sale and will name them in the applicable supplement. In connection with\nthese sales, the underwriters may be deemed to have received compensation from us\nin the form of underwriting discounts and commissions. The underwriters also may\nreceive commissions from purchasers of debt securities for whom they may act as\nagent. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable supplement, the underwriters\nwill not be obligated to purchase the debt securities unless the conditions set\nforth in the underwriting agreement are satisfied, and if the underwriters\npurchase any of the debt securities, they will be required to purchase all of the\noffered debt securities. The underwriters may acquire the debt securities for\ntheir own account and may resell the securities from time to time in one or more\ntransactions, including negotiated transactions, at a fixed public offering price\nor varying prices determined at the time of sale. The underwriters may sell the\noffered debt securities to or through dealers, and those dealers may receive\ndiscounts, concessions, or commissions from the underwriters as well as from the\npurchasers for whom they may act as agent. Any initial public offering price and\nany discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers may be\nchanged from time to time. 88\n\nDistribution Through Dealers\n\nBank of America and/or BofA Finance may offer and sell debt securities from time\nto time to one or more dealers who would purchase the debt\nsecurities as principal. The dealers then may resell the offered debt securities\nto the public at fixed or varying prices to be determined by those dealers at the\ntime of resale. Bank of America and/or BofA Finance will set forth the names of\nthe\ndealers and the terms of the transaction in the applicable supplement.\n\nDistribution Through Agents\n\nBank of America and/or BofA Finance may offer and sell debt securities on a\ncontinuous basis through agents that become parties to an\nunderwriting or distribution agreement. Bank of America and/or BofA Finance will\nname any agent involved in the offer and sale, and describe any commissions\npayable by Bank of America and/or BofA Finance in the applicable supplement.\nUnless\notherwise specified in the applicable supplement, the agent will be acting on a\nbest efforts basis during the appointment period.\n\nDirect Sales\n\nBank of America and/or BofA Finance may sell directly to, and solicit offers from,\ninstitutional investors or others\nwho may be deemed to be underwriters, as defined in the Securities Act, for any\nresale of the debt securities. Bank of America and/or BofA Finance will describe\nthe terms of any sales of this kind in the applicable supplement.\n\nGeneral Information\n\nUnderwriters, dealers, or agents participating in an offering of debt securities\nmay be deemed to be underwriters, and any discounts and\ncommissions received by them and any profit realized by them on resale of the\noffered debt securities for whom they act as agent, may be deemed to be\nunderwriting discounts and commissions under the Securities Act.\n\nBank of America and/or BofA Finance may offer to sell debt securities either at a\nfixed price or at prices that may vary, at market prices\nprevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices, or\nat negotiated prices. Debt securities may be sold in connection with a remarketing\nafter their purchase by one or more firms including our affiliates, acting as\nprincipal for their own accounts or as our agent.\n\nIn connection with an underwritten offering of the debt securities, the\nunderwriters\nmay engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering\ntransactions in accordance with Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act.\nOverallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short\nposition\nfor the underwriters. The underwriters may enter bids for, and purchase, debt\nsecurities in the open market in order to stabilize the price of the debt\nsecurities. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the debt\nsecurities in the open\nmarket after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short\npositions. In addition, the underwriting syndicate may reclaim selling concessions\nallowed to an underwriter or a dealer for distributing the debt securities in the\noffering if\nthe syndicate repurchases previously distributed debt securities in transactions\nto cover syndicate short positions, in stabilization transactions, or otherwise.\nThese activities may cause the price of the debt securities to be higher than it\nwould\notherwise be. Those activities, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time.\n\nOrdinarily, each issue of debt securities will be a new\nissue, and there will be no established trading market for any debt security prior\nto its original issue date. Bank of America and/or BofA\n\n89\n\nFinance may not list any particular series of debt securities on a securities\nexchange or quotation system. Any underwriters to whom or agents through whom the\noffered securities are sold for\noffering and sale may make a market in the offered debt securities. However, any\nunderwriters or agents that make a market will not be obligated to do so and may\nstop doing so at any time without notice. Bank of America and BofA Finance cannot\nassure you that there will be a liquid trading market for the offered debt\nsecurities.\n\nUnder agreements entered into with Bank of America\nand/or BofA Finance, underwriters and agents may be entitled to indemnification by\nBank of America and/or BofA Finance against certain civil liabilities, including\nliabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribution for payments the\nunderwriters or agents may be required to make.\n\nIn the applicable supplement, we will specify the settlement period for the\noffered debt\nsecurities. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market\ngenerally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to a\ntrade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, if\nBank of America and/or BofA Finance specify a longer settlement cycle in the\napplicable supplement for an offering of debt securities, purchasers who wish to\ntrade those debt securities on any date prior to two business days before delivery\nof such\ndebt securities, will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at\nthe time of the trade to prevent a failed settlement and should consult their own\nadvisors in connection with that election.\n\nMarket-Making Transactions by Affiliates\n\nFollowing the initial distribution of debt securities, broker-dealer affiliates of\nBank of America and/or BofA Finance, including BofAS, may\nbuy and sell the debt securities in secondary market transactions as part of their\nbusiness as broker-dealers. Resales of this kind may occur in the open market or\nmay be privately negotiated, at prevailing market prices at the time of resale or\nat\nrelated or negotiated prices. This prospectus and any related supplements may be\nused by one or more affiliates of Bank of America and/or BofA Finance in\nconnection with these market-making transactions to the extent permitted by\napplicable law.\nAffiliates of Bank of America and/or BofA Finance may act as principal or agent in\nthese transactions.\n\nThe aggregate initial offering\nprice specified on the cover of the applicable supplement will relate to the\ninitial offering of debt securities not yet issued as of the date of this\nprospectus. This amount does not include any debt securities to be sold in market-\nmaking\ntransactions. The debt securities to be sold in market-making transactions include\ndebt securities issued after the date of this prospectus.\n\nInformation about the trade and settlement dates, as well as the purchase price,\nfor a market-making transaction will be provided to the\npurchaser in a separate confirmation of sale.\n\nUnless Bank of America, BofA Finance or their respective agent informs you in your\nconfirmation of sale that the debt security is being purchased in its original\noffering and sale, you may assume that you are purchasing the debt security in a\nmarket-making transaction.\n\nConflicts of Interest\n\nBofAS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bank of America and an affiliate of BofA\nFinance, and unless otherwise set forth in the applicable\nsupplement, Bank of America or BofA Finance, as applicable, will receive the net\nproceeds of any offering in which BofAS participates as an underwriter, dealer or\nagent. The offer and sale of any debt securities by BofAS, or any other broker-\ndealer\naffiliate of Bank of America or BofA Finance that is a member of the Financial\n\n90\n\nIndustry Regulatory Authority, Inc., or \u0093FINRA,\u0094 will comply with the requirements\nof FINRA Rule 5121 regarding a FINRA member firm\u0092s offer and sale of securities of\nan affiliate.\nAs required by FINRA Rule 5121, any such offer and sale will not be made to any\ndiscretionary account without the prior approval of the customer.\n\nThe maximum commission or discount to be received by any FINRA member or\nindependent broker-dealer will not be greater than 8% of the initial\ngross proceeds from the sale of any debt security being sold.\n\nThe underwriters, agents and their affiliates may engage in financial or\nother business transactions with Bank of America and its subsidiaries and BofA\nFinance in the ordinary course of business.\n\nIn addition,\nin the ordinary course of their business activities, one or more of the\nunderwriters, dealers or agents and/or their respective affiliates, may make or\nhold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities\n(or related\nderivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their\nown account and for the accounts of their customers. These investments and\nsecurities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of Bank of America\nor its\naffiliates, including BofA Finance. These underwriters, dealers, agents, or their\naffiliates, that have a lending relationship with Bank of America routinely hedge\ntheir credit exposure to Bank of America consistent with their customary risk\nmanagement policies. Typically, these parties would hedge such exposure to Bank of\nAmerica by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of\ncredit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities of Bank of\nAmerica, including potentially the debt securities offered hereby. Any such short\npositions could adversely affect future trading prices of the debt securities\noffered hereby. These broker-dealers or their affiliates may also make investment\nrecommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of\nsuch debt securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to\nclients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such debt securities and\ninstruments.\n\n91\n\nERISA CONSIDERATIONS\n\nA fiduciary of a pension, profit-sharing or other employee benefit plan subject to\nTitle I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of\n1974, as amended (\u0093ERISA\u0094) (each, an \u0093ERISA Plan\u0094), should consider the fiduciary\nstandards of ERISA in the context of the ERISA plan\u0092s particular circumstances\nbefore authorizing an investment in the debt securities. Among\nother factors, the fiduciary should consider whether such an investment is in\naccordance with the documents governing the ERISA plan and whether the investment\nis appropriate for the ERISA plan in view of its overall investment policy and\ndiversification of its portfolio. A fiduciary should also consider whether an\ninvestment in the debt securities may constitute a \u0093prohibited transaction,\u0094 as\ndescribed below.\n\nSection 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans, as well as\nplans, accounts and other arrangements described\nin Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code (including, without limitation, individual\nretirement accounts and retirement plans covering self-employed persons) that are\nsubject to Section 4975 of the Code, and entities whose underlying assets\ninclude plan assets by reason of an ERISA Plan\u0092s or such plan\u0092s, account\u0092s or\narrangement\u0092s investment in such entities (including, without limitation, as\napplicable, insurance company general accounts) (the foregoing, together\nwith ERISA Plans, \u0093Plans\u0094), from engaging in certain transactions involving \u0093plan\nassets\u0094 with parties that are \u0093parties in interest\u0094 under ERISA or \u0093disqualified\npersons\u0094 under the Code with respect to the\nPlans (referred to as \u0093prohibited transactions\u0094).\n\nBecause of its business, the issuers and certain of their affiliates may each\nbe considered a \u0093party in interest\u0094 or a \u0093disqualified person\u0094 with respect to\nmany Plans on account of being a service provider to such Plans. As a result, a\nprohibited transaction may arise if the debt securities are acquired\nby or on behalf of a Plan unless the debt securities are acquired and held\npursuant to an available exemption.\n\nIn this regard, the U.S.\nDepartment of Labor has issued certain prohibited transaction class exemptions\n(\u0093PTCEs\u0094) that may provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited\ntransactions resulting from or occurring in connection with the acquisition or\nholding of the debt securities. Those PTCEs include PTCE 96-23 (for certain\ntransactions determined by in-house asset managers), PTCE\n95-60 (for certain transactions involving insurance company general accounts),\nPTCE 91-38 (for certain transactions involving bank collective investment funds),\nPTCE 90-1 (for certain transactions involving insurance company pooled separate\naccounts) and PTCE 84-14 (for certain transactions determined by independent\nqualified professional\nasset managers). In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20)\nof the Code provide an exemption for the purchase and sale of securities and\nrelated lending transactions, provided that neither the issuer of the securities\nnor any of its affiliates has or exercises any discretionary authority or control\nor renders any investment advice with respect to the assets of any Plan involved\nin the transaction and provided further that the Plan receives no less, nor pays\nno\nmore, than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction (the so-\ncalled \u0093Service Provider Exemption\u0094). There can be no assurance that any of these\nclass or statutory exemptions will be\navailable with respect to transactions involving the debt securities.\n\nGovernmental, church,\nnon-U.S. and other plans (collectively, \u0093Non-ERISA Arrangements\u0094) are generally\nnot subject to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction rules of\nERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, but may be subject to similar restrictions\nunder state, federal, local or non-U.S. laws (\u0093Similar Laws\u0094). Fiduciaries of\nNon-ERISA Arrangements should consult with their counsel regarding the potential\nconsequences of an investment in the debt securities under any applicable Similar\nLaws before acquiring the debt securities.\n\nAccordingly, debt securities may not be acquired or held by any Plan unless one of\nthe following exemptions (or another available\nexemption) applies to such acquisition and holding: PTCE 96-23,\n\n92\n\nPTCE 95-60,PTCE 91-38,PTCE 90-1,PTCE 84-14and the Service Provider Exemption. Each\npurchaser of the debt securities (or any interest therein) will be deemed to have\nrepresented and warranted on each day including the date of its acquisition of\nsuch debt securities (or interest therein) through and including the date of\ndisposition of such debt securities (or interest therein) that:\n                                                   \n  (a)  it is not a Plan or Non-ERISA Arrangement;  \n                                                   \n                                                                                  \n       if it is a Plan, its acquisition, holding and disposition of such debt     \n  (b)  securities (or interest therein) will                                      \n       not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under      \n       ERISA or the Code; or                                                      \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n       if it is a Non-ERISA Arrangement, its acquisition, holding and             \n  (c)  disposition of such debt securities (or interest therein) will not         \n       violate any Similar Law and are not otherwise prohibited.                  \n                                                                                  \nMoreover, any purchaser that is a Plan or Non-ERISAArrangement or is acquiring the\ndebt securities on behalf of a Plan or Non-ERISAArrangement, including any\nfiduciary purchasing on behalf of a Plan or Non-ERISAArrangement, will be deemed\nto have represented, in its corporate and its fiduciary capacity, by its\nacquisition and holding of the debt securities that (a) none of the issuers, the\nunderwriters, the dealers, the agents or their respective affiliates\n(collectively, the \u0093Sellers\u0094) is a \u0093fiduciary\u0094 (under Section 3(21) of ERISA or\nany Similar Laws, or under any final or proposed regulations thereunder) in\nconnection with the initial offerings of the debt securities, (b) no information\nprovided by any Seller constitutes advice that has formed a primary basis for any\ninvestment decision by or on behalf of such purchaser in connection with the debt\nsecurities and the transactions contemplated with respect to the debt securities,\nand (c) such purchaser recognizes and agrees that any communication from any\nSeller to such purchaser with respect to the debt securities is not intended by\nthe Seller to be impartial investment advice and is rendered in its capacity as a\nseller of the debt securities and not as a fiduciary to such purchaser. This\ndiscussion is a general summary of some of the rules which apply to Plans and Non-\nERISAArrangements and their related investment vehicles as of the date of this\nprospectus. The rules governing investments by Plans and Non-ERISAArrangements may\nchange frequently, and the Sellers have no duty to, nor will they, inform you\nabout any changes to such rules if and when they occur. This summary does not\ndescribe all of the rules or other considerations that may be relevant to the\ninvestment in the debt securities by Plans or Non-ERISAArrangements. The\ndescription above is not, and should not be construed as, legal advice or a legal\nopinion. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties imposed upon\npersons involved in prohibited transactions, it is important that any person\nconsidering the purchase of the debt securities with the assets of any Plan or\nNon-ERISAArrangement consult with its counsel regarding the consequences under\nERISA and the Code, or any applicable Similar Law, of the acquisition and holding\nof the debt securities and the availability of exemptive relief under any class or\nstatutory exemptions. The sale of the debt securities to a Plan or Non-\nERISAArrangement is in no respect a representation by any Seller that such an\ninvestment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by\nPlans or Non-ERISAArrangements generally or any particular Plan or Non-\nERISAArrangement, or that such an investment is appropriate for Plans or Non-\nERISAArrangements generally or any particular Plan or Non-ERISAArrangement. 93\n\nWHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION Bank of America and BofA Finance have filed a\nregistration statement on Form S-3with the SEC relating to the debt securities of\nBank of America and the debt securities of BofA Finance to be offered and sold\nusing this prospectus.

For these purposes, a retail\ninvestor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in\npoint (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, \u0093MiFID II\u0094); (ii)\na customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the\n\u0093Insurance Distribution Directive\u0094), where that customer would not\nqualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID\nII; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the EU Prospectus Regulation.\nConsequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No\n1286/2014 (as amended, the \u0093EU PRIIPs Regulation\u0094) for offering or selling the\nnotes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been\nprepared and\n\nS-4\n\ntherefore offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to any\nretail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the EU PRIIPs Regulation.\n\nIMPORTANT \u0097 UK RETAIL INVESTORS\u0097 The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or\notherwise made available to and should\nnot be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the\nUnited Kingdom (the \u0093UK\u0094). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person\nwho is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point\n(8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of UK domestic\nlaw by virtue of the EUWA; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of\nthe FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement\nDirective (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional\nclient as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as\nit forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a\nqualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation.\nConsequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014\nas it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the \u0093UK PRIIPs\nRegulation\u0094) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available\nto retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling\nthe notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK\nmay be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.\n\nNotification under Section309B(1) of the Securities and Futures Act 2001 (the\n\u0093SFA\u0094)\u0097 Unless otherwise stated in the applicable supplement in respect of any\nnotes, all notes issued or to be issued using this prospectus supplement and the\naccompanying prospectus shall be prescribed capital\nmarkets products (as defined in the Securities and Futures (Capital Markets\nProducts) Regulations 2018) and Excluded Investment Products (as defined in the\nMonetary Authority of Singapore (the \u0093MAS\u0094) Notice SFA 04-N12: Notice on the Sale\nof Investment Products and MAS Notice FAA-N16: Notice on Recommendations on\nInvestment Products).\n\nINVESTORS SHOULD NOTE THAT BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION IS NOT LICENCED TO OPERATE\nAS A BANK IN ITALY.\n\nUnless we indicate otherwise or unless the context requires otherwise, all\nreferences in this prospectus supplement to \u0093Bank of\nAmerica,\u0094 \u0093we,\u0094 \u0093us,\u0094 \u0093our,\u0094 or similar references are to Bank of America\nCorporation, and not to any of its subsidiaries. In this prospectus supplement,\nreferences to \u0093floating-rate notes\u0094 mean both\nfloating-rate notes and fixed/floating rate notes at any time such fixed/floating\nrate notes bear interest at a floating rate.\n\nAny term\nthat is used, but not defined, in this prospectus supplement has the meaning set\nforth in the accompanying prospectus. Certain terms that are used in this\nprospectus supplement have the specific meanings set forth herein. A listing of\nthe pages on\nwhich such terms are defined can be found in the \u0093Index of Certain Defined Terms\u0094\nbeginning on page S-67 of this prospectus supplement.\n\nWhen we refer to \u0093you\u0094 or \u0093investors\u0094 in this prospectus supplement, we mean those\nwho invest in the notes being offered\nby this prospectus supplement, whether they are the registered holders or only\nindirect owners of those notes. When we refer to \u0093your notes\u0094 in this prospectus\nsupplement, we mean the notes in which you will hold a direct or indirect\ninterest.\n\nS-5\n\nRISK FACTORS\n\nYour investment in the notes involves significant risks. Your decision to purchase\nthe notes should be made only after carefully considering the risks of an\ninvestment in the notes, including those discussed below, in the accompanying\nprospectus beginning on page 7, and in the applicable supplement(s) for the\nspecific notes, with your advisors in light of your particular circumstances. The\nnotes are not an appropriate investment for you if you are not knowledgeable about\nsignificant elements of the notes or financial matters in general. For information\nregarding risks and uncertainties that may materially affect the business and\nresults of Bank of America, please refer to the information under the caption\n\u0093Item 1A. Risk Factors\u0094 in its annual report on Form 10-Kfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, which is incorporated by reference in the accompanying\nprospectus, as well as those risks and uncertainties discussed in subsequent\nfilings of Bank of America that are incorporated by reference in the accompanying\nprospectus. You also should review the risk factors that will be set forth in\nother documents that Bank of America will file after the date of this prospectus\nsupplement.\n\nThis discussion of risks uses a number of capitalized and other defined terms that\nare defined elsewhere in this prospectus supplement. A listing of the pages on\nwhich certain of such terms are defined can be found under the \u0093Index of Certain\nDefined Terms\u0094 beginning on page S-67 of this prospectus supplement.\n\nRisks Relating to the Notes\n\nHedging activities of affiliates may affect your return at maturity and the market\nvalue of the notes.\n\nAt any time, our affiliates may engage\nin hedging activities relating to the notes. This hedging activity, in turn, may\nincrease or decrease the market value of the notes. In addition, our affiliates\nmay acquire a long or short position in the notes from time to time. All or a\nportion of\nthese positions may be liquidated at or about the time of maturity of the notes.\nThe aggregate amount and the composition of these positions are likely to vary\nover time. However, we cannot assure you that its activities or its affiliates\u0092\nactivities will not adversely affect the market value of the notes.\n\nThe hedging and trading activities of our affiliates may create conflicts of\ninterest with you.\n\nFrom time to time during the term of any notes and in connection with the\ndetermination of the\npayments on notes, we or our affiliates may enter into hedging transactions or\nadjust or close out existing hedging transactions. We or our affiliates also may\nenter into hedging transactions relating to other notes or instruments that we may\nissue,\nsome of which may have returns calculated in a manner related to that of\nparticular notes. We or our affiliates will price these hedging transactions with\nthe intent to realize a profit, considering the risks inherent in these hedging\nactivities,\nwhether the value of the notes increases or decreases. These hedging activities\nmay result in a profit that is more or less than initially expected, or could\nresult in a loss.\n\nOne or more of our broker-dealer affiliates, including BofA Securities, Inc., may\nengage in trading activities that are not for your account\nor on your behalf. These trading activities may present a conflict of interest\nbetween your interest in the notes and the interests of such affiliates. These\ntrading activities could influence the market measure or other reference asset (if\nany) for\nthe notes or secondary trading (if any) in the notes, or otherwise could be\nadverse to your interests as a beneficial owner of the notes.\n\nS-6\n\nThere may be potential conflicts of interest involving the calculation agent,\nwhich may be an affiliate of ours.\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the calculation agent\nwill be one of our\naffiliates, including Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc. We may remove and/or\nappoint different calculation agents from time to time after the original issue\ndate of a series of notes, or we may elect to act as the calculation agent with\nrespect\nto such series of notes, in each case without your consent and without notifying\nyou of the change. The calculation agent will make a variety of determinations\nrelating to the notes, including the amounts that will be paid on the notes. In\nmaking\nthese determinations, the calculation agent may be required to make discretionary\njudgements. In making these discretionary judgments, the fact that the calculation\nagent is our affiliate may cause it to have economic interests that are adverse to\nyour interests as an investor in the notes, and the calculation agent\u0092s\ndeterminations may adversely affect your return on the notes.\n\nRisks Relating to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate and SOFR Notes Generally\n\nThe following discussion of risks relates to the secured overnight financing rate\n(\u0093SOFR\u0094) and SOFR notes generally. In this discussion, references to \u0093SOFR notes\u0094\nmean a series of compounded SOFR notes or simple average SOFR notes. You should\ncarefully consider the following discussion of risks before investing in SOFR\nnotes.\n\nAny failure of SOFR to maintain market acceptance could adversely affect the\nreturn on or value of the SOFR notes and result in a limited secondary trading\nmarket for the SOFR notes.\n\nAccording to the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York\u0092s Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the \u0093ARRC\u0094),\nSOFR was developed for use in certain U.S. dollar derivatives and other financial\ncontracts as an alternative to the London Interbank Offered Rate for\ndeposits in U.S. Dollars (\u0093U.S. Dollar LIBOR\u0094) in part because it is considered a\ngood representation of general funding conditions in the overnight U.S. Treasury\nrepurchase agreement market. However, as a rate based on transactions\nsecured by U.S. Treasury securities, it does not measure bank-specific credit risk\nand, as a result, is less likely to correlate with the unsecured short-term\nfunding costs of banks. This may mean that market participants would not consider\nSOFR a\nsuitable substitute, replacement or successor for U.S. Dollar LIBOR, which may, in\nturn, lead to lessened market acceptance of SOFR.\n\nFurther, other index providers are developing products that are perceived as\ncompeting with SOFR. It is possible that market participants will\nprefer one of these competing products and that such competing products may become\nmore widely accepted in the marketplace than SOFR. To the extent market acceptance\nfor SOFR as a benchmark for floating-rate notes declines, the return on and value\nof the SOFR notes and the price at which investors can sell the SOFR notes in the\nsecondary market could be adversely affected. In addition, investors in the SOFR\nnotes may not be able to sell the SOFR notes at all or may not be able to sell the\nSOFR notes at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable to similar\ninvestments that continue to have a developed secondary market, and may\nconsequently suffer from increased pricing volatility and market risk.\n\nAs of the date of this prospectus supplement, there are multiple market\nconventions with respect to the implementation of SOFR as a base rate\nfor floating-rate notes or other securities. The manner of calculation and related\nconventions with respect to the determination of interest rates based on SOFR in\nfloating-rate notes markets may differ materially compared with the manner of\ncalculation and related conventions with respect to the determination of interest\nrates based on SOFR in other markets, such as the derivatives and loan markets.\nInvestors should carefully consider how any potential inconsistencies between the\nmanner of calculation and related\n\nS-7\n\nconventions with respect to the determination of interest or other payment rates\nbased on SOFR across these markets may impact any hedging or other financial\narrangements that they may put in\nplace in connection with any acquisition, holding or disposition of the SOFR\nnotes.\n\nSOFR may be modified or discontinued, which could adversely affect the return on,\nvalue of or market for affected SOFR notes.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the\n\u0093FRBNY\u0094) (or a successor), as administrator of SOFR, may make methodological or\nother changes that could change the value of SOFR, including changes related to\nthe method by which SOFR is calculated, eligibility criteria applicable to the\ntransactions used to calculate SOFR, or timing related to the publication of SOFR.\nIn addition, SOFR is published by the FRBNY based on data received from sources\nother than us, and we have no control over the methods of calculation, publication\nschedule, rate revision practices or availability of SOFR or the SOFR Index. If\nthe manner in which SOFR is calculated is changed, that change may result in a\nreduction of the amount of interest payable on the SOFR notes, which may adversely\naffect\nthe trading prices of the SOFR notes. The administrator of SOFR may withdraw,\nmodify, amend, suspend or discontinue the calculation or dissemination of SOFR in\nits sole discretion and without notice and has no obligation to consider the\ninterests of\ninvestors in the SOFR notes in calculating, withdrawing, modifying, amending,\nsuspending or discontinuing SOFR. For purposes of the formula used to calculate\ninterest with respect to a series of SOFR notes, SOFR in respect of a particular\ndate will\nnot be adjusted for any modifications or amendments to SOFR data that the\nadministrator of SOFR may publish after the interest rate on SOFR notes for that\nday has been determined in accordance with the terms and provisions set forth in\nthis\nprospectus supplement and the applicable supplement.\n\nThere can be no guarantee that SOFR will not be modified or discontinued in a\nmanner\nthat is materially adverse to an investor in SOFR notes. If the manner in which\nSOFR is calculated is changed or if SOFR is discontinued, that change or\ndiscontinuance could reduce or otherwise negatively impact the amount of interest\nthat accrues\non a series of SOFR notes, which could adversely affect the return on, value of\nand market for such series of SOFR notes.\n\nWe or our affiliates may publish research reports that could affect the market\nvalue of SOFR notes.\n\nWe or one or more of our affiliates, at\npresent or in the future, may publish research reports with respect to movements\nin interest rates generally, or with respect to the LIBOR transition to\nalternative reference rates or SOFR specifically. This research may be modified\nfrom time to\ntime without notice and may express opinions or provide recommendations that are\ninconsistent with purchasing or holding SOFR notes. Any of these activities may\naffect the market value of SOFR notes.\n\nRisks Relating to Compounded SOFR Notes and Simple Average SOFR Notes\n\nThe following discussion of risks specifically relates to compounded SOFR notes\nand simple average SOFR notes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, compounded\nSOFR notes using the SOFR Index convention). You should carefully consider the\nfollowing discussion of risks before investing in compounded SOFR notes or simple\naverage SOFR notes.\n\nThe interest rate on a series of compounded SOFR notes or simple average SOFR\nnotes is based on a compounded or simple average, respectively, of Daily SOFR,\nwhich is relatively new in the marketplace.\n\nFor each interest period, the interest rate on a series of\ncompounded SOFR notes or simple average SOFR notes will be based on a compounded\nor simple average, respectively, of Daily SOFR\n\nS-8\n\ncalculated as described under \u0093Description of the Notes\u0097Floating-Rate\nNotes\u0097Compounded SOFR Notes\u0094 or \u0093Description of the Notes\u0097Floating-Rate\nNotes\u0097Simple\nAverage SOFR Notes,\u0094 as applicable, in this prospectus supplement. As a result,\nthe interest rate on a series of compounded SOFR notes or simple average SOFR\nnotes during any interest period may not be the same as the interest rate on other\ninstruments bearing interest at a rate based on SOFR that use an alternative\nmethod to determine the applicable interest rate. Further, if Daily SOFR in\nrespect of a particular date during an interest period or observation period (if\napplicable) for\na series of compounded SOFR notes or simple average SOFR notes is negative, the\ninclusion of such Daily SOFR in the calculation of compounded SOFR or simple\naverage SOFR for the applicable interest period will reduce the interest rate and\nthe\ninterest payable on such series of compounded SOFR notes or simple average SOFR\nnotes, as applicable, for such interest period.\n\nThe\nmethod for calculating an interest rate based upon compounded SOFR or simple\naverage SOFR (for example, payment delays, observation periods/lookbacks and/or\nlockout/suspension periods) in market precedents varies. This variation in the\nmarket could\nadversely affect the return on, value of and market for the compounded SOFR notes\nor simple average SOFR notes.\n\nInterest payments due on a series of compounded SOFR notes or simple average SOFR\nnotes will be determined only at the end of the relevant interest period.\n\nInterest payments due on a series of compounded SOFR notes or simple average SOFR\nnotes will be determined only at the end of the relevant\ninterest period. Therefore, holders of any series of compounded SOFR notes or\nsimple average SOFR notes will not know the amount of interest payable with\nrespect to each interest period until shortly prior to the related interest\npayment date, and\nit may be difficult for investors in such compounded SOFR notes or simple average\nSOFR notes to estimate reliably the amounts of interest that will be payable on\neach such interest payment date at the beginning of or during the relevant\ninterest\nperiod. In addition, some investors may be unwilling or unable to trade such\ncompounded SOFR notes or simple average SOFR notes without changes to their\ninformation technology systems, both of which could adversely impact the liquidity\nand trading\nprice of any series of compounded SOFR notes or simple average SOFR notes.\n\nWith respect to a series of compounded SOFR notes using the payment delay\nconvention or simple average SOFR notes that do not use a rate lookback, it will\nnot be possible to calculate accrued interest with respect to any period until\nafter the end of such period.\n\nWith respect to a series of compounded SOFR notes using the payment delay\nconvention or simple average SOFR notes that do not use a rate\nlookback, because Daily SOFR in respect of a given day is not published until the\nU.S. government securities business day immediately following such day, it will\nnot be possible to calculate accrued interest with respect to any period until\nafter\nthe end of such period, which may adversely affect your ability to trade such\nnotes in the secondary market.\n\nWith respect to a series of compounded SOFR notes using the rate cut off\nconvention or payment delay convention, or a series of simple average SOFR notes\nthat employs a rate cut-offdate, pursuant to the formula used to determine\ncompounded SOFR or simple average SOFR for such notes for an applicable interest\nperiod, Daily SOFR used in such calculation for any day from, and including, the\nrate cut-offdate to, but excluding, the relevant interest payment date (or\nmaturity or redemption date, if applicable) will be Daily SOFR in respect of the\nrelevant rate cut-offdate.\n\nThe formula used to determine the base rate for compounded SOFR notes using the\npayment delay convention employs a rate cut-off date for the final interest period\nwith respect to any series\n\nS-9\n\nof notes. In addition, the formulas used to determine the base rate for (i) any\nseries of compounded SOFR notes for which the applicable supplement specifies that\nthe rate cut-off convention applies and (ii) any series of simple average SOFR\nnotes for which the applicable supplement specifies that a rate cut-off date\napplies, may employ a\nrate cut-off date for each interest period with respect to such series.\n\nFor the final interest\nperiod with respect to a series of compounded SOFR notes using the payment delay\nconvention, Daily SOFR used in the calculation of compounded SOFR for any day\nfrom, and including, the rate cut-off date to, but\nexcluding, the maturity date or the redemption date, if applicable, will be Daily\nSOFR in respect of the rate cut-off date. The rate cut-off date will be two U.S.\ngovernment securities business days (or such other number of U.S. government\nsecurities business days as we may specify in the applicable supplement) prior to\nthe applicable maturity date (or redemption date, if applicable).\n\nFor each interest period with respect to (i) any series of compounded SOFR notes\nusing the rate\ncut-off convention and (ii) any series of simple average SOFR notes using a rate\ncut-off date, Daily SOFR used in the calculation of compounded SOFR or simple\naverage SOFR for any day from, and including, the rate cut-off date to, but\nexcluding, the relevant interest payment date or the maturity or redemption date,\nif applicable, will be Daily SOFR in respect of the\nrate cut-off date.\n\nWith respect to any such series of notes, the rate cut-off date will be (i) for\ncompounded SOFR, five U.S. government securities business days (or such other\nnumber of U.S. government securities business days as we may specify in the\napplicable supplement), or\n(ii) for simple average SOFR, two U.S. government securities business days (or\nsuch other number of U.S. government securities business days as we may specify in\nthe applicable supplement) prior to each interest payment date or the maturity\ndate (or redemption date, if applicable).\n\nAs a result of the foregoing, a holder of a series of compounded SOFR notes using\nthe payment\ndelay convention will not receive the benefit of any increase in the level of SOFR\non any date subsequent to the applicable rate cut-off date in connection with the\ndetermination of the interest payable with\nrespect to the final interest period for an applicable series of compounded SOFR\nnotes using the payment delay convention. A holder of compounded SOFR notes using\nthe rate cut-off convention or simple average\nSOFR notes using a rate-cut off date will not receive the benefit of any increase\nin the level of SOFR on any date subsequent to the applicable rate cut-off date in\nconnection with the determination of the interest payable with respect to each\ninterest period for a series of compounded SOFR notes using the rate cut-off\nconvention or simple average SOFR notes using a rate cut-off date, which could\nreduce the amount of interest that may be payable on the applicable series of\nnotes.\n\nHolders of a series of compounded SOFR notes using the payment delay convention\nwill receive payments of interest on a delayed basis.\n\nThe interest payment dates for any series of compounded SOFR notes using the\npayment delay convention with respect to interest rate\ndetermination and interest payments will be two business days (or such other\nnumber of business days as we may specify in the applicable supplement) after the\ninterest period demarcation date at the end of each interest period for such\nseries. This\nconvention differs from the interest payment convention that has been used\nhistorically for floating-rate notes with interest rates based on other benchmark\nor market rates, such as U.S. Dollar LIBOR, where interest typically has been paid\non a\nfixed day that immediately follows the final day of the applicable interest\nperiod. As a result, investors in a series of compounded SOFR notes using the\npayment delay convention will receive payments of interest on a delayed basis as\ncompared to\ntraditional floating-rate notes without payment delay in which they previously may\nhave invested.\n\nS-10\n\nRisks Relating to SOFR Benchmark Transition Provisions\n\nThe following discussion of risks specifically relates to SOFR benchmark\ntransition provisions. You should carefully consider the following discussion of\nrisks relating to the SOFR benchmark transition provisions before investing in any\nSOFR notes. In this discussion, references to \u0093SOFR notes\u0094 mean a series of\ncompounded SOFR notes or simple average SOFR notes.\n\nThe selection of a Benchmark Replacement could adversely affect the return on,\nvalue of or market for affected SOFR notes.\n\nIf we or our designee, after consulting with us, determines that a Benchmark\nTransition Event and related Benchmark Replacement Date have\noccurred with respect to a series of SOFR notes, the applicable Benchmark\nReplacement will replace the then-current Benchmark (which will be a rate based on\nSOFR at the original issue date of the relevant SOFR notes) for all purposes\nrelating to\nsuch SOFR notes. If a particular Benchmark Replacement or Benchmark Replacement\nAdjustment cannot be determined, then the next-available Benchmark Replacement or\nBenchmark Replacement Adjustment will apply. These replacement rates and\nadjustments\nmay be selected or formulated by (i) the USD Relevant Governmental Body (such as\nthe ARRC), (ii) the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (\u0093ISDA\u0094)\nor any successor thereto or (iii) in certain circumstances, us or\nour designee (which may be our affiliate), after consulting with us.\n\nIn addition, the terms of the SOFR notes expressly authorize us or\nour designee (which may be our affiliate), after consulting with us, in connection\nwith a Benchmark Replacement to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes with\nrespect to, among other things, the determination of interest periods and the\ntiming and frequency of determining rates and making payments of interest and\nother administrative matters. The application of a Benchmark Replacement and\nBenchmark Replacement Adjustment, and any implementation of Benchmark Replacement\nConforming\nChanges, could result in adverse consequences to the interest rate or amount of\ninterest payable on the SOFR notes, which could adversely affect the return on,\nvalue of and market for such SOFR notes and the price at which investors may be\nable to\nsell such SOFR notes. Moreover, certain determinations, decisions and elections\nwith respect to the Benchmark Replacement and any Benchmark Replacement Conforming\nChanges, or the occurrence or non-occurrence\nof a Benchmark Transition Event, may require the exercise of discretion and the\nmaking of subjective judgments by us or our designee (after consulting with us).\nAny determination, decision or election made by us or our designee pursuant to the\nSOFR\nbenchmark transition provisions set forth in this prospectus supplement will, if\nmade by us, be made in our sole discretion and, if made by our designee, be made\nafter consultation with us and, in each case, will become effective without\nconsent\nfrom the investors in the affected SOFR notes or any other party. We may designate\nan entity to make any determination, decision or election that we have the right\nto make in connection with the SOFR benchmark transition provisions set forth in\nthis\nprospectus supplement. Any designee that we may appoint in connection with these\ndeterminations, decisions or elections may be our affiliate. When performing such\nfunctions, potential conflicts of interest may exist between us, our designee and\ninvestors in the SOFR notes and making such potentially subjective determinations\nmay adversely affect the return on, value of and market for the SOFR notes. All\ndeterminations by us or our designee in our or its discretion will be conclusive\nfor\nall purposes and binding on us and investors in the applicable SOFR notes absent\nmanifest error. Further, (i) the composition and characteristics of any Benchmark\nReplacement for a series of SOFR notes will not be the same as those of the\napplicable SOFR rate for a series of SOFR notes, the Benchmark Replacement will\nnot be the economic equivalent of SOFR there can be no assurance that the\nBenchmark Replacement will perform in the same way as SOFR would have at any time\nand there is\nno guarantee that the Benchmark Replacement will be a comparable substitute for\nSOFR (each of which means that a Benchmark Transition Event could adversely affect\nthe return on, value of and market for the applicable series of SOFR notes), (ii)\nany\n\nS-11\n\nfailure of the Benchmark Replacement to gain market acceptance could adversely\naffect the relevant series of SOFR notes, (iii) the Benchmark Replacement may have\na very limited history and\nthe future performance of the Benchmark Replacement may not be able to be\npredicted based on historical performance, (iv) the secondary trading market for\ndebt securities linked to the Benchmark Replacement may be limited and (v) the\nadministrator of the Benchmark Replacement may make changes that could change the\nvalue of the Benchmark Replacement or discontinue the Benchmark Replacement and\nwould not have any obligation to consider the interests of investors in the\nrelevant\nseries of SOFR notes in doing so. For more information, see the SOFR benchmark\ntransition provisions set forth under \u0093Description of the Notes\u0097Floating-Rate\nNotes\u0097Effect of a Benchmark Transition Event and Related Benchmark\nReplacement Date with Respect to SOFR\u0094 below.\n\nRisks Relating to Simple Average Federal Funds (Effective) Rate Notes\n\nThe following discussion of risks specifically relates to simple average federal\nfunds (effective) rate notes. You should carefully consider the following\ndiscussion of risks before investing in simple average federal funds (effective)\nrate notes.\n\nInterest payments due on a series of simple average federal funds (effective) rate\nnotes will be determined only at the end of the relevant interest period.\n\nInterest payments due on a series of simple average federal funds (effective) rate\nnotes will be determined only at the end of the relevant\ninterest period. Therefore, holders of any series of simple average federal funds\n(effective) rate notes will not know the amount of interest payable with respect\nto each interest period until shortly prior to the related interest payment date,\nand\nit may be difficult for investors in such simple average federal funds (effective)\nrate notes to estimate reliably the amounts of interest that will be payable on\neach such interest payment date at the beginning of or during the relevant\ninterest\nperiod.\n\nWith respect to a series of simple average federal funds (effective) rate notes\nthat does not use a rate lookback, it will not be possible to calculate accrued\ninterest with respect to any period until after the end of such period.\n\nThe federal funds\n(effective) rate in respect of a given day is not published until the New York\nbanking day (as defined below) immediately following such day. For this reason,\nwith respect to a series of simple average federal funds (effective) rate notes\nthat does\nnot use a rate lookback, it will not be possible to calculate accrued interest\nwith respect to any period until after the end of such period, which may adversely\naffect your ability to trade such notes in the secondary market.\n\nWith respect to a series of simple average federal funds (effective) rate notes\nthat employs a rate cut-offdate, pursuant to the formula used to determine the\nsimple average federal funds (effective) rate for each applicable interest period,\nthe federal funds (effective) rate used in such calculation for any day from, and\nincluding, the rate cut-offdate to, but excluding, the relevant interest payment\ndate (or maturity or redemption date, if applicable) will be the federal funds\n(effective) rate in respect of the relevant rate cut-offdate.\n\nPursuant to the formula used to determine the simple average\nfederal funds (effective) rate for each interest period with respect to a series\nof simple average federal funds (effective) rate notes using a rate cut-off date,\nthe federal funds (effective) rate used in\nsuch calculation for any day from, and including, the rate cut-off date to, but\nexcluding, the relevant interest payment date or the maturity or redemption date,\nif applicable, will be the federal funds\n(effective) rate in respect of the rate cut-off date. The rate cut-off date will\nbe two New York banking days (or such other number of\n\nS-12\n\nNew York banking days as we may specify in the applicable supplement) prior to\neach interest payment date or the maturity date (or redemption date, if\napplicable). Therefore, you will not receive\nthe benefit of any increase in the level of the federal funds (effective) rate on\nany date subsequent to the rate cut-off date in connection with the determination\nof the interest payable with respect to an\ninterest period for a series of simple average federal funds (effective) rate\nnotes using a rate cut-off date, which could reduce the amount of interest that\nmay be payable.\n\nRisks Relating to U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aeNotes\n\nThe following discussion of risks specifically relates to U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE\nSwap Rate\u00aenotes. You should carefully consider the following discussion of risks\nbefore investing in U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\u00aenotes.\n\nICE Benchmark Administration (including any successor administrator of the U.S.\nDollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00ae, \u0093IBA\u0094) launched the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\n\u00aefor use as a benchmark in order to aid the market\u0092s transition to SOFR and away\nfrom U.S. Dollar LIBOR. The following discussion of certain risks relating to the\nnotes is based on information related to the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aethat\nis made publicly available on the ICE Swap Rate \u00aeWebsite as of the date of this\npricing supplement, which information is subject to change at any time after such\ndate. In the following discussion of risks, references to the \u0093U.S. Dollar SOFR\nICE Swap Rate \u00ae\u0094 refer to such rate for the applicable tenor(s) with respect to a\nseries of notes. For further information about the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\n\u00ae, see \u0093Description of the Notes\u0097Floating-Rate Notes\u0097U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRate \u00aeNotes\u0094 below.\n\nThe U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aeis a new series of benchmarks, and the future\nperformance of the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aecannot be predicted based on\nthe limited historical information available.\n\nIBA began publication of the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\non November 8, 2021. As a result, there is limited historical information on which\nto evaluate the performance of the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate or on which to\nbase a prediction\nas to its future performance, which may bear little or no relation to such limited\ninformation. The limited historical information is not necessarily indicative of\nthe future performance of the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate or the value of the\nU.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate notes, and any historical upward or downward trend\nin the level of the\nU.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate during any period is not an indication that the\nlevel of the applicable benchmark is more or less likely to increase or decrease\nover the term of the\napplicable U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate notes. The actual future levels of the\nU.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate may be\nlower than any available historical data. An investment in the U.S. Dollar SOFR\nICE Swap Rate notes may involve more risk than investing in notes linked to\nbenchmarks or indices with\nestablished performance records, where a longer history of performance may be\navailable so that investors have more information on which to base an investment\ndecision.\n\nThe composition of the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aeis not the same as the U.S.\nDollar LIBOR ICE Swap Rate \u00aeand the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aeis not\nexpected to be a comparable substitute or replacement for the U.S. Dollar LIBOR\nICE Swap Rate \u00ae.\n\nThe composition\nof the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate is not the same as the U.S. Dollar LIBOR\nSwap Rate, and the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRate is not expected to be a comparable substitute or replacement for the U.S.\nDollar LIBOR Swap Rate. The U.S. Dollar LIBOR ICE Swap Rate seeks to represent the\nmid-price for the semi-annual fixed leg of an interest rate swap where the\nfloating leg is based on three-month U.S. Dollar\nLIBOR payable quarterly, calculated on the\n\nS-13\n\nbasis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. The U.S. Dollar SOFR\nICE Swap Rate seeks to represent the annual fixed leg of an interest rate swap\nwhere the floating leg is based on a compounded average of the daily SOFR\nadministered by the FRBNY (or any successor\nadministrator) compounded in arrears for twelve months payable annually using\nstandard market conventions, calculated on the basis of the actual number of days\nelapsed, with a year presumed to comprise 360 days.\n\nThe composition and characteristics of SOFR, which underlies the U.S. Dollar SOFR\nICE Swap Rate is not the same as those of three-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR, nor is\nSOFR the economic equivalent of three-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR. Thus, the U.S.\nDollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate has been designed with respect to swap transactions\nreferencing a rate that differs in significant respects from the rate referenced\nin the swap transactions with respect to which the\nU.S. Dollar LIBOR ICE Swap Rate was designed. As a result, the rate of interest on\nand value of the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRate notes may perform differently over time from the manner in which the interest\nrate and value of debt securities with comparable terms and provisions that were\nlinked to the\nU.S. Dollar LIBOR ICE Swap Rate would have performed. In addition, any failure of\nthe U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate to\ngain market acceptance could adversely affect the value of and market for the\naffected notes.\n\nA lack of input data may impact IBA\u0092s ability to calculate and publish the U.S.\nDollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aefor one or more tenors.\n\nThe input data for the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate is based on swaps\nreferencing SOFR as the floating leg. The U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate is\ndependent on receiving sufficient eligible input data, from the trading venue\nsources identified by IBA in\naccordance with the \u0093Waterfall\u0094 methodology, for applicable U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE\nSwap Rate tenors. The ability of the applicable trading venues to provide\nsufficient eligible\ninput data in accordance with IBA\u0092s \u0093waterfall\u0094 methodology depends on, among\nother things, there being a liquid market in swap contracts referencing SOFR on\nsuch trading venues, which in turn depends, among other things, on there\nbeing a liquid market in loans, floating rate debt securities and other financial\ncontracts referencing SOFR. Because SOFR\u0092s use as a reference rate for financial\ncontracts began relatively recently and the related market for SOFR-based swaps\nis relatively new, there is limited information on which to assess potential\nfuture liquidity in SOFR-based swap markets or in the market for SOFR-based\nfinancial contracts more generally.\n\nIf the market for SOFR-based swap contracts is not sufficiently liquid, or if the\nliquidity in such market proves to be volatile, this could\nresult in the inability of IBA to calculate the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate on\ncertain occasions, which could materially adversely affect the reliability of the\nU.S. Dollar SOFR\nICE Swap Rate, and could adversely affect the return on and value of the U.S.\nDollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate notes and the price at\nwhich you are able to sell such notes in the secondary market, if any. In\naddition, if SOFR does not maintain market acceptance for use as reference rates\nfor U.S. dollar-denominated financial contracts, uncertainty about SOFR may\nadversely affect\nthe return on and the value of the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate notes.\n\nThe information regarding the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aethat IBA makes\npublicly available is limited.\n\nCertain information and materials relating to the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\nis available on ICE Swap Rate Website. Currently, publicly available rate\ninformation for the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate can be viewed only on the ICE\nReport Center on the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Website, and, for any\nparticular day, the only\nrate available for viewing is the rate published for the preceding publication\nday. In addition, as of the date of this prospectus\n\nS-14\n\nsupplement, such rate appearing on the ICE Report Center is rounded to two decimal\nplaces and does not represent the actual U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate rates that\nwill be used to determine the applicable U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate for\npurposes of calculating interest on the\nU.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate notes (which rate will be that published on the\nDesignated SOFR Swap Rate Page and rounded to three decimal places). As of the\ndate of this prospectus\nsupplement, a paid subscription to the Bloomberg Professional Services service is\nrequired to obtain additional U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate data (such as\nhistorical U.S. Dollar\nSOFR ICE Swap Rate rates rounded to three decimal places). IBA has not indicated\nwhether such information will become publicly available in the future or whether\nthe U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE\nSwap Rate rates will be made available from another source. As a result of this\nlimited publicly available information, it may be difficult for an investor to\ndetermine the applicable\nU.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate for a specific date or dates.\n\nThe U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aemay be modified or discontinued, which could\nadversely affect the return on, value of or market for the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE\nSwap Rate \u00aenotes.\n\nIBA may make\nmethodological or other changes that could change the value of the U.S. Dollar\nSOFR ICE Swap Rate, including changes related to the method by which such rate is\ncalculated, eligibility\ncriteria applicable to the transactions used to calculate such rate, including the\ntrading venues for such transactions, or timing related to the determination or\npublication of such rate, or may cease the calculation or dissemination of such\nrate.\nDepending on the circumstances, such change or cessation could be implemented with\nlittle or no public notice or consultation. Any such changes may result in a\nreduction of the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate and, in turn, reduce the amount of\ninterest payable on the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate notes, which may adversely\naffect the\nreturn on, value of and market for the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate notes. In\naddition, the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRate is determined by IBA based on data received from sources other than us, and\nwe do not have any control over the methods of calculation, publication schedule,\nrate revision practices or\navailability of such data.\n\nIf the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aedoes not appear on the applicable\nDesignated SOFR Swap Rate Page at the applicable Relevant Time, and a U.S. Dollar\nSOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aeTransition Event and related U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\n\u00aeReplacement Date have not occurred, the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aewill be\ndetermined by the calculation agent (which may be one of our affiliates) using\nalternative methods, which will involve the exercise of discretion by the\ncalculation agent.\n\nIf the U.S. SOFR ICE Swap Ratedoes not appear on the applicable Designated SOFR\nSwap Rate Page at the Relevant Time on an applicable interest determination date\n(for example, as a result of insufficient liquidity in the underlying applicable\nSOFR swap contracts market) and\na U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Transition Event and related U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE\nSwap Rate Replacement Date have not\noccurred with respect to the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate, the calculation agent\nwill determine the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRate for such applicable interest determination date in its sole discretion, after\nconsulting such sources as it deems comparable to the Designated SOFR Swap Rate\nPage or to the sources from\nwhich IBA obtains the swap rate input data used by IBA to calculate such rate, or\nany other source or data it determines to be reasonable (including, if applicable,\nthe U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRate that was most recently published by IBA) for the purpose of estimating such\nrate. This method of determining the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate may result in\ninterest payments on the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate notes that are higher\nthan, lower than or that do not\notherwise correlate over time with the interest payments that would have been made\non the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate notes if the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\nhad been published in accordance with IBA\u0092s usual\n\nS-15\n\npolicies and procedures governing the determination and publication of such rate\nand appeared on the Designated SOFR Swap Rate Page at the Relevant Time. This\ncould adversely affect the rate of\ninterest on the affected U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate notes, which, in turn,\ncould adversely affect the return on, value of and market for such affected U.S.\nDollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRate notes and the price at which investors may be able to sell such affected U.S.\nDollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate notes. In addition,\nin determining the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate, the calculation agent may have\neconomic interests that are adverse to the investor\u0092s interests.\n\nIf a U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aeTransition Event and related U.S. Dollar SOFR\nICE Swap Rate \u00aeReplacement Date are determined to have occurred with respect to\nthe U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00ae, the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\n\u00aeReplacement may not be a suitable replacement for such rate.\n\nIf we or the calculation agent (after consulting with us) determines that a U.S.\nDollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRate Transition Event and related U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Replacement Date\nhave occurred with respect to the\nU.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate and a series of U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\nnotes, then the applicable U.S. Dollar\nSOFR ICE Swap Rate Replacement will replace the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate for\nsuch series of notes for all purposes\nrelating to the relevant notes in respect of all determinations on such date and\nfor all determinations on all subsequent dates, as set forth under \u0093Description of\nthe Notes\u0097 Effect of a U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Transition Event.\u0094 The U.S.\nDollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Replacement will be the alternate rate of interest that\nhas been selected\nby us or the calculation agent (after consulting with us) as an industry-accepted\nreplacement for the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate for U.S. dollar-denominated\nfloating-rate notes at\nsuch time, plus the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Replacement Adjustment (if\nany). After determination of the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Replacement,\ninterest on the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate notes will no longer be determined\nby reference to the U.S. Dollar\nSOFR ICE Swap Rate, but instead will be determined by reference to the U.S. Dollar\nSOFR ICE Swap Rate Replacement. If we or the\ncalculation agent (after consulting with us) determines that there is no such\nreplacement rate as of any applicable date of determination, then we or the\ncalculation agent (after consulting with us) will determine a substitute rate or\nsubstitute\nrate value to be used in place of the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate for that date\nof determination after consulting such sources as we or the calculation agent\n(after consulting with\nus) deems comparable to the sources (if any) on which such rate customarily was\npublished by IBA or authorized distributors prior to the applicable U.S. Dollar\nSOFR ICE Swap Rate\nTransition Event and U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Replacement Date or to the\nsources from which IBA obtains the SOFR swap rate input data used by IBA to\ncalculate the U.S. Dollar\nSOFR ICE Swap Rate, or any other source or data we or the calculation agent (after\nconsulting with us) determines to be reasonable (including, if applicable, the\nU.S. Dollar SOFR ICE\nSwap Rate that was most recently published by IBA) for the purpose of determining\nsuch substitute rate or substitute rate value.\n\nThere is no assurance that any U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Replacement will\nbe similar to the initial U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate in any respect as it is\ndetermined and published by IBA as of the date of this prospectus supplement, or\nthat any\nU.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Replacement will produce the economic equivalent of\nsuch U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate as a\nreference rate for determining the interest rate on the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRate notes, or otherwise be a suitable replacement or successor for such rate. In\naddition, it is\npossible that, at the time of the occurrence of a U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\nReplacement Event and related U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Replacement Date, no\nindustry- accepted interest rate as a replacement for the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE\nSwap Rate will exist and there\nmay be disagreement regarding the selection of a replacement rate for such U.S.\nDollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the determination of the\nU.S. Dollar SOFR\nICE Swap Rate Replacement will become effective without the consent of the holders\nof the notes of any other\n\nS-16\n\nparty. Use of the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Replacement may result in\ninterest payments on the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRate notes that are higher than, lower than or that do not otherwise correlate\nover time with the interest payments that would have been made on such U.S. Dollar\nSOFR ICE Swap Rate notes in the absence of a U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\nTransition Event and related U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Replacement Date. This\ncould adversely affect the interest rate and amount of interest payable on the\naffected U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRate notes, which, in turn, could adversely affect the return on, value of and\nmarket for such affected U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRate notes and the price at which investors may be able to sell such affected U.S.\nDollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate notes.\n\nIn addition, although the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Ratebenchmark transition\nprovisions set forth in \u0093Description of the Notes\u0097Effect of a U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE\nSwap Rate Transition\nEvent\u0094 provide for a U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Replacement Adjustment to be\nadded to the Unadjusted U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Replacement, such U.S.\nDollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Replacement Adjustment may be zero or negative, and\nthere is no guarantee that the\nU.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Replacement Adjustment (if any) will make the\nUnadjusted U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\nReplacement equivalent to the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate as it is calculated\nand published by IBA as of the date of this prospectus supplement.\n\nThe secondary trading market for the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aenotes may be\nlimited.\n\nPublication of the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\nbegan recently, and, as of the date of this prospectus supplement, use of the U.S.\nDollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate as a reference rate for floating-rate notes is limited.\nIn addition, the\nU.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate may not be widely used as such in the future. If\nthe U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate does not\nprove to be widely used as a benchmark in securities that are similar or\ncomparable to the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate notes, a trading market for the\nU.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRate notes may fail to develop or be maintained, and the trading price of the U.S.\nDollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate notes may be lower\nthan those of debt securities with rates of interest based on rates that are more\nwidely used.\n\nWe or our affiliates may publish research that could affect the market value of\nthe U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aenotes.\n\nWe or one or more of our affiliates may, at present or in the future, publish\nresearch reports with respect to movements in interest rates\ngenerally, or the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate specifically. This research may\nbe modified from time to time without notice and may express opinions or provide\nrecommendations that are\ninconsistent with purchasing or holding the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate notes.\nAny of these activities may affect the market value of the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE\nSwap Rate notes.\n\nS-17\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES\n\nThis section describes general terms and provisions of the notes. This section\nsupplements, and should be read together with, the general description of our debt\nsecurities, and the terms and provisions thereof, included in \u0093Description of Debt\nSecurities of Bank of America Corporation\u0094 in the accompanying prospectus. If\nthere is any inconsistency between the information in this prospectus supplement\nand the accompanying prospectus, the information in this prospectus supplement\nwill supersede the information in the accompanying prospectus.\n\nThe terms and provisions of the notes set forth in this prospectus supplement will\napply to a series of notes, to the extent applicable as set forth below, unless\notherwise specified in the applicable supplement. If the applicable supplement for\na series of notes includes terms and provisions that modify, conflict with or\notherwise are inconsistent with the applicable terms and provisions set forth\nbelow, then, regardless of whether or not the applicable terms and provisions set\nforth below are stated to apply \u0093unless otherwise specified in the applicable\nsupplement,\u0094 such terms and provisions set forth in the applicable supplement\nshall govern and control with respect to such series of notes.\n\nCertain capitalized or other defined terms that are used in this section\n\u0093Description of the Notes\u0094 have the specific meanings set forth herein. A listing\nof the pages on which certain of such terms are defined can be found under the\n\u0093Index of Certain Defined Terms\u0094 beginning on page S-67 of this prospectus\nsupplement.\n\nGeneral\n\nWe will issue the notes as part of a series of debt securities, Senior Medium-Term\nNotes, Series P, under an indenture dated as of\nJune 27, 2018, which is an exhibit to our registration statement and has been\nfiled with the SEC. The indenture is a contract between us, as issuer, and The\nBank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. In this prospectus\nsupplement,\nwe refer to The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as the \u0093trustee,\u0094 and\nwe refer to the indenture as supplemented from time to time as the \u0093Indenture.\u0094 In\naddition to the following summary of general terms of the notes\nand the Indenture, you should review the forms of the actual notes and the\nspecific provisions of the Indenture, as applicable, which are on file with the\nSEC.\n\nThe Indenture is subject to, and governed by, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. We\nand the selling agents, in the ordinary course of our\nrespective businesses, have conducted and may conduct business with the trustee or\nits affiliates. See \u0093Description of Debt Securities of Bank of America\nCorporation\u0097The Indenture\u0094 in the accompanying prospectus for more information\nabout the Indenture and the functions of the trustee. The Indenture does not limit\nthe amount of indebtedness that we may incur.\n\nThe\nnotes are being offered by us on a continuous basis. We may issue other debt\nsecurities under the Indenture from time to time in one or more series up to the\naggregate principal amount of the then-existing grant of authority by our board of\ndirectors.\n\nUnless otherwise provided in the applicable supplement, the minimum denomination\nof the notes will be $1,000 and any larger\namount that is a whole multiple of $1,000 (or the equivalent in other currencies).\n\nWe may issue the following types of notes: fixed-rate\nnotes, fixed/floating rate notes and floating-rate notes. For more information on\nthese types of notes, see below under \u0093\u0097Fixed-Rate Notes,\u0094 \u0093\u0097Fixed/Floating Rate\nNotes\u0094 and \u0093\u0097Floating-Rate Notes.\u0094 In\naddition, we may issue notes that do not bear interest.\n\nS-18\n\nRanking\n\nThe notes will be our unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and will rank\nequally in right of payment with all our other unsecured and\nunsubordinated obligations from time to time outstanding, except obligations that\nare subject to any priorities or preferences by law.\n\nBecause we are a holding company, our right to participate in any distribution of\nassets of any subsidiary upon such subsidiary\u0092s\nliquidation or reorganization or otherwise is subject to the prior claims of\ncreditors of that subsidiary, except to the extent we may be recognized as a\ncreditor of that subsidiary. Accordingly, our obligations will be structurally\nsubordinated to\nall existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries, and claimants should look\nonly to our assets for payments on the notes. Further, creditors of our\nsubsidiaries recapitalized pursuant to our resolution plan generally would be\nentitled to\npayment of their claims from the assets of the subsidiaries, including our\ncontributed assets. In addition, any of our obligations under the notes will be\nunsecured and, therefore, in a bankruptcy or similar proceeding, will effectively\nrank junior\nto our secured obligations to the extent of the value of the assets securing such\nobligations.\n\nSee \u0093Risk Factors\u0097Holders of the\ndebt securities of Bank of America and claimants under Bank of America\u0092s\nguarantees of the BofA Finance debt securities could be at greater risk of being\nstructurally subordinated if Bank of America sells or conveys all or substantially\nall of\nits assets to one or more of its majority-owned subsidiaries\u0094 in the accompanying\nprospectus.\n\nFixed-Rate Notes\n\nWe may issue notes that bear interest at a fixed rate as set forth in the\napplicable supplement, which we refer to as\n\u0093fixed-rate notes.\u0094 Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, each\nfixed-rate note will bear interest from its original issue date or from the most\nrecent date to which interest on the note has been paid or made available\nfor payment. Interest will accrue on the principal of a fixed-rate note at the\nfixed annual rate stated in the applicable supplement, until the principal is paid\nor made available for payment.\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, we will pay interest on\nany fixed-rate note monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or\nannually, as applicable, in arrears, on the days set forth in the applicable\nsupplement (each such day being an \u0093interest payment date\u0094 for a fixed-rate note)\nand at maturity. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, each\ninterest payment due on an interest payment date or the maturity date will include\ninterest accrued from, and including, the most recent interest payment date to\nwhich interest has been paid, or, if no interest has been paid, from the original\nissue\ndate, to, but excluding, the next interest payment date or the maturity date, as\nthe case may be. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement,\ninterest on fixed-rate notes will be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day\nyear consisting of twelve 30-day months, which we may refer to as the \u009330/360\u0094 day\ncount convention. We will make payments on fixed-rate notes as described\nbelow under \u0093\u0097Payment of Principal, Interest, and Other Amounts Payable.\u0094\n\nWe also may issue amortizing notes, which are\nfixed-rate notes for which combined principal and interest payments are made in\ninstallments over the life of the note. Payments on amortizing notes are applied\nfirst to interest due and then to the reduction of the unpaid principal amount.\nThe\nsupplement for an amortizing note will include a table setting forth repayment\ninformation.\n\nFixed/Floating Rate Notes\n\nWe may issue notes with elements of each of the fixed-rate notes described above\nand floating-rate notes described below. For\nexample, a note may bear interest at a fixed rate for some interest\n\nS-19\n\nperiods and at a floating rate for some other interest periods. We will describe\nthe determination of interest for any of these notes in the applicable supplement.\nFloating-Rate Notes We may issue notes that will bear interest at a floating\ninterest rate determined in accordance with the applicable terms and provisions\nset forth in the applicable supplement and below under \u0093\u0097General Terms and\nProvisions Applicable to Floating-Rate Notes,\u0094 \u0093\u0097U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\n\u00aeNotes,\u0094 \u0093\u0097Compounded SOFR Notes,\u0094 \u0093\u0097Simple Average SOFR Notes,\u0094 \u0093\u0097Simple Average\nFederal Funds (Effective) Rate Notes,\u0094 \u0093\u0097Effect of a U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRate \u00aeTransition Event and Related U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aeReplacement\nDate,\u0094 and \u0093\u0097Effect of a Benchmark Transition Event and Related Benchmark\nReplacement Date with Respect to SOFR,\u0094 as applicable.

Compounded SOFR notes. With respect to compounded SOFR notes, the\nbase rate for an interest period will be determined on the basis of a compounded\naverage of Daily SOFR (as defined under \u0093\u0097Compounded SOFR Notes\u0094 below) determined\nas set forth below under \u0093\u0097Compounded SOFR Notes\u0094 (such rate, \u0093compounded SOFR\u0094).\nAs so set forth, compounded SOFR will be determined in arrears at or near the end\nof each interest period in accordance with a formula using Daily SOFR published\nduring the applicable interest period or observation period relating to such\ninterest period, as the case may be. Compounded SOFR may be calculated in\naccordance with a number of different calculation conventions that are described\nmore fully under \u0093\u0097Compounded SOFR Notes\u0094 below.

The factor resulting from the day count S-22\n\nconvention will be, if so specified in the applicable supplement, one of the\nfollowing, or may be any other convention set forth in the applicable supplement:\n                                                                                  \n      a factor based on a 360-day year of twelve                                  \n      30-day months if the day count convention specified in the applicable       \n      supplement is \u009330/360\u0094;                                                       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      a factor equal to the actual number of days in the relevant period divided  \n      by 360 if the day count convention                                          \n      specified in the applicable supplement is \u0093Actual/360\u0094;                       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      a factor equal to the actual number of days in the relevant period divided  \n      by 365, or if any portion of that                                           \n      relevant period falls in a leap year, the sum of (A)\u00a0the actual number of   \n      days in that portion of the relevant period falling in a leap year divided  \n      by 366 and (B)\u00a0the actual number of days in that portion of the relevant    \n      period falling in                                                           \n      a non-leap year divided by 365, if the day count convention specified in    \n      the applicable supplement is \u0093Actual/Actual\u0094; or                              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      a factor equal to the actual number of days in the relevant period divided  \n      by 365, if the day count convention                                         \n      specified in the applicable supplement is \u0093Actual/365 (Fixed).\u0094               \n                                                                                  \nIf no day count convention is specified in the applicable supplement, the accrued\ninterest factor will be as follows:\n                                                                           \n      for U.S.\u00a0Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\u00ae notes, the                       \n      factor will be based on a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months; and  \n                                                                           \n                                                                                  \n      for compounded SOFR notes, simple average SOFR notes, simple average        \n      federal funds (effective) rate notes or any                                 \n      other floating-rate notes other than U.S.\u00a0Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\u00ae        \n      notes, the factor will be equal to the actual number of days in the         \n      relevant period divided by 360.                                             \n                                                                                  \nOn or before the relevant \u0093calculation date,\u0094 the calculation agent will calculate\nthe amount of interest that has accrued during each interest period in accordance\nwith the provisions set forth above.

All amounts used in\nor resulting from any calculation on floating-rate notes will be rounded to the\nnearest cent, in the case of U.S. dollars, or to the nearest corresponding\nhundredth of a unit, in the case of a currency other than U.S. dollars, with one-\nhalfcent or one-halfof a corresponding hundredth of a unit or more being rounded\nupward. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, all percentages\nresulting from any calculation with respect to a floating-rate note will be\nrounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percent, with\nfive one-millionthsof a percentage point rounded upwards, e.g., 9.876545% (or\n0.09876545) being rounded to 9.87655% (or 0.0987655). S-23\n\nThe interest rate on a floating-rate note may not be higher than the maximum rate\npermitted\nby New York law, as that rate may be modified by U.S. law of general application.\nUnder current New York law, the maximum rate of interest, subject to some\nexceptions, for any loan in an amount less than $250,000 is 16% and for any loan\nin the\namount of $250,000 or more but less than $2,500,000 is 25% per annum on a simple\ninterest basis. These limits do not apply to loans of $2,500,000 or more to any\none borrower.\n\nAt the request of a holder of any U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate note, the\ncalculation agent will provide the interest rate then in effect for that floating-\nrate note and, if already determined, the interest rate that is to take effect on\nthe next interest reset date.\n\nAt the request of a holder of any compounded SOFR note, simple average SOFR note\nor simple average federal funds (effective) rate note, the\ncalculation agent will provide compounded SOFR, simple average SOFR or the simple\naverage federal funds (effective) rate, as applicable, the interest rate and the\namount of interest accrued with respect to any interest period for such note,\nafter\ncompounded SOFR, simple average SOFR or the simple average federal funds\n(effective) rate, as applicable, and such interest rate and accrued interest have\nbeen determined.\n\nU.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aeNotes\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable supplement, the following terms and\nprovisions and other information will apply to each series of U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE\nSwap Rate \u00aenotes.\n\nThe interest rate in effect\nfrom, and including, the original issue date of a series of floating-rate notes\nto, but excluding, the first interest reset date (as defined below) for such\nseries of notes will be the initial interest rate set forth in the applicable\nsupplement or\ndetermined as set forth in the applicable supplement. The interest rate for a\nseries of U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate notes may be reset daily, weekly,\nmonthly, quarterly,\nsemi-annually, or annually, or at any other interval, as we specify in the\napplicable supplement. If so specified in the applicable supplement, a single\ninterest period may contain multiple interest reset dates, in which case the\ninterest rate with\nrespect to the applicable series of notes will reset on each such interest reset\ndate in accordance with the terms and provisions set forth in this subsection or\nas otherwise set forth in the applicable supplement, and interest will accrue on\nsuch\nseries of notes at the interest rate in effect from time to time during such\ninterest period. We refer to each date on which the interest rate for a series of\nU.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRate notes will reset as an \u0093interest reset date.\u0094 We will specify the interest\nreset dates in the applicable supplement. Interest reset dates may be adjusted in\naccordance with the\napplicable business day convention (as described below under \u0093\u0097Payment of\nPrincipal, Interest, and Other Amounts Payable\u0097Business Day Conventions\u0094)\nspecified in the applicable supplement.\n\nThe \u0093interest determination date\u0094 in respect of any interest reset date is the day\nto which the calculation agent will refer when\ndetermining the interest rate at which the applicable floating interest rate will\nreset. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the interest\ndetermination date for an interest reset date for a U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\nnote will be the second U.S. government securities business day (as defined below)\npreceding the interest reset date.\n\nThe calculation agent will determine the interest rate for an interest period in\nrespect of a U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate note on the interest determination\ndate corresponding to such interest reset date. In addition, on the applicable\ncalculation date, the calculation agent will calculate the amount of interest\nthat has accrued during each interest period in accordance with the provisions set\nforth under \u0093\u0097General Terms and Provisions Applicable to Floating-Rate\nNotes\u0097Accrual of Interest, Interest Payment Dates and Interest Periods for\nFloating-Rate Notes\n\nS-24\n\nOther than Compounded SOFR Notes Using the Payment Delay Convention\u0094 and \u0093\u0097General\nTerms and Provisions Applicable to Floating-Rate Notes\u0097Calculation of Interest\nAmounts\u0094\nabove.\n\nWith respect to a series of U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate notes,\nunless otherwise specified in the applicable supplement, the following terms will\nhave the meanings set forth below:\n\n\u0093U.S. Dollar\nSOFR ICE Swap Rate\u00ae\u0094 means, in respect of each applicable interest determination\ndate, the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRate for the applicable tenor specified in the applicable supplement, as\ncalculated and provided as of approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time (or any\namended time specified by the\nadministrator of the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate in the benchmark methodology)\non such interest determination date, by IBA as the administrator of the U.S.\nDollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRate (or a successor administrator), as such rate appears for the Applicable Index\non the Designated SOFR Swap Rate Page at the Relevant Time on such interest\ndetermination date, as\ndetermined by the calculation agent.\n\nIf the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\nfor the applicable tenor in respect of any interest period cannot be determined in\naccordance with the preceding paragraph on an applicable interest determination\ndate, and a U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Transition Event and related U.S.\nDollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Replacement Date have not occurred with respect to such\nrate, then the\nU.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate for such tenor for such interest determination date\nwill be determined by the calculation agent in its sole discretion after\nconsulting such sources as it\ndeems comparable to the sources (if any) on which such rate customarily is\npublished by the IBA (or a successor administrator) or authorized distributors or\nto the sources from which IBA (or such successor administrator) obtains the swap\nrate input\ndata used by IBA (or such successor administrator), to calculate such rate, or any\nother source or data it determines to be reasonable (including, if applicable, the\nU.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRate for the applicable tenor that was most recently published by IBA (or such\nsuccessor administrator)) for the purpose of estimating such rate.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the calculation agent (after consulting with us)\ndetermines that a U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Transition Event and related U.S.\nDollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Replacement Date have occurred prior to the applicable\nU.S. Dollar\nSOFR ICE Swap Rate Reference Time in respect of any determination of the U.S.\nDollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate for the applicable tenor\non any date, as described below under \u0093\u0097Effect of a U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\nTransition Event\u0094 below, then the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate benchmark\nreplacement provisions set forth below under such heading will thereafter apply to\nall determinations of the interest rate payable on the applicable series of notes.\n\n\u0093Applicable Index\u0094 means \u0093USISSO01 Index,\u0094 \u0093USISSO02 Index,\u0094 \u0093USISSO05 Index,\u0094\n\u0093USISSO10\nIndex,\u0094 \u0093USISSO20 Index,\u0094 \u0093USISSO30 Index,\u0094 and/or any other designation specified\nin the applicable supplement to be an \u0093Applicable Index.\u0094\n\n\u0093Designated SOFR Swap Rate Page\u0094 means the page entitled \u0093USD SOFR (11:15am NY)\u0094\nthat can be accessed on the Bloomberg\nProfessional Services service (or any other page or screen that replaces that page\nor screen on the Bloomberg Professional Services service or such other service or\nservices as may be nominated for the purpose of displaying rates for U.S. dollar\nswaps referencing SOFR by IBA or its successor or such other entity assuming the\nresponsibility of IBA or its successor in calculating rates for U.S. dollar swaps\nreferencing SOFR in the event IBA or its successor no longer does so).\n\n\u0093Relevant Time\u0094 means approximately 12:15, p.m., New York City time, or such other\ntime as may be specified in the applicable\nsupplement.\n\nS-25\n\nCompounded SOFR Notes Unless otherwise specified in the applicable supplement, the\nfollowing terms and provisions and other information will apply to compounded SOFR\nnotes.

Payment Delay Convention If the applicable\nsupplement for a series of compounded SOFR notes specifies that the \u0093payment delay\nconvention\u0094 applies, then, unless we specify otherwise in the applicable\nsupplement, the S-26\n\nfollowing terms and provisions will apply to such series. References to \u0093notes\u0094 in\nthis subsection \u0093\u0097Payment Delay Convention\u0094 are to compounded SOFR notes using the\npayment delay convention.\n\nFor a series of compounded SOFR notes using the payment delay convention, unless\nwe specify otherwise in\nthe applicable supplement, compounded SOFR, the interest rate, accrued interest,\nthe date on which the foregoing will be calculated by the calculation agent with\nrespect to an interest period, interest periods and timing of interest payments\nfor a\nparticular interest period will be determined in accordance with the following\nterms and provisions set forth in this subsection and in the other sections and\nsubsections of this prospectus supplement referenced below in this subsection. See\n\u0093\u0097General Terms and Provisions Applicable to Floating-Rate Notes\u0094 for a\ndescription of additional terms and provisions of the notes relating to the\ndetermination of interest rates and calculation of interest amounts (other than\nwith\nrespect to the accrual of interest, interest payment dates, interest periods and\nthe timing of such calculation of interest amounts, which will be as set forth\nbelow in this subsection) that will be applicable with respect to a series of\ncompounded\nSOFR notes using the payment delay convention, unless we specify otherwise in the\napplicable supplement.\n\nEach series of the notes will\naccrue interest from the original issue date of such series until the principal\namount is paid or made available for payment. We will pay interest on a series of\nthe notes on each interest payment date (as defined in the second following\nparagraph)\nwith respect to such series of notes. Each interest payment due on an interest\npayment date, the maturity date or the redemption date, as applicable, will\ninclude interest accrued from, and including, the most recent interest period\ndemarcation date\nto which interest has been paid, or, if no interest has been paid, from the\noriginal issue date, to, but excluding, the next interest period demarcation date\n(or, in the case of the final interest period, the maturity date or, if such notes\nare\nredeemed earlier, the redemption date) (each such period, an \u0093interest period\u0094 for\nsuch series of notes). The applicable supplement for a series of notes will\nspecify, among other terms and provisions, the \u0093interest period demarcation\ndates\u0094 with respect to such series.\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, interest period\ndemarcation dates and\ninterest periods (in addition to interest payment dates) may be adjusted in\naccordance with the business day convention specified in the applicable\nsupplement. If the scheduled final interest period demarcation date (which will be\nthe maturity date\nor, if we elect to redeem the notes, the redemption date) falls on a day that is\nnot a business day, the payment of principal and interest will be made on the next\nsucceeding business day, and such final interest period demarcation date will be\npostponed to such succeeding business day.\n\nWe will pay interest on each series of the notes in arrears, on the second\nbusiness day (or\nsuch other number of business days we may specify in the applicable supplement)\nfollowing each interest period demarcation date (each such day being an \u0093interest\npayment date\u0094 for such notes); provided that the interest payment date with\nrespect to the final interest period for a series of the notes will be the\nmaturity date for such series or, if the notes are redeemed earlier, the\nredemption date. On each interest payment date, we will pay accrued interest for\nthe most recently\ncompleted interest period.\n\nIf an interest period demarcation date other than the final interest period\ndemarcation date otherwise would\nfall on a day that is not a business day, then such interest period demarcation\ndate will be postponed to the next day that is a business day, except that, if the\nnext succeeding business day falls in the next calendar month, then such interest\nperiod demarcation date will be advanced to the immediately preceding day that is\na business day. If the scheduled final interest period demarcation date (which\nwill be the maturity date or, if we elect to redeem the notes earlier, the\nredemption\ndate) falls on a day that is not a business day, the payment of principal and\ninterest will be made on the next succeeding business day, and such final interest\nperiod demarcation date\n\nS-27\n\nwill be postponed to such succeeding business day.

See \u0093\u0097General Terms and\nProvisions Applicable to Floating-Rate Notes\u0094 for a description of additional\nterms and provisions of the notes relating to the determination of interest rates,\naccrual of interest, interest payment dates, interest periods and calculation of\ninterest amounts (other than the timing of such calculation, which will be as set\nforth below in this subsection) that will be applicable with respect to each\nseries of simple average federal funds (effective) rate notes, unless we specify\notherwise in the applicable supplement. S-34\n\nThe interest rate for a series of the notes will be determined by reference to the\nsimple\naverage federal funds (effective) rate. For each interest period for a series of\nthe notes, the simple average federal funds (effective) rate will be equal to the\nsum of the daily base rate for each calendar day in such interest period divided\nby\nthe number of calendar days in such interest period. Except as provided below for\nnotes for which a \u0093rate lookback\u0094 or \u0093rate cut-off date\u0094 applies, and unless\notherwise specified in the\napplicable supplement, the \u0093daily base rate\u0094 with respect to each calendar day in\na relevant interest period will be the federal funds (effective) rate in respect\nof such day; provided that for any calendar day in an interest period that\nis not a New York banking day, the daily base rate for such calendar day will be\nthe federal funds (effective) rate in respect of the New York banking day in such\ninterest period immediately preceding such calendar day.\n\nFor purposes of calculating the simple average federal funds (effective) rate in\naccordance with the foregoing, either a \u0093rate\nlookback\u0094 or \u0093rate cut-off date\u0094 will apply to your notes, as specified in the\napplicable supplement.\n\nIf the applicable supplement specifies that a \u0093rate lookback\u0094 applies, then,\nnotwithstanding the terms and provisions set forth in\nthe third preceding paragraph: (i) the \u0093daily base rate\u0094 with respect to each New\nYork banking day in a relevant interest period will be the federal funds\n(effective) rate in respect of the New York banking day falling two New York\nbanking days (or such other number of New York banking days as may be specified in\nthe applicable supplement) prior to such New York banking day (such number of\ndays, the \u0093lookback period\u0094), and (ii) the \u0093daily base rate\u0094\nwith respect to each calendar day in a relevant interest period that is not a New\nYork banking day will be equal to the daily base rate in effect for the\nimmediately preceding New York banking day.\n\nIf the applicable supplement specifies that a \u0093rate cut-off date\u0094 applies then,\nnotwithstanding the terms and provisions set forth in the fourth preceding\nparagraph, for each calendar day in an interest period falling after the rate cut-\noff date for such interest period, the daily base\nrate for each such calendar day will be the federal funds (effective) rate in\nrespect of such rate cut-off date. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable\nsupplement, the \u0093rate cut-off date\u0094 for an interest period, if applicable, will be\nthe second New York banking day prior to the interest payment date for such\ninterest period.\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, each interest payment\ndue on an interest payment date or maturity date for a series\nof the notes will include interest accrued from, and including, the most recent\ninterest payment date to which interest has been paid, or, if no interest has been\npaid, from the original issue date, to, but excluding, the next interest payment\ndate\nor the maturity date, as the case may be (each such period, an \u0093interest period\u0094\nfor such series of notes).\n\nThe calculation\nagent will determine the simple average federal funds (effective) rate, the\ninterest rate and accrued interest for each interest period in arrears as soon as\nreasonably practicable prior to the relevant interest payment date and will notify\nus of\nthe simple average federal funds (effective) rate and such interest rate and\naccrued interest for each interest period as soon as reasonably practicable after\nsuch determination, but in any event by the business day immediately prior to the\ninterest\npayment date.\n\nFor purposes of the foregoing terms and provisions, unless otherwise provided in\nthe applicable supplement, the following\nterms have the meanings set forth below:\n\n\u0093Federal funds (effective) rate,\u0094 for any New York banking day, will be the rate\nfor\nsuch day as displayed on the Reuters Screen Page FEDFUNDS1 (or any successor\nservice or any other page that replaces that page on that service) under the\nheading \u0093EFFECT\u0094 on the New York banking day\n\nS-35\n\nnext following such day (such next following New York banking day, the\n\u0093publication day\u0094). With respect to any New York banking day, if such rate is not\ndisplayed on Reuters Screen Page\nFEDFUNDS1 by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the applicable publication day, the\nfederal funds (effective) rate for such New York banking day will be the federal\nfunds (effective) rate for such New York banking day, as published on the\napplicable\npublication day in H.15 Daily Update under the heading \u0093Federal Funds\n(Effective).\u0094 If such rate is not published in H.15 Daily Update by 5:00 p.m., New\nYork City time, on such publication day, the federal funds (effective) rate for\nsuch\nNew York banking day will be the federal funds (effective) rate as published for\nthe first preceding New York banking day for which the federal funds (effective)\nrate can be determined in accordance with the first sentence of this paragraph.\n\nAs used in the foregoing terms and provisions relating to the determination of the\nfederal funds (effective) rate:\n\n\u0093H.15 Daily Update\u0094 means the Selected Interest Rates (Daily)-H.15 release of the\nBoard of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (the \u0093Federal Reserve\u0094), available at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/, or any successor site or publication.\n\n\u0093New York banking day\u0094 means a day of the work week other than a holiday observed\nby the FRBNY.\n\nEffect of a Benchmark Transition Event and Related Benchmark Replacement Date with\nRespect to SOFR\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the provisions set forth\nin this section \u0093\u0097Effect of a Benchmark Transition Event and Related Benchmark\nReplacement Date with Respect to SOFR,\u0094 which we refer to as the \u0093SOFR benchmark\ntransition provisions,\u0094 will apply to all compounded SOFR notes and simple average\nSOFR notes.

Additional Information About SOFR As further\ndescribed in this prospectus supplement, the interest rate on compounded SOFR\nnotes and simple average SOFR notes will be determined by reference to a rate\nbased on SOFR. In general, the following discussion relating to SOFR is based on\ninformation available on the SOFR Administrator\u0092s Website. SOFR was selected by\nthe FRBNY in 2017 as a replacement for U.S. LIBOR and since 2018 has been\npublished by the FRBNY and is intended to be a broad measure of the cost of\nborrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. The SOFR\nAdministrator reports that SOFR includes all trades in the Broad General\nCollateral Rate, plus bilateral Treasury repurchase agreement (\u0093repo\u0094)\ntransactions cleared through the delivery-versus-payment service offered by the\nFixed Income Clearing Corporation (the \u0093FICC\u0094), a subsidiary of The Depository\nTrust & Clearing Corporation (\u0093DTCC\u0094). SOFR is filtered by FRBNY to remove a\nportion of the foregoing transactions considered to be \u0093specials.\u0094 According to\nFRBNY, \u0093specials\u0094 are repos for specific-issue collateral which take place at\ncash-lending rates below those for general collateral repos because cash providers\nare willing to accept a lesser return on their cash in order to obtain a\nparticular security. SOFR is calculated as a volume-weighted median of\ntransaction-level tri-partyrepo data collected from The Bank of New York Mellon,\nwhich currently acts as the clearing bank for the S-42\n\ntri-partyrepo market, as well as General Collateral Finance Repo transaction data\nand data on bilateral U.S. Treasury repo transactions cleared through the FICC\u0092s\ndelivery-versus-payment service. FRBNY notes that it obtains information from DTCC\nSolutions LLC, an affiliate of DTCC. FRBNY currently publishes SOFR daily on each\nU.S. government securities business day at approximately 8:00 a.m. ET on the SOFR\nAdministrator\u0092s Website. Historical data for an earlier period can be obtained on\nthe SOFR Administrator\u0092s Website through the historical data search function.\nAdditional Information about U.S. Dollar SOFR Ice Swap Rate \u00ae In general, the\nfollowing discussion relating to the U.S. Dollar SOFR Ice Swap Rate \u00aeis based on\ninformation available on the IBA website. The U.S. Dollar SOFR Ice Swap Rate\n\u00aerepresents the mid-pricefor interest rate swaps (the fixed leg) and swap spreads\n(the applicable mid-priceminus a corresponding specified government bond yield) in\nUSD in various tenors ranging from 1 year to 30 years at particular specified\ntimes of the day. In June 2020, IBA implemented a waterfall approach for the U.S.\nDollar SOFR Ice Swap Rate \u00aemethodology, which the U.S. Dollar SOFR Ice Swap Rate\n\u00aefollows. Subsequently, the U.S. Dollar SOFR Ice Swap Rate \u00aelaunched by IBA for\nuse as a benchmark on November 8, 2021 in order to aid the market\u0092s transition to\nSOFR and away from U.S. Dollar LIBOR. To calculate the U.S. Dollar SOFR Ice Swap\nRate \u00ae, IBA relies on eligible, executable prices and volumes provided by\nregulated, electronic, trading venues and, if such trading venues do not provide\nsufficient eligible input data, eligible dealer to client prices and volumes\ndisplayed electronically by trading venues. If there is insufficient eligible\ninput data to calculate a rate in accordance with the foregoing sentence, IBA uses\nmovement interpolation, where possible for applicable tenors, to calculate a rate.\nWhere it is not possible to calculate a U.S. Dollar SOFR Ice Swap Rate \u00aefor an\napplicable tenor in accordance with the foregoing, then IBA\u0092s Insufficient Data\nPolicy as set forth on the U.S. Dollar SOFR Ice Swap Rate \u00aewebsite will apply and\n\u0093No Publication\u0094 will be published for the U.S. Dollar SOFR Ice Swap Rate \u00aeof the\napplicable tenor. The U.S. Dollar SOFR Ice Swap Rate \u00aefor the various applicable\ntenors as reported on the ICE Report Center is expressed as an integer rounded to\ntwo decimal places; however, for purpose of calculations of interest with respect\nto the notes, such rate will be deemed to be expressed as a percentage.

Unless we specify otherwise in\nthe applicable supplement, the principal and interest payable at maturity, or\nearlier redemption, will be paid to the holder of the note at the time of payment\nby the paying agent. Except as set forth in the following sentence, and unless we\nspecify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the record date for any interest\npayment for a note in book-entry only form will be the date that is one business\nday prior to the applicable payment date. If the note is (i) in book-entry only\nform and held through DTC and is denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars\nor (ii) in a form that is other than book-entry only, and unless we specify\notherwise in the applicable supplement, the regular record date for an interest\npayment date will be the fifteenth calendar day prior to the applicable interest\npayment date as originally scheduled to occur, whether or not such record date is\na business day.

If no business day convention is specified in the applicable\nsupplement, then, with respect to any interest period during which the note bears\ninterest at a fixed rate, the following unadjusted business day convention will\napply, and, with respect to any interest period during which the note bears\ninterest at a floating rate, the modified following business day convention\n(adjusted) will apply.

Payment of\nAdditional Amounts If we so specify in the applicable supplement, and subject to\nthe exceptions and limitations set forth in the accompanying prospectus under\n\u0093Description of Bank of America Corporation Debt Securities\u0097Payment of Additional\nAmounts,\u0094 we will pay to the holder of notes that is a \u0093non-U.S.person\u0094 (as\ndefined in the accompanying prospectus under \u0093Description of Bank of America\nCorporation Debt Securities\u0097Payment of Additional Amounts\u0094) additional amounts to\nensure that every net payment on such notes will not be less, due to the payment\nof U.S. withholding tax, than the amount then otherwise due and payable. For this\npurpose, a \u0093net payment\u0094 on such notes means a payment by us or any paying agent,\nincluding payment of principal and interest, after deduction for any present or\nfuture tax, assessment, or other governmental charge of the United States (other\nthan a territory or possession). These additional amounts will constitute\nadditional interest on the note. For this purpose, U.S. withholding tax means a\nwithholding tax of the United States, other than a territory or possession. Except\nas specifically provided in the accompanying prospectus under \u0093Description of Bank\nof America Corporation Debt Securities\u0097Payment of Additional Amounts,\u0094 we will not\nbe required to S-48\n\nmake any payment of any tax, assessment, or other governmental charge imposed by\nany government, political subdivision, or taxing authority of that government.\n\nIf we so specify in the applicable supplement, we may redeem the notes, in whole\nbut not in part, at any time before maturity if we have or\nwill become obligated to pay additional amounts as a result of a change in, or an\namendment to, United States tax laws or regulations, as described in the\naccompanying prospectus under \u0093Description of Bank of America Corporation Debt\nSecurities\u0097Redemption for Tax Reasons,\u0094 subject to any required approvals as\ndescribed below under \u0093\u0097Redemption.\u0094\n\nRedemption by Bank of America\n\nThe applicable supplement will indicate whether we have the option to redeem notes\nprior to their\nstated maturity. If we may redeem the notes prior to their stated maturity, the\napplicable supplement will indicate the redemption price and method for\nredemption. See also \u0093Description of Debt Securities of Bank of America\nCorporation\u0097Redemption\u0094 in the accompanying prospectus. The redemption of any note\nthat is our eligible long-term debt (\u0093LTD\u0094) will require the prior approval of the\nFederal Reserve if after such redemption we would fail to\nsatisfy our requirements as to eligible LTD or total loss-absorbing capacity under\nthe total-loss absorbing capacity (\u0093TLAC\u0094) Rules.\n\nRepayment at Option of Holder\n\nThe applicable supplement will indicate whether the notes can be repaid at the\nholder\u0092s option\nprior to their stated maturity. If the notes may be repaid prior to their stated\nmaturity, the applicable supplement will indicate the amount at which we will\nrepay the notes and the procedure for repayment.\n\nReopenings\n\nWe have the ability to \u0093reopen,\u0094 or increase after the issuance date, the\nprincipal amount of a particular tranche or series of our\nnotes without notice to the holders of existing notes by selling additional notes\nhaving the same terms, provided that such additional notes shall be fungible for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes. However, any new notes of this kind may have a\ndifferent offering price and may begin to bear interest (if any) at a different\ndate.\n\nOther Provisions\n\nAny provisions with respect to the determination of an interest rate basis, the\nspecification of interest rate basis, the calculation of the\napplicable interest rate, the amounts payable at maturity, earlier redemption or\nrepayment, as the case may be, the interest payment dates, or any other related\nmatters for a particular tranche of notes, may be modified as described in the\napplicable supplement.\n\nRepurchase\n\nWe, or our affiliates, may purchase at any time our notes by tender, in the open\nmarket at prevailing prices or in private transactions at\nnegotiated prices. If we purchase notes in this manner, we have the discretion to\nhold, resell, or cancel any repurchased notes. The repurchase of any note that is\nour eligible LTD will require the prior approval of the Federal Reserve if after\nsuch\nrepurchase we would fail to satisfy our requirements as to eligible LTD or total\nloss-absorbing capacity under the TLAC Rules.\n\nS-49\n\nForm, Exchange, Registration, and Transfer of Notes\n\nWe will issue notes only in fully registered form, without coupons. Unless we\nspecify otherwise in the applicable supplement, we will issue\nnotes in book-entry only form. This means that we will not issue certificated\nnotes in definitive form to each beneficial owner. Instead, the notes will be in\nthe form of a global note or a master global note, in fully registered form,\nregistered\nand held in the name of and deposited with or on behalf of the applicable\ndepository or a nominee of that depository. Unless we specify otherwise in the\napplicable supplement, the depository for the notes will be DTC. Such notes will\nbe registered\nin the name of Cede & Co. (DTC\u0092s partnership nominee) or any other name as may be\nrequested by an authorized representative of DTC and will be deposited with DTC.\nFor notes denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, the\napplicable supplement may specify that such notes will be cleared through\nEuroclear Bank SA/NV (\u0093Euroclear\u0094) and/or Clearstream Banking S.A., Luxembourg\n(\u0093Clearstream\u0094), rather than DTC. DTC, Euroclear, and Clearstream, as\ndepositories for global securities, and some of their policies and procedures, are\ndescribed under \u0093Registration and Settlement\u0097Depositories for Global Securities\u0094\nin the accompanying prospectus. For more information about book-entry\nonly notes and the procedures for registration, settlement, exchange, and transfer\nof book-entry only notes, see \u0093Description of Debt Securities of Bank of America\nCorporation\u0097Form and Denomination of Debt Securities\u0094 and\n\u0093Registration and Settlement\u0094 in the accompanying prospectus.\n\nUnless specified otherwise in the applicable supplement, your\nnotes will be represented by a kind of global note that we refer to as a master\nglobal note. This kind of global note represents multiple notes that have\ndifferent terms and are issued at different times. Each note evidenced by a master\nnote will be\nidentified by the trustee on a schedule to the master note. If we specify in the\napplicable supplement that your notes will not be represented by a master global\nnote, then all notes represented by the same global note will have the same terms.\n\nIf we ever issue notes in definitive form, unless we specify otherwise in the\napplicable supplement, those notes will be in registered form,\nand the exchange, registration, or transfer of those notes will be governed by the\nIndenture and the procedures described under \u0093Description of Debt Securities of\nBank of America Corporation\u0097Exchange, Registration, and Transfer\u0094 in\nthe accompanying prospectus.\n\nS-50\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION (CONFLICTS OF INTEREST)\n\nWe are offering the notes for sale on a continuing basis through the selling\nagents. The selling agents may act either on a principal\nbasis or on an agency basis. We may offer the notes at varying prices relating to\nprevailing market prices at the time of resale, as determined by the selling\nagents, or, if so specified in the applicable supplement, for resale at a fixed\npublic\noffering price. The applicable supplement will set forth the initial price for the\nnotes, or whether they will be sold at varying prices.\n\nIf we sell notes on an agency basis, we will pay a commission to the selling agent\nto be negotiated at the time of sale. The commission will\nbe determined at the time of sale and will be specified in the applicable\nsupplement. Each selling agent will use its reasonable best efforts when we\nrequest it to solicit purchases of the notes as our agent.\n\nUnless otherwise agreed and specified in the applicable supplement, if notes are\nsold to a selling agent acting as principal, for its own\naccount, or for resale to one or more investors or other purchasers, including\nother broker-dealers, then any notes so sold will be purchased by that selling\nagent at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes less a\ncommission that\nwill be a percentage of the principal amount determined as described above. Notes\nsold in this manner may be resold by the selling agent to investors and other\npurchasers from time to time in one or more transactions, including negotiated\ntransactions, at a fixed public offering price or at varying prices determined at\nthe time of sale, or the notes may be resold to other dealers for resale to\ninvestors. The selling agents may allow any portion of the discount received in\nconnection\nwith the purchase from us to the dealers, but the discount allowed to any dealer\nwill not be in excess of the discount to be received by the selling agent from us.\nAfter the initial public offering of notes, the selling agent may change the\npublic\noffering price or the discount allowed to dealers.\n\nWe also may sell notes directly to investors, without the involvement of any\nselling\nagent. In this case, we would not be obligated to pay any commission or discount\nin connection with the sale, and we would receive 100% of the principal amount of\nthe notes so sold, unless otherwise specified in the applicable supplement.\n\nWe will name any selling agents or other persons through which we sell any notes,\nas well as any commissions or discounts payable to those\nselling agents or other persons, in the applicable supplement. As of the date of\nthis prospectus supplement, our selling agent is BofA Securities, Inc. (\u0093BofAS\u0094).\nWe will enter into a distribution agreement with BofAS that describes the\noffering of notes by them as agent and as principal. A form of distribution\nagreement will be filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this\nprospectus supplement forms a part. We also may accept offers to purchase notes\nthrough\nadditional selling agents on substantially the same terms and conditions,\nincluding commissions, as would apply to purchases through BofAS under the\ndistribution agreement. If a selling agent purchases notes as principal, that\nselling agent usually\nwill be required to enter into a separate purchase agreement for the notes, and\nmay be referred to in that purchase agreement and the applicable supplement, along\nwith any other selling agents, as an \u0093underwriter.\u0094\n\nWe have the right to withdraw, cancel, or modify the offer made by this prospectus\nsupplement without notice. We will have the sole right to\naccept offers to purchase notes, and we, in our absolute discretion, may reject\nany proposed purchase of notes in whole or in part. Each selling agent will have\nthe right, in its reasonable discretion, to reject in whole or in part any\nproposed\npurchase of notes through that selling agent.\n\nAny selling agent participating in the distribution of the notes may be considered\nto be an\nunderwriter, as that term is defined in the Securities Act. We have agreed to\nindemnify each selling\n\nS-51\n\nagent and certain other persons against certain liabilities, including liabilities\nunder the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments that the selling agents may\nbe required to make. We also have agreed to reimburse the selling agents for\ncertain expenses. The notes will not have an established trading market when\nissued, and we do not intend to list the notes on any securities exchange, unless\notherwise specified in the applicable supplement. Any selling agent may purchase\nand sell notes in the secondary market from time to time. However, no selling\nagent is obligated to do so, and any selling agent may discontinue making a market\nin the notes at any time without notice.

The stabilizing manager (or persons acting on its behalf),\nif any, may over allot notes or effect transactions with a view to supporting the\nmarket price of the applicable notes during the stabilization period at a level\nhigher than that which might otherwise prevail. However, stabilization action may\nnot necessarily occur. Any stabilization action may begin on or after the date on\nwhich adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offer of the applicable\nseries of notes is made and, if begun, may be ended at any time, but it must end\nno later than 30 days after the date on which we receive the proceeds of the\napplicable offering of notes, or no later than 60 days after the date of allotment\nof the applicable series of notes, whichever is the earlier. Any stabilization\naction or over allotment must be conducted by the stabilizing manager (or persons\nacting on its behalf) in accordance with all applicable laws and rules and will be\nundertaken at the offices of the stabilizing manager (or persons acting on its\nbehalf) and, if applicable, on the applicable securities exchange on which the\napplicable series of notes is listed (if any). Any of these activities may\nstabilize or maintain the market price of the securities above independent market\nlevels. The selling agents are not required to engage in these activities, and may\nend any of these activities at any time. The stabilizing manager (if any) may\nconduct these activities in the over-the-countermarket or otherwise. If the\nstabilizing manager (if any) commences any of these transactions, it may\ndiscontinue them at any time.

Neither this prospectus supplement nor the accompanying prospectus\nconstitutes an approved prospectus for the purposes of the UK Prospectus\nRegulation. The expression \u0093UK Prospectus Regulation\u0094 means Regulation (EU)\n2017/1129\nas it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal)\nAct of 2018 (as amended, the \u0093EUWA\u0094).\n\nThis\nprospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus are only for distribution to\nand directed at: (i) in the United Kingdom, persons having professional experience\nin matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the\nFinancial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as\namended) (the \u0093Order\u0094) and high net worth entities falling within Article 49(2)(a)\nto (d) of the Order; (ii) persons who are outside the United Kingdom;\nand (iii) any other person to whom it can otherwise be lawfully distributed (all\nsuch persons together being referred to as \u0093Relevant Persons\u0094).

Consequently, no key information document\nrequired by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the \u0093EU PRIIPs Regulation\u0094)\nfor offering or selling the\nnotes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been\nprepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them\navailable to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the EU PRIIPs\nRegulation.\n\nIMPORTANT\u0097UK RETAIL INVESTORS\u0097The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or\notherwise made available to\nand should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor\nin the United Kingdom (the \u0093UK\u0094). For these purposes, a retail investor means a\nperson who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point\n(8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of UK domestic\nlaw by virtue of the EUWA; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of\nthe FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement\nDirective (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional\nclient as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as\nit forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a\nqualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation.\nConsequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014\nas it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the \u0093UK PRIIPs\nRegulation\u0094) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available\nto retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling\nthe notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK\nmay be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.\n\nNotification under Section 309B(1) of the Securities and Futures Act 2001 (the\n\u0093SFA\u0094)\u0097Unless otherwise stated in the applicable supplement in respect of any\nnotes, all notes issued or to be issued using this prospectus supplement and the\naccompanying prospectus shall be prescribed capital\nmarkets products (as defined in the Securities and Futures (Capital Markets\nProducts) Regulations 2018) and Excluded Investment Products (as defined in the\nMonetary Authority of Singapore (the \u0093MAS\u0094) Notice SFA 04-N12: Notice on the Sale\nof Investment Products and MAS Notice FAA-N16: Notice on Recommendations on\nInvestment Products).\n\nINVESTORS SHOULD NOTE THAT NEITHER BOFA FINANCE LLC NOR BANK OF AMERICA\nCORPORATION IS LICENCED TO OPERATE AS A BANK IN ITALY.\n\nUnless we indicate otherwise or unless the context requires otherwise, all\nreferences in this prospectus supplement to \u0093BofA\nFinance,\u0094 \u0093we,\u0094 \u0093us,\u0094 \u0093our,\u0094 or similar references are to BofA Finance LLC, and\nnot to any of its affiliates, including Bank of America Corporation. In this\nprospectus supplement, references to \u0093floating-rate\nnotes\u0094 mean both floating-rate notes and fixed/floating rate notes or indexed\nnotes at any time such fixed/floating rate notes or indexed notes bear interest at\na floating rate.\n\nAny term that is used, but not defined, in this prospectus supplement has the\nmeaning set forth in the accompanying prospectus. Certain terms\nthat are used in this prospectus supplement have the specific meanings set forth\nherein. A listing of the pages on which such terms are defined can be found in the\n\u0093Index of Certain Defined Terms\u0094 beginning on page S-69 of this prospectus\nsupplement.\n\nWhen we refer to \u0093you\u0094 or \u0093investors\u0094 in this prospectus supplement, we mean those\nwho invest in the\nnotes being offered by this prospectus supplement, whether they are the registered\nholders or only indirect owners of those notes. When we refer to \u0093your notes\u0094 in\nthis prospectus supplement, we mean the notes in which you will hold a\ndirect or indirect interest.\n\nS-5\n\nRISK FACTORS\n\nYour investment in the notes involves significant risks. Your decision to purchase\nthe notes should be made only after carefully considering the risks of an\ninvestment in the notes, including those discussed below, in the accompanying\nprospectus beginning on page 7, and in the applicable supplement(s) for the\nspecific notes, with your advisors in light of your particular circumstances. The\nnotes are not an appropriate investment for you if you are not knowledgeable about\nsignificant elements of the notes or financial matters in general. For information\nregarding risks and uncertainties that may materially affect the business and\nresults of Bank of America, please refer to the information under the caption\n\u0093Item 1A. Risk Factors\u0094 in its annual report on Form 10-Kfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, which is incorporated by reference in the accompanying\nprospectus, as well as those risks and uncertainties discussed in subsequent\nfilings of Bank of America that are incorporated by reference in the accompanying\nprospectus. You also should review the risk factors that will be set forth in\nother documents that Bank of America will file after the date of this prospectus\nsupplement.\n\nThis discussion of risks uses a number of capitalized and other defined terms that\nare defined elsewhere in this prospectus supplement. A listing of the pages on\nwhich certain of such terms are defined can be found under the \u0093Index of Certain\nDefined Terms\u0094 beginning on page S-69 of this prospectus supplement.\n\nRisks Relating to the Notes\n\nHolders of indexed notes are subject to important risks that are not associated\nwith more conventional debt securities.\n\nIf you invest in\nindexed notes, you will be subject to significant risks not associated with\nconventional fixed-rate or floating-rate debt securities. These risks include the\npossibility that the applicable market measures may be subject to fluctuations,\nand the\npossibility that you will receive a lower amount of, or no, principal, premium, or\ninterest, and at different times, than expected. In recent years, many securities,\ncurrencies, commodities, interest rates, indices, and other market measures have\nexperienced volatility, and this volatility may be expected in the future.\nHowever, past experience is not necessarily indicative of what may occur in the\nfuture. BofA Finance has no control over a number of matters, including economic,\nfinancial,\nand political events, that are important in determining the existence, magnitude,\nand longevity of market volatility and other risks and their impact on the value\nof, or payments made on, the indexed notes. Further, you should assume that there\nis\nno statutory, judicial, or administrative authority that addresses directly the\ncharacterization of some types of indexed notes or similar instruments for U.S.\nfederal or other income tax purposes. As a result, the income tax consequences of\nan\ninvestment in indexed notes are not certain. In considering whether to purchase\nindexed notes, you should be aware that the calculation of amounts payable on\nindexed notes may involve reference to a market measure determined by one of our\naffiliates\nor prices or values that are published solely by third parties or entities which\nare not regulated by the laws of the United States. Additional risks that you\nshould consider in connection with an investment in indexed notes are set forth in\nthe\napplicable supplement(s) for the notes.\n\nHedging activities of affiliates may affect your return at maturity and the market\nvalue of the notes.\n\nAt any time, affiliates of BofA Finance may engage in hedging activities relating\nto the notes. This hedging activity, in\nturn, may increase or decrease the market value of the notes. In addition,\naffiliates of BofA Finance may acquire a long or short position in the notes from\ntime to time. All or\n\nS-6\n\na portion of these positions may be liquidated at or about the time of maturity of\nthe notes. The aggregate amount and the composition of these positions are likely\nto vary over time. However,\nBofA Finance cannot assure you that its activities or its affiliates\u0092 activities\nwill not adversely affect the market value of the notes.\n\nThe hedging and trading activities of affiliates of BofA Finance may create\nconflicts of interest with you.\n\nFrom time to time during the term of any notes and in connection with the\ndetermination of the payments on notes, BofA Finance or its\naffiliates may enter into hedging transactions or adjust or close out existing\nhedging transactions. BofA Finance or its affiliates also may enter into hedging\ntransactions relating to other notes or instruments that BofA Finance or Bank of\nAmerica\nmay issue, some of which may have returns calculated in a manner related to that\nof particular notes. BofA Finance or its affiliates will price these hedging\ntransactions with the intent to realize a profit, considering the risks inherent\nin these\nhedging activities, whether the value of the notes increases or decreases. These\nhedging activities may result in a profit that is more or less than initially\nexpected, or could result in a loss.\n\nOne or more broker-dealer affiliates of BofA Finance, including BofA Securities,\nInc., may engage in trading activities that are not for your\naccount or on your behalf. These trading activities may present a conflict of\ninterest between your interest in the notes and the interests of such affiliates.\nThese trading activities could influence the market measure or other reference\nasset (if\nany) for the notes or secondary trading (if any) in the notes, or otherwise could\nbe adverse to your interests as a beneficial owner of the notes.\n\nThere may be potential conflicts of interest involving the calculation agent,\nwhich may be an affiliate of ours.\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the calculation agent\nwill be one of our affiliates, including BofA Securities,\nInc., Merrill Lynch Commodities, Inc., or Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc. We\nmay remove and/or appoint different calculation agents from time to time after the\noriginal issue date of a series of notes, or we may elect to act as the\ncalculation\nagent with respect to such series of notes, in each case without your consent and\nwithout notifying you of the change. The calculation agent will make a variety of\ndeterminations relating to the notes, including the amounts that will be paid on\nthe\nnotes. In making these determinations, the calculation agent may be required to\nmake discretionary judgements. In making these discretionary judgments, the fact\nthat the calculation agent is our affiliate may cause it to have economic\ninterests that\nare adverse to your interests as an investor in the notes, and the calculation\nagent\u0092s determinations may adversely affect your return on the notes.\n\nRisks Relating to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate and SOFR Notes Generally\n\nThe following discussion of risks relates to the secured overnight financing rate\n(\u0093SOFR\u0094) and SOFR notes generally. In this discussion, references to \u0093SOFR notes\u0094\nmean a series of compounded SOFR notes or simple average SOFR notes. You should\ncarefully consider the following discussion of risks before investing in SOFR\nnotes.\n\nAny failure of SOFR to maintain market acceptance could adversely affect the\nreturn on or value of the SOFR notes and result in a limited secondary trading\nmarket for the SOFR notes.\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u0092s Alternative Reference Rates\nCommittee (the \u0093ARRC\u0094), SOFR was developed for use in certain U.S. dollar\nderivatives and other financial\n\nS-7\n\ncontracts as an alternative to the London Interbank Offered Rate for deposits in\nU.S. Dollars (\u0093U.S. Dollar LIBOR\u0094) in part because it is considered a good\nrepresentation of\ngeneral funding conditions in the overnight U.S. Treasury repurchase agreement\nmarket. However, as a rate based on transactions secured by U.S. Treasury\nsecurities, it does not measure bank-specific credit risk and, as a result, is\nless likely to\ncorrelate with the unsecured short-term funding costs of banks. This may mean that\nmarket participants would not consider SOFR a suitable substitute, replacement or\nsuccessor for U.S. Dollar LIBOR, which may, in turn, lead to lessened market\nacceptance of SOFR.\n\nFurther, other index providers are developing products that are perceived as\ncompeting with SOFR. It is possible that\nmarket participants will prefer one of these competing products and that such\ncompeting products may become more widely accepted in the marketplace than SOFR.\nTo the extent market acceptance for SOFR as a benchmark for floating-rate notes\ndeclines,\nthe return on and value of the SOFR notes and the price at which investors can\nsell the SOFR notes in the secondary market could be adversely affected. In\naddition, investors in the SOFR notes may not be able to sell the SOFR notes at\nall or may not\nbe able to sell the SOFR notes at prices that will provide them with a yield\ncomparable to similar investments that continue to have a developed secondary\nmarket, and may consequently suffer from increased pricing volatility and market\nrisk.\n\nAs of the date of this prospectus supplement, there are multiple market\nconventions with respect to the implementation of SOFR as a base rate\nfor floating-rate notes or other securities. The manner of calculation and related\nconventions with respect to the determination of interest rates based on SOFR in\nfloating-rate notes markets may differ materially compared with the manner of\ncalculation and related conventions with respect to the determination of interest\nrates based on SOFR in other markets, such as the derivatives and loan markets.\nInvestors should carefully consider how any potential inconsistencies between the\nmanner of calculation and related conventions with respect to the determination of\ninterest or other payment rates based on SOFR across these markets may impact any\nhedging or other financial arrangements that they may put in place in connection\nwith any acquisition, holding or disposition of the SOFR notes.\n\nSOFR may be modified or discontinued, which could adversely affect the return on,\nvalue of or market for affected SOFR notes.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the \u0093FRBNY\u0094) (or a successor),\nas administrator of SOFR, may make methodological or other changes that could\nchange the value of SOFR, including changes related to the method by which SOFR is\ncalculated, eligibility criteria applicable to the transactions used to calculate\nSOFR,\nor timing related to the publication of SOFR. In addition, SOFR is published by\nthe FRBNY based on data received from sources other than us, and we have no\ncontrol over the methods of calculation, publication schedule, rate revision\npractices or\navailability of SOFR or the SOFR Index. If the manner in which SOFR is calculated\nis changed, that change may result in a reduction of the amount of interest\npayable on the SOFR notes, which may adversely affect the trading prices of the\nSOFR notes.\nThe administrator of SOFR may withdraw, modify, amend, suspend or discontinue the\ncalculation or dissemination of SOFR in its sole discretion and without notice and\nhas no obligation to consider the interests of investors in the SOFR notes in\ncalculating, withdrawing, modifying, amending, suspending or discontinuing SOFR.\nFor purposes of the formula used to calculate interest with respect to a series of\nSOFR notes, SOFR in respect of a particular date will not be adjusted for any\nmodifications or amendments to SOFR data that the administrator of SOFR may\npublish after the interest rate on SOFR notes for that day has been determined in\naccordance with the terms and provisions set forth in this prospectus supplement\nand the\napplicable supplement.\n\nThere can be no guarantee that SOFR will not be modified or discontinued in a\nmanner that is materially adverse to\nan investor in SOFR notes. If the manner in which SOFR is calculated is\n\nS-8\n\nchanged or if SOFR is discontinued, that change or discontinuance could reduce or\notherwise negatively impact the amount of interest that accrues on a series of\nSOFR notes, which could adversely\naffect the return on, value of and market for such series of SOFR notes.\n\nWe or our affiliates may publish research reports that could affect the market\nvalue of SOFR notes.\n\nWe or one or more of our affiliates, at present or in the future, may publish\nresearch reports\nwith respect to movements in interest rates generally, or with respect to the\nLIBOR transition to alternative reference rates or SOFR specifically. This\nresearch may be modified from time to time without notice and may express opinions\nor provide\nrecommendations that are inconsistent with purchasing or holding SOFR notes. Any\nof these activities may affect the market value of SOFR notes.\n\nRisks Relating to Compounded SOFR Notes and Simple Average SOFR Notes\n\nThe following discussion of risks specifically relates to compounded SOFR notes\nand simple average SOFR notes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, compounded\nSOFR notes using the SOFR Index convention). You should carefully consider the\nfollowing discussion of risks before investing in compounded SOFR notes or simple\naverage SOFR notes.\n\nThe interest rate on a series of compounded SOFR notes or simple average SOFR\nnotes is based on a compounded or simple average, respectively, of Daily SOFR,\nwhich is relatively new in the marketplace.\n\nFor each interest period,\nthe interest rate on a series of compounded SOFR notes or simple average SOFR\nnotes will be based on a compounded or simple average, respectively, of Daily SOFR\ncalculated as described under \u0093Description of the Notes\u0097Floating-Rate\nNotes\u0097Compounded SOFR Notes\u0094 or \u0093Description of the Notes\u0097Floating-Rate\nNotes\u0097Simple Average SOFR Notes,\u0094 as applicable, in this prospectus supplement. As\na result, the interest rate on a series of compounded SOFR notes\nor simple average SOFR notes during any interest period may not be the same as the\ninterest rate on other instruments bearing interest at a rate based on SOFR that\nuse an alternative method to determine the applicable interest rate. Further, if\nDaily SOFR in respect of a particular date during an interest period or\nobservation period (if applicable) for a series of compounded SOFR notes or simple\naverage SOFR notes is negative, the inclusion of such Daily SOFR in the\ncalculation of\ncompounded SOFR or simple average SOFR for the applicable interest period will\nreduce the interest rate and the interest payable on such series of compounded\nSOFR notes or simple average SOFR notes, as applicable, for such interest period.\n\nThe method for calculating an interest rate based upon compounded SOFR or simple\naverage SOFR (for example, payment delays, observation\nperiods/lookbacks and/or lockout/suspension periods) in market precedents varies.\nThis variation in the market could adversely affect the return on, value of and\nmarket for the compounded SOFR notes or simple average SOFR notes.\n\nInterest payments due on a series of compounded SOFR notes or simple average SOFR\nnotes will be determined only at the end of the relevant interest period.\n\nInterest payments due on a series of compounded SOFR notes or simple average SOFR\nnotes will be determined only at\nthe end of the relevant interest period. Therefore, holders of any series of\ncompounded SOFR notes or simple average SOFR notes will not know the amount of\ninterest payable with respect to each interest period until shortly prior to the\nrelated\ninterest payment date, and it may be difficult for investors in such compounded\nSOFR notes or simple average SOFR notes\n\nS-9\n\nto estimate reliably the amounts of interest that will be payable on each such\ninterest payment date at the beginning of or during the relevant interest period.\nIn addition, some investors may be\nunwilling or unable to trade such compounded SOFR notes or simple average SOFR\nnotes without changes to their information technology systems, both of which could\nadversely impact the liquidity and trading price of any series of compounded SOFR\nnotes\nor simple average SOFR notes.\n\nWith respect to a series of compounded SOFR notes using the payment delay\nconvention or simple average SOFR notes that do not use a rate lookback, it will\nnot be possible to calculate accrued interest with respect to any period until\nafter the end of such period.\n\nWith respect to a series of compounded SOFR notes using the payment delay\nconvention or simple average SOFR notes that do not use a rate\nlookback, because Daily SOFR in respect of a given day is not published until the\nU.S. government securities business day immediately following such day, it will\nnot be possible to calculate accrued interest with respect to any period until\nafter\nthe end of such period, which may adversely affect your ability to trade such\nnotes in the secondary market.\n\nWith respect to a series of compounded SOFR notes using the rate cut off\nconvention or payment delay convention, or a series of simple average SOFR notes\nthat employs a rate cut-offdate, pursuant to the formula used to determine\ncompounded SOFR or simple average SOFR for such notes for an applicable interest\nperiod, Daily SOFR used in such calculation for any day from, and including, the\nrate cut-offdate to, but excluding, the relevant interest payment date (or\nmaturity or redemption date, if applicable) will be Daily SOFR in respect of the\nrelevant rate cut-offdate.\n\nThe formula used to determine the base rate for compounded SOFR notes using the\npayment delay convention employs a rate cut-off date for the final interest period\nwith respect to any series of notes. In addition, the formulas used to determine\nthe base rate for (i) any series of compounded SOFR notes for which the applicable\nsupplement specifies that the rate cut-off convention applies and (ii) any series\nof simple average SOFR notes for which the applicable supplement specifies that a\nrate\ncut-off date applies, may employ a rate cut-off date for each interest period with\nrespect to such series.\n\nFor the final interest period with respect to a series of compounded SOFR notes\nusing the payment delay convention, Daily SOFR used in the\ncalculation of compounded SOFR for any day from, and including, the rate cut-off\ndate to, but excluding, the maturity date or the redemption date, if applicable,\nwill be Daily SOFR in respect of the rate cut-off date. The rate cut-off date will\nbe two U.S. government securities business days (or such other number of U.S.\ngovernment securities business days as we may specify in\nthe applicable supplement) prior to the applicable maturity date (or redemption\ndate, if applicable).\n\nFor each interest period with\nrespect to (i) any series of compounded SOFR notes using the rate cut-off\nconvention and (ii) any series of simple average SOFR notes using a rate cut-off\ndate, Daily SOFR used in the calculation of compounded SOFR or simple average SOFR\nfor any day from, and including, the rate cut-off date to, but excluding, the\nrelevant interest payment date or the maturity\nor redemption date, if applicable, will be Daily SOFR in respect of the rate cut-\noff date.\n\nWith\nrespect to any such series of notes, the rate cut-off date will be (i) for\ncompounded SOFR, five U.S. government securities business days (or such other\nnumber of U.S. government securities business days\nas we may specify in the applicable supplement), or (ii) for simple average SOFR,\ntwo U.S. government securities business days (or such other number of U.S.\ngovernment securities\n\nS-10\n\nbusiness days as we may specify in the applicable supplement) prior to each\ninterest payment date or the maturity date (or redemption date, if applicable).\n\nAs a result of the foregoing, a holder of a series of compounded SOFR notes using\nthe payment delay convention will not receive the benefit of\nany increase in the level of SOFR on any date subsequent to the applicable rate\ncut-off date in connection with the determination of the interest payable with\nrespect to the final interest period for an\napplicable series of compounded SOFR notes using the payment delay convention. A\nholder of compounded SOFR notes using the rate cut-off convention or simple\naverage SOFR notes using a rate-cut off date will not receive the benefit of any\nincrease in the level of SOFR on any date subsequent to the applicable rate cut-\noff date in connection with the\ndetermination of the interest payable with respect to each interest period for a\nseries of compounded SOFR notes using the rate cut-off convention or simple\naverage SOFR notes using a rate cut-off date, which could reduce the amount of\ninterest that may be payable on the applicable series of notes.\n\nHolders of a series of compounded SOFR notes using the payment delay convention\nwill receive payments of interest on a delayed basis.\n\nThe interest payment dates for any series of compounded SOFR notes using the\npayment delay convention with respect to interest rate\ndetermination and interest payments will be two business days (or such other\nnumber of business days as we may specify in the applicable supplement) after the\ninterest period demarcation date at the end of each interest period for such\nseries. This\nconvention differs from the interest payment convention that has been used\nhistorically for floating-rate notes with interest rates based on other benchmark\nor market rates, such as U.S. Dollar LIBOR, where interest typically has been paid\non a\nfixed day that immediately follows the final day of the applicable interest\nperiod. As a result, investors in a series of compounded SOFR notes using the\npayment delay convention will receive payments of interest on a delayed basis as\ncompared to\ntraditional floating-rate notes without payment delay in which they previously may\nhave invested.\n\nRisks Relating to SOFR Benchmark Transition Provisions\n\nThe following discussion of risks specifically relates to SOFR benchmark\ntransition provisions. You should carefully consider the following discussion of\nrisks relating to the SOFR benchmark transition provisions before investing in any\nSOFR notes. In this discussion, references to \u0093SOFR notes\u0094 mean a series of\ncompounded SOFR notes or simple average SOFR notes.\n\nThe selection of a Benchmark Replacement could adversely affect the return on,\nvalue of or market for affected SOFR notes.\n\nIf we or our designee, after consulting with us, determines that a Benchmark\nTransition Event and related Benchmark\nReplacement Date have occurred with respect to a series of SOFR notes, the\napplicable Benchmark Replacement will replace the then-current Benchmark (which\nwill be a rate based on SOFR at the original issue date of the relevant SOFR\nnotes) for all\npurposes relating to such SOFR notes. If a particular Benchmark Replacement or\nBenchmark Replacement Adjustment cannot be determined, then the next-available\nBenchmark Replacement or Benchmark Replacement Adjustment will apply. These\nreplacement\nrates and adjustments may be selected or formulated by (i) the USD Relevant\nGovernmental Body (such as the ARRC), (ii) the International Swaps and Derivatives\nAssociation, Inc. (\u0093ISDA\u0094) or any successor thereto or (iii) in\ncertain circumstances, us or our designee (which may be our affiliate), after\nconsulting with us.\n\nIn addition, the terms of the SOFR\nnotes expressly authorize us or our designee (which may be our affiliate), after\nconsulting with us, in connection with a Benchmark Replacement to make\n\nS-11\n\nBenchmark Replacement Conforming Changes with respect to, among other things, the\ndetermination of interest periods and the timing and frequency of determining\nrates and making payments of\ninterest and other administrative matters. The application of a Benchmark\nReplacement and Benchmark Replacement Adjustment, and any implementation of\nBenchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, could result in adverse consequences to\nthe interest rate\nor amount of interest payable on the SOFR notes, which could adversely affect the\nreturn on, value of and market for such SOFR notes and the price at which\ninvestors may be able to sell such SOFR notes. Moreover, certain determinations,\ndecisions\nand elections with respect to the Benchmark Replacement and any Benchmark\nReplacement Conforming Changes, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of a Benchmark\nTransition Event, may require the exercise of\ndiscretion and the making of subjective judgments by us or our designee (after\nconsulting with us). Any determination, decision or election made by us or our\ndesignee pursuant to the SOFR benchmark transition provisions set forth in this\nprospectus\nsupplement will, if made by us, be made in our sole discretion and, if made by our\ndesignee, be made after consultation with us and, in each case, will become\neffective without consent from the investors in the affected SOFR notes or any\nother\nparty. We may designate an entity to make any determination, decision or election\nthat we have the right to make in connection with the SOFR benchmark transition\nprovisions set forth in this prospectus supplement. Any designee that we may\nappoint in\nconnection with these determinations, decisions or elections may be our affiliate.\nWhen performing such functions, potential conflicts of interest may exist between\nus, our designee and investors in the SOFR notes and making such potentially\nsubjective determinations may adversely affect the return on, value of and market\nfor the SOFR notes. All determinations by us or our designee in our or its\ndiscretion will be conclusive for all purposes and binding on us and investors in\nthe\napplicable SOFR notes absent manifest error. Further, (i) the composition and\ncharacteristics of any Benchmark Replacement for a series of SOFR notes will not\nbe the same as those of the applicable SOFR rate for a series of SOFR notes, the\nBenchmark Replacement will not be the economic equivalent of SOFR there can be no\nassurance that the Benchmark Replacement will perform in the same way as SOFR\nwould have at any time and there is no guarantee that the Benchmark Replacement\nwill be a\ncomparable substitute for SOFR (each of which means that a Benchmark Transition\nEvent could adversely affect the return on, value of and market for the applicable\nseries of SOFR notes), (ii) any failure of the Benchmark Replacement to gain\nmarket\nacceptance could adversely affect the relevant series of SOFR notes, (iii) the\nBenchmark Replacement may have a very limited history and the future performance\nof the Benchmark Replacement may not be able to be predicted based on historical\nperformance, (iv) the secondary trading market for debt securities linked to the\nBenchmark Replacement may be limited and (v) the administrator of the Benchmark\nReplacement may make changes that could change the value of the Benchmark\nReplacement or discontinue the Benchmark Replacement and would not have any\nobligation to consider the interests of investors in the relevant series of SOFR\nnotes in doing so. For more information, see the SOFR benchmark transition\nprovisions set\nforth under \u0093Description of the Notes\u0097Floating-Rate Notes\u0097Effect of a Benchmark\nTransition Event and Related Benchmark Replacement Date with Respect to SOFR\u0094\nbelow.\n\nRisks Relating to Simple Average Federal Funds (Effective) Rate Notes\n\nThe following discussion of risks specifically relates to simple average federal\nfunds (effective) rate notes. You should carefully consider the following\ndiscussion of risks before investing in simple average federal funds (effective)\nrate notes.\n\nInterest payments due on a series of simple average federal funds (effective) rate\nnotes will be determined only at the end of the relevant interest period.\n\nInterest payments due on a series of simple average federal funds (effective) rate\nnotes will be determined only at the end of the relevant\ninterest period. Therefore, holders of any series of simple\n\nS-12\n\naverage federal funds (effective) rate notes will not know the amount of interest\npayable with respect to each interest period until shortly prior to the related\ninterest payment date, and it may\nbe difficult for investors in such simple average federal funds (effective) rate\nnotes to estimate reliably the amounts of interest that will be payable on each\nsuch interest payment date at the beginning of or during the relevant interest\nperiod.\n\nWith respect to a series of simple average federal funds (effective) rate notes\nthat does not use a rate lookback, it will not be possible to calculate accrued\ninterest with respect to any period until after the end of such period.\n\nThe federal funds (effective)\nrate in respect of a given day is not published until the New York banking day (as\ndefined below) immediately following such day. For this reason, with respect to a\nseries of simple average federal funds (effective) rate notes that does not use a\nrate lookback, it will not be possible to calculate accrued interest with respect\nto any period until after the end of such period, which may adversely affect your\nability to trade such notes in the secondary market.\n\nWith respect to a series of simple average federal funds (effective) rate notes\nthat employs a rate cut-offdate, pursuant to the formula used to determine the\nsimple average federal funds (effective) rate for each applicable interest period,\nthe federal funds (effective) rate used in such calculation for any day from, and\nincluding, the rate cut-offdate to, but excluding, the relevant interest payment\ndate (or maturity or redemption date, if applicable) will be the federal funds\n(effective) rate in respect of the relevant rate cut-offdate.\n\nPursuant to the formula used to determine the simple average\nfederal funds (effective) rate for each interest period with respect to a series\nof simple average federal funds (effective) rate notes using a rate cut-off date,\nthe federal funds (effective) rate used in\nsuch calculation for any day from, and including, the rate cut-off date to, but\nexcluding, the relevant interest payment date or the maturity or redemption date,\nif applicable, will be the federal funds\n(effective) rate in respect of the rate cut-off date. The rate cut-off date will\nbe two New York banking days (or such other number of New York banking days as we\nmay\nspecify in the applicable supplement) prior to each interest payment date or the\nmaturity date (or redemption date, if applicable). Therefore, you will not receive\nthe benefit of any increase in the level of the federal funds (effective) rate on\nany\ndate subsequent to the rate cut-off date in connection with the determination of\nthe interest payable with respect to an interest period for a series of simple\naverage federal funds (effective) rate notes\nusing a rate cut-off date, which could reduce the amount of interest that may be\npayable.\n\nRisks Relating to U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aeNotes\n\nThe following discussion of risks specifically relates to U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE\nSwap Rate\u00aenotes. You should carefully consider the following discussion of risks\nbefore investing in U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\u00aenotes.\n\nICE Benchmark Administration (including any successor administrator of the U.S.\nDollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00ae, \u0093IBA\u0094) launched the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\n\u00aefor use as a benchmark in order to aid the market\u0092s transition to SOFR and away\nfrom U.S. Dollar LIBOR. The following discussion of certain risks relating to the\nnotes is based on information related to the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aethat\nis made publicly available on the ICE Swap Rate \u00aeWebsite as of the date of this\npricing supplement, which information is subject to change at any time after such\ndate. In the following discussion of risks, references to the \u0093U.S. Dollar SOFR\nICE Swap Rate \u00ae\u0094 refer to such rate for the applicable tenor(s) with respect to a\nseries of notes. For further information about the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\n\u00ae, see \u0093Description of the Notes\u0097Floating-Rate Notes\u0097U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRate \u00aeNotes\u0094 below.\n\nS-13\n\nThe U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aeis a new series of benchmarks, and the future\nperformance of the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aecannot be predicted based on\nthe limited historical information available.\n\nIBA began\npublication of the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate on November 8, 2021. As a\nresult, there is limited historical information on which to evaluate the\nperformance of the\nU.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate or on which to base a prediction as to its future\nperformance, which may bear little or no relation to such limited information. The\nlimited historical\ninformation is not necessarily indicative of the future performance of the U.S.\nDollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate or the value of the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\nnotes, and any historical upward or downward trend in the level of the U.S. Dollar\nSOFR ICE Swap Rate during any period is not an\nindication that the level of the applicable benchmark is more or less likely to\nincrease or decrease over the term of the applicable U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRate notes. The actual\nfuture levels of the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate may be lower than any\navailable historical data. An investment in the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\nnotes may involve more risk than investing in notes linked to benchmarks or\nindices with established performance records, where a longer history of\nperformance may be available so that investors\nhave more information on which to base an investment decision.\n\nThe composition of the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aeis not the same as the U.S.\nDollar LIBOR ICE Swap Rate \u00aeand the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aeis not\nexpected to be a comparable substitute or replacement for the U.S. Dollar LIBOR\nICE Swap Rate \u00ae.\n\nThe composition of the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate is not the same as the\nU.S. Dollar LIBOR Swap Rate, and the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate is not\nexpected to be a comparable substitute or replacement for the U.S. Dollar LIBOR\nSwap Rate. The\nU.S. Dollar LIBOR ICE Swap Rate seeks to represent the mid-price for the semi-\nannual fixed leg of an interest rate swap where the floating leg is\nbased on three-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR payable quarterly, calculated on the basis\nof a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. The U.S. Dollar SOFR\nICE Swap Rate seeks to represent the annual fixed leg of an interest rate swap\nwhere the floating leg is based on a compounded average of the daily SOFR\nadministered by the FRBNY (or any\nsuccessor administrator) compounded in arrears for twelve months payable annually\nusing standard market conventions, calculated on the basis of the actual number of\ndays elapsed, with a year presumed to comprise 360 days.\n\nThe composition and characteristics of SOFR, which underlies the U.S. Dollar SOFR\nICE Swap Rate is not the same as those of three-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR, nor is\nSOFR the economic equivalent of three-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR. Thus, the U.S.\nDollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate has been designed with respect to swap transactions\nreferencing a rate that differs in significant respects from the rate referenced\nin the swap transactions with respect to which the\nU.S. Dollar LIBOR ICE Swap Rate was designed. As a result, the rate of interest on\nand value of the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRate notes may perform differently over time from the manner in which the interest\nrate and value of debt securities with comparable terms and provisions that were\nlinked to the\nU.S. Dollar LIBOR ICE Swap Rate would have performed. In addition, any failure of\nthe U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate to\ngain market acceptance could adversely affect the value of and market for the\naffected notes.\n\nA lack of input data may impact IBA\u0092s ability to calculate and publish the U.S.\nDollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aefor one or more tenors.\n\nThe input data for the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate is based on swaps\nreferencing SOFR as the floating leg. The U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate is\ndependent on receiving sufficient eligible input data, from the trading venue\nsources identified by IBA in\naccordance with the\n\nS-14\n\n\u0093Waterfall\u0094 methodology, for applicable U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate tenors. The\nability of the applicable trading\nvenues to provide sufficient eligible input data in accordance with IBA\u0092s\n\u0093waterfall\u0094 methodology depends on, among other things, there being a liquid\nmarket in swap contracts referencing SOFR on such trading venues, which in turn\ndepends, among other things, on there being a liquid market in loans, floating\nrate debt securities and other financial contracts referencing SOFR. Because\nSOFR\u0092s use as a reference rate for financial contracts began relatively recently\nand the\nrelated market for SOFR-based swaps is relatively new, there is limited\ninformation on which to assess potential future liquidity in SOFR-based swap\nmarkets or in the market for SOFR-based financial contracts more generally.\n\nIf the market for SOFR-based swap contracts is not sufficiently liquid, or if the\nliquidity in such market proves to be volatile, this could\nresult in the inability of IBA to calculate the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate on\ncertain occasions, which could materially adversely affect the reliability of the\nU.S. Dollar SOFR\nICE Swap Rate, and could adversely affect the return on and value of the U.S.\nDollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate notes and the price at\nwhich you are able to sell such notes in the secondary market, if any. In\naddition, if SOFR does not maintain market acceptance for use as reference rates\nfor U.S. dollar-denominated financial contracts, uncertainty about SOFR may\nadversely affect\nthe return on and the value of the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate notes.\n\nThe information regarding the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aethat IBA makes\npublicly available is limited.\n\nCertain information and materials relating to the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\nis available on ICE Swap Rate Website. Currently, publicly available rate\ninformation for the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate can be viewed only on the ICE\nReport Center on the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Website, and, for any\nparticular day, the only\nrate available for viewing is the rate published for the preceding publication\nday. In addition, as of the date of this prospectus supplement, such rate\nappearing on the ICE Report Center is rounded to two decimal places and does not\nrepresent the\nactual U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate rates that will be used to determine the\napplicable U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\nfor purposes of calculating interest on the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate notes\n(which rate will be that published on the Designated SOFR Swap Rate Page and\nrounded to three decimal\nplaces). As of the date of this prospectus supplement, a paid subscription to the\nBloomberg Professional Services service is required to obtain additional U.S.\nDollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\ndata (such as historical U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate rates rounded to three\ndecimal places). IBA has not indicated whether such information will become\npublicly available in the\nfuture or whether the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate rates will be made available\nfrom another source. As a result of this limited publicly available information,\nit may be difficult for\nan investor to determine the applicable U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate for a\nspecific date or dates.\n\nThe U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aemay be modified or discontinued, which could\nadversely affect the return on, value of or market for the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE\nSwap Rate \u00aenotes.\n\nIBA may make methodological or other changes that could change the value of the\nU.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate, including changes related to the method by which\nsuch rate is calculated, eligibility criteria applicable to the transactions used\nto calculate such rate, including the trading venues for such\ntransactions, or timing related to the determination or publication of such rate,\nor may cease the calculation or dissemination of such rate. Depending on the\ncircumstances, such change or cessation could be implemented with little or no\npublic\nnotice or consultation. Any such changes may result in a reduction of the U.S.\nDollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate and, in turn, reduce the amount of interest payable on\nthe U.S. Dollar SOFR\nICE Swap Rate notes, which may\n\nS-15\n\nadversely affect the return on, value of and market for the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE\nSwap Rate notes. In addition, the U.S. Dollar\nSOFR ICE Swap Rate is determined by IBA based on data received from sources other\nthan us, and we do not have any control over the methods of calculation,\npublication schedule, rate revision\npractices or availability of such data.\n\nIf the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aedoes not appear on the applicable\nDesignated SOFR Swap Rate Page at the applicable Relevant Time, and a U.S. Dollar\nSOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aeTransition Event and related U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\n\u00aeReplacement Date have not occurred, the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aewill be\ndetermined by the calculation agent (which may be one of our affiliates) using\nalternative methods, which will involve the exercise of discretion by the\ncalculation agent.\n\nIf the U.S. SOFR ICE Swap Ratedoes not appear on the applicable Designated SOFR\nSwap Rate Page at the Relevant Time on an applicable interest determination date\n(for example, as a result of insufficient liquidity in the underlying\napplicable SOFR swap contracts market) and a U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\nTransition Event and related U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRate Replacement Date have not occurred with respect to the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE\nSwap Rate, the calculation agent will determine\nthe U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate for such applicable interest determination date\nin its sole discretion, after consulting such sources as it deems comparable to\nthe Designated SOFR\nSwap Rate Page or to the sources from which IBA obtains the swap rate input data\nused by IBA to calculate such rate, or any other source or data it determines to\nbe reasonable (including, if applicable, the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate that\nwas most recently published by IBA) for the purpose of estimating such rate. This\nmethod of determining the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRate may result in interest payments on the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate notes\nthat are higher than, lower than or that do not\notherwise correlate over time with the interest payments that would have been made\non the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate notes if the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRatehad been published in accordance with IBA\u0092s usual policies and procedures\ngoverning the determination and publication of such rate and\nappeared on the Designated SOFR Swap Rate Page at the Relevant Time. This could\nadversely affect the rate of interest on the affected U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRate notes, which, in\nturn, could adversely affect the return on, value of and market for such affected\nU.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate notes and the price at which investors may be able\nto sell such affected\nU.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate notes. In addition, in determining the U.S. Dollar\nSOFR ICE Swap Rate, the calculation agent\nmay have economic interests that are adverse to the investor\u0092s interests.\n\nIf a U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aeTransition Event and related U.S. Dollar SOFR\nICE Swap Rate \u00aeReplacement Date are determined to have occurred with respect to\nthe U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00ae, the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\n\u00aeReplacement may not be a suitable replacement for such rate.\n\nIf we or the calculation agent (after consulting with us)\ndetermines that a U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Transition Event and related U.S.\nDollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Replacement\nDate have occurred with respect to the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate and a series\nof U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate notes,\nthen the applicable U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Replacement will replace the\nU.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate for such\nseries of notes for all purposes relating to the relevant notes in respect of all\ndeterminations on such date and for all determinations on all subsequent dates, as\nset forth under \u0093Description of the Notes\u0097Effect of a U.S. Dollar\nSOFR ICE Swap Rate Transition Event.\u0094 The U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\nReplacement will be the alternate rate of interest\nthat has been selected by us or the calculation agent (after consulting with us)\nas an industry-accepted replacement for the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate for\nU.S. dollar-denominated\nfloating-rate notes at such time, plus the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\nReplacement Adjustment (if any). After determination of the U.S. Dollar\n\nS-16\n\nSOFR ICE Swap Rate Replacement, interest on the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRate notes will no longer be determined by reference to the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE\nSwap Rate, but instead will be determined by\nreference to the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Replacement. If we or the\ncalculation agent (after consulting with us) determines that there is no such\nreplacement rate as of any\napplicable date of determination, then we or the calculation agent (after\nconsulting with us) will determine a substitute rate or substitute rate value to\nbe used in place of the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate for that date of\ndetermination after consulting such sources as we or the calculation agent (after\nconsulting with us) deems comparable to the sources (if any) on which such rate\ncustomarily was\npublished by IBA or authorized distributors prior to the applicable U.S. Dollar\nSOFR ICE Swap Rate Transition Event and U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Replacement\nDate or to the sources from which IBA obtains the SOFR swap rate input data used\nby IBA to calculate the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate, or any other source or\ndata we or the calculation agent (after consulting with us) determines to be\nreasonable (including, if applicable, the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate that was\nmost recently published by IBA) for the purpose of determining such substitute\nrate or substitute rate value.\n\nThere is no assurance that any U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Replacement will\nbe similar to the initial U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate in any respect as it is\ndetermined and published by IBA as of the date of this prospectus supplement, or\nthat any\nU.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Replacement will produce the economic equivalent of\nsuch U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate as a\nreference rate for determining the interest rate on the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRate notes, or otherwise be a suitable replacement or successor for such rate. In\naddition, it is\npossible that, at the time of the occurrence of a U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\nReplacement Event and related U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Replacement Date, no\nindustry-accepted interest rate as a replacement for the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRate will exist and there\nmay be disagreement regarding the selection of a replacement rate for such U.S.\nDollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the determination of the\nU.S. Dollar SOFR\nICE Swap Rate Replacement will become effective without the consent of the holders\nof the notes of any other party. Use of the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\nReplacement may result in interest payments on the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\nnotes that are higher than, lower than or that do\nnot otherwise correlate over time with the interest payments that would have been\nmade on such U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate notes in the absence of a U.S. Dollar\nSOFR ICE Swap\nRate Transition Event and related U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Replacement Date.\nThis could adversely affect the interest rate\nand amount of interest payable on the affected U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\nnotes, which, in turn, could adversely affect the return on, value of and market\nfor such affected\nU.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate notes and the price at which investors may be able\nto sell such affected U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRate notes.\n\nIn addition, although the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Ratebenchmark transition\nprovisions set forth in \u0093Description of the Notes\u0097Effect of a U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE\nSwap Rate Transition Event\u0094 provide for a U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\nReplacement Adjustment to be added to the Unadjusted\nU.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Replacement, such U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\nReplacement Adjustment may be zero or\nnegative, and there is no guarantee that the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\nReplacement Adjustment (if any) will make the Unadjusted U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRate Replacement equivalent to the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate as it is\ncalculated and published by IBA as of the date of this\nprospectus supplement.\n\nThe secondary trading market for the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aenotes may be\nlimited.\n\nPublication of the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate began recently, and, as of the\ndate of this prospectus supplement, use of the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate as a\nreference rate for\nfloating-rate notes is limited. In addition, the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\nmay not be widely\n\nS-17\n\nused as such in the future. If the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate does not prove\nto be widely used as a benchmark in securities that\nare similar or comparable to the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate notes, a trading\nmarket for the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRate notes may fail to develop or be maintained, and the trading price of the U.S.\nDollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate notes may be lower\nthan those of debt securities with rates of interest based on rates that are more\nwidely used.\n\nWe or our affiliates may publish research that could affect the market value of\nthe U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aenotes.\n\nWe or one or more of our affiliates may, at present or in the future, publish\nresearch reports with respect to movements in interest rates\ngenerally, or the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate specifically. This research may\nbe modified from time to time without notice and may express opinions or provide\nrecommendations that are\ninconsistent with purchasing or holding the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate notes.\nAny of these activities may affect the market value of the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE\nSwap Rate notes.\n\nS-18\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES\n\nThis section describes general terms and provisions of the notes.

The payment obligations of BofA Finance on the notes will be fully and\nunconditionally guaranteed by Bank of America as described in the accompanying\nprospectus.\n\nAny obligations of Bank of America under its\nguarantee of the notes will be unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and will\nrank equally in right of payment with all of its other unsecured and\nunsubordinated obligations, except obligations that are subject to any priorities\nor preferences by\nlaw, and senior in right of payment to its subordinated obligations. Because Bank\nof America is a holding company, its right to participate in any distribution of\nassets of any subsidiary upon such subsidiary\u0092s liquidation or reorganization or\notherwise is subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary, except\nto the extent Bank of America may itself be recognized as a creditor of that\nsubsidiary. Accordingly, the guarantee obligations will be structurally\nsubordinated to all\nexisting and future liabilities of Bank of America subsidiaries, and claimants\nshould look only to the assets of Bank of America for payments under its guarantee\nof the notes. Further, creditors of Bank of America\u0092s subsidiaries recapitalized\npursuant to Bank of America\u0092s resolution plan generally would be entitled to\npayment of their claims from the assets of the subsidiaries, including Bank of\nAmerica\u0092s contributed assets. In addition, any obligations of Bank of America\nunder\nits guarantee will be unsecured and, therefore, in a bankruptcy or similar\nproceeding, will effectively rank junior to Bank of America\u0092s secured obligations\nto the extent of the value of the assets securing such obligations.\n\nSee \u0093Risk Factors\u0097BofA Finance is a finance subsidiary and, as such, has no\nindependent assets, operations or revenues,\u0094\n\u0093Risk Factors\u0097Bank of America\u0092s obligations under its guarantee of BofA Finance\u0092s\ndebt securities will be structurally subordinated to liabilities of Bank of\nAmerica\u0092s subsidiaries\u0094 and \u0093Risk Factors\u0097Holders\nof the debt securities of Bank of America and claimants under Bank of America\u0092s\nguarantees of the BofA Finance debt securities could be at greater risk of being\nstructurally subordinated if Bank of America sells or conveys all or substantially\nall of its assets to one or more of its majority-owned subsidiaries\u0094 in the\naccompanying prospectus.\n\nBofA Finance is a finance\nsubsidiary and has no operations other than those related to the issuance,\nadministration and repayment of its notes that are guaranteed by Bank of America.\nIn addition, BofA Finance will have no assets available for distributions to\nholders of its\nnotes if they make claims in respect of such notes in a bankruptcy, resolution or\nsimilar proceeding. Accordingly, any recoveries by such holders will be limited to\nthose available under Bank of America\u0092s guarantee of such notes. Holders of\nBofA Finance\u0092s notes will have recourse only to a single claim against Bank of\nAmerica and its assets under Bank of America\u0092s guarantee of the notes, and holders\nof the notes should accordingly assume that in any bankruptcy, resolution or\nsimilar proceeding, they would not have any priority over, and should be treated\nequally with, the claims of all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of\nBank of America, including claims of holders of unsecured debt securities issued\nby\nBank of America.\n\nFixed-Rate Notes\n\nWe may issue notes that bear interest at a fixed rate as set forth in the\napplicable supplement, which we refer to as \u0093fixed-rate\nnotes.\u0094 Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, each fixed-rate\nnote will bear interest from its original issue date or from the most recent date\nto which interest on the note has been paid or made available for payment.\nInterest will accrue on the principal of a fixed-rate note at the fixed annual\nrate stated in the applicable supplement, until the principal is paid or made\navailable for payment.\n\nS-20\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, we will pay interest on\nany\nfixed-rate note monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually, as applicable, in\narrears, on the days set forth in the applicable supplement (each such day being\nan \u0093interest payment date\u0094 for a fixed-rate note) and at maturity. Unless we\nspecify otherwise in the applicable supplement, each interest payment due on an\ninterest payment date or the maturity date will include interest accrued from, and\nincluding, the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid,\nor,\nif no interest has been paid, from the original issue date, to, but excluding, the\nnext interest payment date or the maturity date, as the case may be. Unless we\nspecify otherwise in the applicable supplement, interest on fixed-rate notes will\nbe\ncomputed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day\nmonths, which we may refer to as the \u009330/360\u0094 day count convention. We will make\npayments on fixed-rate notes as described below under \u0093\u0097Payment of Principal,\nInterest, and Other Amounts Payable.\u0094\n\nWe\nalso may issue amortizing notes, which are fixed-rate notes for which combined\nprincipal and interest payments are made in installments over the life of the\nnote. Payments on amortizing notes are applied first to interest due and then to\nthe\nreduction of the unpaid principal amount. The supplement for an amortizing note\nwill include a table setting forth repayment information.\n\nIndexed Notes\n\nWe may issue notes that provide that the rate of return, including the principal\nand/or any premium, interest, or\nother amounts payable, is determined by reference, either directly or indirectly,\nto the price or performance of one or interest rates, equity securities, indices,\nexchange traded funds, commodities, currency exchange rates, futures contracts or\nany\nother rates, instruments, assets or other factors or any other measure of economic\nor financial risk or value, or one or more baskets, indices or other combinations\nof the foregoing (referred to as \u0093market measures\u0094), in each case as\nspecified in the applicable supplement. We refer to these notes as \u0093indexed\nnotes.\u0094\n\nIf you purchase an indexed note, you may\nreceive an amount at maturity that is greater than or less than the face amount of\nyour note, depending upon the formula used to determine the amount payable and the\nrelative value at maturity of the market measure to which your indexed note is\nlinked. We expect that the value of the applicable market measure will fluctuate\nover time.\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable\nsupplement, indexed notes will be cash-settled only.\n\nIndexed notes may bear interest at a fixed or floating rate, if so specified in\nthe\napplicable supplement. Unless otherwise indicated in the applicable supplement,\nthe terms and provisions set forth above under \u0093\u0097Fixed-Rate Notes\u0094 and below under\n\u0093\u0097Floating-Rate Notes\u0094 will apply to such indexed notes\nwith respect to any interest period for which such indexed note accrues interest\nat a fixed or floating rate, as applicable.\n\nWe will\nspecify in the applicable supplement the method for determining the principal\nand/or any premium, interest, or other amounts payable in respect of particular\nindexed notes, as well as certain historical or other information with respect to\nthe\nspecified index or other market measure, specific risk factors relating to that\nparticular type of indexed note, and tax considerations associated with an\ninvestment in the indexed notes.\n\nIf so specified in the applicable supplement, we may issue indexed notes that are\nlinked to one or more of the base rates described below\nunder \u0093\u0097Floating-Rate Notes\u0097U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Notes,\u0094 \u0093\u0097Floating-Rate\nNotes\u0097Compounded SOFR Notes,\u0094 \u0093\u0097Floating-Rate\nNotes\u0097Simple Average SOFR Notes,\u0094 or \u0093\u0097Floating-Rate Notes\u0097Simple Average Federal\nFunds\n\nS-21\n\n(Effective) Rate Notes\u0094for purposes other than determining a floating rate of\ninterest.

The specific terms of, and any additional considerations\nrelating to, indexed amortizing notes will be set forth in the applicable\nsupplement. Fixed/Floating Rate Notes We may issue notes with elements of each of\nthe fixed-rate notes described above and floating-rate notes described below.

Calculation of\nInterest Amounts Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the\namount of accrued interest on a floating-rate note for an interest period is\ncalculated by multiplying the outstanding principal amount of such note by an\naccrued interest factor. This accrued interest factor will be determined by\nmultiplying the per annum floating interest rate determined by reference to the\napplicable base rate, as determined for the applicable interest period, by a\nfactor resulting from the day count convention that applies with respect to such\ndetermination. The factor resulting from the day count convention will be, if so\nspecified in the applicable supplement, one of the following, or may be any other\nconvention set forth in the applicable supplement:\n                                                                                  \n      a factor based on a 360-day year of twelve                                  \n      30-day months if the day count convention specified in the applicable       \n      supplement is \u009330/360\u0094;                                                       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      a factor equal to the actual number of days in the relevant period divided  \n      by 360 if the day count convention                                          \n      specified in the applicable supplement is \u0093Actual/360\u0094;                       \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      a factor equal to the actual number of days in the relevant period divided  \n      by 365, or if any portion of that                                           \n      relevant period falls in a leap year, the sum of (A)\u00a0the actual number of   \n      days in that portion of the relevant period falling in a leap year divided  \n      by 366 and (B)\u00a0the actual number of days in that portion of the relevant    \n      period falling in                                                           \n      a non-leap year divided by 365, if the day count convention specified in    \n      the applicable supplement is \u0093Actual/Actual\u0094; or                              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      a factor equal to the actual number of days in the relevant period divided  \n      by 365, if the day count convention                                         \n      specified in the applicable supplement is \u0093Actual/365 (Fixed).\u0094               \n                                                                                  \nIf no day count convention is specified in the applicable supplement, the accrued\ninterest factor will be as follows:\n                                                                           \n      for U.S.\u00a0Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\u00ae notes, the                       \n      factor will be based on a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months; and  \n                                                                           \n                                                                                  \n      for compounded SOFR notes, simple average SOFR notes, simple average        \n      federal funds (effective) rate notes or any                                 \n      other floating-rate notes other than U.S.\u00a0Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\u00ae        \n      notes, the factor will be equal to the actual number of days in the         \n      relevant period divided by 360.                                             \n                                                                                  \nS-25\n\nOn or before the relevant \u0093calculation date,\u0094 the calculation agent will calculate\nthe amount of interest that has accrued during each interest period in accordance\nwith the provisions set forth above.

All amounts used in\nor resulting from any calculation on floating-rate notes will be rounded to the\nnearest cent, in the case of U.S. dollars, or to the nearest corresponding\nhundredth of a unit, in the case of a currency other than U.S. dollars, with one-\nhalfcent or one-halfof a corresponding hundredth of a unit or more being rounded\nupward. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, all percentages\nresulting from any calculation with respect to a floating-rate note will be\nrounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percent, with\nfive one-millionthsof a percentage point rounded upwards, e.g., 9.876545% (or\n0.09876545) being rounded to 9.87655% (or 0.0987655). The interest rate on a\nfloating-rate note may not be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York\nlaw, as that rate may be modified by U.S. law of general application. Under\ncurrent New York law, the maximum rate of interest, subject to some exceptions,\nfor any loan in an amount less than $250,000 is 16% and for any loan in the amount\nof $250,000 or more but less than $2,500,000 is 25% per annum on a simple interest\nbasis. These limits do not apply to loans of $2,500,000 or more to any one\nborrower. At the request of a holder of any U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aenote,\nthe calculation agent will provide the interest rate then in effect for that\nfloating-rate note and, if already determined, the interest rate that is to take\neffect on the next interest reset date. At the request of a holder of any\ncompounded SOFR note, simple average SOFR note or simple average federal funds\n(effective) rate note, the calculation agent will provide compounded SOFR, simple\naverage SOFR or the simple average federal funds (effective) rate, as applicable,\nthe interest rate and the amount of interest accrued with respect to any interest\nperiod for such note, after compounded SOFR, simple average SOFR or the simple\naverage federal funds (effective) rate, as applicable, and such interest rate and\naccrued interest have been determined. U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate \u00aeNotes\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable supplement, the following terms and\nprovisions and other information will apply to each series of U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE\nSwap Rate \u00aenotes. The interest rate in effect from, and including, the original\nissue date of a series of floating-rate notes to, but excluding, the first\ninterest reset date (as defined below) for such series of notes will be the\ninitial interest rate set forth in the applicable supplement or determined as set\nforth in the S-26\n\napplicable supplement. The interest rate for a series of U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRate notes may be reset daily, weekly, monthly,\nquarterly, semi-annually, or annually, or at any other interval, as we specify in\nthe applicable supplement. If so specified in the applicable supplement, a single\ninterest period may contain multiple interest reset dates, in which case the\ninterest\nrate with respect to the applicable series of notes will reset on each such\ninterest reset date in accordance with the terms and provisions set forth in this\nsubsection or as otherwise set forth in the applicable supplement, and interest\nwill accrue\non such series of notes at the interest rate in effect from time to time during\nsuch interest period. We refer to each date on which the interest rate for a\nseries of U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap\nRate notes will reset as an \u0093interest reset date.\u0094 We will specify the interest\nreset dates in the applicable supplement. Interest reset dates may be adjusted in\naccordance with the\napplicable business day convention (as described below under \u0093\u0097Payment of\nPrincipal, Interest, and Other Amounts Payable\u0097Business Day Conventions\u0094)\nspecified in the applicable supplement.\n\nThe \u0093interest determination date\u0094 in respect of any interest reset date is the day\nto which the calculation agent will refer when\ndetermining the interest rate at which the applicable floating interest rate will\nreset. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the interest\ndetermination date for an interest reset date for a U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\nnote will be the second U.S. government securities business day (as defined below)\npreceding the interest reset date.\n\nThe calculation agent will determine the interest rate for an interest period in\nrespect of a U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate note on the interest determination\ndate corresponding to such interest reset date. In addition, on the applicable\ncalculation date, the calculation agent will calculate the amount of interest\nthat has accrued during each interest period in accordance with the provisions set\nforth under \u0093\u0097General Terms and Provisions Applicable to Floating-Rate\nNotes\u0097Accrual of Interest, Interest Payment Dates and Interest Periods for\nFloating-Rate Notes Other than Compounded SOFR Notes Using the Payment Delay\nConvention\u0094 and \u0093\u0097General Terms and Provisions Applicable to Floating-Rate\nNotes\u0097Calculation of Interest Amounts\u0094 above.\n\nWith respect to a series of U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate notes, unless\notherwise specified in the applicable supplement, the following terms will have\nthe meanings set forth below:\n\n\u0093U.S. Dollar SOFR\nICE Swap Rate\u0094 means, in respect of each applicable interest determination date,\nthe U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\nfor the applicable tenor specified in the applicable supplement, as calculated and\nprovided as of approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time (or any amended time\nspecified by the administrator of the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate in the\nbenchmark methodology) on such interest determination date, by IBA as the\nadministrator of the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate\n(or a successor administrator), as such rate appears for the Applicable Index on\nthe Designated SOFR Swap Rate Page at the Relevant Time on such interest\ndetermination date, as determined by the calculation agent.\n\nIf the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate for the applicable tenor in respect of\nany interest period cannot be determined in accordance with the preceding\nparagraph on an applicable interest determination date, and a U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE\nSwap Rate Transition Event\nand related U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate Replacement Date have not occurred with\nrespect to such rate, then the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate for such tenor for\nsuch interest determination date will be determined by the calculation agent in\nits sole discretion after consulting such sources as it deems comparable to the\nsources (if any)\non which such rate customarily is published by the IBA (or a successor\nadministrator) or authorized distributors or to the sources from which IBA (or\nsuch successor administrator) obtains the swap rate input data used by IBA (or\nsuch successor\nadministrator), to calculate such rate, or any other source or data it determines\nto be reasonable (including, if applicable, the U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate for\nthe applicable tenor\nthat was\n\nS-27\n\nmost recently published by IBA (or such successor administrator)) for the purpose\nof estimating such rate.

The information contained on such\nwebsite is not part of this prospectus supplement and is not incorporated in this\nprospectus supplement by reference.\n\nPayment Delay Convention\n\nIf the applicable supplement for a series of compounded SOFR notes specifies that\nthe \u0093payment delay convention\u0094 applies, then, unless we specify otherwise in the\napplicable supplement, the following terms and provisions will apply to such\nseries. References to \u0093notes\u0094 in this subsection \u0093\u0097Payment Delay Convention\u0094 are\nto compounded SOFR notes using the payment delay convention.\n\nFor a series of compounded SOFR notes using the\npayment delay convention, unless we specify otherwise in the applicable\nsupplement, compounded SOFR, the interest rate, accrued interest, the date on\nwhich the foregoing will be calculated by the calculation agent with respect to an\ninterest period,\ninterest periods and timing of interest payments for a particular interest period\nwill be determined in accordance with the following terms and provisions set forth\nin this subsection and in the other sections and subsections of this prospectus\nsupplement referenced below in this subsection. See \u0093\u0097General Terms and Provisions\nApplicable to Floating-Rate Notes\u0094 for a description of additional terms and\nprovisions of the notes relating to the determination of interest rates\nand calculation of interest amounts (other than with respect to the accrual of\ninterest, interest payment dates, interest periods and the timing of such\ncalculation of interest amounts, which will be as set forth below in this\nsubsection) that will\nbe applicable with respect to a series of compounded SOFR notes using the payment\ndelay convention, unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement.\n\nEach series of the notes will accrue interest from the original issue date of such\nseries until the principal amount is paid or made available\nfor payment. We will pay interest on a series of the notes on each interest\npayment date (as defined in the second following paragraph) with respect to such\nseries of notes. Each interest payment due on an interest payment date, the\nmaturity date or\nthe redemption date, as applicable, will include interest accrued from, and\nincluding, the most recent interest period demarcation date to which interest has\nbeen paid, or, if no interest has been paid, from the original issue date, to, but\nexcluding, the next interest period demarcation date (or, in the case of the final\ninterest period, the maturity date or, if such notes are redeemed earlier, the\nredemption date) (each such period, an \u0093interest period\u0094 for such series of\nnotes). The applicable supplement for a series of notes will specify, among other\nterms and provisions, the \u0093interest period demarcation dates\u0094 with respect to such\nseries.\n\nS-29\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, interest period\ndemarcation dates\nand interest periods (in addition to interest payment dates) may be adjusted in\naccordance with the business day convention specified in the applicable\nsupplement. If the scheduled final interest period demarcation date (which will be\nthe maturity\ndate or, if we elect to redeem the notes, the redemption date) falls on a day that\nis not a business day, the payment of principal and interest will be made on the\nnext succeeding business day, and such final interest period demarcation date will\nbe\npostponed to such succeeding business day.\n\nWe will pay interest on each series of the notes in arrears, on the second\nbusiness day (or\nsuch other number of business days we may specify in the applicable supplement)\nfollowing each interest period demarcation date (each such day being an \u0093interest\npayment date\u0094 for such notes); provided that the interest payment date with\nrespect to the final interest period for a series of the notes will be the\nmaturity date for such series or, if the notes are redeemed earlier, the\nredemption date. On each interest payment date, we will pay accrued interest for\nthe most recently\ncompleted interest period.\n\nIf an interest period demarcation date other than the final interest period\ndemarcation date otherwise would\nfall on a day that is not a business day, then such interest period demarcation\ndate will be postponed to the next day that is a business day, except that, if the\nnext succeeding business day falls in the next calendar month, then such interest\nperiod demarcation date will be advanced to the immediately preceding day that is\na business day. If the scheduled final interest period demarcation date (which\nwill be the maturity date or, if we elect to redeem the notes earlier, the\nredemption\ndate) falls on a day that is not a business day, the payment of principal and\ninterest will be made on the next succeeding business day, and such final interest\nperiod demarcation date will be postponed to such succeeding business day. In each\ncase,\nthe related interest periods also will be adjusted for non-business days.\n\nWith respect to any\nseries of fixed/floating rate notes for which compounded SOFR is specified to be\nthe base rate for the applicable floating-rate period and for which the \u0093payment\ndelay convention\u0094 is specified to be applicable, notwithstanding anything to\nthe contrary in the applicable terms and provisions of such notes, and provided\nthat such series of notes is not redeemed prior to the commencement of the\nfloating-rate period, if the final interest payment date falling in the fixed-rate\nperiod\notherwise would fall on a day that is not a business day, then such interest\npayment date will be postponed to the next day that is a business day, and the\nrelated interest period also will be adjusted for\nnon-business days. If such final interest payment date during the fixed-rate\nperiod is so postponed, the first day of the initial interest period during the\nfloating-rate period will be adjusted accordingly.\n\nThe interest rate for a series of the notes will be determined by reference to\ncompounded SOFR, calculated in respect of each interest\nperiod in accordance with the formula set forth below. For purposes of calculating\ncompounded SOFR in accordance with such formula with respect to the final interest\nperiod, Daily SOFR for each U.S. government securities business day in the period\nfrom, and including, the rate cut-off date to, but excluding, the maturity date or\nredemption date, as applicable, will be Daily SOFR in respect of such rate cut-off\ndate. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the \u0093rate cut-off\ndate\u0094 will be the second U.S. government securities business day prior to the\nmaturity date or redemption date, as\napplicable.\n\nS-30\n\nThe calculation agent will determine \u0093compounded SOFR\u0094 for a series of the notes\nfor each interest period in accordance with the following formula:\n\nwhere:\n\n\u0093d\u0094, for any interest period, is the number of U.S. government securities\nbusiness days in such interest period;\n\n\u0093i\u0094, for such interest period, is a series of whole numbers from one to d, each\nrepresenting the relevant U.S. government securities business days in\nchronological order from, and including, the first U.S. government securities\nbusiness day in such interest period;\n\n\u0093SOFRi\u0094, for any U.S. government securities business day\n\u0093i\u0094 in such interest period, is equal to Daily SOFR in respect of that day,\ndetermined by the calculation agent; provided that, for purposes of calculating\ncompounded SOFR with respect to the final interest period, Daily SOFR for\neach U.S. government securities business day in the period from, and including,\nthe rate cut-off date to, but excluding, the maturity date or redemption date, as\napplicable, will be Daily SOFR in respect of\nsuch rate cut-off date;\n\n\u0093ni\u0094 for U.S. government securities business day \u0093i\u0094 in such interest period, is\nthe number of calendar days from, and including, such U.S. government securities\nbusiness day\n\u0093i\u0094 to, but excluding, the following U.S. government securities business day; and\n\n\u0093d\u0094, for such interest\nperiod, is the number of calendar days in such interest period.\n\nThe calculation agent will determine compounded SOFR, the interest rate\nand accrued interest for each interest period in arrears on the applicable\ncalculation date and will notify us of compounded SOFR and such interest rate and\naccrued interest for each interest period as soon as reasonably practicable after\nsuch\ndetermination. At the request of a holder of a series of the notes, the\ncalculation agent will provide compounded SOFR, the interest rate and the amount\nof interest accrued with respect to any interest period for such series, after\ncompounded SOFR\nand such interest rate and accrued interest have been determined.\n\nObservation Period Convention, SOFR Index Convention, and Rate Cut-offConvention\n\nIf the applicable supplement for a series of compounded SOFR notes specifies that\nthe \u0093observation period convention,\u0094 \u0093SOFR Index convention,\u0094 or \u0093rate cut-\noffconvention\u0094 applies, then, unless we specify otherwise in the applicable\nsupplement, the following terms and provisions will apply to such series.\nReferences to \u0093notes\u0094 in this subsection \u0093\u0097Observation Period Convention SOFR\nIndex Convention, and Rate Cut-offConvention\u0094 are to compounded SOFR notes using\nthe observation period convention, SOFR Index convention or rate cut-\noffconvention, as applicable.\n\nFor a series of compounded SOFR notes using the observation period convention,\nSOFR Index convention or rate\ncut-off convention, unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement,\ncompounded SOFR, the interest rate, accrued interest and the date on which the\nforegoing will be calculated by the calculation\nagent with respect to an interest period will be determined in accordance with the\nfollowing terms and provisions set forth in this subsection and in the other\nsections and subsections of this prospectus supplement referenced below in this\nsubsection.

For each interest period for a series of\nthe notes, \u0093simple average SOFR\u0094 means, for each applicable interest period, a\nrate equal to the sum of the daily base rate for each calendar day in such\ninterest period divided by the number of calendar days in such interest period,\ncalculated in accordance with the terms and provisions set forth below.\n\nSubject to the provisions below relating to a \u0093rate\nlookback\u0094 or \u0093rate cut-off date,\u0094 as applicable, the \u0093daily base rate\u0094 with\nrespect to each calendar day in a relevant interest period will be Daily SOFR in\nrespect of such day;\nprovided that for any calendar day in an interest period that is not a U.S.\ngovernment securities business day, Daily SOFR in respect of such calendar day\nwill be Daily SOFR for the U.S. government securities business day in such\ninterest period\nimmediately preceding such calendar day.\n\nFor purposes of calculating simple average SOFR in accordance with the foregoing,\neither a\n\u0093rate lookback\u0094 or \u0093rate cut-off date\u0094 will apply to your notes, as specified in\nthe applicable supplement.\n\nIf the applicable supplement specifies that a \u0093rate lookback\u0094 applies, then,\nnotwithstanding the terms and provisions set forth in\nthe second preceding paragraph: (i) the \u0093daily base rate\u0094 with respect to each\nU.S. government securities business day in a relevant interest period will be\nDaily SOFR in respect of the U.S. government securities business day falling\ntwo U.S. government securities business days (or such other number of U.S.\ngovernment securities business days as may be specified in the applicable\nsupplement) prior to such U.S. government securities business day (such number of\ndays, the\n\u0093lookback period\u0094); and (ii) the \u0093daily base rate\u0094 with respect to each calendar\nday in a relevant interest period that is not a U.S. government securities\nbusiness day will be equal to the daily base rate in effect for the\nimmediately preceding U.S. government securities business day.\n\nIf the applicable supplement specifies that a \u0093rate cut-off date\u0094 applies then,\nnotwithstanding the terms and provisions set forth in the second preceding\nparagraph, for each calendar day in an\n\nS-35\n\ninterest period falling after the rate cut-offdate for such interest period, the\n\u0093daily base rate\u0094 for each such calendar day will be Daily SOFR in respect of such\nrate cut-offdate. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the\n\u0093rate cut-offdate\u0094 for an interest period, if applicable, will be the second U.S.\ngovernment securities business day (or such other number of U.S. government\nsecurities business days as we may specify in the applicable supplement) prior to\nthe interest payment date for such interest period. Unless we specify otherwise in\nthe applicable supplement, each interest payment due on an interest payment date\nor maturity date for a series of the notes will include interest accrued from, and\nincluding, the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid,\nor, if no interest has been paid, from the original issue date, to, but excluding,\nthe next interest payment date or the maturity date, as the case may be (each such\nperiod, an \u0093interest period\u0094 for such series of notes). The calculation agent will\ndetermine simple average SOFR, the interest rate and accrued interest for each\ninterest period in arrears as soon as reasonably practicable prior to the relevant\ninterest payment date and will notify us of simple average SOFR and such interest\nrate and accrued interest for each interest period as soon as reasonably\npracticable after such determination, but in any event by the business day\nimmediately prior to the interest payment date.

S-44\n\nAdditional Information About SOFR\n\nAs further described in this prospectus supplement, the interest rate on\ncompounded SOFR notes and simple average SOFR notes will be\ndetermined by reference to a rate based on SOFR.\n\nIn general, the following discussion relating to SOFR is based on information\navailable\non the SOFR Administrator\u0092s Website.\n\nSOFR was selected by the FRBNY in 2017 as a replacement for U.S. LIBOR and since\n2018 has been\npublished by the FRBNY and is intended to be a broad measure of the cost of\nborrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. The SOFR\nAdministrator reports that SOFR includes all trades in the Broad General\nCollateral Rate, plus\nbilateral Treasury repurchase agreement (\u0093repo\u0094) transactions cleared through the\ndelivery-versus-payment service offered by the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation\n(the \u0093FICC\u0094), a subsidiary of The Depository Trust &\nClearing Corporation (\u0093DTCC\u0094). SOFR is filtered by FRBNY to remove a portion of\nthe foregoing transactions considered to be \u0093specials.\u0094 According to FRBNY,\n\u0093specials\u0094 are repos for specific-issue collateral which take\nplace at cash-lending rates below those for general collateral repos because cash\nproviders are willing to accept a lesser return on their cash in order to obtain a\nparticular security.\n\nSOFR is calculated as a volume-weighted median of transaction-level tri-party repo\ndata collected from\nThe Bank of New York Mellon, which currently acts as the clearing bank for the\ntri-party repo market, as well as General Collateral Finance Repo transaction data\nand data on bilateral U.S. Treasury repo\ntransactions cleared through the FICC\u0092s delivery-versus-payment service. FRBNY\nnotes that it obtains information from DTCC Solutions LLC, an affiliate of DTCC.\n\nFRBNY currently publishes SOFR daily on each U.S. government securities business\nday at approximately 8:00 a.m. ET on the SOFR\nAdministrator\u0092s Website. Historical data for an earlier period can be obtained on\nthe SOFR Administrator\u0092s Website through the historical data search function.\n\nAdditional Information about U.S. Dollar SOFR Ice Swap Rate \u00ae\n\nIn general, the following discussion relating to the U.S. Dollar SOFR Ice Swap\nRate is based on information available on the IBA website.\n\nThe U.S. Dollar\nSOFR Ice Swap Rate represents the mid-price for interest rate swaps (the fixed\nleg) and swap spreads (the applicable\nmid-price minus a corresponding specified government bond yield) in USD in various\ntenors ranging from 1 year to 30 years at particular specified times of the day.\nIn June 2020, IBA implemented a waterfall\napproach for the U.S. Dollar SOFR Ice Swap Rate methodology, which the U.S. Dollar\nSOFR Ice Swap Rate follows.\nSubsequently, the U.S. Dollar SOFR Ice Swap Rate launched by IBA for use as a\nbenchmark on November 8, 2021 in order to aid the market\u0092s transition to SOFR and\naway from\nU.S. Dollar LIBOR.\n\nTo calculate the U.S. Dollar SOFR Ice Swap Rate,\nIBA relies on eligible, executable prices and volumes provided by regulated,\nelectronic, trading venues and, if such trading venues do not provide sufficient\neligible input data, eligible dealer to client prices and volumes displayed\nelectronically\nby trading venues. If there is insufficient eligible input data to calculate a\nrate in accordance with the foregoing sentence, IBA uses movement interpolation,\nwhere possible for applicable tenors, to calculate a rate. Where it is not\npossible to\ncalculate a U.S. Dollar SOFR Ice Swap Rate for an applicable tenor in accordance\nwith the foregoing, then IBA\u0092s Insufficient Data Policy as set forth on the U.S.\nDollar SOFR\nIce Swap Rate website will apply and \u0093No Publication\u0094 will be published for the\nU.S. Dollar SOFR Ice Swap Rate of the\napplicable tenor. The U.S. Dollar\n\nS-45\n\nSOFR Ice Swap Rate \u00aefor the various applicable tenors as reported on the ICE\nReport Center is expressed as an integer rounded to two decimal places; however,\nfor purpose of calculations of interest with respect to the notes, such rate will\nbe deemed to be expressed as a percentage. The U.S. Dollar SOFR Ice Swap Rate \u00aeis\ncalculated on each weekday other than those set forth in IBA\u0092s ICE Swap Rate\nHoliday Calendar, which is available on the U.S. Dollar SOFR Ice Swap Rate\n\u00aewebsite, and published in the ICE Report Center, a link to which is available on\nthe U.S. Dollar SOFR Ice Swap Rate \u00aewebsite. For any particular day, the only rate\navailable for viewing on the ICE Report Center is the rate published for the\npreceding publication day.

Paying and Transfer Agent; Security Registrar With\nrespect to any series of notes denominated in U.S. dollars, we have appointed the\ntrustee, acting through its corporate trust office, to act initially as our paying\nagent, security registrar and transfer agent, pursuant to the Indenture.

Payment of Principal,\nInterest, and Other Amounts Payable Payments to Holders and Record Dates for\nInterest Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the provisions\ndescribed in this section will apply to payments on the notes. Subject to any\napplicable business day convention as described below or in the applicable\nsupplement, interest payments, if applicable, on the notes will be made on each\ninterest payment date applicable to, and at the maturity date, or earlier\nredemption date, of, the notes. Interest payable on any interest payment date\nother than the maturity date, or earlier redemption date, will be paid to the\nregistered holder of the note on the regular record date for that interest payment\ndate, as described below. However, unless we specify otherwise in the applicable\nsupplement, the initial interest payment on a note issued between a regular record\ndate and the interest payment date immediately following the regular record date\nwill be made on the second interest payment date following the original issue date\nto the holder of record on the regular record date preceding the second interest\npayment date. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the\nprincipal and interest payable at maturity, or earlier redemption, will be paid to\nthe holder of the note at the time of payment by the paying agent. Except as set\nforth in the following sentence, and unless we specify otherwise in the applicable\nsupplement, the record date for any interest payment for a note in book-entry only\nform will be the S-48\n\ndate that is one business day prior to the applicable payment date. If the note is\n(i) in book-entry only form and held through DTC and is denominated in a currency\nother than U.S. dollars or (ii) in a form that is other than book-entry only, and\nunless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the regular record date\nfor an interest payment date will be the fifteenth calendar day prior to the\napplicable interest payment date as originally scheduled to occur, whether or not\nsuch record date is a business day.

If the    \n      preceding business day convention is specified in the applicable            \n      supplement to be \u0093adjusted,\u0094 then                                             \n      the related interest reset dates and interest periods also will be          \n      adjusted for non-business days; however, if the preceding business day      \n      convention is specified in the applicable supplement to be                  \n      \u0093unadjusted,\u0094 then the related interest reset dates and interest periods      \n      will not be adjusted for non-business days.                                 \n                                                                                  \nIn all cases, unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, if the\nmaturity date or any earlier redemption date or repayment date with respect to any\nnote (other than a compounded SOFR note using the payment delay convention) falls\non a day that is not a business day, any payment of principal and any premium,\ninterest and other amounts otherwise due on such day, will be made on the next\nsucceeding business day, and no interest on such payment will accrue for the\nperiod from and after such maturity date, redemption date or repayment date, as\nthe case may be. If no business day convention is specified in the applicable\nsupplement, then, with respect to any interest period during which the note bears\ninterest at a fixed rate, the following unadjusted business day convention will\napply, and, with respect to any interest period during which the note bears\ninterest at a floating rate, the modified following business day convention\n(adjusted) will apply. We also may specify and describe a different business day\nconvention from those described above in the applicable supplement.

For this purpose, a \u0093net payment\u0094 on such\nnotes means a payment by us or any paying agent, including payment of principal\nand interest, after deduction for any present or future tax, assessment, or\nother governmental charge of the United States (other than a territory or\npossession). These additional amounts will constitute additional interest on the\nnote. For this purpose, U.S. withholding tax means a withholding tax of the United\nStates,\nother than a territory or possession.\n\nExcept as specifically provided in the accompanying prospectus under \u0093Description\nof BofA\nFinance LLC Debt Securities\u0097Payment of Additional Amounts,\u0094 we will not be\nrequired to make any payment of any tax, assessment, or other governmental charge\nimposed by any government, political subdivision, or taxing authority of that\ngovernment.\n\nIf we so specify in the applicable supplement, we may redeem the notes, in whole\nbut not in part, at any time before maturity\nif we have or will become obligated to pay additional amounts as a result of a\nchange in, or an amendment to, United States tax laws or regulations, as described\nin the accompanying prospectus under \u0093Description of BofA Finance LLC Debt\nSecurities\u0097Redemption for Tax Reasons,\u0094 subject to any required approvals as\ndescribed below under \u0093\u0097Redemption.\u0094\n\nBank of America Guarantee\n\nOur payment obligations on the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by\nBank of America as\ndescribed in the accompanying prospectus. If, for any reason, BofA Finance does\nnot make any required payment on any of the notes when due, Bank of America will\nmake such payment, on demand, at the same place and in the same manner that\napplies to\npayments made by BofA Finance under the Indenture.

If the\nnotes may be repaid prior to their stated maturity, the\n\nS-51\n\napplicable supplement will indicate the amount at which we will repay the notes\nand the procedure for repayment.\n\nSurvivor\u0092s Option\n\nThe applicable supplement may indicate that the holder of a note will have a\nsurvivor\u0092s option, which is an option to elect repayment of\nsuch note prior to its stated maturity in the event of the death of the beneficial\nowner of such note, so long as the note was acquired by the beneficial owner at\nleast six months prior to the request, unless otherwise specified in the\napplicable\nsupplement. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the notes\nwill not have a survivor\u0092s option.If the notes do have a survivor\u0092s option, the\nspecific terms of and any additional considerations relating to notes\nwith a survivor\u0092s option will be set forth in the applicable supplement.\n\nReopenings\n\nWe have the ability to \u0093reopen,\u0094 or increase after the issuance date, the\nprincipal amount of a particular tranche or series of our\nnotes without notice to the holders of existing notes by selling additional notes\nhaving the same terms, provided that such additional notes shall be fungible for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes. However, any new notes of this kind may have a\ndifferent offering price and may begin to bear interest (if any) at a different\ndate.\n\nOther Provisions\n\nAny provisions with respect to the determination of an interest rate basis, the\nspecification of interest rate basis, the calculation of the\napplicable interest rate, the amounts payable at maturity, earlier redemption or\nrepayment, as the case may be, the interest payment dates, or any other related\nmatters for a particular tranche of notes, may be modified as described in the\napplicable supplement.\n\nRepurchase\n\nWe, or our affiliates, may purchase at any time our notes by tender, in the open\nmarket at prevailing prices or in private transactions at\nnegotiated prices.

Unless we\nspecify otherwise in the applicable supplement, we will issue notes in book-entry\nonly form. This means that we will not issue certificated notes in definitive form\nto each beneficial owner. Instead, the notes will be in the form of a global note\nor\na master global note, in fully registered form, registered and held in the name of\nand deposited with or on behalf of the applicable depository or a nominee of that\ndepository. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the\ndepository\nfor the notes will be DTC. Such notes will be registered in the name of Cede & Co.\n(DTC\u0092s partnership nominee) or any other name as may be requested by an authorized\nrepresentative of DTC and will be deposited with DTC. For notes\ndenominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, the applicable supplement may\nspecify that such notes will be cleared through Euroclear Bank SA/NV (\u0093Euroclear\u0094)\nand/or Clearstream Banking S.A., Luxembourg (\u0093Clearstream\u0094),\nrather than DTC. DTC, Euroclear, and Clearstream, as depositories for global\nsecurities, and some of their policies and procedures, are described under\n\u0093Registration and Settlement\u0097Depositories for Global Securities\u0094 in the\naccompanying prospectus. For more information about book-entry only notes and the\nprocedures for registration, settlement, exchange, and transfer of book-entry only\nnotes, see \u0093Description of Debt Securities of BofA Finance LLC\u0097Form and\nDenomination of Debt Securities\u0094 and \u0093Registration and Settlement\u0094 in the\naccompanying prospectus.\n\nS-52\n\nUnless specified otherwise in the applicable supplement, your notes will be\nrepresented by a\nkind of global note that we refer to as a master global note. This kind of global\nnote represents multiple notes that have different terms and are issued at\ndifferent times. Each note evidenced by a master note will be identified by the\ntrustee on a\nschedule to the master note. If we specify in the applicable supplement that your\nnotes will not be represented by a master global note, then all notes represented\nby the same global note will have the same terms.\n\nIf we ever issue notes in definitive form, unless we specify otherwise in the\napplicable supplement, those notes will be in registered form,\nand the exchange, registration, or transfer of those notes will be governed by the\nIndenture and the procedures described under \u0093Description of Debt Securities of\nBofA Finance LLC\u0097Exchange, Registration, and Transfer\u0094 in the\naccompanying prospectus.\n\nS-53\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION (CONFLICTS OF INTEREST)\n\nBofA Finance is offering the notes for sale on a continuing basis through the\nselling agents. The selling agents may act either on a\nprincipal basis or on an agency basis. We may offer the notes at varying prices\nrelating to prevailing market prices at the time of resale, as determined by the\nselling agents, or, if so specified in the applicable supplement, for resale at a\nfixed\npublic offering price. The applicable supplement will set forth the initial price\nfor the notes, or whether they will be sold at varying prices.\n\nIf BofA Finance sells notes on an agency basis, it will pay a commission to the\nselling agent to be negotiated at the time of sale. The\ncommission will be determined at the time of sale and will be specified in the\napplicable supplement. Each selling agent will use its reasonable best efforts\nwhen we request it to solicit purchases of the notes as our agent.\n\nUnless otherwise agreed and specified in the applicable supplement, if notes are\nsold to a selling agent acting as principal, for its own\naccount, or for resale to one or more investors or other purchasers, including\nother broker-dealers, then any notes so sold will be purchased by that selling\nagent at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes less a\ncommission that\nwill be a percentage of the principal amount determined as described above. Notes\nsold in this manner may be resold by the selling agent to investors and other\npurchasers from time to time in one or more transactions, including negotiated\ntransactions, at a fixed public offering price or at varying prices determined at\nthe time of sale, or the notes may be resold to other dealers for resale to\ninvestors. The selling agents may allow any portion of the discount received in\nconnection\nwith the purchase from us to the dealers, but the discount allowed to any dealer\nwill not be in excess of the discount to be received by the selling agent from us.\nAfter the initial public offering of notes, the selling agent may change the\npublic\noffering price or the discount allowed to dealers.\n\nBofA Finance also may sell notes directly to investors, without the involvement of\nany\nselling agent. In this case, we would not be obligated to pay any commission or\ndiscount in connection with the sale, and we would receive 100% of the principal\namount of the notes so sold, unless otherwise specified in the applicable\nsupplement.\n\nBofA Finance will name any selling agents or other persons through which it sells\nany notes, as well as any commissions or discounts\npayable to those selling agents or other persons, in the applicable supplement. As\nof the date of this prospectus supplement, our selling agent is BofA Securities,\nInc. (\u0093BofAS\u0094). BofA Finance and Bank of America will enter into a\ndistribution agreement with BofAS that describes the offering of notes by them as\nagent and as principal. A form of distribution agreement will be filed as an\nexhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus supplement forms a\npart.\nBofA Finance also may accept offers to purchase notes through additional selling\nagents on substantially the same terms and conditions, including commissions, as\nwould apply to purchases through BofAS under the distribution agreement. If a\nselling\nagent purchases notes as principal, that selling agent usually will be required to\nenter into a separate purchase agreement for the notes, and may be referred to in\nthat purchase agreement and the applicable supplement, along with any other\nselling\nagents, as an \u0093underwriter.\u0094\n\nBofA Finance has the right to withdraw, cancel, or modify the offer made by this\nprospectus\nsupplement without notice. BofA Finance will have the sole right to accept offers\nto purchase notes, and, in its absolute discretion, may reject any proposed\npurchase of notes in whole or in part. Each selling agent will have the right, in\nits\nreasonable discretion, to reject in whole or in part any proposed purchase of\nnotes through that selling agent.\n\nAny selling agent\nparticipating in the distribution of the notes may be considered to be an\nunderwriter, as that term is defined in the Securities Act. We and Bank of America\nhave agreed to\n\nS-54\n\nindemnify each selling agent and certain other persons against certain\nliabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to\npayments that the selling agents may be required to make. We and Bank of America\nalso have agreed to reimburse the selling agents for certain expenses. The notes\nwill not have an established trading market when issued, and we do not intend to\nlist the notes on any securities exchange, unless otherwise specified in the\napplicable supplement. Any selling agent may purchase and sell notes in the\nsecondary market from time to time. However, no selling agent is obligated to do\nso, and any selling agent may discontinue making a market in the notes at any time\nwithout notice. There is no assurance that there will be a secondary market for\nany of the notes. To facilitate offerings of the notes by a selling agent that\npurchases notes as principal, and in accordance with industry practice, selling\nagents may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain, or otherwise affect\nthe market price of the notes. Those transactions may include overallotment,\nentering stabilizing bids, effecting syndicate-covering transactions, and imposing\npenalty bids to reclaim selling concessions allowed to a member of the syndicate\nor to a dealer, as follows:\n                                                                                  \n      An overallotment in connection with an offering creates a short position    \n      in the offered securities for the                                           \n      selling agent\u0092s own account.                                                 \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      A selling agent may place a stabilizing bid to purchase a note for the      \n      purpose of pegging, fixing, or maintaining                                  \n      the price of that note.                                                     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      Selling agents may engage in syndicate-covering transactions to cover       \n      overallotments or to stabilize the price of                                 \n      the notes by bidding for, and purchasing, the notes or any other            \n      securities in the open market in order to reduce a short position created   \n      in connection with the offering.                                            \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      The selling agent that serves as syndicate manager may impose a penalty     \n      bid on a syndicate member to reclaim a                                      \n      selling concession in connection with an offering when offered securities   \n      originally sold by the syndicate member are purchased in                    \n      syndicate-covering transactions, in stabilization transactions, or          \n      otherwise.                                                                  \n                                                                                  \nIn connection with any offering of the notes, we may appoint a \u0093stabilizing\nmanager,\u0094 in which case the stabilizing manager will be identified in the\napplicable supplement. The stabilizing manager (or persons acting on its behalf),\nif any, may over allot notes or effect transactions with a view to supporting the\nmarket price of the applicable notes during the stabilization period at a level\nhigher than that which might otherwise prevail. However, stabilization action may\nnot necessarily occur. Any stabilization action may begin on or after the date on\nwhich adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offer of the applicable\nseries of notes is made and, if begun, may be ended at any time, but it must end\nno later than 30 days after the date on which we receive the proceeds of the\napplicable offering of notes, or no later than 60 days after the date of allotment\nof the applicable series of notes, whichever is the earlier. Any stabilization\naction or over allotment must be conducted by the stabilizing manager (or persons\nacting on its behalf) in accordance with all applicable laws and rules and will be\nundertaken at the offices of the stabilizing manager (or persons acting on its\nbehalf) and, if applicable, on the applicable securities exchange on which the\napplicable series of notes is listed (if any). Any of these activities may\nstabilize or maintain the market price of the securities above independent market\nlevels. The selling agents are not required to engage in these activities, and may\nend any of these activities at any time. The stabilizing manager (if any) may\nconduct these S-55\n\nactivities in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. If the stabilizing manager\n(if any) commences any of these\ntransactions, it may discontinue them at any time.\n\nBofAS, a selling agent and one of our affiliates, is a broker-dealer and member of\nthe\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., or \u0093FINRA.\u0094 Each initial offering\nand any remarketing of notes involving any of our broker-dealer affiliates,\nincluding BofAS, will be conducted in compliance with the requirements of FINRA\nRule 5121 regarding a FINRA member firm\u0092s offer and sale of securities of an\naffiliate. None of our broker-dealer affiliates that is a FINRA member will\nexecute a transaction in the notes in a discretionary account without specific\nprior\nwritten approval of the customer. For more information, see \u0093Plan of Distribution\n(Conflicts of Interest)\u0097Conflicts of Interest\u0094 in the accompanying prospectus.\n\nFollowing the initial distribution of any notes, our broker-dealer affiliates,\nincluding BofAS, may buy and sell the notes in market-making\ntransactions as part of their business as a broker-dealer. Resales of this kind\nmay occur in the open market or may be privately negotiated at prevailing market\nprices at the time of sale. Notes may be sold in connection with a remarketing\nafter\ntheir purchase by one or more firms. Any of our affiliates may act as principal or\nagent in these transactions.\n\nThis prospectus\nsupplement may be used by one or more of our affiliates in connection with offers\nand sales related to market-making transactions in the notes, including block\npositioning and block trades, to the extent permitted by applicable law.

Notes sold in\nmarket-making transactions include notes issued after the date of this prospectus\nsupplement as well as previously-issued securities.\n\nInformation about the trade and settlement dates, as well as the purchase price,\nfor a market-making transaction will be provided to the\npurchaser in a separate confirmation of sale. Unless BofA Finance or one of its\nselling agents informs you in the confirmation of sale that notes are being\npurchased in an original offering and sale, you may assume that you are purchasing\nthe notes\nin a market-making transaction.\n\nBofAS and other selling agents that BofA Finance may name in the future, or their\naffiliates, have\nengaged, and may in the future engage, in investment banking, commercial banking,\nand financial advisory transactions with BofA Finance and its affiliates. These\ntransactions are in the ordinary course of business for the selling agents and\nBofA\nFinance and its respective affiliates. In these transactions, the selling agents\nor their affiliates receive customary fees and expenses.\n\nIn the applicable supplement, BofA Finance will specify the settlement period for\nthe offered notes. Under Rule\n15c6-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, trades in the secondary market\ngenerally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to a\ntrade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, if\nBofA Finance specifies a longer settlement cycle in the applicable supplement for\nan offering of notes, purchasers who wish to trade those notes on any date prior\nto two business days before delivery of the notes will be required to specify an\nalternative settlement cycle at the time of the trade to prevent a failed\nsettlement and should consult their own advisors in connection with that election.\n\nSelling Restrictions\n\nGeneral.

Such indemnity may\nbe against expenses (including attorneys\u0092 fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid\nin settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with\nsuch action, suit or proceeding, if the person acted in good faith and in a manner\nthe person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of\nthe corporation and if, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, the\nperson did not have reasonable cause to believe the person\u0092s conduct was unlawful.\nSection 145(b) of the Delaware Corporation Law provides, in general, that a\ncorporation has the power to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is\nthreatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or\nsuit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor\nbecause the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the\ncorporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director,\nofficer, employee or agent of any other enterprise, against any expenses\n(including attorneys\u0092 fees) actually and reasonably incurred by the person in\nconnection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if the person\nacted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not\nopposed to the best interests of the corporation, except that no indemnification\nshall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person\nshall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the\nextent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was\nbrought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of\nliability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly\nand reasonably II-1\n\nentitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other\ncourt shall deem proper.\n\nSection 145(g) of the Delaware Corporation Law provides, in general, that a\ncorporation has the power to purchase and maintain insurance\non behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of\nthe corporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a\ndirector, officer, employee or agent of any other enterprise, against any\nliability asserted\nagainst the person in any such capacity, or arising out of the person\u0092s status as\nsuch, regardless of whether the corporation would have the power to indemnify the\nperson against such liability under the provisions of Section 145 of the\nDelaware Corporation Law.\n\nArticle VIII of the bylaws of Bank of America Corporation (\u0093Bank of America\u0094)\nprovides for\nindemnification to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware Corporation Law\nfor any person who is or was a director or officer of Bank of America who is or\nwas involved or threatened to be made involved in any proceeding, whether civil,\ncriminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that such person\nis or was serving as a director, officer, manager or employee of Bank of America\nor is or was serving at the request of Bank of America as a director, officer,\nmanager\nor employee of any other enterprise.
