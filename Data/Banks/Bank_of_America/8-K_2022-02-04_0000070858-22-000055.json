Additionally, the\nCompany\u2019s wealth management businesses had record client flows, the Investment\nBank had a record year, and Global Markets achieved its highest sales and trading\nrevenue in a decade.\n\nCommunities . The Company continued to advance racial equality and economic\nopportunity, including funding $450 million of the previously announced $1.25\nbillion commitment. Our actions in 2021 included:\n\n\u2013 Investing $36 million in 21 Minority Deposit Institutions and Community\nDevelopment Financial Institutions, banks supporting minority-owned businesses\n\n\u2013 Providing $300 million to 100 equity funds to provide capital to diverse\nentrepreneurs and small business owners\n\n\u2013 Committing $15 billion to help 60,000 individuals and families purchase an\naffordable home\n\nBank of America also issued its second Equality Progress Sustainability Bond for\n$2 billion to promote financing for, and investments in, underserved communities,\nminority-and women-led businesses and low-carbon solutions. The Company made\nprogress on its announced goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions before 2050\nand our $1.5 trillion sustainable finance commitment.\n\nIn addition, the Board recognized Mr. Moynihan\u2019s leadership in 2021, including the\nsuccessful transition of new leaders to the Bank of America Management Team to\ncontinue to drive responsible growth. The Board also recognized Mr. Moynihan\u2019s\nleadership in the financial services industry and among other CEO forums,\nincluding as chair of the World Economic Forum\u2019s International Business Council\nand The Clearing House, and as co-chair of the Sustainable Markets Initiative.\n\nCompensation Structure . The Board determined that Mr. Moynihan\u2019s compensation\nstructure continues to be composed of base salary, time-based restricted stock\nunits (\u201cRSUs\u201d), and performance RSUs. Mr. Moynihan\u2019s annual base salary remains\n$1.5 million. The aggregate value of his 2021 equity incentive award is $30.5\nmillion. Consistent with prior years, there is no cash bonus. The incentive is\ncomprised 30% of cash-settled RSUs that will vest over the next 12 months, 20% of\nstock-settled RSUs that will vest annually over the next four years, and 50% of\nperformance RSUs that will be re-earned only if Bank of America\u2019s future financial\nperformance meets specific standards.\n\nThe overall structure of Mr. Moynihan\u2019s 2021 performance RSUs remains consistent\nwith the structure over the prior nine years, during which time shareholders voted\nto approve the Company\u2019s executive compensation program through the annual\nadvisory \u201cSay on Pay\u201d process with an average of 94.5 % support. The performance\nRSUs awarded to Mr. Moynihan continue to use a \u201cre-earn\u201d approach, vesting only if\nthe Company meets specific performance standards over a three-year period (from\n2022 through 2024). Under this \u201cre-earn\u201d approach, future performance of the\nCompany below the standards of the performance RSUs will decrease the amount\nultimately paid; 100% is the maximum payout if standards are met. The three-year\naverage return on assets and three-year average growth in adjusted tangible book\nvalue standards for the performance RSUs are unchanged from last year.\n\nAdditionally, all of Mr. Moynihan\u2019s 2021 equity incentive awards are subject to\nBank of America\u2019s stock ownership and retention requirements. Specifically, 50% of\nthe net after-tax shares he receives from equity awards must be retained until one\nyear after his retirement. These equity awards also are subject to Bank of\nAmerica\u2019s cancellation and clawback policies.\n                                                                                  \n                                    SIGNATURES                                    \n                                                                                  \nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the\nRegistrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the\nundersigned hereunto duly authorized.\n                                                             \n  BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION                                \n  By:                            /s/ Ross E.
