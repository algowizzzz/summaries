The\nCouncil sponsors and supports business,\noperating unit and regional diversity\nand inclusion councils to ensure\nalignment with enterprise diversity\nstrategies and goals.\n\nOur practices and policies have resulted\nin strong representation across the\nCorporation where our broad employee\npopulation mirrors the clients and\ncommunities we serve. We have a Board\nand senior management team that are 50\npercent and 55 percent racially,\nethnically and gender diverse. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, of global employees\nwho self-identified, 50 percent of\nemployees were women, and, among\nU.S.-based employees who self-\nidentified, 49 percent were people of\ncolor, including 13 percent who were\nAsian, 14 percent who were Black/African\nAmerican and 19 percent who were\nHispanic/Latino. As of December 31,\n2021, the Corporation\u2019s top three\nmanagement levels in relation to the CEO\nwere composed of more than 42 percent\nwomen globally and 24 percent people of\ncolor in the U.S., including eight\npercent who were Asian, nine percent who\nwere Black/African American and six\npercent who were Hispanic/Latino.\nAdditionally, as of December 31, 2021,\nthe Corporation\u2019s managers at all levels\nwere composed of 42 percent women\nglobally and 41 percent people of color\nin the U.S., including 13 percent who\nwere Asian, 10 percent who were\nBlack/African American and 16 percent\nwho were Hispanic/Latino. These\nworkforce diversity metrics are reported\nregularly to the senior management team\nand to the Board.\n\nWe invest in our talent by offering a\nrange of development programs and\nresources that allow employees to\ndevelop and progress in their careers.\nWe reinforce our commitment to diversity\nand inclusion by investing internally in\nour employee networks and by\nfacilitating enterprise-wide learning\nand conversations about various\ndiversity and inclusion topics and\nissues. Further, we partner with various\nexternal organizations, which focus on\nadvancing diverse talent. We also have\npractices in place for attracting and\nretaining diverse talent, including\ncampus recruitment. For example, in\n2021, 46 percent of our global campus\nhires were women, and, in the U.S., 53\npercent were people of color.\n                                                                                  \n  Employee Engagement and Talent Retention                                        \n                                                                                  \nAs part of our ongoing efforts to make\nthe Corporation a great place to work,\nwe have conducted a confidential annual\nEmployee Engagement Survey (Survey) for\nnearly two decades. The Survey results\nare reviewed by the Board and senior\nmanagement and used to assist in\nreviewing the Corporation\u2019s human\ncapital strategies, programs and\npractices. In 2021, 89 percent of the\nCorporation\u2019s employees participated in\nthe Survey, and our Employee Engagement\nIndex, an overall measure of employee\nsatisfaction with the Corporation, was\n88 percent. Our turnover among employees\nwas 12 percent in 2021 and seven percent\nin 2020. Our pre-pandemic levels of\nturnover in 2019 and 2018 were 11\npercent and 12 percent.\n\nAdditionally, the Corporation provides a\nvariety of resources to help employees\ngrow in their current roles and build\nnew skills, including resources to help\nemployees find new opportunities, re-\nskill and seek leadership positions. The\nlearning and development strategy is\ngrounded in the development of\nhorizontal skills delivered throughout\nthe organization. Senior leaders,\nmanagers and teammates are onboarded and\nbuild horizontal skills, as well as\nrole-specific skills, to drive high\nperformance. This approach also\nfacilitates internal mobility and\npromotion of talent to build a bench of\nqualified managers and leaders. In 2021,\nmore than 26,000 employees found new\nroles within the Corporation and we\n\ndelivered more than 10 million hours of\ntraining and development to our\nteammates through the Corporation\u2019s\ntraining academy.\n                                                                                  \n  Fair and Equitable Compensation                                                 \n                                                                                  \nThe Corporation is committed to racial\nand gender pay equity by striving to\ncompensate all of our employees fairly\nand equitably. We maintain robust\npolicies and practices that reinforce\nour commitment, including reviews\nconducted by a third-party consultant\nwith oversight from our Board and senior\nmanagement. In 2021, our review covered\nour regional hubs (U.S., U.K., France,\nIreland, Hong Kong and Singapore) and\nIndia and showed that compensation\nreceived by women, on average, was\ngreater than 99 percent of that received\nby men in comparable positions and, in\nthe U.S., compensation received by\npeople of color was, on average, greater\nthan 99 percent of that received by\nteammates who are not people of color in\ncomparable positions.\n\nWe also strive to pay our employees\nfairly based on market rates for their\nroles, experience and how they perform.\nWe regularly benchmark against other\ncompanies both within and outside our\nindustry to help ensure our pay is\ncompetitive. In the fourth quarter of\n2021, we raised our minimum hourly wage\nfor U.S. employees to $21 per hour,\nwhich is above all governmental minimum\nwage levels in all jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate in the U.S., and\nannounced plans to increase to $25 per\nhour by 2025.\n                                                                                  \n  Health and Wellness \u2013 2021 Focus                                                \n                                                                                  \nThe Corporation also is committed to\nsupporting employees\u2019 physical,\nemotional and financial wellness by\noffering flexible and competitive\nbenefits, including comprehensive health\nand insurance benefits and wellness\nresources. In 2021, we continued efforts\nto support our employees through the\nongoing health crisis resulting from the\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\npandemic (the pandemic). We continued to\nmonitor guidance from the U.S. Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention,\nmedical boards and health authorities\nand prioritized sharing such guidance\nwith our teammates. Other benefits and\nresources related to the pandemic\nincluded offering no-cost COVID-19\ntesting, paid time off to allow\nteammates to get vaccinated for\nCOVID-19, providing teammates with\nincentives for getting the vaccine and\nbooster, hosting a medical expert\neducation series and providing on-site\nCOVID-19 vaccine and booster clinics.\n\nWe continued our efforts around\nproviding affordable access to\nhealthcare, including offering no-cost,\n24/7 access to virtual general medical\nand behavioral health resources to help\nour enrolled U.S. teammates stay\nhealthy, both physically and\nemotionally. We kept U.S. health\ninsurance premiums unchanged for\nteammates earning less than $50,000 for\nthe ninth year in a row, and had nominal\npremium increases for teammates earning\nfrom $50,000 to $100,000 for the fifth\nyear in a row. We also provided\npreventative care medications at no cost\nfor U.S. teammates enrolled in the\nBank\u2019s medical plan.\n\nWe have expanded our child and adult\ncare solutions for eligible U.S.\nteammates to help better support their\nfamilies and dependents, including\nproviding up to 50 days of backup care\nfor both adults and children and\nexpanding access to our reimbursement\nprogram to help employees manage child\ncare expenses. Additional support to\nworking parents includes parental leave\nand time off from work to care for and\nbond with a newborn or adopted child (16\nweeks paid plus 10 weeks unpaid for a\ntotal of up to 26 weeks).\n                                                                                  \n  3Bank of America                                                                \n                                                                                  \nFor more information about our human\ncapital management, see the\nCorporation\u2019s website and 2021 Annual\nReport to shareholders that will be\navailable on the Investor Relations\nportion of our website in March 2022\n(the content of which is not\nincorporated by reference into this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K).\n                                                                                  \n  Government Supervision and Regulation                                           \n                                                                                  \nThe following discussion describes,\namong other things, elements of an\nextensive regulatory framework\napplicable to BHCs, financial holding\ncompanies, banks and broker-dealers,\nincluding specific information about\nBank of America.\n\nWe are subject to an extensive\nregulatory framework applicable to BHCs,\nfinancial holding companies and banks\nand other financial services entities.\nU.S. federal regulation of banks, BHCs\nand financial holding companies is\nintended primarily for the protection of\ndepositors and the Deposit Insurance\nFund (DIF) rather than for the\nprotection of shareholders and\ncreditors.\n\nAs a registered financial holding\ncompany and BHC, the Corporation is\nsubject to the supervision of, and\nregular inspection by, the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System\n(Federal Reserve). Our U.S. bank\nsubsidiaries (the Banks), organized as\nnational banking associations, are\nsubject to regulation, supervision and\nexamination by the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency (OCC), the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(FDIC) and the Federal Reserve. In\naddition, the Federal Reserve and the\nOCC have adopted guidelines that\nestablish minimum standards for the\ndesign, implementation and board\noversight of BHCs\u2019 and national banks\u2019\nrisk governance frameworks. U.S.\nfinancial holding companies, and the\ncompanies under their control, are\npermitted to engage in activities\nconsidered \u201cfinancial in nature\u201d as\ndefined by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act\nand related Federal Reserve\ninterpretations. The Corporation's\nstatus as a financial holding company is\nconditioned upon maintaining certain\neligibility requirements for both the\nCorporation and its U.S. depository\ninstitution subsidiaries, including\nminimum capital ratios, supervisory\nratings and, in the case of the\ndepository institutions, at least\nsatisfactory Community Reinvestment Act\nratings. Failure to be an eligible\nfinancial holding company could result\nin the Federal Reserve limiting Bank of\nAmerica's activities, including\npotential acquisitions.\n\nThe scope of the laws and regulations\nand the intensity of the supervision to\nwhich we are subject have increased over\nthe past several years, beginning with\nthe response to the financial crisis, as\nwell as other factors such as\ntechnological and market changes. In\naddition, the banking and financial\nservices sector is subject to\nsubstantial regulatory enforcement and\nfines. Many of these changes have\noccurred as a result of the 2010 Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act (the Financial Reform\nAct). We cannot assess whether there\nwill be any additional major changes in\nthe regulatory environment and expect\nthat our business will remain subject to\ncontinuing and extensive regulation and\nsupervision.\n\nWe are also subject to various other\nlaws and regulations, as well as\nsupervision and examination by other\nregulatory agencies, all of which\ndirectly or indirectly affect our\nentities, management and ability to make\ndistributions to shareholders. For\ninstance, our broker-dealer subsidiaries\nare subject to both U.S. and\ninternational regulation, including\nsupervision by the SEC, Financial\nIndustry Regulatory Authority and New\nYork Stock Exchange, among others; our\nfutures commission merchant subsidiaries\nsupporting commodities and derivatives\nbusinesses in the U.S. are subject to\nregulation by and\n\nsupervision of the U.S. Commodity\nFutures Trading Commission (CFTC),\nNational Futures Association, the\nChicago Mercantile Exchange, and in the\ncase of the Banks, certain banking\nregulators; our insurance activities are\nsubject to licensing and regulation by\nstate insurance regulatory agencies; and\nour consumer financial products and\nservices are regulated by the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau (CFPB).\n\nOur non-U.S. businesses are also subject\nto extensive regulation by various\nnon-U.S. regulators, including\ngovernments, securities exchanges,\nprudential regulators, central banks and\nother regulatory bodies, in the\njurisdictions in which those businesses\noperate. For example, our financial\nservices entities in the United Kingdom\n(U.K.), Ireland and France are subject\nto regulation by the Prudential\nRegulatory Authority and Financial\nConduct Authority, the European Central\nBank and Central Bank of Ireland, and\nthe Autorit\u00e9 de Contr\u00f4le Prudentiel et\nde R\u00e9solution and Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s\nFinanciers, respectively.\n                                                                                  \n  Source of Strength                                                              \n                                                                                  \nUnder the Financial Reform Act and\nFederal Reserve policy, BHCs are\nexpected to act as a source of financial\nstrength to each subsidiary bank and to\ncommit resources to support each such\nsubsidiary. Similarly, under the cross-\nguarantee provisions of the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation\nImprovement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), in the\nevent of a loss suffered or anticipated\nby the FDIC, either as a result of\ndefault of a bank subsidiary or related\nto FDIC assistance provided to such a\nsubsidiary in danger of default, the\naffiliate banks of such a subsidiary may\nbe assessed for the FDIC\u2019s loss, subject\nto certain exceptions.\n                                                                                  \n  Transactions with Affiliates                                                    \n                                                                                  \nPursuant to Section 23A and 23B of the\nFederal Reserve Act, as implemented by\nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s Regulation W, the\nBanks are subject to restrictions that\nlimit certain types of transactions\nbetween the Banks and their nonbank\naffiliates. In general, U.S. banks are\nsubject to quantitative and qualitative\nlimits on extensions of credit,\npurchases of assets and certain other\ntransactions involving their nonbank\naffiliates. Additionally, transactions\nbetween U.S. banks and their nonbank\naffiliates are required to be on arm\u2019s\nlength terms and must be consistent with\nstandards of safety and soundness.\n                                                                                  \n  Deposit Insurance                                                               \n                                                                                  \nDeposits placed at U.S. domiciled banks\nare insured by the FDIC, subject to\nlimits and conditions of applicable law\nand the FDIC\u2019s regulations. Pursuant to\nthe Financial Reform Act, FDIC insurance\ncoverage limits are $250,000 per\ndepositor, per insured bank for each\naccount ownership category. All insured\ndepository institutions are required to\npay assessments to the FDIC in order to\nfund the DIF.\n\nThe FDIC is required to maintain at\nleast a designated minimum ratio of the\nDIF to insured deposits in the U.S. The\nFDIC adopted regulations that establish\na long-term target DIF ratio of greater\nthan two percent. As of the date of this\nreport, the DIF ratio is below this\nrequired target, and the FDIC has\nadopted a restoration plan that may\nresult in increased deposit insurance\nassessments. Deposit insurance\nassessment rates are subject to change\nby the FDIC and will be impacted by the\noverall economy and the stability of the\nbanking industry as a whole.

These rules are\ncomplex and are evolving as U.S. and\ninternational regulatory authorities\npropose and enact amendments to these\nrules. The Corporation seeks to manage\nits capital position to maintain\nsufficient capital to satisfy these\nregulatory rules and to support our\nbusiness activities. These continually\nevolving rules are likely to influence\nour planning processes and may require\nadditional regulatory capital and\nliquidity, as well as impose additional\noperational and compliance costs on the\nCorporation.\n\nFor more information on regulatory\ncapital rules, capital composition and\npending or proposed regulatory capital\nchanges, see Capital Management on page\n49, and Note 16 \u2013 Regulatory\nRequirements and Restrictions to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements, which\nare incorporated by reference in this\nItem 1.\n                                                                                  \n  Distributions                                                                   \n                                                                                  \nWe are subject to various regulatory\npolicies and requirements relating to\ncapital actions, including payment of\ndividends and common stock repurchases.\nFor instance, Federal Reserve\nregulations require major U.S. BHCs to\nsubmit a capital plan as part of an\nannual Comprehensive Capital Analysis\nand Review (CCAR).\n\nOur ability to pay dividends and make\ncommon stock repurchases depends in part\non our ability to maintain regulatory\ncapital levels above minimum\nrequirements plus buffers and non-\ncapital standards established under the\nFDICIA. To the extent that the Federal\nReserve increases our stress capital\nbuffer (SCB), global systemically\nimportant bank (G-SIB) surcharge or\ncountercyclical capital buffer, our\nreturns of capital to shareholders could\ndecrease. As part of its CCAR, the\nFederal Reserve conducts stress testing\non parts of our business using\nhypothetical economic scenarios prepared\nby the Federal Reserve. Those scenarios\nmay affect our CCAR stress test results,\nwhich may impact the level of our SCB.\nAdditionally, the Federal Reserve may\nimpose limitations or prohibitions on\ntaking capital actions such as paying or\nincreasing common stock dividends or\nrepurchasing common stock. For example,\nas a result of the economic uncertainty\nresulting from the pandemic, in the\nsecond half of 2020 the Federal Reserve\nintroduced certain limitations to\ncapital distributions for all large\nbanks, including the Corporation, which\nwere removed effective July 1, 2021.\n\nIf the Federal Reserve finds that any of\nour Banks are not \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d or\n\u201cwell-managed,\u201d we would be required to\nenter into an agreement with the Federal\nReserve to comply with all applicable\ncapital and management requirements,\nwhich may contain additional limitations\nor conditions relating to our\nactivities. Additionally, the applicable\nfederal regulatory authority is\nauthorized to determine, under certain\ncircumstances relating to the financial\ncondition of a bank or BHC, that the\npayment of dividends would be an unsafe\nor unsound practice and to prohibit\npayment thereof.\n\nFor more information regarding the\nrequirements relating to the payment of\ndividends, including the minimum capital\nrequirements, see Note 13 \u2013\nShareholders\u2019 Equity and Note 16 \u2013\nRegulatory Requirements and Restrictions\nto the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nMany of our subsidiaries, including our\nbank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are\nsubject to laws that restrict dividend\npayments, or authorize regulatory bodies\nto block or reduce the\n\nflow of funds from those subsidiaries to\nthe parent company or other\nsubsidiaries. The rights of the\nCorporation, our shareholders and our\ncreditors to participate in any\ndistribution of the assets or earnings\nof our subsidiaries are further subject\nto the prior claims of creditors of the\nrespective subsidiaries.\n                                                                                  \n  Resolution Planning                                                             \n                                                                                  \nAs a BHC with greater than $250 billion\nof assets, the Corporation is required\nby the Federal Reserve and the FDIC to\nperiodically submit a plan for a rapid\nand orderly resolution in the event of\nmaterial financial distress or failure.\n\nSuch resolution plan is intended to be a\ndetailed roadmap for the orderly\nresolution of the BHC, including the\ncontinued operations or solvent wind\ndown of its material entities, pursuant\nto the U.S. Bankruptcy Code under one or\nmore hypothetical scenarios assuming no\nextraordinary government assistance.\n\nIf both the Federal Reserve and the FDIC\ndetermine that the BHC\u2019s plan is not\ncredible, the Federal Reserve and the\nFDIC may jointly impose more stringent\ncapital, leverage or liquidity\nrequirements or restrictions on growth,\nactivities or operations. A summary of\nour plan is available on the Federal\nReserve and FDIC websites.\n\nThe FDIC also requires the submission of\na resolution plan for Bank of America,\nNational Association (BANA), which must\ndescribe how the insured depository\ninstitution would be resolved under the\nbank resolution provisions of the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Act. A\ndescription of this plan is available on\nthe FDIC\u2019s website.\n\nWe continue to make substantial progress\nto enhance our resolvability, which\nincludes continued improvements to our\npreparedness capabilities to implement\nour resolution plan, both from a\nfinancial and operational standpoint.\n\nAcross international jurisdictions,\nresolution planning is the\nresponsibility of national resolution\nauthorities (RA). Among those, the\njurisdictions with the greatest impact\nto the Corporation\u2019s subsidiaries are\nthe U.K., Ireland and France, where\nrules have been issued requiring the\nsubmission of significant information\nabout locally incorporated subsidiaries\nas well as the Corporation\u2019s banking\nbranches located in those jurisdictions\nthat are deemed to be material for\nresolution planning purposes. As a\nresult of the RA's review of the\nsubmitted information, we could be\nrequired to take certain actions over\nthe next several years that could\nincrease operating costs and potentially\nresult in the restructuring of certain\nbusinesses and subsidiaries.\n\nFor more information regarding our\nresolution plan, see Item 1A. Risk\nFactors \u2013 Liquidity on page 10.\n                                                                                  \n  Insolvency and the Orderly Liquidation Authority                                \n                                                                                  \nUnder the Federal Deposit Insurance Act,\nthe FDIC may be appointed receiver of an\ninsured depository institution if it is\ninsolvent or in certain other\ncircumstances. In addition, under the\nFinancial Reform Act, when a\nsystemically important financial\ninstitution (SIFI) such as the\nCorporation is in default or danger of\ndefault, the FDIC may be appointed\nreceiver in order to conduct an orderly\nliquidation of such institution. In the\nevent of such appointment, the FDIC\ncould, among other things, invoke the\norderly liquidation authority, instead\nof the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, if the\nSecretary of the Treasury makes certain\nfinancial distress and systemic risk\ndeterminations. The orderly liquidation\nauthority is modeled in part on the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Act, but also\nadopts certain concepts from the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code.\n                                                                                  \n  5Bank of America                                                                \n                                                                                  \nThe orderly liquidation authority\ncontains certain differences from the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code. For example, in\ncertain circumstances, the FDIC could\npermit payment of obligations it\ndetermines to be systemically\nsignificant (e.g., short-term creditors\nor operating creditors) in lieu of\npaying other obligations (e.g., long-\nterm creditors) without the need to\nobtain creditors\u2019 consent or prior court\nreview. The insolvency and resolution\nprocess could also lead to a large\nreduction or total elimination of the\nvalue of a BHC\u2019s outstanding equity, as\nwell as impairment or elimination of\ncertain debt.\n\nUnder the FDIC\u2019s \u201csingle point of entry\u201d\nstrategy for resolving SIFIs, the FDIC\ncould replace a distressed BHC with a\nbridge holding company, which could\ncontinue operations and result in an\norderly resolution of the underlying\nbank, but whose equity is held solely\nfor the benefit of creditors of the\noriginal BHC.\n\nFurthermore, the Federal Reserve\nrequires that BHCs maintain minimum\nlevels of long-term debt required to\nprovide adequate loss absorbing capacity\nin the event of a resolution.\n\nFor more information regarding our\nresolution, see Item 1A. Risk Factors \u2013\nLiquidity on page 10.\n                                                                                  \n  Limitations on Acquisitions                                                     \n                                                                                  \nThe Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and\nBranching Efficiency Act of 1994 permits\na BHC to acquire banks located in states\nother than its home state without regard\nto state law, subject to certain\nconditions, including the condition that\nthe BHC, after and as a result of the\nacquisition, controls no more than 10\npercent of the total amount of deposits\nof insured depository institutions in\nthe U.S. and no more than 30 percent or\nsuch lesser or greater amount set by\nstate law of such deposits in that\nstate. At June 30, 2021, we held greater\nthan 10 percent of the total amount of\ndeposits of insured depository\ninstitutions in the U.S.\n\nIn addition, the Financial Reform Act\nrestricts acquisitions by a financial\ninstitution if, as a result of the\nacquisition, the total liabilities of\nthe financial institution would exceed\n10 percent of the total liabilities of\nall financial institutions in the U.S.\nAt June 30, 2021, our liabilities did\nnot exceed 10 percent of the total\nliabilities of all financial\ninstitutions in the U.S.\n                                                                                  \n  The Volcker Rule                                                                \n                                                                                  \nThe Volcker Rule prohibits insured\ndepository institutions and companies\naffiliated with insured depository\ninstitutions (collectively, banking\nentities) from engaging in short-term\nproprietary trading of certain\nsecurities, derivatives, commodity\nfutures and options for their own\naccount. The Volcker Rule also imposes\nlimits on banking entities\u2019 investments\nin, and other relationships with, hedge\nfunds and private equity funds. The\nVolcker Rule provides exemptions for\ncertain activities, including market\nmaking, underwriting, hedging, trading\nin government obligations, insurance\ncompany activities and organizing and\noffering hedge funds and private equity\nfunds. The Volcker Rule also clarifies\nthat certain activities are not\nprohibited, including acting as agent,\nbroker or custodian. A banking entity\nwith significant trading operations,\nsuch as the Corporation, is required to\nmaintain a detailed compliance program\nto comply with the restrictions of the\nVolcker Rule.\n                                                                                  \n  Derivatives                                                                     \n                                                                                  \nOur derivatives operations are subject\nto extensive regulation globally. These\noperations are subject to regulation\nunder the Financial Reform Act, the\nEuropean Union (EU) Markets in Financial\nInstruments Directive and Regulation,\nthe European Market Infrastructure\nRegulation, analogous U.K. regulatory\nregimes and similar regulatory regimes\nin other jurisdictions that regulate or\nwill regulate the derivatives markets in\nwhich we\n\noperate by, among other things:\nrequiring clearing and exchange trading\nof certain derivatives; enforcing\nexisting or imposing new capital,\nmargin, reporting, registration and\nbusiness conduct requirements for\ncertain market participants; imposing\nposition limits on certain over-the-\ncounter (OTC) derivatives; and imposing\nderivatives trading transparency\nrequirements. These regulations are\nalready in effect in many markets in\nwhich we operate.\n\nIn addition, many G-20 jurisdictions,\nincluding the U.S., U.K., and Japan,\nhave adopted resolution stay regulations\nto address concerns that the close-out\nof derivatives and other financial\ncontracts in resolution could impede\norderly resolution of G-SIBs, and\nadditional jurisdictions are expected to\nfollow suit. In addition, the EU has\nimplemented EU-wide resolution stay\nrequirements. Generally, these\nresolution stay regulations require\namendment of certain financial contracts\nto provide for contractual recognition\nof stays of termination rights under\nvarious statutory resolution regimes and\na stay on the exercise of cross-default\nrights based on an affiliate\u2019s entry\ninto insolvency proceedings. As\nresolution stay regulations of a\nparticular jurisdiction applicable to us\ngo into effect, we amend impacted\nfinancial contracts in compliance with\nsuch regulations either as a regulated\nentity or as a counterparty facing a\nregulated entity in such jurisdiction.\n                                                                                  \n  Consumer Regulations                                                            \n                                                                                  \nOur consumer businesses are subject to\nextensive regulation and oversight by\nfederal and state regulators.

The Gramm-\nLeach-Bliley Act requires us to\nperiodically disclose Bank of America\u2019s\nprivacy policies and practices relating\nto sharing such information and enables\nretail customers to opt out of our\nability to share information with\nunaffiliated third parties, under\ncertain circumstances. The Gramm-Leach-\nBliley Act and other laws also require\nus to implement a comprehensive\ninformation security program that\nincludes administrative, technical and\nphysical safeguards to provide the\nsecurity and confidentiality of customer\nrecords and information. Security and\nprivacy policies and procedures for the\nprotection of personal and confidential\ninformation are in effect across all\nbusinesses and geographic locations.\n\nOther laws and regulations, at the\ninternational, federal and state level,\nimpact our ability to share certain\ninformation with affiliates and non-\naffiliates for marketing and/or non-\nmarketing purposes, or contact customers\nwith marketing offers and establish\ncertain rights of consumers in\nconnection with their personal\ninformation. For example, California\u2019s\nConsumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which went\ninto effect in January 2020, as modified\nby the California Privacy Rights Act\n(CPRA), provides consumers with the\nright to know what personal data is\nbeing collected, know whether their\npersonal data is sold or disclosed and\nto whom and opt out of the sale of their\npersonal data,\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America6                                                                \n                                                                                  \namong other rights.

material risk\nfactors set forth below.\n\nCoronavirus Disease The impacts of the\npandemic have adversely affected, and\nmay continue to adversely affect us, and\nthe pandemic\u2019s duration and future\nimpacts remain uncertain.\n\nSince the onset of the pandemic, the\nnegative economic conditions and\ndisruptions arising from it have\nadversely impacted our financial results\nto varying degrees and in various\nrespects, including as a result of\nperiods of increased allowance for\ncredit losses followed by subsequent\ndeclines, and continued elevated\nnoninterest expense. The pandemic\u2019s\nimpact on economic conditions and\nactivity remains uncertain and will\ncontinue to evolve by region, country\nand state, and it is possible that new\nor evolving variants of COVID-19 could\nresult in increased business disruptions\nand contribute to a potential economic\ndownturn. In recent months, the U.S. and\nother regions of the world have\nexperienced supply chain disruptions and\nlabor shortages, and the global economy\nand supply chains remain vulnerable.\nPandemic developments and certain\nresponses have also resulted in\ninflationary pressure and ultimately may\ncontribute to the development of a\nprolonged, disruptive period of high\ninflation in the U.S. and globally.\n\nThe economic impact of the pandemic may\ncontinue to adversely affect certain of\nour businesses and our results of\noperations, including decreased demand\nfor and use of our products and\nservices; lower fees, including asset\nmanagement fees; lower sales and trading\nrevenue due to decreased market\nliquidity resulting from heightened\nvolatility; higher levels of\nuncollectible reversed charges in our\nmerchant services business; increased\nnoninterest expense, including\noperational losses; and increased credit\nlosses due to a deterioration in the\nfinancial condition of our consumer and\ncommercial borrowers, which could result\nin their inability to fulfill\ncontractual obligations, may vary by\nregion, sector or industry and could be\nexacerbated by the expiration of\ngovernment assistance. Additionally, our\nliquidity and/or regulatory capital\ncould be adversely impacted by\ncustomers\u2019 withdrawal of deposits,\ninability to repay loans and reduced\nusage of banking products, volatility\nand disruptions in the capital and\ncredit markets, changes in the value of\nsecurities, derivatives and other\nfinancial instruments resulting in\nincreased margin requirements,\nvolatility in foreign exchange rates and\ncustomer draws on lines of credit.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions could\nalso result in potential downgrades to\nour credit ratings, negative impacts to\nregulatory capital and liquidity and\nreinstated restrictions on dividends\nand/or common stock repurchases.\n\nWe continue to execute business\ncontinuity plans in connection with the\npandemic. If we become unable to operate\n\nour businesses from remote locations\nincluding, for example, because of an\ninternal or external failure of our\ninformation technology infrastructure,\nwe experience increased rates of\nemployee illness or unavailability, or\ngovernmental restrictions are placed on\nour employees or operations, our\nbusiness continuity plans could be\nadversely affected and result in\ndisruption to our businesses.\nAdditionally, we continue to rely on\nthird parties who could experience\nbusiness interruptions as a result of\nthe pandemic, which could increase our\nrisks and adversely impact our\nbusinesses.\n\nIn connection with the pandemic, various\ngovernmental fiscal and monetary relief\nprograms were implemented in an effort\nto stimulate the global economy and\navert negative economic or market\nconditions. Our participation in such\nprograms could result in reputational\nharm and government actions and\nproceedings, and has resulted in, and\nmay continue to result in, litigation,\nincluding class actions. Such actions\nmay result in judgments, orders,\nsettlements, penalties, and fines. Our\nparticipation in such programs has also\nresulted and will continue to result in\nlosses, including from the Paycheck\nProtection Program (PPP) and the\nprocessing of unemployment benefits for\nCalifornia and certain other states.\n\nWe continue to closely monitor the\npandemic and related risks as they\nevolve globally and in the U.S. The\nmagnitude and duration of the pandemic\nand its future direct and indirect\neffects on global health, the global\neconomy and our businesses, results of\noperations and financial condition are\nuncertain and depend on future\ndevelopments that cannot be predicted,\nincluding the likelihood of future\nsurges of COVID-19 cases and the spread\nof more easily communicable and/or\ndangerous variants of COVID-19, the\navailability, usage and acceptance of\neffective medical treatments and\nvaccines (including additional doses of\nvaccines) in the U.S. and globally and\nfuture public response and government\nactions, including travel bans and\nrestrictions, limitations on business\nactivity, vaccine mandates and\nadditional stimulus legislation. The\npandemic may cause setbacks to the\nglobal or national economic recovery or\nlonger lasting effects on economic\nconditions than are currently\nanticipated, changes in financial\nmarkets, changes in fiscal, monetary and\ntax regulatory environments, and changes\nin client preferences and behavior,\nwhich could have a material adverse\neffect on our businesses, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nMarket\nOur business and results of operations\nmay be adversely affected by the\nfinancial markets, fiscal, monetary, and\nregulatory policies, and economic\nconditions generally.\n\nGeneral economic, political, social and\nhealth conditions in the U.S. and in one\nor more countries abroad affect markets\nin the U.S. and abroad and our business.\nIn particular, markets in the U.S. or\nabroad may be affected by the level and\nvolatility of interest rates,\navailability and market conditions of\nfinancing, unexpected changes in gross\ndomestic product (GDP), economic growth\nor its sustainability, inflation, supply\nchain disruptions, consumer spending,\nemployment levels, labor shortages, wage\nstagnation, federal government\nshutdowns, developments related to the\nU.S. federal debt ceiling, energy\nprices, home prices, commercial property\nvalues, bankruptcies, a default by a\nsignificant market participant or class\nof counterparties, fluctuations or other\nsignificant changes in both debt and\nequity capital markets and currencies,\nliquidity of the global financial\nmarkets, the growth of global trade and\ncommerce, trade policies, the\navailability and cost of capital and\ncredit, disruption of communication,\ntransportation or energy infrastructure\nand\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America8                                                                \n                                                                                  \ninvestor sentiment and confidence.\nAdditionally, global markets, including\nenergy and commodity markets, may be\nadversely affected by the current or\nanticipated impact of climate change,\nextreme weather events or natural\ndisasters, the emergence or continuation\nof widespread health emergencies or\npandemics, cyberattacks or campaigns,\nmilitary conflict, including escalating\nmilitary tension between Russia and\nUkraine, terrorism or other geopolitical\nevents. Market fluctuations may impact\nour margin requirements and affect our\nbusiness liquidity. Also, any sudden or\nprolonged market downturn in the U.S. or\nabroad, as a result of the above factors\nor otherwise, could result in a decline\nin net interest income and noninterest\nincome and adversely affect our results\nof operations and financial condition,\nincluding capital and liquidity levels.\nFor example, global developments in\nconnection with the ongoing pandemic,\nincluding supply chain disruptions, high\ninflation, changes to industries such as\ncommercial real estate, the emergence of\nnew variants and significant\nrestrictions on households and\nbusinesses in certain countries, have\nadversely impacted and may continue to\nadversely impact financial markets and\nmacroeconomic conditions and could\nresult in additional market volatility\nand disruptions globally.\n\nActions taken by the Federal Reserve,\nincluding changes in its target funds\nrate, balance sheet management, and\nlending facilities, and other central\nbanks are beyond our control and\ndifficult to predict. These actions can\naffect interest rates and the value of\nfinancial instruments and other assets\nand liabilities and can impact our\nborrowers. Sudden changes in monetary\npolicy, for example in response to high\ninflation, could lead to financial\nmarket volatility, increases in market\ninterest rates, and a flattening or\ninversion of the yield curve. The\ncontinued protracted period of lower\ninterest rates has resulted in lower\nrevenue through lower net interest\nincome, which has adversely affected our\nresults of operations. Continued low\nU.S. interest rates, potentially\nresulting from a further extended period\nof accommodative monetary policy and/or\nan economic downturn could have a\nfurther adverse impact on us, including\nour net interest income and results of\noperations.\n\nChanges to existing U.S. laws and\nregulatory policies and evolving\npriorities, including those related to\nfinancial regulation, taxation,\ninternational trade, fiscal policy,\nclimate change (including required\nreduction of greenhouse gas emissions)\nand healthcare, may adversely impact\nU.S. or global economic activity and our\ncustomers', our counterparties' and our\nearnings and operations. For example,\nthe expiration of pandemic-related\ngovernment assistance in the U.S. could\nresult in a reduction in economic\nactivity and lead to a deterioration in\nhouseholds\u2019 finances, particularly if\nconsumers also continue to face high\ninflation. A slowdown in consumer demand\ncould limit the ability of firms to pass\non fast-rising costs for labor and other\ninputs, weighing on earnings and\npotentially leading to an equity market\ndownturn. Significant fiscal policy\nchanges and/or initiatives may also\nraise the federal debt, affect\nbusinesses and household after-tax\nincomes and increase uncertainty\nsurrounding the formulation and\ndirection of U.S. monetary policy and\nvolatility of interest rates. A rise in\nU.S. interest rates could increase the\nlikelihood of a more volatile and\nappreciating U.S. dollar. Changes, or\nproposed changes, to certain U.S. trade\nand international investment policies,\nparticularly with important trading\npartners (including China and the EU)\nhave in recent years negatively impacted\nfinancial markets. An escalation of\ntensions could lead to further measures\nthat adversely affect financial markets,\ndisrupt world trade and commerce and\nlead to trade retaliation, including\nthrough the use of tariffs, foreign\nexchange measures\n\nor the large-scale sale of U.S. Treasury\nBonds. Actions taken by other countries,\nparticularly China, to restrict the\nactivities of businesses, could also\nnegatively affect financial markets.\n\nAny of these developments could\nadversely affect our consumer and\ncommercial businesses, our customers,\nour securities and derivatives\nportfolios, including the risk of lower\nre-investment rates within those\nportfolios, our level of charge-offs and\nprovision for credit losses, the\ncarrying value of our deferred tax\nassets, our capital levels, our\nliquidity and our results of operations.\nAdditionally, the transition from IBORs\nand other benchmark rates to alternative\nreference rates (ARRs) could negatively\nimpact markets globally and our\nbusiness, and/or magnify any negative\nimpact of the above referenced factors\non our business, customers and results\nof operations.\n\nIncreased market volatility and adverse\nchanges in financial or capital market\nconditions may increase our market risk.\n\nOur liquidity, competitive position,\nbusiness, results of operations and\nfinancial condition are affected by\nmarket risks such as changes in interest\nand currency exchange rates,\nfluctuations (significant or otherwise)\nin equity and futures prices, lower\ntrading volumes and prices of\nsecuritized products, the implied\nvolatility of interest rates and credit\nspreads and other economic and business\nfactors. These market risks may\nadversely affect, among other things,\nthe value of our securities, trading\nassets and other financial instruments,\nthe cost of debt capital and our access\nto credit markets, the value of assets\nunder management (AUM), fee income\nrelating to AUM, customer allocation of\ncapital among investment alternatives,\nthe volume of client activity in our\ntrading operations, investment banking\nfees, the general profitability and risk\nlevel of the transactions in which we\nengage and our competitiveness with\nrespect to deposit pricing. For example,\nthe value of certain of our assets is\nsensitive to changes in market interest\nrates. If the Federal Reserve or a\nnon-U.S. central bank changes or signals\na change in monetary policy, market\ninterest rates or credit spreads could\nbe affected, which could adversely\nimpact the value of such assets. Changes\nto fiscal policy, including expansion of\nU.S. federal deficit spending and\nresultant debt issuance, could also\naffect market interest rates. In\naddition, although some interest rates\nhave begun to rise and elevated\ninflation could lead to further\nincreases, the continued low interest\nrate environment has had and could\ncontinue to have a negative impact on\nour results of operations, including on\nfuture revenue and earnings growth. A\nflattening or inversion of the yield\ncurve could also negatively impact our\nresults of operations, including revenue\nand earnings.\n\nWe use various models and strategies to\nassess and control our market risk\nexposures, but those are subject to\ninherent limitations. In times of market\nstress or other unforeseen\ncircumstances, previously uncorrelated\nindicators may become correlated and\nvice versa. These types of market\nmovements may limit the effectiveness of\nour hedging strategies and cause us to\nincur significant losses. These changes\nin correlation can be exacerbated where\nother market participants are using risk\nor trading models with assumptions or\nalgorithms similar to ours. In these and\nother cases, it may be difficult to\nreduce our risk positions due to\nactivity of other market participants or\nwidespread market dislocations,\nincluding circumstances where asset\nvalues are declining significantly or no\nmarket exists for certain assets. To the\nextent that we own securities that do\nnot have an established liquid trading\nmarket or are otherwise subject to\nrestrictions on sale or hedging, we may\nnot be able to reduce our positions and\ntherefore reduce our risk associated\nwith such positions.\n                                                                                  \n  9Bank of America                                                                \n                                                                                  \nWe may incur losses if asset values\ndecline, including due to changes in\ninterest rates and prepayment speeds.\n\nWe have a large portfolio of financial\ninstruments, including loans and loan\ncommitments, securities financing\nagreements, asset-backed secured\nfinancings, derivative assets and\nliabilities, debt securities, marketable\nequity securities and certain other\nassets and liabilities that we measure\nat fair value that are subject to\nvaluation and impairment assessments. We\ndetermine these values based on\napplicable accounting guidance, which,\nfor financial instruments measured at\nfair value, requires an entity to base\nfair value on exit price and to maximize\nthe use of observable inputs and\nminimize the use of unobservable inputs\nin fair value measurements. The fair\nvalues of these financial instruments\ninclude adjustments for market\nliquidity, credit quality, funding\nimpact on certain derivatives and other\ntransaction-specific factors, where\nappropriate.\n\nGains or losses on these instruments can\nhave a direct impact on our results of\noperations, unless we have effectively\nhedged our exposures. Increases in\ninterest rates may result in a decrease\nin residential mortgage loan\noriginations and could impact the\norigination of corporate debt. In\naddition, increases in interest rates or\nchanges in spreads may adversely impact\nthe fair value of debt securities and,\naccordingly, for debt securities\nclassified as available for sale, may\nadversely affect accumulated other\ncomprehensive income and, thus, capital\nlevels. These market moves also may\nadversely impact the value of debt\nsecurities we hold to meet regulatory\nliquidity requirements. Decreases in\ninterest rates may increase prepayment\nspeeds of certain assets, and,\ntherefore, may adversely affect net\ninterest income.\n\nFair values may be impacted by declining\nvalues of the underlying assets or the\nprices at which observable market\ntransactions occur and the continued\navailability of these transactions or\nindices. The financial strength of\ncounterparties, with whom we have\neconomically hedged some of our exposure\nto these assets, also will affect the\nfair value of these assets. Sudden\ndeclines and volatility in the prices of\nassets may curtail or eliminate trading\nactivities in these assets, which may\nmake it difficult to sell, hedge or\nvalue these assets. The inability to\nsell or effectively hedge assets reduces\nour ability to limit losses in such\npositions, and the difficulty in valuing\nassets may increase our risk-weighted\nassets (RWA), which requires us to\nmaintain additional capital and\nincreases our funding costs. Values of\nAUM also impact revenues in our wealth\nmanagement and related advisory\nbusinesses for asset-based management\nand performance fees. Declines in values\nof AUM can result in lower fees earned\nfor managing such assets.\n                                                                                  \n   Liquidity                                                                      \n                                                                                  \nIf we are unable to access the capital\nmarkets or continue to maintain\ndeposits, or our borrowing costs\nincrease, our liquidity and competitive\nposition will be negatively affected.\n\nLiquidity is essential to our\nbusinesses. We fund our assets primarily\nwith globally sourced deposits in our\nbank entities, as well as secured and\nunsecured liabilities transacted in the\ncapital markets. We rely on certain\nsecured funding sources, such as repo\nmarkets, which are typically short-term\nand credit-sensitive. We also engage in\nasset securitization transactions,\nincluding with the GSEs, to fund\nconsumer lending activities. Our\nliquidity could be adversely affected by\nany inability to access the capital\nmarkets, illiquidity or volatility in\nthe capital markets, the decrease in\nvalue of eligible collateral or\nincreased collateral requirements\n(including as a result of credit\nconcerns for short-term borrowing),\nchanges to our relationships with our\nfunding providers based on real or\nperceived changes in our risk\n\nprofile, prolonged federal government\nshutdowns, or changes in regulations,\nguidance or GSE status that impact our\nfunding avenues or ability to access\ncertain funding sources. Additionally,\nour liquidity may be negatively impacted\nby the unwillingness or inability of the\nFederal Reserve to act as lender of last\nresort, unexpected simultaneous draws on\nlines of credit, slower customer payment\nrates, restricted access to the assets\nof prime brokerage clients, the\nwithdrawal of or failure to attract\ncustomer deposits or invested funds\n(which could result from customer\nattrition for higher yields, the desire\nfor more conservative alternatives,\nchanges in customer behavior or our\ncustomers\u2019 increased need for cash),\nincreased regulatory liquidity, capital\nand margin requirements for our U.S. or\ninternational banks and their nonbank\nsubsidiaries, which could result in the\ninability to transfer liquidity\ninternally and inefficient funding,\nchanges in patterns of intraday\nliquidity usage resulting from a\ncounterparty or technology failure or\nother idiosyncratic event or failure or\ndefault by a significant market\nparticipant or third party (including\nclearing agents, custodians, central\nbanks or central counterparties (CCPs)).\nThese factors also have the potential to\nincrease our borrowing costs and\nnegatively impact our liquidity.\n\nSeveral of these factors may arise due\nto circumstances beyond our control,\nsuch as general market volatility,\ndisruption, shock or stress, the\nemergence or continuation of widespread\nhealth emergencies or pandemics, Federal\nReserve policy decisions (including\nfluctuations in interest rates or\nFederal Reserve balance sheet\ncomposition), negative views or loss of\nconfidence about the Corporation\n(including short- and long-term business\nprospects) or the financial services\nindustry generally or due to a specific\nnews event, changes in the regulatory\nenvironment or governmental fiscal or\nmonetary policies, actions by credit\nrating agencies or an operational\nproblem that affects third parties or\nus. The impact of these events, whether\nwithin our control or not, could include\nan inability to sell assets or redeem\ninvestments, unforeseen outflows of\ncash, the need to draw on liquidity\nfacilities, the reduction of financing\nbalances and the loss of equity secured\nfunding, debt repurchases to support the\nsecondary market or meet client\nrequests, the need for additional\nfunding for commitments and\ncontingencies and unexpected collateral\ncalls, among other things, the result of\nwhich could be increased costs, a\nliquidity shortfall and/or impact on our\nliquidity coverage ratio.\n\nOur liquidity and cost of obtaining\nfunding is directly related to\nprevailing market conditions, including\nchanges in interest and currency\nexchange rates, significant fluctuations\nin equity and futures prices, lower\ntrading volumes and prices of\nsecuritized products and our credit\nspreads. Credit spreads reflect the\npublished credit ratings, or other\nassessments of credit risk and relative\nvalue by market participants, of the\nCorporation and represent the risk\npremiums that our funding providers\ndemand in excess of a benchmark interest\nrate, for example, U.S. Treasury\nsecurities rates. Increases in interest\nrates and our credit spreads can\nincrease the cost of our funding and\nresult in mark-to-market or credit\nvaluation adjustment exposures. Changes\nin our credit spreads are market-driven\nand may be influenced by market\nperceptions of our creditworthiness,\nincluding changes in our credit ratings.\nChanges to interest rates and our credit\nspreads occur continuously and may be\nunpredictable and highly volatile. We\nmay also experience spread compression\nas a result of offering higher than\nexpected deposit rates in order to\nattract and maintain deposits due to\nincreased marketplace rate competition.\nAdditionally, concentrations within our\nfunding\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America10                                                               \n                                                                                  \nprofile, such as maturities, currencies\nor counterparties, can reduce our\nfunding efficiency.\n\nReduction in our credit ratings could\nsignificantly limit our access to\nfunding or the capital markets, increase\nborrowing costs or trigger additional\ncollateral or funding requirements.\n\nOur borrowing costs and ability to raise\nfunds are directly impacted by our\ncredit ratings. In addition, credit\nratings may be important to customers or\ncounterparties when we compete in\ncertain markets and seek to engage in\ncertain transactions, including OTC\nderivatives. Credit ratings and outlooks\nare opinions expressed by rating\nagencies on our creditworthiness and\nthat of our obligations or securities,\nincluding long-term debt, short-term\nborrowings, preferred stock and asset\nsecuritizations. Our credit ratings are\nsubject to ongoing review by rating\nagencies, which consider a number of\nfactors, including our financial\nstrength, performance, prospects and\noperations and factors not under our\ncontrol, such as the macroeconomic and\ngeopolitical environment, including any\ncontinued macroeconomic stress caused by\nthe pandemic, or changes the rating\nagencies may make to the methodologies\nthey use to determine our ratings.\n\nRating agencies could make adjustments\nto our credit ratings at any time, and\nthere can be no assurance as to whether\nor when any downgrades could occur. A\nreduction in certain of our credit\nratings could result in a wider credit\nspread and negatively affect our\nliquidity, access to credit markets, the\nrelated cost of funds, our businesses\nand certain trading revenues,\nparticularly in those businesses where\ncounterparty creditworthiness is\ncritical. If the short-term credit\nratings of our parent company, or bank\nor broker-dealer subsidiaries, were\ndowngraded by one or more levels, we may\nexperience loss of access to short-term\nfunding sources such as repo financing,\nand/or incur increased cost of funds and\nincreased collateral requirements. Under\nthe terms of certain OTC derivative\ncontracts and other trading agreements,\nif our or our subsidiaries\u2019 credit\nratings are downgraded, the\ncounterparties may require additional\ncollateral or terminate these contracts\nor agreements.\n\nWhile certain potential impacts are\ncontractual and quantifiable, the full\nconsequences of a credit rating\ndowngrade to a financial institution are\ninherently uncertain, as they depend\nupon numerous dynamic, complex and\ninter-related factors and assumptions,\nincluding whether any downgrade of a\nfirm\u2019s long-term credit ratings\nprecipitates downgrades to its short-\nterm credit ratings, and assumptions\nabout the potential behaviors of various\ncustomers, investors and counterparties.\n\nBank of America Corporation is a holding\ncompany, is dependent on its\nsubsidiaries for liquidity and may be\nrestricted from transferring funds from\nsubsidiaries.\n\nBank of America Corporation, as the\nparent company, is a separate and\ndistinct legal entity from our bank and\nnonbank subsidiaries. We evaluate and\nmanage liquidity on a legal entity\nbasis. Legal entity liquidity is an\nimportant consideration as there are\nlegal, regulatory, contractual and other\nlimitations on our ability to utilize\nliquidity from one legal entity to\nsatisfy the liquidity requirements of\nanother, including the parent company,\nwhich could result in adverse liquidity\nevents. The parent company depends on\ndividends, distributions, loans and\nother payments from our bank and nonbank\nsubsidiaries to fund dividend payments\non our common stock and preferred stock\nand to fund all payments on our other\nobligations, including debt obligations.\nAny inability of our subsidiaries to pay\ndividends or make payments to us may\nadversely affect our cash flow and\nfinancial condition.\n\nMany of our subsidiaries, including our\nbank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are\nsubject to laws that restrict dividend\npayments, or authorize regulatory bodies\nto block or reduce the flow of funds\nfrom those subsidiaries to the parent\ncompany or other subsidiaries. Our bank\nand broker-dealer subsidiaries are\nsubject to restrictions on their ability\nto lend or transact with affiliates,\nminimum regulatory capital and liquidity\nrequirements and restrictions on their\nability to use funds deposited with them\nin bank or brokerage accounts to fund\ntheir businesses. Intercompany\narrangements we entered into in\nconnection with our resolution planning\nsubmissions could restrict the amount of\nfunding available to the parent company\nfrom our subsidiaries under certain\nadverse conditions.\n\nAdditional restrictions on related party\ntransactions, increased capital and\nliquidity requirements and additional\nlimitations on the use of funds on\ndeposit in bank or brokerage accounts,\nas well as lower earnings, can reduce\nthe amount of funds available to meet\nthe obligations of the parent company\nand even require the parent company to\nprovide additional funding to such\nsubsidiaries. Also, regulatory action\nthat requires additional liquidity at\neach of our subsidiaries could impede\naccess to funds we need to pay our\nobligations or pay dividends. In\naddition, our right to participate in a\ndistribution of assets upon a\nsubsidiary\u2019s liquidation or\nreorganization is subject to prior\nclaims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors.\n\nOur liquidity and financial condition,\nand the ability to pay dividends to\nshareholders and to pay obligations\ncould be materially adversely affected\nin the event of a resolution.\n\nBank of America Corporation, our parent\nholding company, is required to\nperiodically submit a plan to the FDIC\nand Federal Reserve describing its\nresolution strategy under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code in the event of material\nfinancial distress or failure. In the\ncurrent plan, Bank of America\nCorporation\u2019s preferred resolution\nstrategy is a \u201csingle point of entry\u201d\nstrategy. This strategy provides that\nonly the parent holding company would\nfile for bankruptcy under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code and contemplates\nproviding certain key operating\nsubsidiaries with sufficient capital and\nliquidity to operate through severe\nstress and to enable such subsidiaries\nto continue operating or be wound down\nin a solvent manner following a\nbankruptcy of the parent holding\ncompany. Bank of America Corporation has\nentered into intercompany arrangements\nresulting in the contribution of most of\nits capital and liquidity to key\nsubsidiaries. Pursuant to these\narrangements, if Bank of America\nCorporation\u2019s liquidity resources\ndeteriorate so severely that resolution\nbecomes imminent, Bank of America\nCorporation will no longer be able to\ndraw liquidity from its key\nsubsidiaries, and will be required to\ncontribute its remaining financial\nassets to a wholly-owned holding company\nsubsidiary, which could materially and\nadversely affect our liquidity and\nfinancial condition and the ability to\nreturn capital to shareholders,\nincluding through the payment of\ndividends and repurchase of the\nCorporation\u2019s common stock, and meet our\npayment obligations.\n\nIf the FDIC and Federal Reserve jointly\ndetermine that Bank of America\nCorporation\u2019s resolution plan is not\ncredible, they could impose more\nstringent capital, leverage or liquidity\nrequirements or restrictions on our\ngrowth, activities or operations. We\ncould also be required to take certain\nactions that could impose operating\ncosts and could potentially result in\nthe divestiture of certain assets or\nrestructuring of businesses and\nsubsidiaries.\n\nAdditionally, under the Financial Reform\nAct, when a G-SIB such as Bank of\nAmerica Corporation is in default or\ndanger of default, the FDIC may be\nappointed receiver in order to conduct\n                                                                                  \n  11Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nan orderly liquidation of such\ninstitution. In the event of such\nappointment, the FDIC could, among other\nthings, invoke the orderly liquidation\nauthority, instead of the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code, if the Secretary of the\nTreasury makes certain financial\ndistress and systemic risk\ndeterminations. In 2013, the FDIC issued\na notice describing its preferred\n\u201csingle point of entry\u201d strategy for\nresolving a G-SIB. Under this approach,\nthe FDIC could replace Bank of America\nCorporation with a bridge holding\ncompany, which could continue operations\nand result in an orderly resolution of\nthe underlying bank, but whose equity\nwould be held solely for the benefit of\nour creditors. The FDIC\u2019s \u201csingle point\nof entry\u201d strategy may result in our\nsecurity holders suffering greater\nlosses than would have been the case\nunder a bankruptcy proceeding or a\ndifferent resolution strategy.\n\nTo the extent that the Corporation is\nresolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code\nor the FDIC\u2019s orderly liquidation\nauthority, third-party creditors of the\nCorporation\u2019s subsidiaries may receive\nsignificant or full recoveries on their\nclaims while security holders of Bank of\nAmerica Corporation could face\nsignificant or complete losses.\n\nCredit\n\nEconomic or market disruptions and\ninsufficient credit loss reserves may\nresult in a higher provision for credit\nlosses.\n\nA number of our products expose us to\ncredit risk, including loans, letters of\ncredit, derivatives, debt securities,\ntrading account assets and assets held-\nfor-sale. Deterioration in the financial\ncondition of our consumer and commercial\nborrowers, counterparties or underlying\ncollateral could adversely affect our\nfinancial condition and results of\noperations.\n\nOur credit portfolios may be impacted by\nglobal and U.S. macroeconomic and market\nconditions, events and disruptions,\nincluding declines in GDP, consumer\nspending or property values, asset price\ncorrections, increasing consumer and\ncorporate leverage, increases in\ncorporate bond spreads, rising or\nelevated unemployment levels, rising or\nelevated inflation, fluctuations in\nforeign exchange or interest rates, as\nwell as widespread health emergencies or\npandemics, extreme weather events and\nthe impacts of climate change and\ndomestic and global efforts to\ntransition to a low-carbon economy.\nSignificant economic or market stresses\nand disruptions typically have a\nnegative impact on the business\nenvironment and financial markets, which\ncould impact the underlying credit\nquality of our borrowers, counterparties\nand assets. Property value declines or\nasset price corrections could increase\nthe risk of borrowers or counterparties\ndefaulting or becoming delinquent in\ntheir obligations to us, and could\ndecrease the value of the collateral we\nhold, which could increase credit\nlosses. Credit risk could also be\nmagnified by lending to leveraged\nborrowers or declining asset prices,\nincluding property or collateral values,\nunrelated to macroeconomic stress.\nSimultaneous drawdowns on lines of\ncredit and/or an increase in a\nborrower\u2019s leverage in a weakening\neconomic environment could result in\ndeterioration in our credit portfolio,\nshould borrowers be unable to fulfill\ncompeting financial obligations.\nIncreased delinquency and default rates\ncould adversely affect our credit\nportfolios, including consumer credit\ncard, home equity and residential\nmortgage portfolios through increased\ncharge-offs and provisions for credit\nlosses.\n\nAlthough macroeconomic conditions have\nimproved during 2021 in comparison to\n2020, the pandemic and the related\nimpacts of inflationary conditions, high\ninput costs and supply chain\ndisruptions, unemployment or labor\nshortages and the expiration of\npandemic-related government benefits and\nprograms could negatively impact the\nability of consumer and\n\ncommercial borrowers or counterparties\nto meet their financial obligations.\nAdditionally, the pandemic continues to\nimpact the economy and certain sectors\nremain at risk (e.g., travel and\nentertainment, as well as commercial\nreal estate office exposure). To the\nextent the pandemic worsens, as a result\nof new variants or otherwise, resulting\nin restrictions on economic activity or\nother negative impacts on the\nmacroeconomic environment, our credit\nportfolio and allowance for credit\nlosses could be adversely impacted.\n\nWe establish an allowance for credit\nlosses, which includes the allowance for\nloan and lease losses and the reserve\nfor unfunded lending commitments, based\non management's best estimate of\nlifetime expected credit losses inherent\nin our relevant financial assets. The\nprocess to determine the allowance for\ncredit losses uses models and\nassumptions that require us to make\ndifficult and complex judgments that are\noften interrelated. This includes\nforecasting how borrowers or\ncounterparties will perform in changing\nand unprecedented economic conditions,\nsuch as predicting developments in\npublic health and fiscal policy related\nto the pandemic. The ability of our\nborrowers or counterparties to repay\ntheir obligations will likely be\nimpacted by changes in future economic\nconditions, which in turn could impact\nthe accuracy of our loss forecasts and\nallowance estimates. There is also the\npossibility that we have failed or will\nfail to accurately identify the\nappropriate economic indicators or\naccurately estimate their impacts to our\nborrowers or counterparties, which\nsimilarly could impact the accuracy of\nour loss forecasts and allowance\nestimates.\n\nIf the models, estimates and assumptions\nwe use to establish reserves or the\njudgments we make in extending credit to\nour borrowers or counterparties, which\nare more sensitive due to the current\nmacroeconomic environment, including as\na result of the uncertainty regarding\nthe magnitude and duration of the\npandemic, prove inaccurate in predicting\nfuture events, we may suffer unexpected\nlosses. In addition, changes to external\nfactors can negatively impact our\nrecognition of credit losses in our\nportfolios and allowance for credit\nlosses.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses is our\nbest estimate of expected credit losses;\nhowever, there is no guarantee that it\nwill be sufficient to address credit\nlosses, particularly if the economic\noutlook deteriorates significantly and\nquickly. In such an event, we may\nincrease our allowance which would\nreduce our earnings. Additionally, to\nthe extent that economic conditions\nworsen as a result of COVID-19 or\notherwise, impacting our consumer and\ncommercial borrowers, counterparties or\nunderlying collateral, and credit losses\nare worse than expected, we may increase\nour provision for credit losses, which\ncould have an adverse effect on our\nresults of operations and could\nnegatively impact our financial\ncondition.\n\nOur concentrations of credit risk could\nadversely affect our credit losses,\nresults of operations and financial\ncondition.\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business,\nwe may be subject to concentrations of\ncredit risk because of a common\ncharacteristic or common sensitivity to\neconomic, financial, public health or\nbusiness developments. For example,\nconcentrations of credit risk may reside\nin a particular industry, geography,\nproduct, asset class, counterparty or\nwithin any pool of exposures with a\ncommon risk characteristic. A\ndeterioration in the financial condition\nor prospects of a particular industry,\ngeographic location, product or asset\nclass, or a failure or downgrade of, or\ndefault by, any particular entity or\ngroup of entities could negatively\naffect our businesses, and it is\npossible our limits and credit\nmonitoring exposure controls will not\nfunction as anticipated.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America12                                                               \n                                                                                  \nWhile our activities expose us to many\ndifferent industries and counterparties,\nwe routinely execute a high volume of\ntransactions with counterparties in the\nfinancial services industry,\npredominantly comprised of broker-\ndealers, commercial banks, investment\nbanks, insurers, mutual funds, hedge\nfunds, central clearing counterparties\nand other institutional clients,\nresulting in significant credit\nconcentration with respect to these\nindustries. Financial services\ninstitutions and other counterparties\nare inter-related because of trading,\nfunding, clearing or other\nrelationships. As a result, defaults by\none or more counterparties, or market\nuncertainty about the financial\nstability of one or more financial\nservices institutions, or the financial\nservices industry generally, could lead\nto market-wide liquidity disruptions,\nlosses and defaults.\n\nMany of these transactions expose us to\ncredit risk and, in some cases, disputes\nand litigation in the event of default\nof a counterparty. In addition, our\ncredit risk may be heightened by market\nrisk when the collateral held by us\ncannot be liquidated or is liquidated at\nprices not sufficient to recover the\nfull amount of the loan or derivatives\nexposure due to us, which may occur as a\nresult of events that impact the value\nof the collateral, such as an asset\nprice correction or fraud. Further,\ndisputes with obligors as to the\nvaluation of collateral could increase\nin times of significant market stress,\nvolatility or illiquidity, and we could\nsuffer losses during such periods if we\nare unable to realize the fair value of\nthe collateral or manage declines in the\nvalue of collateral.\n\nOur commercial portfolios include\nexposures to certain industries,\nincluding asset managers and funds, real\nestate, finance companies and capital\ngoods. Economic weaknesses, sustained\nelevated inflation, adverse business\nconditions, market disruptions, rising\ninterest or capitalization rates, the\ncollapse of speculative bubbles, greater\nvolatility in areas where we have\nconcentrated credit risk or\ndeterioration in real estate values or\nhousehold incomes may cause us to\nexperience a decrease in cash flow and\nhigher credit losses in either our\nconsumer or commercial portfolios or\ncause us to write down the value of\ncertain assets. Additionally, we could\nexperience continued and long-term\nnegative impacts to our commercial\ncredit exposure and an increase in\ncredit losses within those industries\nthat continue to be disproportionately\nimpacted by COVID-19 or are permanently\nimpacted by a change in consumer\npreferences resulting from COVID-19\n(e.g., travel and entertainment, as well\nas commercial real estate office\nexposure) or other industry disruptions.\n\nFurthermore, we have concentrations of\ncredit risk with respect to our consumer\nreal estate, auto, consumer credit card\nand commercial real estate portfolios,\nwhich represent a significant percentage\nof our overall credit portfolio. The\nU.S. has experienced a meaningful\nincrease in property prices over the\npast year and a decrease in home price\nvaluations or commercial real estate\nvaluations in certain markets where we\nhave large concentrations, as well as\nmore broadly within the U.S. or\nglobally, could result in increased\nservicing expenses, defaults,\ndelinquencies or credit losses. In\nparticular, the impact of climate\nchange, such as rising average global\ntemperatures and rising sea levels, and\nthe increasing frequency and severity of\nextreme weather events and natural\ndisasters such as droughts, floods,\nwildfires and hurricanes could\nnegatively impact collateral, the\nvaluations of home prices or commercial\nreal estate or our customers\u2019 ability\nand/or willingness to pay fees,\noutstanding loans or afford new\nproducts. This could also cause\ninsurability risk and/or increased\ninsurance costs to customers.\n\nWe also enter into transactions with\nsovereign nations, U.S. states and\nmunicipalities. Unfavorable economic or\npolitical conditions, disruptions to\ncapital markets, currency fluctuations,\nchanges in oil prices, social\ninstability and changes in government or\nmonetary policies could adversely impact\nthe operating budgets or credit ratings\nof these government entities and expose\nus to credit and liquidity risk.\n\nLiquidity disruptions in the financial\nmarkets may result in our inability to\nsell, syndicate or realize the value of\nour positions, leading to increased\nconcentrations, which could increase the\ncredit and market risk associated with\nour positions, as well as increase our\nRWA.\n\nWe may be adversely affected if the U.S.\nhousing market weakens or home prices\ndecline.\n\nAlthough the U.S. has experienced a\nmeaningful increase in home prices in\n2021, we remain conscious of geographic\nmarkets where housing price growth has\nincreased significantly that could be\nvulnerable to declines in future periods\nand may negatively impact the demand and\nunderlying collateral for many of our\nproducts. Additionally, our mortgage\nloan production volume is generally\ninfluenced by the rate of growth in\nresidential mortgage debt outstanding\nand the size of the residential mortgage\nmarket, both of which may be adversely\naffected by rising interest rates. Any\ndownturn in the condition of the U.S.\nhousing market, similar to the 2008\nfinancial crisis or otherwise, could\nresult in both significant write-downs\nof asset values in several asset\nclasses, notably mortgage-backed\nsecurities, and exposure to monolines.\nIf the U.S. housing market were to\nweaken, the value of real estate could\ndecline, which could result in increased\ncredit losses and delinquent servicing\nexpenses, negatively affect our\nrepresentations and warranties\nexposures, and adversely affect our\nfinancial condition and results of\noperations.\n\nOur derivatives businesses may expose us\nto unexpected risks and potential\nlosses.\n\nWe are party to a large number of\nderivatives transactions that may expose\nus to unexpected market, credit and\noperational risks that could cause us to\nsuffer unexpected losses. Severe\ndeclines in asset values, unanticipated\ncredit events or unforeseen\ncircumstances that may cause previously\nuncorrelated factors to become\ncorrelated and vice versa, may create\nlosses resulting from risks not\nappropriately taken into account or\nanticipated in the development,\nstructuring or pricing of a derivative\ninstrument. Certain OTC derivative\ncontracts and other trading agreements\nprovide that upon the occurrence of\ncertain specified events, such as a\nchange in the credit rating of the\nCorporation or one or more of its\naffiliates, we may be required to\nprovide additional collateral or take\nother remedial actions and could\nexperience increased difficulty\nobtaining funding or hedging risks. In\nsome cases our counterparties may have\nthe right to terminate or otherwise\ndiminish our rights under these\ncontracts or agreements.\n\nWe are also a member of various central\ncounterparties (CCPs), in part due to\nregulatory requirements for mandatory\nclearing of derivative transactions,\nwhich potentially increases our credit\nrisk exposures to CCPs. In the event\nthat one or more members of the CCP\ndefaults on its obligations, we may be\nrequired to pay a portion of any losses\nincurred by the CCP as a result of that\ndefault. A CCP may modify, in its\ndiscretion, the margin we are required\nto post, which could mean unexpected and\nincreased exposure to the CCP. As a\nclearing member, we are exposed to the\nrisk of non-performance by our clients\nfor which we clear transactions, which\nmay not be covered by\n                                                                                  \n  13Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \navailable collateral. Additionally,\ndefault by a significant market\nparticipant may result in further risk\nand potential losses.\n                                                                                  \n  Geopolitical                                                                    \n                                                                                  \nWe are subject to numerous political,\neconomic, market, reputational,\noperational, compliance, legal,\nregulatory and other risks in the\njurisdictions in which we operate.\n\nWe do business throughout the world,\nincluding in emerging markets. Economic\nor geopolitical stress in one or more\ncountries could have a negative impact\nregionally or globally, resulting in,\namong other things, market volatility,\nreduced market value and economic\noutput. Our liquidity and credit risk\ncould be adversely impacted by and our\nbusinesses and revenues derived from\nnon-U.S. jurisdictions are subject to\nrisk of loss from financial, social or\njudicial instability, changes in\ngovernment leadership, including as a\nresult of electoral outcomes or\notherwise, changes in governmental\npolicies or policies of central banks,\nexpropriation, nationalization and/or\nconfiscation of assets, price controls,\nhigh inflation, natural disasters, the\nemergence or continuation of widespread\nhealth emergencies or pandemics, capital\ncontrols, currency re-denomination risk\nfrom a country exiting the EU or\notherwise, currency fluctuations,\nforeign exchange controls or movements\n(caused by devaluation or de-pegging),\nunfavorable political and diplomatic\ndevelopments, oil price fluctuations and\nchanges in legislation. These risks are\nespecially elevated in emerging markets.\nAdditionally, continued tensions between\nthe U.S. and important trading partners,\nparticularly China, may result in\nsanctions, further tariff increases or\nother restrictive actions on cross-\nborder trade, investment, and transfer\nof information technology that weigh on\ntrade volumes, raise costs for\nproducers, and adversely affect our\nbusinesses and revenues, as well as our\ncustomers and counterparties.\n\nA number of non-U.S. jurisdictions in\nwhich we do business have been or may be\nnegatively impacted by slowing growth or\nrecessionary conditions, market\nvolatility and/or political or civil\nunrest. The ongoing pandemic had a\nsevere negative impact on global GDP,\nand despite significant progress in\n2021, it appears that the global economy\nfaces an uncertain and uneven recovery\nahead. While the U.S. and numerous other\ncountries have recovered to pre-pandemic\nlevels of output, many countries and\nareas within countries are recovering\nmore slowly. Economic weakness may prove\npersistent in many countries and\nregions, including certain regions of\nEurope, Japan and numerous emerging\nmarkets. Moreover, economic activity\nremains vulnerable to ongoing public\nhealth uncertainties with respect to the\npandemic, and a number of countries are\nstill imposing significant restrictions\non residents and businesses. Global\nsupply chain disruptions, labor\nshortages, wage pressures and elevated\ninflation in many countries pose further\nchallenges, especially in the form of\nvolatility in financial markets.\nAdditionally, foreign exchange rates\nagainst the U.S. dollar are at risk of\nsignificant depreciation as the Federal\nReserve raises interest rates.\n\nWe also invest or trade in the\nsecurities of corporations and\ngovernments located in non-U.S.\njurisdictions, including emerging\nmarkets. Revenues from the trading of\nnon-U.S. securities may be subject to\nnegative fluctuations as a result of the\nabove factors. Furthermore, the impact\nof these fluctuations could be magnified\nbecause non-U.S. trading markets,\nparticularly in emerging markets, are\ngenerally smaller, less liquid and more\nvolatile than U.S. trading markets.\nRisks in one nation can limit our\nopportunities for portfolio growth and\nnegatively affect our operations in\nother nations, including our U.S.\noperations. Market and economic\ndisruptions of all types\n\nmay affect consumer confidence levels\nand spending, corporate investment and\njob creation, bankruptcy rates, levels\nof incurrence and default on consumer\nand corporate debt, economic growth\nrates and asset values, among other\nfactors. Any such unfavorable conditions\nor developments could adversely impact\nus.\n\nAs a result of the pandemic and fiscal\npolicy responses to it, including the\nincreased purchase of government bonds\nand other financial assets by central\nbanks, government debt levels have\nincreased significantly raising the risk\nof volatility, significant valuation\nchanges, political tensions among EU\nmembers regarding fiscal policy or\ndefaults on or devaluation of sovereign\ndebt, which could expose us to\nsubstantial losses.\n\nOur non-U.S. businesses are also subject\nto extensive regulation by governments,\nsecurities exchanges and regulators,\ncentral banks and other regulatory\nbodies. In many countries, the laws and\nregulations applicable to the financial\nservices and securities industries are\nuncertain and evolving, and it may be\ndifficult for us to determine the exact\nrequirements of local laws in every\nmarket or manage our relationships with\nmultiple regulators in various\njurisdictions. Our potential inability\nto remain in compliance with local laws\nin a particular market and manage our\nrelationships with regulators could\nresult in increased expenses and changes\nto our organizational structure and\nadversely affect our businesses and\nresults of operations in that market, as\nwell as our reputation in general.\n\nIn connection with the U.K.\u2019s exit from\nthe EU, we are now subject to different\nlaws and regulations, which are expected\nto diverge further over time, and are\nsubject to the oversight of additional\nregulatory authorities. As political and\nregulatory environments evolve, further\nchanges to the legal and regulatory\nframework under which our subsidiaries\nprovide products and services in the\nU.K. and in the EU may result in\nadditional compliance costs and have\nnegative tax consequences or an adverse\nimpact on our results of operations.\n\nIn addition to non-U.S. legislation, our\ninternational operations are also\nsubject to U.S. legal requirements,\nwhich subjects us to operational and\ncompliance costs and risks. For example,\nour operations are subject to U.S. and\nnon-U.S. laws and regulations relating\nto bribery and corruption, anti-money\nlaundering, and economic sanctions,\nwhich can vary by jurisdiction. The\nincreasing speed and novel ways in which\nfunds circulate could make it more\nchallenging to track the movement of\nfunds and heighten financial crimes\nrisk. Our ability to comply with these\nlegal requirements depends on our\nability to continually improve\nsurveillance, detection and reporting\nand analytic capabilities.\n\nIn the U.S., debt ceiling and budget\ndeficit concerns, which have increased\nthe possibility of U.S. government\ndefaults on its debt and/or downgrades\nto its credit ratings, and prolonged\ngovernment shutdowns could weaken the\nU.S. dollar, cause market volatility,\nnegatively impact the global economy and\nbanking system and adversely affect our\nfinancial condition, including our\nliquidity. Additionally, changes in\nfiscal, monetary or regulatory policy,\nincluding as a result of labor\nshortages, wage pressures, supply chain\ndisruptions and higher inflation, could\nincrease our compliance costs and\nadversely affect our business\noperations, organizational structure and\nresults of operations. We are also\nsubject to geopolitical risks, including\neconomic sanctions, acts or threats of\ninternational or domestic terrorism,\nactions taken by the U.S. or other\ngovernments in response thereto, state-\nsponsored cyberattacks or campaigns,\ncivil unrest and/or military conflicts,\nwhich could adversely affect business\nand economic conditions abroad and in\nthe U.S. For example, escalating\nmilitary tensions between Russia and\nUkraine could result in regional\ninstability and adversely impact\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America14                                                               \n                                                                                  \ncommodity and other financial markets as\nwell as economic conditions, especially\nin Europe. Additionally, this could\nmagnify inflationary pressure resulting\nfrom the pandemic and extend any\nprolonged period of higher inflation.\n                                                                                  \n  Business Operations                                                             \n                                                                                  \nA failure in or breach of our\noperational or security systems or\ninfrastructure or business continuity\nplans, or those of third parties or the\nfinancial services industry, could\ndisrupt our critical business operations\nand customer services, result in\nadditional risk exposures, and adversely\nimpact our results of operations and\nfinancial condition, and cause legal or\nreputational harm.\n\nThe potential for operational risk\nexposure exists throughout our\norganization and as a result of our\ninteractions with, and reliance on,\nthird parties (including their\ndownstream service providers) and the\nfinancial services industry\ninfrastructure. Our operational and\nsecurity systems infrastructure,\nincluding our computer systems, emerging\ntechnologies, data management and\ninternal processes, as well as those of\nthird parties, are integral to our\nperformance. We also rely on our\nemployees and third parties (including\ndownstream service providers) in our\nday-to-day and ongoing operations, who\nmay, as a result of human error,\nmisconduct (including errors in\njudgment, malice, fraudulent activity\nand/or engaging in violations of\napplicable policies, laws, rules or\nprocedures), malfeasance or a failure or\nbreach of systems or infrastructure\ncause disruptions to our organization\nand expose us to operational losses,\nregulatory risk and reputational harm.\nThe Corporation\u2019s and third parties\u2019\ninability to properly introduce, deploy\nand manage changes to internal financial\nand governance processes, existing\nproducts, services and technology, as\nwell as new product innovations and\ntechnology could also result in\nadditional operational and regulatory\nrisk.\n\nAdditionally, our financial, accounting,\ndata processing and transmission,\nstorage, backup or other operating or\nsecurity systems and infrastructure, or\nthose of third parties with whom we\ninteract or upon whom we rely, may be\nineffective or fail to operate properly\nor become disabled or damaged as a\nresult of a number of factors including\nevents that are wholly or partially\nbeyond our or such third party\u2019s\ncontrol, which could adversely affect\nour ability to process transactions or\nprovide services. We could also\nexperience prolonged computer and\nnetwork outages resulting in disruptions\nto our critical business operations and\ncustomer services, including abuse or\nfailure of our electronic trading and\nalgorithmic platforms. We may experience\nsudden increases in customer transaction\nvolume or electrical, telecommunications\nor other major physical infrastructure\noutages, newly identified\nvulnerabilities in key hardware or\nsoftware, failure of aging\ninfrastructure and technology project\nimplementation challenges, which could\nresult in prolonged operational outages.\nClimate change is increasing the\nfrequency and severity of natural\ndisasters, such as earthquakes,\nwildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes and\nfloods, which could result in increased\nexposure to operational risks, including\noutages. Additionally, events arising\nfrom local or larger scale political or\nsocial matters, including civil unrest\nand terrorist acts, could result in\noperational disruptions and prolonged\noperational outages.\n\nWe continue to execute our business\ncontinuity plans due to the pandemic and\nwill likely continue to be subject to\nheightened operational risks to the\nextent that the pandemic persists. We\nalso continue to have greater reliance\non remote access tools and technology\nand employees\u2019 personal systems and\nincreased data utilization and be\nincreasingly dependent upon our\ninformation technology infrastructure to\noperate our\n\nbusinesses remotely due to the increased\nnumber of employees who work from home\nand evolving customer preferences,\nincluding increased reliance on digital\nbanking and other digital\n\nservices provided by our businesses.\nEffective management of our business\ncontinuity depends on the security,\nreliability and adequacy of such\nsystems. We also continue to be at risk\nof business disruptions due to illness\nand unavailability as the pandemic\npersists, including from the emergence\nof new variants, particularly if they\nare more transmissible and/or severe.\n\nRegardless of the measures we have taken\nto implement training, procedures,\nbackup systems and other safeguards to\nsupport our operations and bolster our\noperational resilience, our ability to\nconduct business may be adversely\naffected by any significant disruptions\nto us or to third parties (including\ntheir downstream service providers) with\nwhom we interact or upon whom we rely,\nincluding systemic cyber events that\nresult in system outages and\nunavailability of part or all of the\ninternet, cloud services and/or the\nfinancial services industry\ninfrastructure (including critical\nbanking activities). Our ability to\nimplement backup systems and other\nsafeguards with respect to third-party\nsystems and the financial services\nindustry infrastructure is more limited\nthan with respect to our own systems.\n\nFurthermore, to the extent that backup\nsystems are available and utilized, they\nmay not process data as quickly as our\nprimary systems and some data might not\nhave been backed up. We regularly update\nthe systems on which we rely to support\nour operations and growth and to remain\ncompliant with all applicable laws,\nrules and regulations globally. This\nupdating entails significant costs and\ncreates risks associated with\nimplementing new systems and integrating\nthem with existing ones, including\nbusiness interruptions.\n\nA failure or breach of our operational\nor security systems or infrastructure or\nbusiness continuity plans resulting in\ndisruption to our critical business\noperations and customer services and/or\nfailure to identify and effectively\nrespond to operational risks in a timely\nmanner could expose us to market abuse,\nregulatory, market, privacy and\nliquidity risk, and adversely impact our\nresults of operations and financial\ncondition, as well as cause legal or\nreputational harm.\n\nA cyberattack, information or security\nbreach, or a technology failure of ours\nor of a third party could adversely\naffect our ability to conduct our\nbusiness, manage our exposure to risk,\nresult in the disclosure and/or misuse\nof information and/or fraudulent\nactivity and increase our operational\nand security systems and critical\ninfrastructure costs.\n\nOur business is highly dependent on the\nsecurity, controls and efficacy of our\ninfrastructure, computer and data\nmanagement systems, as well as those of\nour customers, suppliers, counterparties\nand other third parties (including their\ndownstream service providers) the\nfinancial services industry and\nfinancial data aggregators, with whom we\ninteract, on whom we rely or who have\naccess to our customers' personal or\naccount information. Our business relies\non effective access management and the\nsecure collection, processing,\ntransmission, storage and retrieval of\nconfidential, proprietary, personally\nidentifiable and other information in\nour computer and data management systems\nand networks, and in the computer and\ndata management systems and networks of\nthird parties. In addition, to remotely\naccess our network, products and\nservices, our employees, customers,\nsuppliers, counterparties and other\nthird parties increasingly use personal\nmobile devices or computing devices that\nare outside of our\n                                                                                  \n  15Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nnetwork and control environments and are\nsubject to their own cybersecurity\nrisks.\n\nWe, our employees, customers, regulators\nand third parties (including providers\nof products and services) are regularly\nthe target of an increasing number of\ncyber threats and attacks and will\ncontinue to be. Cyber threats and\ntechniques used in cyberattacks are\npervasive, sophisticated, rapidly\nevolving, difficult to prevent and\ninclude computer viruses, malicious or\ndestructive code (such as ransomware),\nsocial engineering (including phishing,\nvishing and smishing), denial of service\nor information or other security breach\ntactics that could result in disruptions\nto our businesses and operations, the\nloss of funds of the Corporation and/or\nits clients and the unauthorized\nrelease, gathering, monitoring, misuse,\nloss or destruction or theft of\nconfidential, proprietary and other\ninformation, including intellectual\nproperty, of ours, our employees, our\ncustomers or of third parties.\nCybersecurity risks have also\nsignificantly increased in recent years\nin part due to the growing number and\nincreasingly sophisticated activities of\nmalicious cyber actors, including\norganized crime groups, hackers,\nterrorist organizations, extremist\nparties, hostile foreign governments and\nstate-sponsored actors, in some\ninstances acting to promote political\nends responding to policies and/or\nactions of the U.S. government. We are\nalso subject to cyberattacks by\ndisgruntled employees, activists and\nother third parties, including those\ninvolved in corporate espionage.\n\nOur cybersecurity risk and exposure\nremains heightened because of, among\nother things, the evolving nature and\npervasiveness of cyber threats, our\nprominent size and scale, our high-\nprofile brand, our geographic footprint\nand international presence and our role\nin the financial services industry and\nthe broader economy. The financial\nservices industry, including the\nCorporation, is particularly at risk\nbecause of the use of and reliance on\ndigital banking and other digital\nservices, including mobile banking\nproducts, such as mobile payments, and\nother web- and cloud-based products and\napplications and the development of\nadditional remote connectivity\nsolutions, which increase cybersecurity\nrisks and exposure. Acceptance and use\nof such digital banking products and\nservices has substantially increased\nsince the onset of the pandemic.\nAdditionally, the proliferation of\nthird-party financial data aggregators\nand emerging technologies, including our\nuse of automation, artificial\nintelligence (AI) and robotics, increase\nour cybersecurity risks and exposure.\n\nWe continue to execute our business\ncontinuity plans due to the pandemic.\nAccordingly, our risk and exposure to\ncyberattacks and security breaches\nremain magnified due to our continued\nreliance on remote access tools and\ntechnology, resulting in increased\nreliance on virtual/digital interactions\nand a larger number of access points to\nour networks that must be secured. This\nincreased risk of unauthorized access to\nour networks results in greater amounts\nof information being available for\naccess, including from employees\u2019\npersonal devices over which we do not\nhave the same controls as we do when a\nlarger employee population is working\nfrom our offices. Greater demand on our\ninformation technology infrastructure\nand security tools and processes will\nlikely continue as the pandemic persists\nand may be experienced permanently.\n\nWe also face indirect technology,\ncybersecurity and operational risks\nrelating to the customers, clients and\nother third parties (including their\ndownstream service providers) and the\nfinancial services industry with whom we\ndo business, upon whom we rely to\nfacilitate or enable our business\nactivities or upon whom our customers\nrely. Other indirect risks relate to\nproviders of products and/or services,\nfinancial counterparties,\n\nfinancial data aggregators, financial\nintermediaries, such as clearing agents,\nexchanges and clearing houses,\nregulators, providers of critical\ninfrastructure, such as internet access\nand electrical power, and retailers for\nwhom we process transactions. We are\nalso at additional risk resulting from\ncritical third-party information\nsecurity and open-source software\nvulnerabilities.\n\nAdditionally, we have exposure to cyber\nthreats as a result of our continuous\ntransmission of sensitive information\nto, and storage of such information by,\nthird parties, including providers of\nproducts and/or services, and\nregulators, the outsourcing of some of\nour business operations, and system and\ncustomer account updates and\nconversions. Further, any such event may\nnot be disclosed to us in a timely\nmanner. Similarly, any failure,\ncyberattack or other information or\nsecurity breach that significantly\ndegrades, deletes or compromises our\nsystems or data could adversely impact\nthird parties, counterparties and the\ncritical infrastructure of the financial\nservices industry.\n\nAs a result of increasing consolidation,\ninterdependence and complexity of\nfinancial entities and technology\nsystems, a technology failure,\ncyberattack or other information or\nsecurity vulnerability, failure or\nbreach that significantly exposes,\ndegrades, deletes or compromises the\nsystems or data of one or more financial\nentities or third parties (or their\ndownstream service providers) could have\na material impact on us, our\ncounterparties or other market\nparticipants and ultimately have an\nadverse impact on financial stability in\nthe U.S. and/or globally. This\nconsolidation, interconnectivity and\ncomplexity increases the risk of\noperational failure, on both individual\nand industry-wide bases, as disparate\nsystems need to be integrated, often on\nan accelerated basis.\n\nCyber threats and the techniques used in\ncyberattacks change rapidly. Despite\nsubstantial efforts to protect the\nintegrity and resilience of our systems\nand implement controls, processes,\npolicies and other protective measures,\nwe may not be able to anticipate or\ndetect cyberattacks or information or\nsecurity breaches and implement\neffective preventive or defensive\nmeasures to address or mitigate such\nattacks or breaches. Even the most\nadvanced internal control environment is\nvulnerable to compromise. Internal\naccess management failures could result\nin the compromise or unauthorized\nexposure of confidential data.\n\nCyberattacks or security breaches could\npersist for an extended period of time\nbefore being detected. It could take\nconsiderable additional time for us to\ndetermine the scope, extent, amount, and\ntype of information compromised, at\nwhich time the impact on the Corporation\nand measures to recover and restore to a\nbusiness-as-usual state may be difficult\nto assess. As cyber threats continue to\nevolve, we may be required to expend\nsignificant additional money and\nresources to modify or enhance our\nprotective measures, investigate and\nremediate any information security,\nsoftware or network vulnerabilities or\nincidents whether specific to us, a\nthird party, the industry or businesses\nin general, and develop our capabilities\nto respond and recover. As a result,\nincreasing resources to develop and\nenhance our controls, processes and\npractices designed to protect our\nsystems, workstations, intellectual\nproperty and proprietary information,\nsoftware, data and networks from attack,\ndamage or unauthorized access, remains a\ncritical priority.\n\nAlthough to date we have not experienced\nany material losses or other material\nconsequences relating to technology\nfailure, cyberattacks or other\ninformation or security breaches,\nwhether directed at us or third parties,\nthere can be no assurance that our\ncontrols and procedures in place to\nmonitor\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America16                                                               \n                                                                                  \nand mitigate the risks of cyber threats,\nincluding the remediation of critical\ninformation security and software\nvulnerabilities, will be sufficient\nand/or timely and that we will not\nsuffer material losses or consequences\nin the future. Successful penetration or\ncircumvention of system security could\nresult in negative consequences,\nincluding loss of customers and business\nopportunities, the withdrawal of\ncustomer deposits, misappropriation or\ndestruction of our intellectual\nproperty, proprietary information or\nconfidential information and/or the\nconfidential, proprietary or personally\nidentifiable information of certain\nparties, such as our employees,\ncustomers, providers of products and\nservices, counterparties and other third\nparties, or damage to their computers or\nsystems. Also, any technology failure,\ncyberattack, successful penetration or\ncircumvention of our networks and\nsystems or other information or security\nbreach, termination or constraint of any\nthird party (including their downstream\nservice providers), the financial\nservices industry infrastructure or\nfinancial data aggregators, could, among\nother things, adversely affect our\nability to conduct day-to-day business\nactivities, effect transactions, service\nour clients, manage our exposure to risk\nor expand our businesses, result in\nfraudulent or unauthorized transactions\nor cause prolonged computer and network\noutages resulting in material\ndisruptions to our or our customers\u2019 or\nother third parties\u2019 network access or\ncritical business operations and\ncustomer services, in the U.S. and/or\nglobally.\n\nCyberattacks or other information or\nsecurity breaches, whether directed at\nus or third parties, may result in\nsignificant lost revenue, give rise to\nlosses and claims brought by third\nparties, litigation exposure, government\nfines, penalties or intervention and\nother negative consequences.\nFurthermore, the public perception that\na cyberattack on our systems has been\nsuccessful, whether or not this\nperception is correct, may damage our\nreputation with customers and third\nparties with whom we do business and/or\nresult in the loss of confidence in our\nsecurity measures. Additionally, our\nfailure to communicate cyber incidents\nappropriately to relevant parties could\nresult in regulatory, privacy,\noperational and reputational risk.\nAlthough we maintain cyber insurance,\nthere can be no assurance that\nliabilities or losses we may incur will\nbe covered under such policies or that\nthe amount of insurance will be\nadequate. Cyberattacks or other\ninformation or security breaches could\nalso result in a violation of applicable\nprivacy and other laws in the U.S. and\nabroad, reimbursement or other\ncompensatory costs, additional\ncompliance costs, and our internal\ncontrols or disclosure controls being\nrendered ineffective. The occurrence of\nany of these events could adversely\nimpact our results of operations,\nliquidity and financial condition.\n\nFailure to satisfy our obligations as\nservicer for residential mortgage\nsecuritizations, loans owned by other\nentities and other losses we could incur\nas servicer, could adversely impact our\nreputation, servicing costs or results\nof operations.\n\nWe and our legacy companies service\nmortgage loans on behalf of third-party\nsecuritization vehicles and other\ninvestors. If we commit a material\nbreach of our obligations as servicer or\nmaster servicer, we may be subject to\ntermination if the breach is not cured\nwithin a specified period of time\nfollowing notice, which could cause us\nto lose servicing income. In addition,\nwe may have liability for any failure by\nus, as a servicer or master servicer,\nfor any act or omission on our part that\ninvolves willful misfeasance, bad faith,\ngross negligence or reckless disregard\nof our duties. If any such breach was\nfound to have occurred, it may harm our\nreputation, increase our servicing\ncosts, result in litigation or\nregulatory action or adversely impact\nour results of\n\noperations. Additionally, with respect\nto foreclosures, we may incur costs or\nlosses due to irregularities in the\nunderlying documentation, or if the\nvalidity of a foreclosure action is\nchallenged by a borrower or overturned\nby a court because of errors or\ndeficiencies in the foreclosure process.\nWe may also incur costs or losses\nrelating to delays or alleged\ndeficiencies in processing documents\nnecessary to comply with state law\ngoverning foreclosure.\n\nChanges in the structure of and\nrelationship among the GSEs could\nadversely impact our business.\n\nDuring 2021, we sold approximately $3.2\nbillion of loans to GSEs, primarily\nFreddie Mac (FHLMC). FHLMC and Fannie\nMae (FNMA) are currently in\nconservatorship with their primary\nregulator, the Federal Housing Finance\nAgency (FHFA) acting as conservator. In\nSeptember 2019, the Treasury Department\npublished a proposal to recapitalize\nFHLMC and FNMA and remove them from\nconservatorship as well as reduce their\nrole in the marketplace. Consistent with\nthis proposal, in January 2021, the\nTreasury Department further amended the\nagreement that governs the\nconservatorship of FHLMC and FNMA and\ndelineated the continued objective to\nremove the GSEs from conservatorship.\nHowever, we cannot predict the future\nprospects of the GSEs, timing of the\nrecapitalization or release from\nconservatorship, or content of\nlegislative or rulemaking proposals\nregarding the future status of the GSEs\nin the housing market. Additionally, if\nthe GSEs were to take a reduced role in\nthe marketplace, including by limiting\nthe mortgage products they offer, we\ncould be required to seek alternative\nfunding sources, retain additional loans\non our balance sheet, secure funding\nthrough the Federal Home Loan Bank\nsystem, or securitize the loans through\nPrivate Label Securitization.\nAccordingly, uncertainty regarding their\nfuture and the mortgage-backed\nsecurities they guarantee continues to\nexist for the foreseeable future.\n\nAny of these developments could\nadversely affect the value of our\nsecurities portfolios, capital levels,\nliquidity and results of operations.\n\nOur risk management framework may not be\neffective in mitigating risk and\nreducing the potential for losses.\n\nOur risk management framework is\ndesigned to minimize risk and loss to\nus. We seek to effectively and\nconsistently identify, measure, monitor,\nreport and control the types of risk to\nwhich we are subject, including\nstrategic, credit, legal, climate,\nmarket, liquidity, compliance,\noperational and reputational risks.\nWhile we employ a broad and diversified\nset of controls and risk mitigation\ntechniques, including modeling and\nforecasting, hedging strategies and\ntechniques that seek to balance our\nability to profit from trading positions\nwith our exposure to potential losses,\nour ability to control and mitigate\nrisks that result in losses is\ninherently limited by our ability to\nidentify all risks, including emerging\nand unknown risks, anticipate the timing\nof risks, apply effective hedging\nstrategies, make correct assumptions,\nmanage and aggregate data correctly and\nefficiently, and develop risk management\nmodels to assess and control risk.\n\nOur ability to manage risk is dependent\non our ability to consistently execute\nall elements of our risk management\nprogram and develop and maintain a\nculture of managing risk well throughout\nthe Corporation and manage risks\nassociated with third parties (including\ntheir downstream service providers),\nincluding providers of products and/or\nservices, to enable effective risk\nmanagement and ensure that risks are\nappropriately considered, evaluated and\nresponded to in a timely manner.\nUncertain economic conditions,\nheightened\n                                                                                  \n  17Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nlegislative and regulatory scrutiny of\nand change within the financial services\nindustry, the pace of technological\nchanges, accounting and market\ndevelopments, the failure of employees\nto comply with our policies and Risk\nFramework and the overall complexity of\nour operations, among other\ndevelopments, may result in a heightened\nlevel of risk for us. We have\nexperienced increased operational,\nreputational and compliance risk as a\nresult of the need to rapidly implement\nmultiple and varying pandemic relief\nprograms, such as PPP and the processing\nof unemployment benefits for California\nand certain other states, which have\nresulted and will continue to result in\nlosses, in addition to the continued\nexecution of our business continuity\nplans due to the pandemic. Our failure\nto manage evolving risks or properly\nanticipate, manage, control or mitigate\nrisks could result in additional losses.\n                                                                                  \n  Regulatory, Compliance and Legal                                                \n                                                                                  \nWe are subject to comprehensive\ngovernment legislation and regulations\nand certain settlements, orders and\nagreements with government authorities\nfrom time to time.\n\nWe are subject to comprehensive\nregulation under federal and state laws\nin the U.S. and the laws of the various\njurisdictions in which we operate,\nincluding increasing and complex\neconomic sanctions regimes. These laws\nand regulations significantly affect and\nhave the potential to restrict the scope\nof our existing businesses, limit our\nability to pursue certain business\nopportunities, including the products\nand services we offer, reduce certain\nfees and rates or make our products and\nservices more expensive for our clients.\nAdditionally, we are required to file\nvarious financial and non-financial\nregulatory reports to comply with laws\nand rules in the jurisdictions in which\nwe operate.\n\nWe continue to adjust our business and\noperations, legal entity structure and\nour policies, processes, procedures and\ncontrols, including with regard to\ncapital and liquidity management, risk\nmanagement and data management, to\ncomply with currently effective laws and\nregulations, as well as final\nrulemaking, guidance and interpretation\nby regulatory authorities, including the\nDepartment of Treasury (including the\nInternal Revenue Service (IRS)), Federal\nReserve, OCC, CFPB, Financial Stability\nOversight Council, FDIC, Department of\nLabor, SEC and CFTC in the U.S. and\nforeign regulators and other government\nauthorities. Further, we could become\nsubject to future legislation and\nregulatory requirements beyond those\ncurrently proposed, adopted or\ncontemplated in the U.S. or abroad,\nincluding policies and rulemaking\nrelated to the Financial Reform Act, the\npandemic, emerging technologies and\nclimate change. The cumulative effect of\nall of the legislation and regulations\non our business, operations and\nprofitability remains uncertain. This\nuncertainty necessitates that in our\nbusiness planning we make certain\nassumptions with respect to the scope\nand requirements of prospective and\nproposed rules. If these assumptions\nprove incorrect, we could be subject to\nincreased regulatory and compliance\nrisks and costs as well as potential\nreputational harm. In addition, U.S. and\ninternational regulatory initiatives may\noverlap, and non-U.S. regulations and\ninitiatives may be inconsistent or may\nconflict with current or proposed U.S.\nregulations, which could lead to\ncompliance risks and increased costs.\n\nOur regulators\u2019 prudential and\nsupervisory authority gives them broad\npower and discretion to direct our\nactions, and they have assumed an active\noversight, inspection and investigatory\nrole across the financial services\nindustry. Regulatory focus is not\nlimited to laws and regulations\napplicable to the financial services\nindustry, but extends to other\nsignificant laws and\n\nregulations that apply across industries\nand jurisdictions, including those\nrelated to data management and privacy,\nanti-money laundering, anti-corruption\nand economic sanctions.\n\nWe are also subject to laws, rules and\nregulations in the U.S. and abroad,\nincluding GDPR, CCPA and CPRA, and a\nnumber of additional jurisdictions\nenacting or considering similar laws,\nregarding compliance with our privacy\npolicies and the disclosure, collection,\nuse, sharing and safeguarding of\npersonally identifiable information of\ncertain parties, such as our employees,\ncustomers, suppliers, counterparties and\nother third parties, the violation of\nwhich could result in litigation,\nregulatory fines and enforcement\nactions. The complexity and risk of\ncompliance has been magnified by the\ncollection of employee health\ninformation in response to the pandemic.\nAdditionally, we will likely be subject\nto new and evolving data privacy laws in\nthe U.S. and abroad, which could result\nin additional costs of compliance,\nlitigation, regulatory fines and\nenforcement actions. In particular,\nthere is increased complexity and\nuncertainty, including potential\nsuspension or prohibition, regarding the\nstandards used by the Corporation for\ncross-border flows and transfers of\npersonal data from the European Economic\nArea (EEA) to the U.S. and other\njurisdictions outside of the EEA\nresulting from a decision of the Court\nof Justice of the EU and guidance from\nthe European Data Protection Board.\nAdditionally, the European Commission\nhas published new standards of personal\ndata transfer, and China and the U.K.\nhave commenced consultation efforts to\nestablish standards for personal data\ntransfers. If cross-border personal data\ntransfers are suspended or restricted or\nwe are required to implement distinct\nprocesses for each jurisdiction\u2019s\nstandards, this could result in\noperational disruptions to our\nbusinesses, additional costs, increased\nenforcement activity, new contract\nnegotiations with third parties, and/or\nmodification of our cross-border data\nmanagement.\n\nAs part of their enforcement authority,\nour regulators and other government\nauthorities have the authority to, among\nother things, conduct investigations and\nassess significant civil or criminal\nmonetary penalties or restitution and\nissue cease and desist orders and\ninitiate injunctive actions. The amounts\npaid by us and other financial\ninstitutions to settle proceedings or\ninvestigations have, in some instances,\nbeen substantial and may increase. In\nsome cases, governmental authorities\nhave required criminal pleas or other\nextraordinary terms as part of such\nresolutions, which could have\nsignificant consequences, including\nreputational harm, loss of customers,\nrestrictions on the ability to access\ncapital markets, and the inability to\noperate certain businesses or offer\ncertain products for a period of time.\n\nThe Corporation and the conduct of its\nemployees and representatives, including\nconduct that could harm clients,\ncustomers, employees or the integrity of\nthe markets, are subject to regulatory\nscrutiny across jurisdictions. The\ncomplexity of the federal and state\nregulatory and enforcement regimes in\nthe U.S., coupled with the global scope\nof our operations and the regulatory\nenvironment worldwide, also means that a\nsingle event or practice or a series of\nrelated events or practices may give\nrise to a significant number of\noverlapping investigations and\nregulatory proceedings, either by\nmultiple federal and state agencies in\nthe U.S. or by multiple regulators and\nother governmental entities in different\njurisdictions. Additionally, actions by\nother members of the financial services\nindustry related to business activities\nin which we participate may result in\ninvestigations by regulators or other\ngovernment authorities. Responding to\ninquiries, investigations, lawsuits and\nproceedings is time-consuming and\nexpensive and can divert senior\nmanagement attention from our business.\nThe\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America18                                                               \n                                                                                  \noutcome of such proceedings, which may\nlast a number of years, may be difficult\nto predict or estimate.\n\nWe are and may become subject to the\nterms of settlements, orders and\nagreements that we have entered into\nwith government entities and regulatory\nauthorities, which impose, or could\nimpose, significant operational and\ncompliance costs on us as they typically\nrequire us to enhance our procedures and\ncontrols, expand our risk and control\nfunctions within our lines of business,\ninvest in technology and hire\nsignificant numbers of additional risk,\ncontrol and compliance personnel.\nMoreover, if we fail to meet the\nrequirements of the regulatory\nsettlements, orders or agreements to\nwhich we are subject, or, more\ngenerally, fail to maintain risk and\ncontrol procedures and processes that\nmeet the heightened standards\nestablished by our regulators and other\ngovernment authorities, we could be\nrequired to enter into further\nsettlements, orders or agreements and\npay additional fines, penalties or\njudgments, or accept material regulatory\nrestrictions on our businesses.\n\nWhile we believe that we have adopted\nappropriate risk management and\ncompliance programs to identify, assess,\nmonitor and report on employees conduct,\napplicable laws, policies and\nprocedures, compliance risks will\ncontinue to exist, particularly as we\nadapt to new and evolving laws, rules\nand regulations. Additionally, changing\nU.S. fiscal, monetary and regulatory\npolicies, and evolving priorities, may\nresult in ongoing regulatory\nuncertainties. There is no guarantee\nthat our risk management and compliance\nprograms will be consistently executed\nto successfully manage compliance risk.\nWe also rely upon third parties who may\nexpose us to compliance and legal risk.\nFuture legislative or regulatory\nactions, and any required changes to our\nbusiness or operations, or those of\nthird parties (including their\ndownstream providers) upon whom we rely,\nresulting from such developments and\nactions could result in a significant\nloss of revenue, impose additional\ncompliance and other costs or otherwise\nreduce our profitability, limit the\nproducts and services that we offer or\nour ability to pursue certain business\nopportunities, require us to dispose of\nor curtail certain businesses, affect\nthe value of assets that we hold,\nrequire us to increase our prices and\ntherefore reduce demand for our\nproducts, or otherwise adversely affect\nour businesses. In addition,\ninvestigations, legal and regulatory\nproceedings and other contingencies will\narise from time to time that may result\nin fines, regulatory sanctions,\npenalties, equitable relief and changes\nto our business practices. As a result,\nwe are and will continue to be subject\nto heightened compliance and operating\ncosts that could adversely affect our\nresults of operations.\n\nWe are subject to significant financial\nand reputational risks from potential\nliability arising from lawsuits and\nregulatory and government action.\n\nWe continue to face significant legal\nrisks in our business, with a high\nvolume of claims against us and other\nfinancial institutions. The amount of\ndamages, penalties and fines that\nlitigants and regulators seek from us\nand other financial institutions\ncontinues to be high. This includes\ndisputes with consumers, customers and\nother counterparties.\n\nFinancial institutions, including us,\ncontinue to be the subject of claims\nalleging anti-competitive conduct with\nrespect to various products and markets,\nincluding U.S. antitrust class actions\nclaiming joint and several liability for\ntreble damages. As disclosed in Note 12\n\u2014 Commitments and Contingencies to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements, we\nalso face contractual indemnification\nand loan-repurchase claims arising from\nalleged breaches of representations and\nwarranties in the sale of\n\nresidential mortgages by legacy\ncompanies, which may result in a\nrequirement that we repurchase the\nmortgage loans, or otherwise make whole\nor provide other remedies to\ncounterparties.\n\nIn addition, regulatory authorities have\nhad a supervisory focus on enforcement,\nincluding in connection with customer\ncomplaints, alleged violations of law\nand customer harm. For example, U.S.\nregulators and government agencies have\npursued claims against financial\ninstitutions under the Financial\nInstitutions Reform, Recovery, and\nEnforcement Act, the False Claims Act,\nfair lending laws and regulations\n(including the Equal Credit Opportunity\nAct and the Fair Housing Act), antitrust\nlaws, and consumer protection laws and\nregulations, including prohibitions on\nunfair, deceptive, and/or abusive acts\nand practices under the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Act and the Federal\nTrade Commission Act. Such claims may\ncarry significant and, in certain cases,\ntreble damages. T here is also an\nincreased focus on compliance with\nglobal laws, rules and regulations\nrelated to the collection, use, sharing\nand safeguarding of personally\nidentifiable information and corporate\ndata. Additionally, misconduct by the\nCorporation\u2019s employees and\nrepresentatives, including unethical,\nfraudulent, improper or illegal conduct,\nor other unfair, deceptive, abusive or\ndiscriminatory business practices, can\nresult in litigation and/or government\ninvestigations and enforcement actions,\nand cause significant reputational harm.\nThere is also increased scrutiny of\nclimate change-related policies, goals\nand disclosure, which could result in\nlitigation and regulatory investigations\nand actions.\n\nThe global environment of extensive\ninvestigations, regulation, regulatory\ncompliance burdens, litigation and\nregulatory enforcement, combined with\nuncertainty related to the continually\nevolving regulatory environment, have\naffected and will likely continue to\naffect operational and compliance costs\nand risks, including the limitation or\ncessation of our ability or feasibility\nto continue providing certain products\nand services. Lawsuits and regulatory\nactions have resulted in and will likely\ncontinue to result in judgments, orders\nsettlements, penalties and fines adverse\nto us. Further, the Corporation's\nparticipation in implementing government\nrelief measures related to the pandemic\nand other federal and state government\nassistance programs, including the\nprocessing of unemployment benefits for\nCalifornia and certain other states, may\nlead to additional such judgments,\norders, settlements, penalties and\nfines. Litigation and investigation\ncosts, substantial legal liability or\nsignificant regulatory or government\naction against us could have material\nadverse effects on our business,\nfinancial condition, including\nliquidity, and results of operations,\nand/or cause significant reputational\nharm to us.\n\nU.S. federal banking agencies may\nrequire us to increase our regulatory\ncapital, total loss-absorbing capacity\n(TLAC), long-term debt or liquidity\nrequirements.\n\nWe are subject to U.S. regulatory\ncapital and liquidity rules. These\nrules, among other things, establish\nminimum requirements to qualify as a\nwell-capitalized institution. If any of\nour subsidiary insured depository\ninstitutions fails to maintain its\nstatus as well capitalized under the\napplicable regulatory capital rules, the\nFederal Reserve will require us to agree\nto bring the insured depository\ninstitution back to well-capitalized\nstatus. For the duration of such an\nagreement, the Federal Reserve may\nimpose restrictions on our activities.\nIf we were to fail to enter into or\ncomply with such an agreement, or fail\nto comply with the terms of such\nagreement, the Federal Reserve may\nimpose more severe restrictions on our\nactivities, including\n                                                                                  \n  19Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nrequiring us to cease and desist\nactivities permitted under the Bank\nHolding Company Act of 1956.\n\nCapital and liquidity requirements are\nfrequently introduced and amended. It is\npossible that regulators may increase\nregulatory capital requirements\nincluding TLAC and long-term debt\nrequirements, change how regulatory\ncapital is calculated or increase\nliquidity requirements. Our ability to\nreturn capital to our shareholders\ndepends in part on our ability to\nmaintain regulatory capital levels above\nminimum requirements plus buffers. To\nthe extent that increases occur in our\nSCB, G-SIB surcharge or countercyclical\ncapital buffer, our returns of capital\nto shareholders could decrease. For\nexample, our G-SIB surcharge is expected\nto increase by 50 basis points to 3.0\npercent on January 1, 2024.\n\nAs part of its CCAR, the Federal Reserve\nconducts stress testing on parts of our\nbusiness using hypothetical economic\nscenarios prepared by the Federal\nReserve. Those scenarios may affect our\nCCAR stress test results, which may\nimpact the level of our SCB requiring us\nto hold additional capital.\nAdditionally, the Federal Reserve could\nreinstitute limitations or prohibitions\non taking capital actions, such as\npaying or increasing dividends or\nrepurchasing common stock as a result of\nthe economic impact of the ongoing\npandemic or otherwise impose such\nlimitations in connection with other\neconomic disruptions or events.\n\nA significant component of regulatory\ncapital ratios is calculating our RWA\nand our leverage exposure, which may\nincrease. The Basel Committee on Banking\nSupervision has also revised several key\nmethodologies for measuring RWA that\nhave not yet been implemented in the\nU.S., including a standardized approach\nfor operational risk, revised market\nrisk requirements and constraints on the\nuse of internal models, as well as a\ncapital floor based on the revised\nstandardized approaches. U.S. banking\nregulators may update the U.S. Basel 3\nrules to incorporate the Basel Committee\nrevisions. Banks have experienced an\nincrease in balance sheets, increasing\nleverage exposures and causing leverage-\nbased ratios to overtake risk-based\ncapital ratios.\n\nChanges to and compliance with the\nregulatory capital and liquidity\nrequirements may impact our operations\nby requiring us to liquidate assets,\nincrease borrowings, issue additional\nequity or other securities, cease or\nalter certain operations or hold highly\nliquid assets, which may adversely\naffect our results of operations.\n\nChanges in accounting standards or\nassumptions in applying accounting\npolicies could adversely affect us.\n\nOur accounting policies and methods are\nfundamental to how we record and report\nour financial condition and results of\noperations. Some of these policies\nrequire use of estimates and assumptions\nthat may affect the reported value of\nour assets or liabilities and results of\noperations and are critical because they\nrequire management to make difficult,\nsubjective and complex judgments about\nmatters that are inherently uncertain.\nIf those assumptions, estimates or\njudgments were misapplied, we could be\nrequired to correct and restate prior-\nperiod financial statements. Accounting\nstandard-setters and those who interpret\nthe accounting standards, including the\nSEC, banking regulators and our\nindependent registered public accounting\nfirm may also amend or even reverse\ntheir previous interpretations or\npositions on how various standards\nshould be applied. These changes may be\ndifficult to predict and could impact\nhow we prepare and report our financial\nstatements. In some cases, we could be\nrequired to apply a new or revised\n\nstandard retrospectively, resulting in\nus revising prior-period financial\nstatements.\n\nWe may be adversely affected by changes\nin U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws and\nregulations.\n\nIt is possible that governmental\nauthorities in the U.S. and/or other\ncountries could further amend or repeal\ntax laws in a way that would materially\nadversely affect us, including the\npossibility that aspects of the 2017 Tax\nCuts and Jobs Act could be amended in\nthe future. Any future change in tax\nlaws and regulations or interpretations\nof current or future tax laws and\nregulations could materially adversely\naffect our results of operations.\nAdditionally, U.S. and foreign tax laws\nare complex and our judgments,\ninterpretations or applications of such\ntax laws could differ from that of the\nrelevant governmental authority. This\ncould result in additional tax\nliabilities and interest, penalties, the\nreduction of certain tax benefits and/or\nthe requirement to make adjustments to\namounts recorded, which could be\nmaterial.\n\nIn addition, we have U.K. net deferred\ntax assets (DTA) which consist primarily\nof net operating losses that are\nexpected to be realized by certain\nsubsidiaries over an extended number of\nyears. Adverse developments with respect\nto tax laws or to other material\nfactors, such as prolonged worsening of\nEurope\u2019s capital markets or changes in\nthe ability of our U.K. subsidiaries to\nconduct business in the EU, could lead\nour management to reassess and/or change\nits current conclusion that no valuation\nallowance is necessary with respect to\nour U.K. net DTA.\n                                                                                  \n  Reputation                                                                      \n                                                                                  \nDamage to our reputation could harm our\nbusinesses, including our competitive\nposition and business prospects.\n\nOur ability to attract and retain\ncustomers, clients, investors and\nemployees is impacted by our reputation.\nHarm to our reputation can arise from\nvarious sources, including officer,\ndirector and/or employee activities,\nsuch as fraud, misconduct and unethical\nbehavior (such as employees\u2019 sales\npractices), security breaches,\nlitigation or regulatory matters and\ntheir outcomes, compensation practices,\nlending practices, the suitability or\nreasonableness of recommending\nparticular trading or investment\nstrategies, including the reliability of\nour research and models and prohibiting\nclients from engaging in certain\ntransactions.\n\nAdditionally, our reputation may be\nharmed by failing to deliver the\nproducts and standards of service and\nquality expected by our customers,\nclients and the community, the failure\nto recognize and address customer\ncomplaints, compliance failures, the\ninability to manage technology change or\nmaintain effective data management,\ncyber incidents, prolonged or repeated\nsystem outages, internal and external\nfraud, inadequacy of responsiveness to\ninternal controls, unintended disclosure\nof personal, proprietary or confidential\ninformation, conflicts of interest and\nbreach of fiduciary obligations, the\nhandling of health emergencies or\npandemics, and the activities of our\nclients, customers, counterparties and\nthird parties, including providers of\nproducts and/or services. For example,\nour reputation may be harmed in\nconnection with our implementation of\ngovernment programs to provide relief to\naddress the economic impact of the\npandemic and other federal and state\ngovernment assistance programs,\nincluding the processing of unemployment\nbenefits for California and certain\nother states, as well as how we handle\nemployee matters related to the\npandemic. Our reputation may also be\nnegatively impacted by our ESG practices\nand disclosures, our businesses\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America20                                                               \n                                                                                  \nand our customers, including practices\nand disclosures related to climate\nchange.\n\nActions by the financial services\nindustry generally or by certain members\nor individuals in the industry also can\nadversely affect our reputation. Also,\nadverse publicity or negative\ninformation posted on social media by\nemployees, the media or otherwise,\nwhether or not factually correct, may\nadversely impact our business prospects\nor financial results.\n\nWe are subject to complex and evolving\nlaws and regulations regarding privacy,\nfair lending activity, UDAAP, electronic\nfunds transfers, know-your-customer\nrequirements, data protection, including\nthe GDPR, CCPA and CPRA, cross-border\ndata movement and other matters.\nPrinciples concerning the appropriate\nscope of consumer and commercial privacy\nvary considerably in different\njurisdictions, and regulatory and public\nexpectations regarding the definition\nand scope of consumer and commercial\nprivacy may remain fluid. It is possible\nthat these laws may be interpreted and\napplied by various jurisdictions in a\nmanner inconsistent with our current or\nfuture practices, or that is\ninconsistent with one another. If\npersonal, confidential or proprietary\ninformation of customers or clients in\nour possession, or in the possession of\nthird parties (including their\ndownstream service providers) or\nfinancial data aggregators, is\nmishandled, misused or mismanaged, or if\nwe do not timely or adequately address\nsuch information, we may face\nregulatory, reputational and operational\nrisks which could adversely affect our\nfinancial condition and results of\noperations.\n\nWe could suffer reputational harm if we\nfail to properly identify and manage\npotential conflicts of interest.\nManagement of potential conflicts of\ninterest has become increasingly complex\nas we expand our business activities\nthrough more numerous transactions,\nobligations and interests with and among\nour clients. The failure to adequately\naddress, or the perceived failure to\nadequately address, conflicts of\ninterest could affect the willingness of\nclients to use our products and\nservices, or give rise to litigation or\nenforcement actions, which could\nadversely affect our business.\n\nOur actual or perceived failure to\naddress these and other issues, such as\noperational risks, gives rise to\nreputational risk that could harm us and\nour business prospects. Failure to\nappropriately address any of these\nissues could also give rise to\nadditional regulatory restrictions,\nlegal risks and reputational harm, which\ncould, among other consequences,\nincrease the size and number of\nlitigation claims and damages asserted\nor subject us to enforcement actions,\nfines and penalties, and cause us to\nincur related costs and expenses.\n                                                                                  \n  Other                                                                           \n                                                                                  \nReforms to and replacement of IBORs and\ncertain other rates or indices may\nadversely affect our reputation,\nbusiness, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\n\nThere continues to be a major transition\nin progress in the global financial\nmarkets with respect to the replacement\nof IBORs, including the London Interbank\nOffered Rate (LIBOR), and certain other\nrates or indices that serve as\n\u201cbenchmarks.\u201d Such benchmarks have been\nused extensively across the global\nfinancial markets and in our business.\nIn particular, LIBOR has historically\nbeen used in many of our products and\ncontracts, including derivatives,\nconsumer and commercial loans,\nmortgages, floating-rate notes and other\nadjustable-rate products and financial\ninstruments. The aggregate notional\namount of these products and contracts\nreferencing LIBOR or other IBORs remains\nmaterial to our business. At the end of\n2021, the global financial markets\ngenerally transitioned away\n\nfrom the use of all LIBOR settings\n(except for certain U.S. dollar (USD)\nLIBOR settings). However, there continue\nto be risks and challenges associated\nwith the transition from IBORs that may\nresult in consequences that cannot be\nfully anticipated, which expose us to\nvarious financial, operational,\nsupervisory, conduct and legal risks,\nwhich we continue to monitor closely.\n\nThrough a multi-year effort by the\nindustry and regulators, ARRs have been\nidentified and/or developed and are\nbeing used to replace LIBOR and other\nIBORs. However, market and client\nadoption of ARRs, may vary across or\nwithin categories of contracts, products\nand services, resulting in market\nfragmentation, decreased trading volumes\nand liquidity, increased complexity and\nmodeling and operational risks. ARRs\nhave compositions and characteristics\nthat differ from the benchmarks they\nreplace, in some cases have limited\nhistory, and may demonstrate less\npredictable performance over time than\nthe benchmarks they replace. For\nexample, certain ARRs are calculated on\na compounded or weighted-average basis\nand, unlike IBORs, do not reflect bank\ncredit risk and therefore typically\nrequire a spread adjustment. There are\nimportant differences between the\nfallbacks, triggers and calculation\nmethodologies being implemented in cash\nand derivatives markets (including\nwithin cash markets). Any mismatch\nbetween the adoption of ARRs in loans,\nsecurities and derivatives markets may\nimpact hedging or other financial\narrangements we have implemented, and as\na result we may experience unanticipated\nmarket exposures. Changes resulting from\ntransition to successor or alternative\nrates may adversely affect the yield on\nloans or securities held by us, amounts\npaid on securities we have issued,\namounts received and paid on derivatives\nwe have entered into, the value of such\nloans, securities or derivative\ninstruments, the trading market for such\nproducts and contracts, and our ability\nto effectively use hedging instruments\nto manage risk. There can be no\nassurance that existing assets and\nliabilities based on or linked to IBORs\nthat have not already transitioned to\nARRs will successfully transition.\n\nGiven the continuation of certain USD\nLIBOR settings until June 30, 2023,\nIBOR-based products and contracts (IBOR\nProducts) linked to these LIBOR settings\nwill still have to be transitioned by\nsuch time. Although a significant\nmajority of the aggregate notional\namount of our IBOR-based products\nmaturing after 2021 include or have been\nupdated to include fallbacks to ARRs,\nthe transitioning of certain IBOR\nProducts that do not include fallback\nprovisions or adequate fallback\nmechanisms will require additional\nefforts to modify their terms. Some\noutstanding IBOR Products are\nparticularly challenging to modify due\nto the requirement that all impacted\nparties consent to such modification. To\naddress such challenges in IBOR\nProducts, legislation has been adopted\nin various jurisdictions, including the\nEU, U.K. and New York State, and federal\nlegislation is pending in the U.S.\nCongress. Litigation, disputes or other\naction may occur as a result of the\ninterpretation or application of\nlegislation, in particular, if there is\nan overlap between laws in different\njurisdictions.\n\nSome of our IBOR Products, in particular\nLIBOR-based products and contracts, may\ncontain language giving the calculation\nagent (which may be us) discretion to\ndetermine the successor rate (including\nthe ARR and/or the applicable spread\nadjustment) to the existing benchmark.\nWe may face a risk of litigation,\ndisputes or other actions from clients,\ncounterparties, customers, investors or\nothers based on various claims, for\nexample that the Corporation incorrectly\ninterpreted or enforced IBOR-based\ncontract provisions, failed to\nappropriately communicate the effect\nthat the transition to ARRs will have on\n                                                                                  \n  21Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nexisting and future products, treated\naffected parties unfairly or made\ninappropriate product recommendations to\nor investments on behalf of its clients,\nor engaged in anti-competitive behavior\nor unlawfully manipulated markets or\nbenchmarks.\n\nWe have launched, and expect to continue\nto develop, launch and support, ARR-\nbased products and services. There is no\nguarantee that liquidity in ARR-based\nproducts will develop, and it is\npossible that ARR-based products,\nincluding products using credit\nsensitive rates, will perform\ndifferently to IBOR Products during\ntimes of economic stress, adverse or\nvolatile market conditions and across\nthe credit and economic cycle, which may\nimpact the value, return on and\nprofitability of our ARR-based assets.\nNew financial products linked to ARRs\nmay have additional legal, financial,\ntax, operational, market, compliance,\nreputational, competitive or other risks\nto us, our clients and other market\nparticipants. In particular, banking\nregulators in the U.S. and globally have\nincreased regulatory scrutiny and\nintensified supervisory focus of\nfinancial institution LIBOR transition\nplans, preparations and readiness,\nincluding the Corporation\u2019s use of\ncredit-sensitive rates like the\nBloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index,\nwhich could result in a regulatory\naction, litigation and/or the need to\nchange the products offered by our\nbusinesses.\n\nFailure to meet industry-wide IBOR\ntransition milestones and to cease\nissuance of IBOR Products by relevant\ncessation dates may, subject to certain\nregulatory exceptions, result in\nsupervisory enforcement by applicable\nregulators, increase our cost of, and\naccess to, capital and other\nconsequences.\n\nThe market transition may also alter our\nrisk profile and risk management\nstrategies, including derivatives and\nhedging strategies, modeling and\nanalytics, valuation tools, product\ndesign and systems, controls, procedures\nand operational infrastructure. This may\nprove challenging given the limited\nhistory of many of the proposed ARRs and\nmay increase the costs and risks related\nto potential regulatory compliance,\nrequirements or inquiries. Among other\nrisks, various IBOR Products transition\nto ARRs at different times or in\ndifferent manners, with the result that\nwe may face significant unexpected\ninterest rate, pricing or other\nexposures across business or product\nlines. Continuing reforms to market\ntransition and other factors may\nadversely affect our business, including\nthe ability to serve customers and\nmaintain market share, financial\ncondition or results of operations and\ncould result in reputational harm to us.\n\nWe face significant and increasing\ncompetition in the financial services\nindustry.\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive\nenvironment and experience intense\ncompetition from local and global\nfinancial institutions as well as new\nentrants, in both domestic and foreign\nmarkets, in which we compete on the\nbasis of a number of factors, including\ncustomer service, quality and range of\nproducts and services offered,\ntechnology, price, fees, reputation,\ninterest rates on loans and deposits,\nlending limits, customer convenience and\nexperience and relationships in relevant\nmarkets. Additionally, the changing\nregulatory environment may create\ncompetitive disadvantages for us given\ngeography-driven capital and liquidity\nrequirements.\n\nIn addition, emerging technologies and\nadvances and the growth of e-commerce\nhave lowered geographic and monetary\nbarriers of other financial\ninstitutions, made it easier for non-\ndepository institutions to offer\nproducts and services that traditionally\nwere banking products and allowed non-\ntraditional\n\nfinancial service providers and\ntechnology companies to\n\ncompete with traditional financial\nservice companies in providing\nelectronic and internet-based financial\nsolutions and services, including\nelectronic securities trading with low\nor no fees and commissions, marketplace\nlending, financial data aggregation and\npayment processing, including real-time\npayment platforms. Further, clients may\nchoose to conduct business with other\nmarket participants who engage in\nbusiness or offer products in areas we\ndeem speculative or risky. Increased\ncompetition may negatively affect our\nearnings by creating pressure to lower\nprices, fees, commissions or credit\nstandards on our products and services,\nrequiring additional investment to\nimprove the quality and delivery of our\ntechnology and/or reducing our market\nshare, or affecting the willingness of\nour clients to do business with us.\n\nOur inability to adapt our business\nstrategies, products and services could\nharm our business.\n\nOur business model is based on a\ndiversified mix of businesses that\nprovide a broad range of financial\nproducts and services, delivered through\nmultiple distribution channels. Our\nsuccess depends on our, and our third-\nparty providers of products and\nservices\u2019 ability to adapt and develop\nour business strategies, products,\nservices and technology to rapidly\nevolving industry standards and consumer\npreferences. In particular, the\nemergence of the pandemic has resulted\nin increased reliance on digital banking\nand other digital services provided by\nthe Corporation\u2019s businesses. There is\nincreasing pressure by competitors to\nprovide products and services on more\nattractive terms, including lower fees\nand higher interest rates on deposits,\nand offer lower cost investment\nstrategies, which may impact our ability\nto grow revenue and/or effectively\ncompete. Additionally, legislative and\nregulatory developments may affect the\ncompetitive landscape and impact the\nproducts and services that we can offer.\nFurther, we may be impacted by the\ngrowth of non-depository institutions\nthat offer traditional banking products\nat higher rates or with low or no fees,\nor otherwise offer alternative products.\nThis can reduce our net interest margin\nand revenues from our fee-based products\nand services, either from a decrease in\nthe volume of transactions or through a\ncompression of spreads.\n\nThe widespread adoption and rapid\nevolution of new technologies, including\nanalytic capabilities, self-service\ndigital trading platforms, internet\nservices, distributed ledgers, such as\nthe blockchain system, cryptocurrencies,\nCentral Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)\nand payment systems, could require\nsubstantial expenditures to modify or\nadapt our existing products and services\nas we grow and develop our online and\nmobile banking channel strategies in\naddition to remote connectivity\nsolutions. As CBDC initiatives evolve\nand mature, our businesses and results\nof operations could be adversely\nimpacted, including as a result of the\nintroduction of new competitors to the\npayment ecosystem and increased\nvolatility in deposits and/or\nsignificant long-term reduction in\ndeposits (i.e., financial\ndisintermediation). Also, we may not be\nas timely or successful in developing or\nintroducing new products and services,\nintegrating new products or services\ninto our existing offerings, responding,\nmanaging or adapting to changes in\nconsumer behavior, preferences,\nspending, investing and/or saving\nhabits, achieving market acceptance of\nour products and services, reducing\ncosts in response to pressures to\ndeliver products and services at lower\nprices or sufficiently developing and\nmaintaining loyal customers. The\nCorporation\u2019s or its third-party\nproviders of products and services\u2019\ninability or resistance to timely\ninnovate or adapt its operations,\nproducts and services\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America22                                                               \n                                                                                  \nto evolving industry standards and\nconsumer preferences could result in\nservice disruptions and harm our\nbusiness and adversely affect our\nresults of operations and reputation.\n\nWe could suffer operational,\nreputational and financial harm if our\nmodels and strategies fail to properly\nanticipate and manage risk.\n\nWe use models and strategies extensively\nto forecast losses, project revenue,\nmeasure and assess capital and liquidity\nrequirements for credit, market,\noperational and strategic risks, assist\nin capital planning and assess and\ncontrol our operations and financial\ncondition. Model Risk Management is a\ndedicated and independent risk function\nthat defines model risk governance,\npolicy and guidelines for the\nCorporation based on laws, rules and\nregulations, as well as internal\nrequirements. Under our Enterprise Model\nRisk Policy, Model Risk Management is\nrequired to perform model oversight,\nincluding independent validation before\ninitial use, ongoing monitoring reviews\nthrough outcomes analysis and\nbenchmarking, and periodic revalidation.\nModels are subject to inherent\nlimitations due to the use of\nsimplifying assumptions, uncertainty\nregarding economic and financial\noutcomes, and emerging risks from the\nuse of applications that rely on AI.\n\nOur models and strategies may not be\nsufficiently predictive of future\nresults due to limited historical\npatterns, extreme or unanticipated\nmarket movements or customer behavior\nand liquidity, especially during severe\nmarket downturns or stress events, which\ncould limit their effectiveness and\nrequire timely recalibration. The models\nthat we use to assess and control our\nmarket risk exposures also reflect\nassumptions about the degree of\ncorrelation among prices of various\nasset classes or other market\nindicators, which may not be\nrepresentative of the next downturn and\nwould magnify the limitations inherent\nin using historical data to manage risk.\nOur models may be adversely impacted as\na result of human error and may not be\neffective if we fail to properly oversee\nand review them at regular intervals and\ndetect their flaws during our review and\nmonitoring processes, they contain\nerroneous data, assumptions, valuations,\nformulas or algorithms or our\napplications running the models do not\nperform as expected. Regardless of the\nsteps we take to ensure effective\ncontrols, governance, monitoring and\ntesting, and implement new technology\nand automated processes, we could suffer\noperational, reputational and financial\nharm if models and strategies fail to\nproperly anticipate and manage current\nand evolving risks.\n\nFailure to properly manage data may\nresult in our inability to manage risk\nand business needs, errors in our day-\nto-day operations, critical reporting\nand strategic decision-making,\ninaccurate reporting and non-compliance\nwith laws, rules and regulations.\n\nOur ability to obtain, create, report\nand maintain information, including the\ndata associated with it, during our\nnormal course of business is a\nfoundational component of our business\nand of managing relationships with\ncustomers. Additionally, we rely on our\nability to manage data in an accurate,\ntimely and complete manner, including\nthe capture, transport, aggregation,\nvalidation, processing, quality,\ninterpretation, protection, maintenance,\nretention, external transmission and\nuse. Our policies, programs, processes\nand practices govern how data risk is\nmanaged globally. While we continuously\nupdate our policies, programs, processes\nand practices and implement emerging\ntechnologies, such as automation, AI and\nrobotics, our data management processes\nmay not be effective and are subject to\nweaknesses and failures, including human\nerror, data limitations, process delays,\nsystem failure or failed controls.\n\nFailure to properly manage data\neffectively in an accurate, timely and\ncomplete manner may impact its quality\nand reliability and our ability to\nmanage current and emerging risk,\nproduce accurate financial, regulatory\nand operational reporting, detect or\nsurveil potential misconduct or non-\ncompliance with laws, rules and\nregulations, as well as to manage\nchanging business needs, strategic\ndecision-making and day-to-day\noperations. The failure to establish and\nmaintain effective, efficient and\ncontrolled data management could\nadversely impact our ability to develop\nour products and relationships with our\ncustomers, increase regulatory risk and\noperational losses, and damage our\nreputation.\n\nOur operations, businesses and customers\ncould be materially adversely affected\nby the impacts related to climate\nchange.\n\nThere is an increasing concern over the\nrisks of climate change and related\nenvironmental sustainability matters,\nwhich present short-term and an\nincreasing amount of long-term risks to\nus. The physical risks of climate change\ninclude rising average global\ntemperatures, rising sea levels and an\nincrease in the frequency and severity\nof extreme weather events and natural\ndisasters, including floods, wildfires,\nhurricanes and tornados. Such disasters\ncould disrupt our operations or the\noperations of customers or third parties\non which we rely. Such disasters could\nresult in market volatility or\nnegatively impact our customers\u2019 ability\nto repay outstanding loans, result in\nrapid deposit outflows, cause supply\nchain and/or distribution network\ndisruptions, damage collateral or result\nin the deterioration of the value of\ncollateral or insurance shortfalls.\n\nAdditionally, climate change concerns\ncould result in transition risk. Changes\nin consumer preferences or technology\nand additional legislation, regulatory\nand legal requirements, including those\nassociated with the transition to a low-\ncarbon economy, could restrict the scope\nof our existing businesses, limit our\nability to pursue certain business\nactivities and offer certain products\nand services, amplify credit and market\nrisks, negatively impact asset values,\nincrease expenses, including as a result\nof strategic planning and technology and\nmarket changes, and/or otherwise\nadversely impact us, our businesses or\nour customers. Our response to climate\nchange, our climate change strategies,\npolicies, goals, commitments and\ndisclosure, and/or our ability to\nachieve our climate-related goals and\ncommitments (which are subject to risks\nand uncertainties, many of which are\noutside of our control) could result in\nreputational harm as a result of\nnegative public sentiment, regulatory\nscrutiny, litigation and reduced\ninvestor and stakeholder confidence.\n\nOur ability to attract and retain\nqualified employees is critical to our\nsuccess, business prospects and\ncompetitive position.\n\nOur performance and competitive position\nis heavily dependent on the talents and\nefforts of highly skilled individuals.\nCompetition for qualified personnel\nwithin the financial services industry\nand from businesses outside the\nfinancial services industry is intense.\n\nOur competitors include global\ninstitutions and institutions subject to\ndifferent compensation and hiring\nregulations than those imposed on U.S.\ninstitutions and financial institutions.\nAlso, our ability to attract and retain\nemployees could be impacted by the\npandemic, including changing workforce\nconcerns, expectations, practices and\npreferences (including remote work), and\nincreasing labor shortages and\ncompetition for labor, which could\nincrease labor costs.\n\nIn order to attract and retain qualified\npersonnel, we must provide market-level\ncompensation. As a large financial and\nbanking institution, we are and may\nbecome subject to\n                                                                                  \n  23Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nadditional limitations on compensation\npractices, which may or may not affect\nour competitors, by the Federal Reserve,\nthe OCC, the FDIC and other regulators\naround the world.

Risk Factors on page 8.\n                                                                                  \n  LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates                                                 \n                                                                                  \nSubject to the continued publication of\ncertain non-representative London\nInterbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) benchmark\nsettings based on a modified calculation\n(i.e., on a \u201csynthetic\u201d basis), British\nPound Sterling, Euro, Swiss Franc and\nJapanese Yen LIBOR settings and one-week\nand two-month U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR\nsettings ceased or became no longer\nrepresentative of the underlying market\nthe rates seek to measure (i.e., non-\nrepresentative) immediately after\nDecember 31, 2021, and the remaining USD\nLIBOR settings (i.e., overnight, one\nmonth, three month, six month and 12\nmonth) will cease or become non-\nrepresentative immediately after June\n30, 2023. Separately, the Federal\nReserve, the Office of the Comptroller\nof the Currency (OCC) and the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)\nissued supervisory guidance encouraging\nbanks to cease entering into new\ncontracts that use USD LIBOR as a\nreference rate by December 31, 2021\nsubject to certain regulatory-approved\nexceptions (USD LIBOR Guidance).\n\nAs a result, a major transition has been\nand continues to be in progress in the\nglobal financial markets with respect to\nthe replacement of Interbank Offered\nRates (IBORs). This is a complex process\nimpacting a variety of our businesses\nand operations. IBORs have historically\nbeen used in many of the Corporation\u2019s\nproducts and contracts, including\nderivatives, consumer and commercial\nloans, mortgages, floating-rate notes\nand other adjustable-rate products and\nfinancial instruments. In response, the\nCorporation established an enterprise-\nwide IBOR transition program, with\nactive involvement of senior management\nand regular reports to the Management\nRisk Committee (MRC) and Enterprise Risk\nCommittee (ERC). The program continues\nto drive the Corporation's industry and\nregulatory engagement, client and\nfinancial contract changes, internal and\nexternal communications, technology and\noperations modifications, including\nupdates to its operational models,\nsystems and processes, introduction of\nnew products, migration of existing\nclients, and program strategy and\ngovernance.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Corporation\nhas transitioned or otherwise addressed\nIBOR-based products and contracts\nreferencing the rates that ceased or\nbecame non-representative after December\n31, 2021, including LIBOR-linked\ncommercial loans, LIBOR-based\nadjustable-rate consumer mortgages,\nLIBOR-linked derivatives and interdealer\ntrading of certain USD LIBOR and other\ninterest rate swaps, and related hedging\n                                                                                  \n  27Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \narrangements. Additionally, in\naccordance with the USD LIBOR Guidance,\nthe Corporation has ceased entering into\nnew contracts that use USD LIBOR as a\nreference rate, subject to certain\nregulatory-approved exceptions. The\nCorporation launched capabilities and\nservices to support the issuance and\ntrading in products indexed to various\nalternative reference rates (ARRs) and\ndeveloped employee training programs as\nwell as other internal and external\nsources of information on the various\nchallenges and opportunities that the\nreplacement of IBORs has presented and\ncontinues to present. The Corporation\ncontinues to monitor a variety of market\nscenarios as part of its transition\nefforts, including risks associated with\ninsufficient preparation by individual\nmarket participants or the overall\nmarket ecosystem, ability of market\nparticipants to meet regulatory and\nindustry-wide recommended milestones and\naccess and demand by clients and market\nparticipants to liquidity in certain\nproducts, including LIBOR products. With\nrespect to the transition of LIBOR\nproducts referencing USD LIBOR settings\nceasing or becoming non-representative\nas of June 30, 2023, a significant\nmajority of the Corporation\u2019s notional\ncontractual exposure to such LIBOR\ncurrencies, of which the significant\nmajority is derivatives contracts, have\nbeen remediated (i.e., updated to\ninclude fallback provisions to ARRs\nbased on market driven protocols,\nregulatory guidance and industry-\nrecommended fallback provisions and\nrelated mechanisms) and the Corporation\nis continuing to remediate the remaining\nUSD LIBOR exposure. The remaining\nexposure, a majority of which is made up\nof derivatives and commercial loans and\nwhich represents a small minority of\noutstanding USD LIBOR notional\ncontractual exposure of the Corporation,\nwill require active dialogue with\nclients to modify the contracts. For any\nresidual exposures after June 2023 that\ncontinue to have no fallback provisions,\nthe Corporation is assessing and\nplanning to leverage relevant\ncontractual and statutory solutions,\nincluding relevant state legislation and\nany future federal legislation, to\ntransition such exposure to ARRs. The\nCorporation has implemented regulatory,\ntax and accounting changes and continues\nto monitor current and potential impacts\nof the transition, including Internal\nRevenue Service tax regulations and\nguidance and Financial Accounting\nStandards Board guidance. In addition,\nthe Corporation has engaged impacted\nclients in connection with the\ntransition by providing ARRs education\nand the timing of transition events. The\nCorporation is also working actively\nwith global regulators, industry working\ngroups and trade associations.

Changes to Overdraft Services In\nJanuary 2022, the Corporation announced\nchanges to its overdraft services for\nconsumer and small business clients,\nwhich include eliminating non-sufficient\nfunds (NSF) fees beginning in February\n2022 and reducing overdraft fees from\n$35 to $10 beginning in May 2022. Fees\nfrom overdraft services were\napproximately $1 billion in 2021 and\nrecorded in Consumer Banking as service\ncharges in the Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. Due to the policy changes, in\n2022 the Corporation expects a\nsignificant reduction in NSF and\noverdraft fees.\n\nFinancial Highlights\n

The increase in net income was\ndue to improvement in the provision for\ncredit losses and higher revenue,\npartially offset by higher noninterest\nexpense.

Net interest yield on\na fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis\ndecreased 24 basis points (bps) to 1.66\npercent for 2021. The decrease in net\ninterest income was primarily driven by\nlower interest rates and average loan\nbalances, partially offset by higher\naverage balances of debt securities.

The\neffective tax rates for 2021 and 2020\nwere driven by the impact of our\nrecurring tax preference benefits and\npositive income tax adjustments from the\nimpact of U.K. tax law changes discussed\nbelow. Our recurring tax preference\nbenefits primarily consist of tax\ncredits from environmental, social and\ngovernance (ESG) investments in\naffordable housing and renewable energy,\naligning with our responsible growth\nstrategy to address global\nsustainability challenges. Absent these\ntax credits, the impact of the U.K. tax\nlaw changes and other discrete items,\nthe effective tax rates would have been\napproximately 25 percent and 26 percent\nfor 2021 and 2020. In June 2021, the\nU.K. enacted the 2021 Finance Act, which\nincluded an increase in the U.K.\ncorporation income tax rate to 25\npercent from 19 percent. This change is\neffective April 1, 2023 and unfavorably\naffects income tax expense on future\nU.K. earnings. In addition, in July\n2020, the U.K. enacted a repeal of the\nfinal two percent of scheduled decreases\nin the U.K. corporation income tax rate.\nAs a result, in 2021 and 2020, the\nCorporation recorded write-ups of U.K.\nnet deferred tax assets of approximately\n$2.0 billion and $700 million, with\ncorresponding positive income tax\nadjustments. These write-ups were\nreversals of previously recorded write-\ndowns of net deferred tax assets for\nprior changes in the U.K. corporation\nincome tax rate.\n

Non-GAAP\nfinancial measures exclude certain items\nor otherwise include components that\ndiffer from the most directly comparable\nmeasures calculated in accordance with\nGAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are\nprovided as additional useful\ninformation to assess our financial\ncondition, results of operations\n(including period-to-period operating\nperformance) or compliance with\nprospective regulatory requirements.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are\nnot intended as a substitute for GAAP\nfinancial measures and may not be\ndefined or calculated the same way as\nnon-GAAP financial measures used by\nother companies.\n\nWe view net interest income and related\nratios and analyses on an FTE basis,\nwhich when presented on a consolidated\nbasis are non-GAAP financial measures.\nTo derive the FTE basis, net interest\nincome is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt\nincome on an equivalent before-tax basis\nwith a corresponding increase in income\ntax expense. For purposes of this\ncalculation, we use the federal\nstatutory tax rate of 21 percent and a\nrepresentative state tax rate. Net\ninterest yield, which measures the basis\npoints we earn over the cost of funds,\nutilizes net interest income on an FTE\nbasis. We believe that presentation of\nthese items on an FTE basis allows for\ncomparison of amounts from\n\nboth taxable and tax-exempt sources and\nis consistent with industry practices.\n\nWe may present certain key performance\nindicators and ratios excluding certain\nitems (e.g., debit valuation adjustment\n(DVA) gains (losses)) which result in\nnon-GAAP financial measures. We believe\nthat the presentation of measures that\nexclude these items is useful because\nsuch measures provide additional\ninformation to assess the underlying\noperational performance and trends of\nour businesses and to allow better\ncomparison of period-to-period operating\nperformance.\n\nWe also evaluate our business based on\ncertain ratios that utilize tangible\nequity, a non-GAAP financial measure.\nTangible equity represents shareholders\u2019\nequity or common shareholders\u2019 equity\nreduced by goodwill and intangible\nassets (excluding mortgage servicing\nrights (MSRs)), net of related deferred\ntax liabilities (\u201cadjusted\u201d\nshareholders\u2019 equity or common\nshareholders\u2019 equity). These measures\nare used to evaluate our use of equity.\nIn addition, profitability, relationship\nand investment models use both return on\naverage tangible common shareholders\u2019\nequity and return on average tangible\nshareholders\u2019 equity as key measures to\nsupport our overall growth objectives.\nThese ratios are as follows:\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible common\nshareholders\u2019 equity measures our net\nincome applicable to common shareholders\nas a percentage of adjusted average\ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity. The\ntangible common equity ratio represents\nadjusted ending common shareholders\u2019\nequity divided by total tangible assets.\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible\nshareholders\u2019 equity measures our net\nincome as a percentage of adjusted\naverage total shareholders\u2019 equity. The\ntangible equity ratio represents\nadjusted ending shareholders\u2019 equity\ndivided by total tangible assets.\n\n\u25cf Tangible book value per common share\nrepresents adjusted ending common\nshareholders\u2019 equity divided by ending\ncommon shares outstanding.\n\nWe believe ratios utilizing tangible\nequity provide additional useful\ninformation because they present\nmeasures of those assets that can\ngenerate income. Tangible book value per\ncommon share provides additional useful\ninformation about the level of tangible\nassets in relation to outstanding shares\nof common stock.\n\nThe aforementioned supplemental data and\nperformance measures are presented in\nTables 6 and 7.\n\nFor more information on the\nreconciliation of these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to the corresponding\nGAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP\nReconciliations on page 85.\n                                                                                  \n  Key Performance Indicators                                                      \n                                                                                  \nWe present certain key financial and\nnonfinancial performance indicators (key\nperformance indicators) that management\nuses when assessing our consolidated\nand/or segment results.

For more\ninformation on the nature of these\nrisks, see Managing Risk on page 46. The\ncapital allocated to the business\nsegments is referred to as allocated\ncapital. Allocated equity in the\nreporting units is comprised of\nallocated capital plus capital for the\nportion of goodwill and intangibles\nspecifically assigned to the reporting\nunit.

partially offset by the\nimpact of lower average loan balances.\nGlobal Transaction Services revenue\nincreased $177 million in 2021 compared\nto 2020 driven by the benefit of higher\ndeposit balances and treasury service\ncharges, partially offset by lower\ndeposit spreads. Average loans and\nleases decreased 14 percent in 2021\ncompared to 2020 driven by client\npaydowns and lower demand. Average\ndeposits increased 14 percent primarily\ndriven by elevated balances from prior-\nyear inflows on client responses to\nmarket volatility and government\nstimulus measures.

trading\nservices and research services to\ninstitutional clients across fixed-\nincome, credit, currency, commodity and\nequity businesses. Global Markets\nproduct coverage includes securities and\nderivative products in both the primary\nand secondary markets. Global Markets\nprovides market-making, financing,\nsecurities clearing, settlement and\ncustody services globally to our\ninstitutional investor clients in\nsupport of their investing and trading\nactivities. We also work with our\ncommercial and corporate clients to\nprovide risk management products using\ninterest rate, equity, credit, currency\nand commodity derivatives, foreign\nexchange, fixed-income and mortgage-\nrelated products. As a result of our\nmarket-making activities in these\nproducts, we may be required to manage\nrisk in a broad range of financial\nproducts including government\nsecurities, equity and equity-linked\nsecurities, high-grade and high-yield\ncorporate debt securities, syndicated\nloans, MBS, commodities and asset-backed\nsecurities. The economics of certain\ninvestment banking and underwriting\nactivities are shared primarily between\nGlobal Markets and Global Banking under\nan internal revenue-sharing arrangement.\nGlobal Banking originates certain deal-\nrelated transactions with our corporate\nand commercial clients that are executed\nand distributed by Global Markets . For\ninformation on\n\ninvestment banking fees on a\nconsolidated basis, see page 43.\n\nThe following explanations for year-\nover-year changes for Global Markets ,\nincluding those disclosed under Sales\nand Trading Revenue, are the same for\namounts including and excluding net DVA.\nAmounts excluding net DVA are a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure. For more information\non net DVA, see Supplemental Financial\nData on page 31.\n\nNet income for Global Markets decreased\n$695 million to $4.6 billion. Net DVA\nlosses were $54 million compared to\nlosses of $133 million in 2020.\nExcluding net DVA, net income decreased\n$755 million to $4.6 billion. These\ndecreases were primarily driven by\nhigher noninterest expense, partially\noffset by higher revenue and lower\nprovision for credit losses.\n\nRevenue increased $490 million to $19.3\nbillion primarily driven by higher\ninvestment banking fees and sales and\ntrading revenue. Sales and trading\nrevenue increased $172 million, and\nexcluding net DVA, increased $93\nmillion. These increases were driven by\nhigher revenue in Equities, partially\noffset by lower revenue in FICC.\n\nThe provision for credit losses\ndecreased $186 million primarily due to\nan improved macroeconomic outlook.\n\nNoninterest expense increased $1.6\nbillion to $13.0 billion primarily\ndriven by higher revenue-related\nexpenses for sales and trading as well\nas costs associated with processing\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America44                                                               \n                                                                                  \ntransactional card claims related to\nstate unemployment benefits. Average\ntotal assets increased $101.0 billion to\n$786.0 billion. Year-end total assets\nincreased $131.2 billion to $747.8\nbillion. Both increases were primarily\ndue to higher client balances in\nEquities and higher levels of inventory\nand loan growth in FICC. The return on\naverage allocated capital was 12\npercent, down from 15 percent,\nreflecting lower net income and an\nincrease in allocated capital. For more\ninformation on capital allocated to the\nbusiness segments, see Business Segment\nOperations on page 36. Sales and Trading\nRevenue Sales and trading revenue\nincludes unrealized and realized gains\nand losses on trading and other assets\nwhich are included in market making and\nsimilar activities, net interest income,\nand fees primarily from commissions on\nequity securities. Sales and trading\nrevenue is segregated into fixed-income\n(government debt obligations, investment\nand non-investment grade corporate debt\nobligations, commercial MBS, residential\nmortgage-backed securities,\ncollateralized loan obligations,\ninterest rate and credit derivative\ncontracts), currencies (interest rate\nand foreign exchange contracts),\ncommodities (primarily futures,\nforwards, swaps and options) and\nequities (equity-linked derivatives and\ncash equity activity).

Sound risk management\nenables us to serve our customers and\ndeliver for our shareholders. If not\nmanaged well, risk can result in\nfinancial loss, regulatory sanctions and\npenalties, and damage to our reputation,\neach of which may adversely impact our\nability to execute our business\nstrategies. We take a comprehensive\napproach to risk management with a\ndefined Risk Framework and an\narticulated Risk Appetite Statement,\nwhich are approved annually by the ERC\nand the Board.\n\nThe seven key types of risk faced by the\nCorporation are strategic, credit,\nmarket, liquidity, compliance,\noperational and reputational.\n\n\u25cf Strategic risk is the risk to current\nor projected financial condition arising\nfrom incorrect assumptions about\nexternal or internal factors,\ninappropriate business plans,\nineffective business strategy execution\nor failure to respond in a timely manner\nto changes in the regulatory,\nmacroeconomic or competitive\nenvironments in the geographic locations\nin which we operate.\n\n\u25cf Credit risk is the risk of loss\narising from the inability or failure of\na borrower or counterparty to meet its\nobligations.\n\n\u25cf Market risk is the risk that changes\nin market conditions adversely impact\nthe value of assets or liabilities or\notherwise negatively impact earnings.\nMarket risk is composed of price risk\nand interest rate risk.\n\n\u25cf Liquidity risk is the inability to\nmeet expected or unexpected cash flow\nand collateral needs while continuing to\nsupport our businesses and customers\nunder a range of economic conditions.\n\n\u25cf Compliance risk is the risk of legal\nor regulatory sanctions, material\nfinancial loss or damage to the\nreputation of the Corporation arising\nfrom the failure of the Corporation to\ncomply with the requirements of\napplicable laws, rules and regulations\nand our internal policies and\nprocedures.\n\n\u25cf Operational risk is the risk of loss\nresulting from inadequate or failed\ninternal processes or systems, people or\nexternal events.\n\n\u25cf Reputational risk is the risk that\nnegative perception of the Corporation\nmay adversely impact profitability or\noperations.\n\nThe following sections address in more\ndetail the specific procedures, measures\nand analyses of the major categories of\nrisk. This discussion of managing risk\nfocuses on the current\n\nRisk Framework that, as part of its\nannual review process, was approved by\nthe ERC and the Board.\n\nAs set forth in our Risk Framework, a\nculture of managing risk well is\nfundamental to our values and our\npurpose, and how we drive Responsible\nGrowth. It requires us to focus on risk\nin all activities and encourages the\nnecessary mindset and behavior to enable\neffective risk management and promote\nsound risk-taking within our risk\nappetite. Sustaining a culture of\nmanaging risk well throughout the\norganization is critical to the success\nof the Corporation and is a clear\nexpectation of our executive management\nteam and the Board.\n\nOur Risk Framework serves as the\nfoundation for the consistent and\neffective management of risks facing the\nCorporation. The Risk Framework sets\nforth roles and responsibilities for the\nmanagement of risk and provides a\nblueprint for how the Board, through\ndelegation of authority to committees\nand executive officers, establishes risk\nappetite and associated limits for our\nactivities.\n\nExecutive management assesses, with\nBoard oversight, the risk-adjusted\nreturns of each business. Management\nreviews and approves the strategic and\nfinancial operating plans, as well as\nthe capital plan and Risk Appetite\nStatement, and recommends them annually\nto the Board for approval. Our strategic\nplan takes into consideration return\nobjectives and financial resources,\nwhich must align with risk capacity and\nrisk appetite. Management sets financial\nobjectives for each business by\nallocating capital and setting a target\nfor return on capital for each business.\nCapital allocations and operating limits\nare regularly evaluated as part of our\noverall governance processes as the\nbusinesses and the economic environment\nin which we operate continue to evolve.\nFor more information regarding capital\nallocations, see Business Segment\nOperations on page 36.\n\nThe Corporation\u2019s risk appetite\nindicates the amount of capital,\nearnings or liquidity we are willing to\nput at risk to achieve our strategic\nobjectives and business plans,\nconsistent with applicable regulatory\nrequirements. Our risk appetite provides\na common set of measures for senior\nmanagement and the Board to clearly\nindicate the level of risk we are\nwilling to take in alignment with our\nstrategic and capital plans and ensure\nthat the Corporation\u2019s risk profile\nremains aligned with our risk appetite.\nOur risk appetite is formally\narticulated in the Risk Appetite\nStatement, which includes both\nqualitative components and quantitative\nlimits.\n\nOur overall capacity to take risk is\nlimited; therefore, we prioritize the\nrisks we take in order to maintain a\nstrong and flexible financial position\nso we can withstand challenging economic\nconditions and take advantage of organic\ngrowth opportunities. Therefore, we set\nobjectives and targets for capital and\nliquidity that are intended to permit us\nto continue to operate in a safe and\nsound manner, including during periods\nof stress.\n\nOur lines of business operate with risk\nlimits (which may include credit, market\nand/or operational limits, as\napplicable) that align with the\nCorporation\u2019s risk appetite. Executive\nmanagement is responsible for tracking\nand reporting performance measurements\nas well as any exceptions to guidelines\nor limits. The Board, and its committees\nwhen appropriate, oversee financial\nperformance, execution of the strategic\nand financial operating plans, adherence\nto risk appetite limits and the adequacy\nof internal controls.\n\nFor a more detailed discussion of our\nrisk management activities, see the\ndiscussion below and pages 49 through\n82.\n\nFor more information about the\nCorporation's risks related to the\npandemic, see Item 1A.

Such delegations may authorize\ncertain decision-making and approval\n\nfunctions, which may be evidenced in\ndocuments such as committee charters,\njob descriptions, meeting minutes and\nresolutions.\n\nThe chart below illustrates the\ninterrelationship among the Board, Board\ncommittees and management committees\nthat have the majority of risk oversight\nresponsibilities for the Corporation.\n                                                                                  \n  Board of Directors and Board Committees                                         \n                                                                                  \nThe Board is composed of 16 directors,\nall but one of whom are independent. The\nBoard authorizes management to maintain\nan effective Risk Framework and oversees\ncompliance with safe and sound banking\npractices. In addition, the Board or its\ncommittees conduct inquiries of, and\nreceive reports from management on,\nrisk-related matters to assess scope or\nresource limitations that could impede\nthe ability of Global Risk Management\n(GRM) and/or Corporate Audit to execute\nits responsibilities. The Board\ncommittees discussed below have the\nprincipal responsibility for enterprise-\nwide oversight of our risk management\nactivities. Through these activities,\nthe Board and applicable committees are\nprovided with information on our risk\nprofile and oversee executive management\naddressing key risks we face. Other\nBoard committees, as described below,\nprovide additional oversight of specific\nrisks.\n\nEach of the committees shown on the\nabove chart regularly reports to the\nBoard on risk-related matters within the\ncommittee\u2019s responsibilities, which is\nintended to collectively provide the\nBoard with integrated insight about our\nmanagement of enterprise-wide risks.\n                                                                                  \n  Audit Committee                                                                 \n                                                                                  \nThe Audit Committee oversees the\nqualifications, performance and\nindependence of the Independent\nRegistered Public Accounting Firm, the\nperformance of our corporate audit\nfunction, the integrity of our\nconsolidated financial statements, our\ncompliance with legal and regulatory\nrequirements, and makes inquiries of\nmanagement or the Chief Audit Executive\n(CAE) to determine whether there are\nscope or resource limitations that\nimpede the ability of Corporate Audit to\nexecute its responsibilities. The Audit\nCommittee is also responsible for\noverseeing compliance risks pursuant to\nthe New York Stock Exchange listing\nstandards.\n                                                                                  \n  Enterprise Risk Committee                                                       \n                                                                                  \nThe ERC has primary responsibility for\noversight of the Risk Framework and key\nrisks we face and of the Corporation\u2019s\n\noverall risk appetite.

Corporate Audit\nincludes Credit Review, which provides\nan independent assessment of credit\nlending decisions and the effectiveness\nof credit processes across the\nCorporation\u2019s credit platform through\nexaminations and monitoring.\n                                                                                  \n   Risk Management Processes                                                      \n                                                                                  \nThe Risk Framework requires that strong\nrisk management practices are integrated\nin key strategic, capital and financial\nplanning processes and in day-to-day\nbusiness processes across the\nCorporation, thereby ensuring risks are\nappropriately\n\nconsidered, evaluated and responded to\nin a timely manner. We employ an\neffective risk management process,\nreferred to as Identify, Measure,\nMonitor and Control, as part of our\ndaily activities.\n\nIdentify \u2013 To be effectively managed,\nrisks must be proactively identified and\nwell understood. Proper risk\nidentification focuses on recognizing\nand understanding key risks inherent in\nour business activities or key risks\nthat may arise from external factors.\nEach employee is expected to identify\nand escalate risks promptly. Risk\nidentification is an ongoing process\nthat incorporates input from FLUs and\ncontrol functions. It is designed to be\nforward-looking and to capture relevant\nrisk factors across all of our lines of\nbusiness.\n\nMeasure \u2013 Once a risk is identified, it\nmust be prioritized and accurately\nmeasured through a systematic process\nincluding quantitative and qualitative\ncomponents. Risk is measured at various\nlevels, including, but not limited to,\nrisk type, FLU and legal entity, and\nalso on an aggregate basis. This risk\nmeasurement process helps to capture\nchanges in our risk profile due to\nchanges in strategic direction,\nconcentrations, portfolio quality and\nthe overall economic environment. Senior\nmanagement considers how risk exposures\nmight evolve under a variety of stress\nscenarios.\n\nMonitor \u2013 We monitor risk levels\nregularly to track adherence to risk\nappetite, policies and standards. We\nalso regularly update risk assessments\nand review risk exposures. Through our\nmonitoring, we know our level of risk\nrelative to limits and can take action\nin a timely manner. We also know when\nrisk limits are breached and have\nprocesses to appropriately report and\nescalate exceptions. This includes\ntimely requests for approval to managers\nand alerts to executive management,\nmanagement-level committees or the Board\n(directly or through an appropriate\ncommittee).\n\nControl \u2013 We establish and communicate\nrisk limits and controls through\npolicies, standards, procedures and\nprocesses. The limits and controls can\nbe adjusted by the Board or management\nwhen conditions or risk tolerances\nwarrant. These limits may be absolute\n(e.g., loan amount, trading volume,\noperational loss) or relative (e.g.,\npercentage of loan book in higher-risk\ncategories). Our FLUs are held\naccountable for performing within the\nestablished limits.\n\nThe formal processes used to manage risk\nrepresent a part of our overall risk\nmanagement process. We instill a strong\nand comprehensive culture of managing\nrisk well through communications,\ntraining, policies, procedures and\norganizational roles and\nresponsibilities. Establishing a culture\nreflective of our purpose to help make\nour customers\u2019 financial lives better\nand delivering on Responsible Growth is\nalso critical to effective risk\nmanagement. We are committed to the\nhighest principles of ethical and\nprofessional conduct. Conduct risk is\nthe risk of improper actions, behaviors\nor practices that are illegal, unethical\nand/or contrary to our core values that\ncould result in harm to the Corporation,\nour shareholders or our customers,\ndamage the integrity of the financial\nmarkets, or negatively impact our\nreputation. We have established\nprotocols and structures so that conduct\nrisk is governed and reported across the\nCorporation appropriately. All employees\nare held accountable for adhering to the\nCode of Conduct, operating within our\nrisk appetite and managing risk in their\ndaily business activities. In addition,\nour performance management and\ncompensation practices encourage\nresponsible risk-taking that is\nconsistent with our Risk Framework and\nrisk appetite.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America48                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Corporation-wide Stress Testing                                                 \n                                                                                  \nIntegral to our Capital Planning,\nFinancial Planning and Strategic\nPlanning processes, we conduct capital\nscenario management and stress\nforecasting on a periodic basis to\nbetter understand balance sheet,\nearnings and capital sensitivities to\ncertain economic and business scenarios,\nincluding economic and market conditions\nthat are more severe than anticipated.\nThese stress forecasts provide an\nunderstanding of the potential impacts\nfrom our risk profile on the balance\nsheet, earnings and capital, and serve\nas a key component of our capital and\nrisk management practices. The intent of\nstress testing is to develop a\ncomprehensive understanding of potential\nimpacts of on- and off-balance sheet\nrisks at the Corporation and certain\nsubsidiaries and how they impact\nfinancial resiliency, which provides\nconfidence to management, regulators and\nour investors.\n                                                                                  \n  Contingency Planning                                                            \n                                                                                  \nWe have developed and maintain\ncontingency plans that are designed to\nprepare us in advance to respond in the\nevent of potential adverse economic,\nfinancial or market stress. These\ncontingency plans include our Capital\nContingency Plan and Financial\nContingency and Recovery Plan, which\nprovide monitoring, escalation, actions\nand routines designed to enable us to\nincrease capital, access funding sources\nand reduce risk through consideration of\npotential options that include asset\nsales, business sales, capital or debt\nissuances, or other de-risking\nstrategies.

This risk results\nfrom incorrect assumptions about\nexternal or internal factors,\ninappropriate business plans,\nineffective business strategy execution,\nor failure to respond in a timely manner\nto changes in the regulatory,\nmacroeconomic or competitive\nenvironments in the geographic locations\nin which we operate, such as competitor\nactions, changing customer preferences,\nproduct obsolescence and technology\ndevelopments. Our strategic plan is\nconsistent with our risk appetite,\ncapital plan and liquidity requirements,\nand specifically addresses strategic\nrisks.\n\nOn an annual basis, the Board reviews\nand approves the strategic plan, capital\nplan, financial operating plan and Risk\nAppetite Statement. With oversight by\nthe Board, executive management directs\nthe lines of business to execute our\nstrategic plan consistent with our core\noperating principles and risk appetite.\nThe executive management team monitors\nbusiness performance throughout the year\nand provides the Board with regular\nprogress reports on whether strategic\nobjectives and timelines are being met,\nincluding reports on strategic risks and\nif additional or alternative actions\nneed to be considered or implemented.\nThe regular executive reviews focus on\nassessing forecasted earnings and\nreturns on capital, the current risk\nprofile, current capital and liquidity\nrequirements, staffing levels and\nchanges required to support the\nstrategic plan, stress testing results,\nand other qualitative factors such as\nmarket growth rates and peer analysis.\n\nSignificant strategic actions, such as\ncapital actions, material acquisitions\nor divestitures, and resolution plans\nare reviewed and approved by the Board.\nAt the business level, processes are in\nplace to discuss the strategic risk\nimplications of new, expanded or\nmodified businesses, products or\nservices\n\nand other strategic initiatives, and to\nprovide formal review and approval where\nrequired. With oversight by the Board\nand the ERC, executive management\nperforms similar analyses throughout the\nyear, and evaluates changes to the\nfinancial forecast or the risk, capital\nor liquidity positions as deemed\nappropriate to balance and optimize\nachieving the targeted risk appetite,\nshareholder returns and maintaining the\ntargeted financial strength. Proprietary\nmodels are used to measure the capital\nrequirements for credit, country,\nmarket, operational and strategic risks.\nThe allocated capital assigned to each\nbusiness is based on its unique risk\nprofile. With oversight by the Board,\nexecutive management assesses the risk-\nadjusted returns of each business in\napproving strategic and financial\noperating plans. The businesses use\nallocated capital to define business\nstrategies, and price products and\ntransactions.\n                                                                                  \n   Capital Management                                                             \n                                                                                  \nThe Corporation manages its capital\nposition so that its capital is more\nthan adequate to support its business\nactivities and aligns with risk, risk\nappetite and strategic planning.\nAdditionally, we seek to maintain safety\nand soundness at all times, even under\nadverse scenarios, take advantage of\norganic growth opportunities, meet\nobligations to creditors and\ncounterparties, maintain ready access to\nfinancial markets, continue to serve as\na credit intermediary, remain a source\nof strength for our subsidiaries, and\nsatisfy current and future regulatory\ncapital requirements. Capital management\nis integrated into our risk and\ngovernance processes, as capital is a\nkey consideration in the development of\nour strategic plan, risk appetite and\nrisk limits.\n\nWe conduct an Internal Capital Adequacy\nAssessment Process (ICAAP) on a periodic\nbasis. The ICAAP is a forward-looking\nassessment of our projected capital\nneeds and resources, incorporating\nearnings, balance sheet and risk\nforecasts under baseline and adverse\neconomic and market conditions. We\nutilize periodic stress tests to assess\nthe potential impacts to our balance\nsheet, earnings, regulatory capital and\nliquidity under a variety of stress\nscenarios. We perform qualitative risk\nassessments to identify and assess\nmaterial risks not fully captured in our\nforecasts or stress tests. We assess the\npotential capital impacts of proposed\nchanges to regulatory capital\nrequirements. Management assesses ICAAP\nresults and provides documented\nquarterly assessments of the adequacy of\nour capital guidelines and capital\nposition to the Board or its committees.\n\nWe periodically review capital allocated\nto our businesses and allocate capital\nannually during the strategic and\ncapital planning processes.

Based on the\nresults of our 2021 CCAR capital plan\nand related supervisory stress tests, we\nare subject to a 2.5 percent stress\ncapital buffer (SCB), unchanged from the\nprior level, effective October 1, 2021\nthrough September 30, 2022. Our Common\nequity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio under\nthe Standardized approach must remain\nabove 9.5 percent during this period in\norder to avoid restrictions on capital\ndistributions and discretionary bonus\npayments.\n\nDue to uncertainty resulting from the\npandemic, the Federal Reserve imposed\nvarious restrictions on share repurchase\nprograms and dividends during 2020 and\nthe first half of 2021.\n                                                                                  \n  49Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nIn conjunction with its release of 2021\nCCAR supervisory stress test results,\nthe Federal Reserve announced those\nrestrictions would end as of July 1,\n2021 for large banks, including the\nCorporation, and large banks would be\nsubject to the normal restrictions under\nthe Federal Reserve's SCB framework. On\nOctober 20, 2021, we announced that the\nBoard renewed the Corporation\u2019s $25\nbillion common stock repurchase program\npreviously announced in April 2021. The\nBoard\u2019s authorization replaced the\nprevious program. As with the April\nauthorization, the Board also authorized\ncommon stock repurchases to offset\nshares awarded under the Corporation\u2019s\nequity-based compensation plans.\nPursuant to the Board\u2019s authorization,\nduring 2021 we repurchased $25.1 billion\nof common stock, including repurchases\nto offset shares awarded under equity-\nbased compensation plans.\n\nThe timing and amount of common stock\nrepurchases made pursuant to our stock\nrepurchase program are subject to\nvarious factors, including the\nCorporation\u2019s capital position,\nliquidity, financial performance and\nalternative uses of capital, stock\ntrading price, regulatory requirements\nand general market conditions, and may\nbe suspended at any time. Such\nrepurchases may be effected through open\nmarket purchases or privately negotiated\ntransactions, including repurchase plans\nthat satisfy the conditions of Rule\n10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended (Exchange Act).\n                                                                                  \n  Regulatory Capital                                                              \n                                                                                  \nAs a financial services holding company,\nwe are subject to regulatory capital\nrules, including Basel 3, issued by U.S.\nbanking regulators. Basel 3 established\nminimum capital ratios and buffer\nrequirements and outlined two methods of\ncalculating risk-weighted assets (RWA),\nthe Standardized approach and the\nAdvanced approaches. The Standardized\napproach relies primarily on supervisory\nrisk weights based on exposure type, and\nthe Advanced approaches determine risk\nweights based on internal models.\n\nThe Corporation's depository institution\nsubsidiaries are also subject to the\nPrompt Corrective Action (PCA)\nframework. The Corporation and its\nprimary affiliated banking entity, BANA,\nare Advanced approaches institutions\nunder Basel 3 and are required to report\nregulatory risk-based capital ratios and\nRWA under both the Standardized and\nAdvanced approaches. The approach that\nyields the lower ratio is used to assess\ncapital adequacy, including under the\nPCA framework. As of December 31, 2021,\nthe CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total\ncapital ratios for the Corporation were\nlower under the Standardized approach.\n                                                                                  \n  Minimum Capital Requirements                                                    \n                                                                                  \nIn order to avoid restrictions on\ncapital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments, the Corporation must\nmeet risk-based capital ratio\nrequirements that include a capital\n\nconservation buffer of 2.5 percent\n(under the Advanced approaches only), an\nSCB (under the Standardized approach\nonly), plus any applicable\ncountercyclical capital buffer and a\nglobal systemically important bank\n(G-SIB) surcharge. Including a\nregulatory minimum requirement of 4.5\npercent, an SCB of 2.5 percent and a\nG-SIB surcharge of 2.5 percent, the\nCorporation's CET1 capital ratio must be\na minimum of 9.5 percent under both the\nStandardized and Advanced approaches.\n\nThe Corporation is required to calculate\nits G-SIB surcharge on an annual basis\nunder two methods and is subject to the\nhigher of the resulting two surcharges.\nMethod 1 is consistent with the approach\nprescribed by the Basel Committee\u2019s\nassessment methodology and is calculated\nusing specified indicators of systemic\nimportance. Method 2 modifies the Method\n1 approach by, among other factors,\nincluding a measure of the Corporation\u2019s\nreliance on short-term wholesale\nfunding. The Corporation\u2019s G-SIB\nsurcharge, which is higher under Method\n2, is expected to increase to 3.0\npercent on January 1, 2024 unless its\nsurcharge calculated as of December 31,\n2022 is lower than 3.0 percent.\n\nThe current SCB of 2.5 percent, which\nremains effective from October 1, 2021\nthrough September 30, 2022, could change\nbased on results of the 2022 CCAR\ncapital plan and related supervisory\nstress tests to be submitted in the\nfirst half of 2022.\n\nThe Corporation is also required to\nmaintain a minimum supplementary\nleverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus\na leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in\norder to avoid certain restrictions on\ncapital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments. Our insured depository\ninstitution subsidiaries are required to\nmaintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be\nconsidered well capitalized under the\nPCA framework. The numerator of the SLR\nis quarter-end Basel 3 Tier 1 capital.\nThe denominator is total leverage\nexposure based on the daily average of\nthe sum of on-balance sheet exposures\nless permitted deductions, and\napplicable temporary exclusions, as well\nas the simple average of certain off-\nbalance sheet exposures, as of the end\nof each month in a quarter. The\ntemporary exclusions expired after March\n31, 2021 and were not applicable for\nDecember 31, 2021.

capital rule that allows a\nfive-year transition period related to\nthe adoption of the current expected\ncredit losses (CECL) accounting\nstandard.\n\n(2) The capital conservation buffer and\nG-SIB surcharge were 2.5 percent at both\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020. At both\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, the\nCorporation's SCB of 2.5 percent was\napplied in place of the capital\nconservation buffer under the\nStandardized approach. The\ncountercyclical capital buffer for both\nperiods was zero. The CET1 capital\nregulatory minimum is the sum of the\nCET1 capital ratio minimum of 4.5\npercent, our G-SIB surcharge of 2.5\npercent and our SCB or the capital\nconservation buffer, as applicable, of\n2.5 percent. The SLR regulatory minimum\nincludes a leverage buffer of 2.0\npercent.\n\n(3) Total capital under the Advanced\napproaches differs from the Standardized\napproach due to differences in the\namount permitted in Tier 2 capital\nrelated to the qualifying allowance for\ncredit losses.\n\n(4) Reflects total average assets\nadjusted for certain Tier 1 capital\ndeductions.\n\n(5) Supplementary leverage exposure at\nDecember 31, 2020 reflects the temporary\nexclusion of U.S. Treasury securities\nand deposits at Federal Reserve Banks.\nThe temporary relief expired after March\n31, 2021 and is not reflected in\nsupplementary leverage exposure at\nDecember 31, 2021.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, CET1 capital was\n$171.8 billion, a decrease of $4.9\nbillion from December 31, 2020, driven\nby common stock repurchases, dividends\nand decreases in net unrealized gains on\navailable-for-sale (AFS) debt securities\nincluded in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (OCI), partially\noffset by earnings. Tier 1 capital\ndecreased $3.6 billion primarily driven\nby the same factors as CET1 capital,\npartially offset by non-cumulative\nperpetual preferred stock issuances.\nTotal capital under the Standardized\napproach decreased $10.3 billion\nprimarily due to the same factors\ndriving the decrease in CET1 capital,\nand a decrease in the adjusted allowance\nfor credit losses included in Tier 2\ncapital. RWA under the\n\nStandardized approach, which yielded the\nlower CET1 capital\n\nratio at December 31, 2021, increased\n$138.1 billion during 2021 to $1,618\nbillion primarily due to loan growth in\nGlobal Banking, strong client activity\nin Global Markets and an increase in\ndebt securities resulting from the\ndeployment of cash received from deposit\ninflows. Supplementary leverage exposure\nat December 31, 2021 increased $818.1\nbillion during 2021 primarily due to the\nexpiration of the Federal Reserve\u2019s\ntemporary relief to exclude U.S.\nTreasury

The TLAC supplementary\nleverage exposure regulatory minimum consists of 7.5 percent plus a 2.0 percent\nTLAC leverage buffer. The TLAC RWA and leverage buffers must be comprised solely\nof CET1 capital and Tier 1 capital, respectively.\n\n(3) The long-term debt RWA regulatory minimum is comprised of 6.0 percent plus an\nadditional 2.5 percent requirement based on the Corporation\u2019s Method 2 G-SIB\nsurcharge. The long-term debt leverage exposure regulatory minimum is 4.5 percent.\n\n(4) The approach that yields the higher RWA is used to calculate TLAC and long-\nterm debt ratios, which was the Standardized approach as of December 31, 2021 and\n2020.\n\n(5) Supplementary leverage exposure at December 31, 2020 reflects the temporary\nexclusion of U.S. Treasury Securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks.

These\ntemporary changes to the SLR allowed the\nexclusion of on-balance sheet amounts of\nU.S. Treasury securities and deposits at\nFederal Reserve Banks from the\ncalculation of supplementary leverage\nexposure. While the temporary relief\nautomatically applied to the\nCorporation, the Corporation\u2019s lead\ndepository institution, Bank of America,\nN.A., did not opt to take advantage of\nthe SLR relief offered by the OCC. At\nDecember 31, 2021, the Corporation\u2019s SLR\nwas 5.5 percent, which exceeds the 5.0\npercent minimum required by the Federal\nReserve.\n                                                                                  \n  Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation                                    \n                                                                                  \nThe Corporation\u2019s principal U.S. broker-\ndealer subsidiaries are BofA Securities,\nInc.

The Corporation's\nprincipal European broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries are Merrill Lynch\nInternational (MLI) and BofA Securities\nEurope SA (BofASE).\n\nThe U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are\nsubject to the net capital requirements\nof Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act.\nBofAS computes its minimum capital\nrequirements as an alternative net\ncapital broker-dealer under Rule\n15c3-1e, and MLPCC and MLPF&S compute\ntheir minimum capital requirements in\naccordance with the alternative standard\nunder Rule 15c3-1. BofAS and MLPCC are\nalso registered as futures commission\nmerchants and are subject to Commodity\nFutures Trading Commission (CFTC)\nRegulation 1.17. The U.S. broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries are also registered with\nthe Financial Industry Regulatory\nAuthority, Inc. (FINRA). Pursuant to\nFINRA Rule 4110, FINRA may impose higher\nnet capital requirements than Rule\n15c3-1 under the Exchange Act with\nrespect to each of the broker-dealers.\n\nBofAS provides institutional services,\nand in accordance with the alternative\nnet capital requirements, is required to\nmaintain tentative net capital in excess\nof $5.0 billion and net capital in\nexcess of the greater of $1.0 billion or\na certain percentage of its reserve\nrequirement in addition to a certain\npercentage of securities-based swap risk\nmargin. BofAS must also notify the SEC\nin the event its tentative net capital\nis less than $6.0 billion. BofAS is also\nrequired to hold a certain percentage of\nits\n\ncustomers' and affiliates' risk-based\nmargin in order to meet its CFTC minimum\nnet capital requirement. At December 31,\n2021, BofAS had tentative net capital of\n$19.4 billion. BofAS also had regulatory\nnet capital of $16.6 billion, which\nexceeded the minimum requirement of $3.5\nbillion.\n\nMLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary\nof BofAS and provides clearing and\nsettlement services as well as prime\nbrokerage and arranged financing\nservices for institutional clients. At\nDecember 31, 2021, MLPCC\u2019s regulatory\nnet capital of $6.2 billion exceeded the\nminimum requirement of $1.5 billion.\n\nMLPF&S provides retail services. At\nDecember 31, 2021, MLPF&S' regulatory\nnet capital was $5.7 billion, which\nexceeded the minimum requirement of $199\nmillion.\n\nOur European broker-dealers are\nregulated by non-U.S. regulators.

To achieve\nthat objective, we analyze and monitor\nour liquidity risk under expected and\nstressed conditions, maintain liquidity\nand access to diverse funding sources,\nincluding our stable deposit base, and\nseek to align liquidity-related\nincentives and risks. These liquidity\nrisk management practices have allowed\nus to effectively manage the market\nfluctuation from the pandemic. For more\ninformation on the risks of the\npandemic, see Part I. Item 1A.

We define liquidity\nas readily available assets, limited to\ncash and high-quality, liquid,\nunencumbered securities that we can use\nto meet our contractual and contingent\nfinancial obligations as they arise. We\nmanage our liquidity position through\nline-of-business and ALM activities, as\nwell as through our legal entity funding\nstrategy, on both a forward and current\n(including intraday) basis under both\nexpected and stressed conditions. We\nbelieve that a centralized approach to\nfunding and liquidity management\nenhances our ability to monitor\nliquidity requirements, maximizes access\nto funding sources, minimizes borrowing\ncosts and facilitates timely responses\nto liquidity events. The Board approves\nour liquidity risk policy and the\nFinancial Contingency and Recovery Plan.\nThe ERC establishes our liquidity risk\ntolerance levels. The MRC is responsible\nfor overseeing liquidity risks and\ndirecting management to maintain\nexposures within the established\ntolerance levels. The MRC reviews and\nmonitors our liquidity position and\nstress testing results, approves certain\nliquidity risk limits and reviews the\nimpact of strategic decisions on our\nliquidity. For more information, see\nManaging Risk on page 46. Under this\ngovernance framework, we developed\ncertain funding and liquidity risk\nmanagement practices which include:\nmaintaining liquidity at the parent\ncompany and selected subsidiaries,\nincluding our bank subsidiaries and\nother regulated entities; determining\nwhat amounts of liquidity are\nappropriate for these entities based on\nanalysis of debt maturities and other\npotential cash outflows, including those\nthat we may experience during stressed\nmarket conditions; diversifying funding\nsources, considering our asset profile\nand legal entity structure; and\nperforming contingency planning. NB\nHoldings Corporation The parent company,\nwhich is a separate and distinct legal\nentity from our bank and nonbank\nsubsidiaries, has an intercompany\narrangement with our wholly-owned\nholding company subsidiary, NB Holdings\nCorporation (NB Holdings). We have\ntransferred, and agreed to transfer,\nadditional parent company assets not\nrequired to satisfy anticipated near-\nterm expenditures to NB Holdings. The\nparent company is expected to continue\nto have access to the same flow of\ndividends, interest and other amounts of\ncash necessary to service its debt, pay\ndividends and perform other obligations\nas it would have had it not entered into\nthese arrangements and transferred any\nassets. These arrangements support our\npreferred single point of entry\nresolution strategy, under which only\nthe parent company would be resolved\nunder the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In\nconsideration for the transfer of\nassets, NB Holdings issued a\nsubordinated note to the parent company\nin a principal amount equal to the value\nof the transferred assets. The aggregate\nprincipal amount of the note will\nincrease by the amount of any future\nasset transfers. NB Holdings also\nprovided the parent company with a\ncommitted line of credit that allows the\nparent company to draw funds necessary\nto service near-term cash needs. These\narrangements support our preferred\nsingle point of entry resolution\nstrategy, under which only the parent\ncompany would be resolved under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code. These arrangements\ninclude provisions to terminate the line\nof credit, forgive the subordinated note\nand require the parent company to\ntransfer its remaining financial assets\nto NB Holdings if our projected\nliquidity resources deteriorate so\nseverely that resolution of the parent\ncompany becomes imminent.\n\nGlobal Liquidity Sources and Other\nUnencumbered Assets We maintain\nliquidity available to the Corporation,\nincluding the parent company and\nselected subsidiaries, in the form of\ncash and high-quality, liquid,\nunencumbered securities. Our liquidity\nbuffer, referred to as Global Liquidity\nSources (GLS), is comprised of assets\nthat are readily available to the parent\ncompany and selected subsidiaries,\nincluding holding company, bank and\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries, even during\nstressed market conditions. Our cash is\nprimarily on deposit with the Federal\nReserve Bank and, to a lesser extent,\ncentral banks outside of the U.S. We\nlimit the composition of high-quality,\nliquid, unencumbered securities to U.S.\ngovernment securities, U.S. agency\nsecurities, U.S. agency MBS and other\ninvestment-grade securities, and a\nselect group of non-U.S. government\nsecurities. We can obtain cash for these\nsecurities, even in stressed conditions,\nthrough repurchase agreements or\noutright sales. We hold our GLS in legal\nentities that allow us to meet the\nliquidity requirements of our global\nbusinesses, and we consider the impact\nof potential regulatory, tax, legal and\nother restrictions that could limit the\ntransferability of funds among entities.\nTable 15 presents average GLS for the\nthree months ended December 31, 2021 and\n2020.\n                                                                                  \n                                                   Three Months Ended             \n  Table 15                 Average Global                 December 31             \n  (Dollars in billions)    Liquidity Sources                     2021       2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Bank entities                                 $               1,006    $   773  \n  Nonbank and other                                               152        170  \n  entities(1)                                                                     \n  Total Average Global                          $               1,158    $   943  \n  Liquidity Sources                                                               \n                                                                                  \n(1) Nonbank includes Parent, NB Holdings\nand other regulated entities. Our bank\nsubsidiaries\u2019 liquidity is primarily\ndriven by deposit and lending activity,\nas well as securities valuation and net\ndebt activity. Bank subsidiaries can\nalso generate incremental liquidity by\npledging a range of unencumbered loans\nand securities to certain FHLBs and the\nFederal Reserve Discount Window. The\ncash we could have obtained by borrowing\nagainst this pool of specifically-\nidentified eligible assets was $322\nbillion and $306 billion at December 31,\n2021 and 2020. We have established\noperational procedures to enable us to\nborrow against these assets, including\nregularly monitoring our total pool of\neligible loans and securities\ncollateral. Eligibility is defined in\nguidelines from the FHLBs and the\nFederal Reserve and is subject to change\nat their discretion. Due to regulatory\nrestrictions, liquidity generated by the\nbank subsidiaries can generally be used\nonly to fund obligations within the bank\nsubsidiaries, and transfers to the\nparent company or nonbank subsidiaries\nmay be subject to prior regulatory\napproval. Liquidity is also held in\nnonbank entities, including the Parent,\nNB Holdings and other regulated\nentities. Parent company and NB Holdings\nliquidity is typically in the form of\ncash deposited at BANA, which is\nexcluded from the liquidity at bank\nsubsidiaries, and high-quality, liquid,\nunencumbered securities. Liquidity held\nin other regulated entities, comprised\nprimarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries,\nis primarily available to meet the\nobligations of that entity, and\ntransfers to the parent company or to\nany other subsidiary may be subject to\nprior regulatory approval due to\nregulatory restrictions and minimum\nrequirements. Our other regulated\nentities also hold unencumbered\ninvestment-grade securities and equities\nthat we believe could be used to\ngenerate additional liquidity.\n                                                                                  \n  55Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nTable 16 presents the composition of\naverage GLS for the three months ended\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020.\n                                                                                  \n  Table 16               Average Global            Three Months Ended             \n  (Dollars in            Liquidity Sources                December 31             \n  billions)              Composition                             2021       2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Cash on deposit                               $                 259    $   322  \n  U.S. Treasury                                                   278        141  \n  securities                                                                      \n  U.S. agency                                                                     \n  securities,                                                                     \n  mortgage-backed                                                                 \n  securities, and                                                 606        462  \n  other                                                                           \n  investment-grade                                                                \n  securities                                                                      \n  Non-U.S. government                                              15         18  \n  securities                                                                      \n  Total Average                                                                   \n  Global Liquidity                              $               1,158    $   943  \n  Sources                                                                         \n                                                                                  \nOur GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High\nQuality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)\nrules. However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market\nvalue, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the\nexclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated\nas the amount of a financial institution\u2019s unencumbered HQLA relative to the\nestimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period\nof significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average\nconsolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $617 billion and $584 billion for the three\nmonths ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. For the same periods, the average\nconsolidated LCR was 115 percent and 122 percent. Our LCR fluctuates due to normal\nbusiness flows from customer activity. Liquidity Stress Analysis We utilize\nliquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of\nliquidity to maintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries to meet\ncontractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. The scenarios\nwe consider and utilize incorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific events,\nincluding potential credit rating downgrades for the parent company and our\nsubsidiaries, and more severe events including potential resolution scenarios. The\nscenarios are based on our historical experience, experience of distressed and\nfailed financial institutions, regulatory guidance, and both expected and\nunexpected future events. The types of potential contractual and contingent cash\noutflows we consider in our scenarios may include, but are not limited to,\nupcoming contractual maturities of unsecured debt and reductions in new debt\nissuances; diminished access to secured financing markets; potential deposit\nwithdrawals; increased draws on loan commitments, liquidity facilities and letters\nof credit; additional collateral that counterparties could call if our credit\nratings were downgraded; collateral and margin requirements arising from market\nvalue changes; and potential liquidity required to maintain businesses and finance\ncustomer activities. Changes in certain market factors, including, but not limited\nto, credit rating downgrades, could negatively impact potential contractual and\ncontingent outflows and the related financial instruments, and in some cases these\nimpacts could be material to our financial results. We consider all sources of\nfunds that we could access during each stress scenario and focus particularly on\nmatching available sources with corresponding liquidity requirements by legal\nentity. We also use the stress modeling results to manage our asset and liability\nprofile and establish limits and guidelines on certain funding sources and\nbusinesses.\n\nNet Stable Funding Ratio Final Rule On October 20, 2020, U.S. banking regulators\nfinalized the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), a rule requiring large banks to\nmaintain a minimum level of stable funding over a one-year period. The final rule\nis intended to support the ability of banks to lend to households and businesses\nin both normal and adverse economic conditions and is complementary to the LCR\nrule, which focuses on short-term liquidity risks. The final rule was effective\nJuly 1, 2021, and the Corporation is in compliance. The U.S. NSFR applies to the\nCorporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions.\nThere have not been any significant impacts to the Corporation. Diversified\nFunding Sources We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured\nand unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding\napproach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor\ngroups. The primary benefits of our centralized funding approach include greater\ncontrol, reduced funding costs, wider name recognition by investors and greater\nflexibility to meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where\nregulations, time zone differences or other business considerations make parent\ncompany funding impractical, certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt.\nWe fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits,\nwhich were $2.1 trillion and $1.8 trillion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Deposits\nare primarily generated by our Consumer Banking , GWIM and Global Banking\nsegments. These deposits are diversified by clients, product type and geography,\nand the majority of our U.S. deposits are insured by the FDIC. We consider a\nsubstantial portion of our deposits to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source\nof funding. We believe this deposit funding is generally less sensitive to\ninterest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than\nwholesale funding sources. Our lending activities may also be financed through\nsecured borrowings, including credit card securitizations and securitizations with\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises (GSE), the Federal Housing Administration (FHA)\nand private-label investors, as well as FHLB loans. Our trading activities in\nother regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through\nsecurities lending and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on\ncustomer activity and market conditions. We believe funding these activities in\nthe secured financing markets is more cost-efficient and less sensitive to changes\nin our credit ratings than unsecured financing. Repurchase agreements are\ngenerally short-term and often overnight. Disruptions in secured financing markets\nfor financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles which resulted in\nadverse changes in terms or significant reductions in the availability of such\nfinancing. We manage the liquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing\nfunding globally from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a range of\nsecurities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when appropriate. For more\ninformation on secured financing agreements, see Note 10 \u2013 Securities Financing\nAgreements, Short-term Borrowings and Restricted Cash to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements. Total long-term debt increased $17.2 billion to $280.1\nbillion during 2021, primarily due to debt issuances, partially offset by debt\nmaturities, redemptions and valuation adjustments. We may, from time to time,\npurchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on market\nconditions, liquidity and other factors. Our other regulated\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America56                                                               \n                                                                                  \nentities may also make markets in our\ndebt instruments to provide liquidity\nfor investors. During 2021, we issued\n$76.7 billion of long-term debt\nconsisting of $56.2 billion of notes\nissued by Bank of America Corporation,\nsubstantially all of which were TLAC\ncompliant, $8.0 billion of notes issued\nby Bank of America, N.A. and $12.5\nbillion of other debt. During 2020, we\nissued $56.9 billion of long-term debt\nconsisting of $43.8 billion of notes\nissued by Bank of America Corporation,\nsubstantially all of which were TLAC\ncompliant, $4.8 billion of notes issued\nby Bank of America, N.A. and $8.3\nbillion of other debt. During 2021, we\nhad total long-term debt maturities and\nredemptions in the aggregate of $46.4\nbillion consisting of $24.4 billion for\nBank of America Corporation, $10.4\nbillion for Bank of America, N.A. and\n$11.6 billion of other debt. During\n2020, we had total long-term debt\nmaturities and redemptions in the\naggregate of $47.1 billion consisting of\n$22.6 billion for Bank of America\nCorporation, $11.5 billion for Bank of\nAmerica, N.A. and $13.0 billion of other\ndebt. At December 31, 2021, Bank of\nAmerica Corporation's senior notes of\n$212.9 billion included $179.5 billion\nof outstanding notes that are both TLAC\neligible and callable at least one year\nbefore their stated maturities. Of these\nsenior notes, $15.0 billion will be\ncallable and become TLAC ineligible\nduring 2022, and $17.0 billion, $17.8\nbillion, $15.0 billion and $17.7 billion\nwill do so during each of 2023 through\n2026, respectively, and $97.0 billion\nthereafter. We issue long-term unsecured\ndebt in a variety of maturities and\ncurrencies to achieve cost-efficient\nfunding and to maintain an appropriate\nmaturity profile. While the cost and\navailability of unsecured funding may be\nnegatively impacted by general market\nconditions or by matters specific to the\nfinancial services industry or the\nCorporation, we seek to mitigate\nrefinancing risk by actively managing\nthe amount of our borrowings that we\nanticipate will mature within any month\nor quarter. We may issue unsecured debt\nin the form of structured notes for\nclient purposes, certain of which\nqualify as TLAC-eligible debt. During\n2021, we issued $7.1 billion of\nstructured notes, which are debt\nobligations that pay investors returns\nlinked to other debt or equity\nsecurities, indices, currencies or\ncommodities. We typically hedge the\nreturns we are obligated to pay on these\nliabilities with derivatives and/or\ninvestments in the underlying\ninstruments, so that from a funding\nperspective, the cost is similar to our\nother unsecured long-term debt. We could\nbe required to settle certain structured\nnote obligations for cash or other\nsecurities prior to maturity under\ncertain circumstances, which we consider\nfor liquidity planning purposes. We\nbelieve, however, that a portion of such\nborrowings will remain outstanding\nbeyond the earliest put or redemption\ndate. Substantially all of our senior\nand subordinated debt obligations\ncontain no provisions that could trigger\na requirement for an early repayment,\nrequire additional collateral support,\nresult in changes to terms, accelerate\nmaturity or create additional financial\nobligations upon an adverse change in\nour credit ratings, financial ratios,\nearnings, cash flows or stock price. For\nmore information on long-term debt\nfunding, including issuances and\nmaturities and redemptions, see Note 11\n\u2013 Long-term Debt to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements. We use derivative\ntransactions to manage the duration,\ninterest rate and currency risks of our\nborrowings, considering the\ncharacteristics of the assets they are\nfunding.

Contingency Planning\nWe maintain contingency funding plans\nthat outline our potential responses to\nliquidity stress events at various\nlevels of severity. These policies and\nplans are based on stress scenarios and\ninclude potential funding strategies and\ncommunication and notification\nprocedures that we would implement in\nthe event we experienced stressed\nliquidity conditions. We periodically\nreview and test the contingency funding\nplans to validate efficacy and assess\nreadiness. Our U.S. bank subsidiaries\ncan access contingency funding through\nthe Federal Reserve Discount Window.\nCertain non-U.S. subsidiaries have\naccess to central bank facilities in the\njurisdictions in which they operate.\nWhile we do not rely on these sources in\nour liquidity modeling, we maintain the\npolicies, procedures and governance\nprocesses that would enable us to access\nthese sources if necessary. Credit\nRatings Our borrowing costs and ability\nto raise funds are impacted by our\ncredit ratings. In addition, credit\nratings may be important to customers or\ncounterparties when we compete in\ncertain markets and when we seek to\nengage in certain transactions,\nincluding over-the-counter (OTC)\nderivatives. Thus, it is our objective\nto maintain high-quality credit ratings,\nand management maintains an active\ndialogue with the major rating agencies.\nCredit ratings and outlooks are opinions\nexpressed by rating agencies on our\ncreditworthiness and that of our\nobligations or securities, including\nlong-term debt, short-term borrowings,\npreferred stock and other securities,\nincluding asset securitizations. Our\ncredit ratings are subject to ongoing\nreview\n                                                                                  \n  57Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nby the rating agencies, and they\nconsider a number of factors, including\nour own financial strength, performance,\nprospects and operations as well as\nfactors not under our control. The\nrating agencies could make adjustments\nto our ratings at any time, and they\nprovide no assurances that they will\nmaintain our ratings at current levels.\n\nOther factors that influence our credit\nratings include changes to the rating\nagencies\u2019 methodologies for our industry\nor certain security types; the rating\nagencies\u2019 assessment of the general\noperating environment for financial\nservices companies; our relative\npositions in the markets in which we\ncompete; our various risk exposures and\nrisk management policies and activities;\npending litigation and other\ncontingencies or potential tail risks;\nour reputation; our liquidity position,\ndiversity of funding sources and funding\ncosts; the current and expected level\nand volatility of our earnings; our\ncapital position and capital management\npractices; our corporate governance; the\nsovereign credit ratings of the U.S.\ngovernment; current or future regulatory\nand legislative initiatives; and the\nagencies\u2019 views on whether the U.S.\ngovernment would provide meaningful\nsupport to the Corporation or its\nsubsidiaries in a crisis.\n\nOn May 24, 2021, Standard & Poor\u2019s\nGlobal Ratings (S&P) affirmed the\ncurrent ratings of the Corporation and\nits subsidiaries, while at the same time\nrevising its rating outlook to Positive\nfrom Stable.\n\nOn June 7, 2021, Fitch Ratings (Fitch)\nupgraded the long-term senior debt\nratings of the Corporation and its rated\nsubsidiaries by one notch, to AA- and\nAA, respectively. Fitch also upgraded\nthe Corporation\u2019s short-term rating to\nF1+ which is now aligned with the short-\nterm rating of its subsidiaries,\nincluding BANA. Following the upgrade,\nthe rating outlook for the Corporation\nand its subsidiaries is Stable.\n\nOn November 22, 2021, Moody\u2019s Investors\nService (Moody\u2019s) affirmed the current\nratings of the Corporation and its\nsubsidiaries, while at the same time\nrevising its rating outlook to Positive\nfrom Stable.\n\nTable 18 presents the Corporation\u2019s\ncurrent long-term/short-term senior debt\nratings and outlooks expressed by the\nrating agencies.\n                                                                                  \n  Ta\u2026    Se\u2026                                                                      \n  18     De\u2026                                                                      \n         Ra\u2026                                                                      \n                                       St\u2026                                        \n                Moo\u2026                   &                     Fit\u2026                 \n                Inv\u2026                   Po\u2026                   Rat\u2026                 \n                Ser\u2026                   Gl\u2026                                        \n                                       Ra\u2026                                        \n                Lon\u2026    Sh\u2026    Out\u2026    Lo\u2026    Sho\u2026    Ou\u2026    Lon\u2026    Sh\u2026    Out\u2026  \n  Ba\u2026                                                                             \n  of            A2      P-1    Pos\u2026    A-     A-2     Po\u2026    AA-     F1+    Sta\u2026  \n  Am\u2026                                                                             \n  Co\u2026                                                                             \n  Ba\u2026                                                                             \n  of            Aa2     P-1    Pos\u2026    A+     A-1     Po\u2026    AA      F1+    Sta\u2026  \n  Am\u2026                                                                             \n  N.\u2026                                                                             \n  Ba\u2026                                                                             \n  of                                                                              \n  Am\u2026                                                                             \n  Eu\u2026           NR      NR     NR      A+     A-1     Po\u2026    AA      F1+    Sta\u2026  \n  De\u2026                                                                             \n  Ac\u2026                                                                             \n  Co\u2026                                                                             \n  Me\u2026                                                                             \n  Ly\u2026                                                                             \n  Pi\u2026                                                                             \n  Fe\u2026           NR      NR     NR      A+     A-1     Po\u2026    AA      F1+    Sta\u2026  \n  &                                                                               \n  Sm\u2026                                                                             \n  In\u2026                                                                             \n  Bo\u2026                                                                             \n  Se\u2026           NR      NR     NR      A+     A-1     Po\u2026    AA      F1+    Sta\u2026  \n  In\u2026                                                                             \n  Me\u2026                                                                             \n  Ly\u2026           NR      NR     NR      A+     A-1     Po\u2026    AA      F1+    Sta\u2026  \n  In\u2026                                                                             \n  Bo\u2026                                                                             \n  Se\u2026           NR      NR     NR      A+     A-1     Po\u2026    AA      F1+    Sta\u2026  \n  Eu\u2026                                                                             \n  SA                                                                              \n                                                                                  \nNR = not rated\n\nA reduction in certain of our credit\nratings or the ratings of certain asset-\nbacked securitizations may have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our\nliquidity, potential loss of access to\ncredit markets, the related cost of\nfunds, our businesses and on certain\nrevenues, particularly in those\nbusinesses where counterparty\ncreditworthiness is critical. In\naddition, under the terms of certain OTC\nderivative contracts and other trading\nagreements, in the event of downgrades\nof our or our rated subsidiaries\u2019 credit\nratings, the counterparties to those\nagreements may require us to provide\nadditional collateral, or to terminate\nthese contracts or agreements, which\ncould cause us to sustain losses and/or\nadversely impact our liquidity. If the\nshort-term credit ratings of our parent\ncompany, bank or broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries were downgraded by one or\nmore levels, the potential loss of\naccess to short-term funding sources\nsuch as repo financing and the effect on\nour incremental cost of funds could be\nmaterial.\n\nWhile certain potential impacts are\ncontractual and quantifiable, the full\nscope of the consequences of a credit\nrating downgrade to a financial\ninstitution is inherently uncertain, as\nit depends upon numerous dynamic,\ncomplex and inter-related factors and\nassumptions, including whether any\ndowngrade of a company\u2019s long-term\ncredit ratings precipitates downgrades\nto its short-term credit ratings, and\nassumptions about the potential\nbehaviors of various customers,\ninvestors and counterparties.

Credit risk can also arise\nfrom operational failures that result in\nan erroneous advance, commitment or\ninvestment of funds. We define the\ncredit exposure to a borrower or\ncounterparty as the loss potential\narising from all product classifications\nincluding loans and leases, deposit\noverdrafts, derivatives, assets held-\nfor-sale and unfunded lending\ncommitments which include loan\ncommitments, letters of credit and\nfinancial guarantees. Derivative\npositions are recorded at fair value and\nassets held-for-sale are recorded at\neither fair value or the lower of cost\nor fair value. Certain loans and\nunfunded commitments are accounted for\nunder the fair value option. Credit risk\nfor categories of assets carried at fair\nvalue is not accounted for as part of\nthe allowance for credit losses but as\npart of the fair value adjustments\nrecorded in earnings. For derivative\npositions,\n\nour credit risk is measured as the net\ncost in the event the counterparties\nwith contracts in which we are in a gain\nposition fail to perform under the terms\nof those contracts. We use the current\nfair value to represent credit exposure\nwithout giving consideration to future\nmark-to-market changes. The credit risk\namounts take into consideration the\neffects of legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements and cash collateral.\nOur consumer and commercial credit\nextension and review procedures\nencompass funded and unfunded credit\nexposures. For more information on\nderivatives and credit extension\ncommitments, see Note 3 \u2013 Derivatives\nand Note 12 \u2013 Commitments and\nContingencies to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n\nWe manage credit risk based on the risk\nprofile of the borrower or counterparty,\nrepayment sources, the nature of\nunderlying collateral and other support\ngiven current events, conditions and\nexpectations. We classify our portfolios\nas either consumer or commercial and\nmonitor credit risk in each as discussed\nbelow.\n\nWe refine our underwriting and credit\nrisk management practices as well as\ncredit standards to meet the changing\neconomic environment. To mitigate losses\nand enhance customer support in our\nconsumer businesses, we have in place\ncollection programs and loan\nmodification and customer assistance\ninfrastructures. We utilize a number of\nactions to mitigate losses in the\ncommercial businesses including\nincreasing the frequency and intensity\nof portfolio monitoring, hedging\nactivity and our practice of\ntransferring management of deteriorating\ncommercial exposures to independent\nspecial asset officers as credits enter\ncriticized categories .\n\nFor information on our credit risk\nmanagement activities, see Consumer\nPortfolio Credit Risk Management below,\nCommercial Portfolio Credit Risk\nManagement on page 65, Non-U.S.\nPortfolio on page 71, Allowance for\nCredit Losses on page 73, and Note 5 \u2013\nOutstanding Loans and Leases and\nAllowance for Credit Losses to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.

Risk Factors - Credit on page\n12.\n\nDuring 2021, the economy gained momentum\nas unemployment continued to decline\nfrom double-digit highs during 2020 and\nthe economy re-opened as vaccination\nrates increased and restrictions eased.\nWith the easing of restrictions, we saw\nincreased business openings, a rebound\nto commercial and consumer spending,\nhigher asset values and increased global\nGDP, all of which positively impacted\nour consumer and commercial credit\nportfolios. Additionally, individuals\nand businesses in the U.S. benefited\nfrom various forms of government support\nthrough economic stimulus packages\nenacted in 2020 and 2021, which\ncontributed to strong asset quality\nacross our credit portfolios.\n\nAs a result of the economic recovery\nexperienced in 2021, net charge-offs,\nnonperforming loans and commercial\nreservable criticized exposure declined\ncompared to 2020. While there has been\nsignificant economic improvement in\ncomparison to 2020, uncertainty remains\nabout the timing and strength of the\neconomy\u2019s recovery, which may also be\nhampered by supply chain disruptions and\ninflationary pressures and could lead to\nadverse impacts to credit quality\nmetrics in future periods. The pandemic\nand its full impact on the global\neconomy continue to be highly uncertain.\nWhile COVID-19 cases eased throughout\nthe majority of 2021, they reached new\nhighs by the end of 2021, and the spread\nof new, more contagious variants could\nimpact the magnitude and duration of\nthis health crisis. However, ongoing\nvirus containment efforts and\nvaccination progress, could support the\nmacroeconomic recovery.\n                                                                                  \n  59Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nFor more information on how the pandemic\nmay affect our operations, see Executive\nSummary \u2013 Recent Developments \u2013 COVID-19\nPandemic on page 27 and Item 1A.

Statistical\ntechniques in conjunction with\nexperiential judgment are used in all\naspects of portfolio management\nincluding underwriting, product pricing,\nrisk appetite, setting credit limits,\nand establishing operating processes and\nmetrics to quantify and balance risks\nand returns. Statistical models are\nbuilt using detailed behavioral\ninformation from external sources such\nas credit bureaus and/or internal\nhistorical experience and are a\ncomponent of our consumer credit risk\nmanagement process. These models are\nused in part to assist in making both\nnew and ongoing credit decisions, as\nwell as portfolio management strategies,\nincluding authorizations and line\nmanagement, collection practices and\nstrategies, and determination of the\nallowance for loan and lease losses and\nallocated capital for credit risk.\n                                                                                  \n  Consumer Credit Portfolio                                                       \n                                                                                  \nThe economic environment improved during\n2021, with the U.S. unemployment rate\ncontinuing to decline and home prices\nincreasing. During 2021, net charge-offs\ndecreased $805 million to $1.8 billion\nprimarily due to lower credit card\nlosses, as the impact of government\nstimulus measures were partially offset\nby charge-offs associated with deferrals\nthat expired in 2020. During 2021,\nnonperforming loans increased due to\ndeferral activity.\n\nThe consumer allowance for loan and\nlease losses decreased $3.0 billion in\n2021 to $7.0 billion primarily due to\nimprovements in the macroeconomic\noutlook and credit quality.

Of the\nnonperforming residential mortgage loans\nat December 31, 2021, $1.2 billion, or\n51 percent, were current on contractual\npayments. Loans accruing past due 30\ndays or more decreased $358 million\ndriven by continued improvement in\ncredit quality.\n\nNet recoveries of $28 million in 2021\nremained relatively unchanged compared\nto 2020.\n\nOf the $209.3 billion in total\nresidential mortgage loans outstanding\nat December 31, 2021, 27 percent were\noriginated as interest-only loans. The\noutstanding balance of interest-only\nresidential mortgage loans that have\nentered the amortization period was $4.8\nbillion, or eight percent, at December\n31, 2021. Residential mortgage loans\nthat have entered the amortization\nperiod generally experienced a higher\nrate of early stage delinquencies and\nnonperforming status compared to the\nresidential mortgage portfolio as a\nwhole. At December 31, 2021, $66\nmillion, or one percent, of outstanding\ninterest-only residential mortgages that\nhad entered the amortization period were\naccruing past due 30 days or more\ncompared to $866 million, or less than\none percent, for the entire residential\n\nmortgage portfolio. In addition, at\nDecember 31, 2021, $275 million, or six\npercent, of outstanding interest-only\nresidential mortgage loans that had\nentered the amortization period were\nnonperforming, of which $83 million were\ncontractually current compared to $2.3\nbillion, or one percent, for the entire\nresidential mortgage portfolio. Loans\nthat have yet to enter the amortization\nperiod in our interest-only residential\nmortgage portfolio are primarily well-\ncollateralized loans to our wealth\nmanagement clients and have an interest-\nonly period of three to ten years.\nApproximately 91 percent of these loans\nthat have yet to enter the amortization\nperiod will not be required to make a\nfully-amortizing payment until 2025 or\nlater.\n\nTable 22 presents outstandings,\nnonperforming loans and net charge-offs\nby certain state concentrations for the\nresidential mortgage portfolio. The Los\nAngeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana\nMetropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)\nwithin California represented 15 percent\nand 16 percent of outstandings at\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020.

For\ninformation on our interest accrual\npolicies and delinquency status for loan\nmodifications related to the pandemic,\nsee Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant\nAccounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\n\n(2) Includes loans that are\ncontractually current which primarily\nconsist of collateral-dependent TDRs,\nincluding those that have been\ndischarged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy,\njunior-lien loans where the underlying\nfirst lien is 90 days or more past due,\nas well as loans that have not yet\ndemonstrated a sustained period of\npayment performance following a TDR.\n\nNonperforming outstanding balances in\nthe home equity portfolio remained\nrelatively flat at $630 million at\nDecember 31, 2021. Of the nonperforming\nhome equity loans at December 31, 2021,\n$227 million, or 36 percent, were\ncurrent on contractual payments. In\naddition, $273 million, or 43 percent of\nnonperforming home equity loans were 180\ndays or more past due and had been\nwritten down to the estimated fair value\nof the collateral, less costs to sell.\nAccruing loans that were 30 days or more\npast due decreased $29 million in 2021.\n\nNet recoveries increased $46 million to\n$119 million in 2021 compared to the\nsame period in 2020. The increase was\ndriven by favorable portfolio trends due\nin part to improvement in home prices.\n\nOf the $27.9 billion in total home\nequity portfolio outstandings at\nDecember 31, 2021, as shown in Table 23,\n14 percent require interest-only\npayments. The outstanding balance of\nHELOCs that have reached the end of\ntheir draw period and have entered the\namortization period was $6.8 billion at\nDecember 31, 2021. The HELOCs that have\nentered the amortization period have\nexperienced a higher percentage of early\nstage delinquencies and nonperforming\nstatus when\n\ncompared to the HELOC portfolio as a\nwhole. At December 31, 2021, $105\nmillion, or two percent, of outstanding\nHELOCs that had entered the amortization\nperiod were accruing past due 30 days or\nmore. In addition, at December 31, 2021,\n$455 million, or seven percent, were\nnonperforming. Loans that have yet to\nenter the amortization period in our\ninterest-only portfolio are primarily\npost-2008 vintages and generally have\nbetter credit quality than the previous\nvintages that had entered the\namortization period. We communicate to\ncontractually current customers more\nthan a year prior to the end of their\ndraw period to inform them of the\npotential change to the payment\nstructure before entering the\namortization period, and provide payment\noptions to customers prior to the end of\nthe draw period.\n\nAlthough we do not actively track how\nmany of our home equity customers pay\nonly the minimum amount due on their\nhome equity loans and lines, we can\ninfer some of this information through a\nreview of our HELOC portfolio that we\nservice and that is still in its\nrevolving period. During 2021, nine\npercent of these customers with an\noutstanding balance did not pay any\nprincipal on their HELOCs.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America62                                                               \n                                                                                  \nTable 24 presents outstandings,\nnonperforming balances and net\nrecoveries by certain state\nconcentrations for the home equity\nportfolio.

Credit card\n\nloans 30 days or more past due and still\naccruing interest decreased $692\nmillion, and loans 90 days or more past\ndue and still accruing interest\ndecreased $416 million primarily due to\ncharge-offs of certain loans with\ndeferrals that expired in 2020 and the\nimpact of government stimulus measures.\n\nUnused lines of credit for credit card\nincreased to $361.2 billion at December\n31, 2021 from $342.4 billion at 2020.\n\nTable 25 presents certain state\nconcentrations for the credit card\nportfolio.\n                                                                                  \n         Cre\u2026                                                                     \n  Ta\u2026    Card                                                                     \n  25     Sta\u2026                                                                     \n         Con\u2026                                                                     \n                                          Acc\u2026                                    \n                                          Past                                    \n                                           Due                                    \n                    Out\u2026                    90                                    \n                                          Days                                    \n                                            or                                    \n                                          Mor\u2026                                    \n                    Dec\u2026                                          Net             \n                      31                                        Char\u2026             \n  (D\u2026                                                                             \n  in                2021       2020       2021       2020        2021       2020  \n  mi\u2026                                                                             \n  Ca\u2026            $  13,\u2026    $  12,\u2026    $    82    $   166    $    322    $   419  \n  Fl\u2026               8,0\u2026       7,6\u2026         71        135         245        306  \n  Te\u2026               6,8\u2026       6,4\u2026         47         87         158        202  \n  New               4,7\u2026       4,6\u2026         35         76         135        188  \n  Yo\u2026                                                                             \n  Wa\u2026               4,0\u2026       3,6\u2026         13         21          39         56  \n  Ot\u2026               44,\u2026       43,\u2026        239        418         824       1,1\u2026  \n  To\u2026                                                                             \n  cr\u2026            $  81,\u2026    $  78,\u2026    $   487    $   903    $  1,723    $  2,3\u2026  \n  ca\u2026                                                                             \n  po\u2026                                                                             \n                                                                                  \n(1) For information on our interest accrual policies and delinquency status for\nloan modifications related to the pandemic, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant\nAccounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n                                                                                  \n  Direct/Indirect Consumer                                                        \n                                                                                  \nAt December 31, 2021, 47 percent of the\ndirect/indirect portfolio was included\nin Consumer Banking (consumer auto and\nrecreational vehicle lending) and 53\npercent was included in\n\nGWIM (principally securities-based\nlending loans).

Credit card and other consumer\nloan modifications generally involve a\nreduction in the customer\u2019s interest\nrate on the account and placing the\ncustomer on a fixed payment plan not\nexceeding 60 months.\n\nModifications of credit card and other\nconsumer loans are made through programs\nutilizing direct customer contact, but\nmay also utilize external programs. At\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, our credit\ncard and other consumer TDR portfolio\nwas $672 million and $701 million, of\nwhich $599 million and $614 million were\ncurrent or less than 30 days past due\nunder the modified terms.\n                                                                                  \n   Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management                                    \n                                                                                  \nCredit risk management for the\ncommercial portfolio begins with an\nassessment of the credit risk profile of\nthe borrower or counterparty based on an\nanalysis of its financial position. As\npart of the overall credit risk\nassessment, our commercial credit\nexposures are assigned a risk rating and\nare subject to approval based on defined\ncredit approval standards. Subsequent to\nloan origination, risk ratings are\nmonitored on an ongoing basis, and if\nnecessary, adjusted to reflect changes\nin the financial condition, cash flow,\nrisk profile or outlook of a borrower or\ncounterparty. In making credit\ndecisions, we consider risk rating,\ncollateral, country, industry and\nsingle-name concentration limits while\nalso balancing these considerations with\nthe total borrower or counterparty\nrelationship. We use a variety of tools\nto continuously monitor the ability of a\nborrower or counterparty to perform\nunder its obligations. We use risk\nrating aggregations to measure and\nevaluate concentrations within\nportfolios. In addition, risk ratings\nare a factor in determining the level of\nallocated capital and the allowance for\ncredit losses.\n\nAs part of our ongoing risk mitigation\ninitiatives, we attempt to work with\nclients experiencing financial\ndifficulty to modify their loans to\nterms that better align with their\ncurrent ability to pay. In situations\nwhere an economic concession has been\ngranted to a borrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulty, we identify these\nloans as TDRs. For more information on\nour accounting policies regarding\ndelinquencies, nonperforming status and\nnet charge-offs for the commercial\nportfolio, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements .\nManagement of Commercial Credit Risk\nConcentrations\nCommercial credit risk is evaluated and\nmanaged with the goal that\nconcentrations of credit exposure\ncontinue to be aligned with our risk\nappetite. We review, measure and manage\nconcentrations of credit exposure by\nindustry, product,\n\ngeography, customer relationship and\nloan size. We also review, measure and\nmanage commercial real estate loans by\ngeographic location and property type.\nIn addition, within our non-U.S.\nportfolio, we evaluate exposures by\nregion and by country. Tables 33, 36 and\n39 summarize our concentrations. We also\nutilize syndications of exposure to\nthird parties, loan sales, hedging and\nother risk mitigation techniques to\nmanage the size and risk profile of the\ncommercial credit portfolio. For more\ninformation on our industry\nconcentrations, see Commercial Portfolio\nCredit Risk Management \u2013 Industry\nConcentrations on page 69 and Table 36.\n\nWe account for certain large corporate\nloans and loan commitments, including\nissued but unfunded letters of credit\nwhich are considered utilized for credit\nrisk management purposes, that exceed\nour single-name credit risk\nconcentration guidelines under the fair\nvalue option. Lending commitments, both\nfunded and unfunded, are actively\nmanaged and monitored, and as\nappropriate, credit risk for these\nlending relationships may be mitigated\nthrough the use of credit derivatives,\nwith our credit view and market\nperspectives determining the size and\ntiming of the hedging activity. In\naddition, we purchase credit protection\nto cover the funded portion as well as\nthe unfunded portion of certain other\ncredit exposures. To lessen the cost of\nobtaining our desired credit protection\nlevels, credit exposure may be added\nwithin an industry, borrower or\ncounterparty group by selling\nprotection. These credit derivatives do\nnot meet the requirements for treatment\nas accounting hedges. They are carried\nat fair value with changes in fair value\nrecorded in other income.\n\nIn addition, we are a member of various\nsecurities and derivative exchanges and\nclearinghouses, both in the U.S. and\nother countries. As a member, we may be\nrequired to pay a pro-rata share of the\nlosses incurred by some of these\norganizations as a result of another\nmember default and under other loss\nscenarios. For more information, see\nNote 12 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies\nto the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\n                                                                                  \n  Commercial Credit Portfolio                                                     \n                                                                                  \nDuring 2021, commercial credit quality\nimproved as the economic recovery gained\nmomentum driven in part by increased\nconsumer spending and COVID-19\nvaccination progress. Accordingly,\ncharge-offs, nonperforming commercial\nloans and reservable criticized utilized\nexposure declined during this period.\nOutstanding commercial loans and leases\nincreased $44.4 billion during 2021 due\nto growth in commercial and industrial,\nprimarily in Global Markets with most of\nthe increase in investment grade\nexposures. This increase was partially\noffset by lower U.S. small business\ncommercial loans due to repayments of\nPPP loans by the Small Business\nAdministration (SBA) under the terms of\nthe program.

Moreover,\nmany real estate markets, while\nimproving, are still experiencing some\ndisruptions in demand, supply chain\nchallenges and tenant difficulties.\nCurrent and future office demand is\nuncertain as companies evaluate space\nneeds with employment models that\nutilize a mix of remote and conventional\noffice use.\n\nThe commercial allowance for loan and\nlease losses decreased $3.4 billion\nduring 2021 to $5.4 billion driven by\nimprovements in the macroeconomic\noutlook and credit quality.

For purposes of this table, the real estate industry is defined\nbased on the primary business activity of the borrowers or counterparties using\noperating cash flows and primary source of repayment as key factors.\nRisk Mitigation We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well\nas the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of\nobtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within\nan industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. At December 31,\n2021 and 2020, net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit\nderivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we\nelected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $2.6\nbillion and $4.2 billion. We recorded net losses of $91 million in 2021 compared\nto net losses of $240 million in 2020. The gains and losses on these instruments\nwere offset by gains and losses on the related exposures. The Value-at-Risk (VaR)\nresults for these exposures are included in the fair value option portfolio\ninformation in Table 43. For more information, see Trading Risk Management on page\n76.

Because these\ntransactions are executed in the OTC\nmarket, we are subject to settlement\nrisk. We are also subject to credit risk\nin the event that these counterparties\nfail to perform under the terms of these\ncontracts. In order to properly reflect\ncounterparty credit risk, we record\ncounterparty credit risk valuation\nadjustments on certain derivative\nassets, including our\n\npurchased credit default protection. In\nmost cases, credit derivative\ntransactions are executed on a daily\nmargin basis. Therefore, events such as\na credit downgrade, depending on the\nultimate rating level, or a breach of\ncredit covenants would typically require\nan increase in the amount of collateral\nrequired by the counterparty, where\napplicable, and/or allow us to take\nadditional protective measures such as\nearly termination of all trades. For\nmore information on credit derivatives\nand counterparty credit risk valuation\nadjustments, see Note 3 \u2013 Derivatives to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements .\n                                                                                  \n  Non-U.S. Portfolio                                                              \n                                                                                  \nOur non-U.S. credit and trading\nportfolios are subject to country risk.\nWe define country risk as the risk of\nloss from unfavorable economic and\npolitical conditions, currency\nfluctuations, social instability and\nchanges in government policies. A risk\nmanagement framework is in place to\nmeasure, monitor and\n\nmanage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In\naddition to the direct risk of doing\nbusiness in a country, we also are\nexposed to indirect country risks (e.g.,\nrelated to the collateral received on\nsecured financing transactions or\nrelated to client clearing activities).\nThese indirect exposures are managed in\nthe normal course of business through\ncredit, market and operational risk\ngovernance rather than through country\nrisk governance.\n\nTable 39 presents our 20 largest\nnon-U.S. country exposures at December\n31, 2021. These exposures accounted for\n89 percent and 90 percent of our total\nnon-U.S. exposure at December 31, 2021\nand 2020. Net country exposure for these\n20 countries increased $10.5 billion in\n2021 primarily driven by increases in\nAustralia, Canada and France, partially\noffset by reductions in Germany and the\nUnited Kingdom.\n\nNon-U.S. exposure is presented on an\ninternal risk management basis and\nincludes sovereign and non-sovereign\ncredit exposure, securities and other\ninvestments issued by or domiciled in\ncountries other than the U.S.\n\nFunded loans and loan equivalents\ninclude loans, leases, and other\nextensions of credit and funds,\nincluding letters of credit and due from\nplacements. Unfunded commitments are the\nundrawn portion of legally binding\ncommitments related to loans and loan\nequivalents. Net counterparty exposure\nincludes the fair value of derivatives,\nincluding the counterparty risk\nassociated with credit default swaps\n(CDS), and secured financing\ntransactions. Securities and other\ninvestments are carried at fair value\nand long securities exposures are netted\nagainst short exposures with the same\nunderlying issuer to, but not below,\nzero.

that changes in\nmarket conditions may adversely impact\nthe value of assets or liabilities, or\notherwise negatively impact earnings.\nThis risk is inherent in the financial\ninstruments associated with our\noperations, primarily within our Global\nMarkets segment. We are also exposed to\nthese risks in other areas of the\nCorporation (e.g., our ALM activities).\nIn the event of market stress, these\nrisks could have a material impact on\nour results. For more information, see\nInterest Rate Risk Management for the\nBanking Book on page 79.\n\nWe have been affected, and may continue\nto be affected, by market stress\nresulting from the pandemic that began\nin the first quarter of 2020. For more\ninformation, see Part 1. Item 1A. Risk\nFactors \u2013 Coronavirus Disease on page 8.\n\nOur traditional banking loan and deposit\nproducts are non-trading positions and\nare generally reported at amortized cost\nfor assets or the amount owed for\nliabilities (historical cost). However,\nthese positions are still subject to\nchanges in economic value based on\nvarying market conditions, with one of\nthe primary risks being changes in the\nlevels of interest rates. The risk of\nadverse changes in the economic value of\nour non-trading positions arising from\nchanges in interest rates is managed\nthrough our ALM activities. We have\nelected to account for certain assets\nand liabilities under the fair value\noption.\n\nOur trading positions are reported at\nfair value with changes reflected in\nincome. Trading positions are subject to\nvarious changes in market-based risk\nfactors. The majority of this risk is\ngenerated by our activities in the\ninterest rate, foreign exchange, credit,\nequity and commodities markets. In\naddition, the values of assets and\nliabilities could change due to market\nliquidity, correlations across markets\nand expectations of market volatility.\nWe seek to manage these risk exposures\nby using a variety of techniques that\nencompass a broad range of financial\ninstruments. The key risk management\ntechniques are discussed in more detail\nin the Trading Risk Management section.\n\nGlobal Risk Management is responsible\nfor providing senior management with a\nclear and comprehensive understanding of\nthe trading risks to which we are\nexposed. These responsibilities include\nownership of market risk policy,\ndeveloping and maintaining quantitative\nrisk models, calculating aggregated risk\nmeasures, establishing and monitoring\nposition limits consistent with risk\nappetite, conducting daily reviews and\nanalysis of trading inventory, approving\nmaterial risk exposures and fulfilling\nregulatory requirements. Market risks\nthat impact businesses outside of Global\nMarkets are monitored and governed by\ntheir respective governance functions.\n\nModel risk is the potential for adverse\nconsequences from decisions based on\nincorrect or misused model outputs and\nreports. Given that models are used\nacross the Corporation, model risk\nimpacts all risk types including credit,\nmarket and operational risks. The\nEnterprise Model Risk Policy defines\nmodel risk standards, consistent with\nour Risk Framework and risk appetite,\nprevailing regulatory guidance and\nindustry best practice. All models,\nincluding risk management, valuation and\nregulatory capital models, must meet\ncertain validation criteria, including\neffective challenge of the conceptual\nsoundness of the model, independent\nmodel testing and ongoing monitoring\nthrough outcomes analysis and\nbenchmarking. The Enterprise Model Risk\nCommittee (EMRC), a subcommittee of the\nMRC, oversees that model standards are\nconsistent with model risk requirements\nand monitors the effective challenge in\nthe model validation process across the\nCorporation.\n                                                                                  \n  Interest Rate Risk                                                              \n                                                                                  \nInterest rate risk represents exposures\nto instruments whose values vary with\nthe level or volatility of interest\nrates. These instruments include, but\nare not limited to, loans, debt\nsecurities, certain trading-related\nassets and liabilities, deposits,\nborrowings and derivatives.

The types of instruments\nexposed to this risk include investments\nin non-U.S. subsidiaries, foreign\ncurrency-denominated loans and\nsecurities, future cash flows in foreign\ncurrencies arising from foreign exchange\ntransactions, foreign currency-\ndenominated debt and various foreign\nexchange derivatives whose values\nfluctuate with changes in the level or\nvolatility of currency exchange rates or\nnon-U.S. interest rates.

The values of these\ninstruments are sensitive to prepayment\nrates, mortgage rates, agency debt\nratings, default, market liquidity,\ngovernment participation and interest\nrate volatility. Our exposure to these\ninstruments takes several forms. For\nexample, we trade and engage in market-\nmaking activities in a variety of\nmortgage securities including whole\nloans, pass-through certificates,\ncommercial mortgages and collateralized\nmortgage obligations including\ncollateralized debt obligations using\nmortgages as underlying collateral. In\naddition, we originate a variety of MBS,\nwhich involves the accumulation of\nmortgage-related loans in anticipation\nof eventual securitization, and we may\nhold positions in mortgage securities\nand residential mortgage loans as part\nof the ALM portfolio. We also record\nMSRs as part of our mortgage origination\nactivities.

Hedging\ninstruments used to mitigate this risk\ninclude bonds, CDS and other credit\nfixed-income instruments.\n                                                                                  \n   Market Liquidity Risk                                                          \n                                                                                  \nMarket liquidity risk represents the\nrisk that the level of expected market\nactivity changes dramatically and, in\ncertain cases, may even cease. This\nexposes us to the risk that we will not\nbe able to transact business and execute\ntrades in an orderly manner which may\nimpact our results. This impact could be\nfurther exacerbated if expected hedging\nor pricing correlations are compromised\nby disproportionate demand or lack of\ndemand for certain instruments. We\nutilize various risk mitigating\ntechniques as discussed in more detail\nin Trading Risk Management.\n                                                                                  \n   Trading Risk Management                                                        \n                                                                                  \nTo evaluate risks in our trading\nactivities, we focus on the actual and\npotential volatility of revenues\ngenerated by individual positions as\nwell as portfolios of positions. Various\ntechniques and procedures are utilized\nto enable the most complete\nunderstanding of these risks.\nQuantitative measures of market risk are\nevaluated on a daily basis from a single\nposition to the portfolio of the\nCorporation. These measures include\nsensitivities of positions to various\nmarket risk factors, such as the\npotential impact on revenue from a one\nbasis point change in interest rates,\nand statistical measures utilizing both\nactual and hypothetical market moves,\nsuch as VaR and stress testing. Periods\nof extreme market stress influence the\nreliability of these techniques to\nvarying degrees. Qualitative evaluations\nof market risk utilize the suite of\nquantitative risk measures while\nunderstanding each of their respective\nlimitations. Additionally, risk managers\nindependently evaluate the risk of the\nportfolios under the current market\nenvironment and potential future\nenvironments.\n\nVaR is a common statistic used to\nmeasure market risk as it allows the\naggregation of market risk factors,\nincluding the effects of portfolio\ndiversification. A VaR model simulates\nthe value of a portfolio under a range\nof scenarios in order to generate a\ndistribution of potential gains and\nlosses. VaR represents the loss a\nportfolio is not expected to exceed more\nthan a certain number of times per\nperiod, based on a specified holding\nperiod, confidence level and window of\nhistorical data. We use one VaR model\nconsistently across the trading\nportfolios and it uses a historical\nsimulation approach based on a three-\nyear window of historical data. Our\nprimary VaR statistic is equivalent to a\n99 percent confidence level, which means\nthat for a VaR with a one-day holding\nperiod, there should not be losses in\nexcess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100\ntrading days.\n\nWithin any VaR model, there are\nsignificant and numerous assumptions\nthat will differ from company to\ncompany. The accuracy of a VaR model\ndepends on the availability and quality\nof historical data for each of the risk\nfactors in the portfolio. A VaR model\nmay require additional modeling\nassumptions for new products that do not\nhave the necessary historical market\ndata or for less liquid positions for\nwhich accurate daily prices\n\nare not consistently available. For\npositions with insufficient historical\ndata for the VaR calculation, the\nprocess for establishing an appropriate\nproxy is based on fundamental and\nstatistical analysis of the new product\nor less liquid position. This analysis\nidentifies reasonable alternatives that\nreplicate both the expected volatility\nand correlation to other market risk\nfactors that the missing data would be\nexpected to experience.\n\nVaR may not be indicative of realized\nrevenue volatility as changes in market\nconditions or in the composition of the\nportfolio can have a material impact on\nthe results. In particular,\n\nthe historical data used for the VaR\ncalculation might indicate higher or\nlower levels of portfolio\ndiversification than will be\nexperienced. In order for the VaR model\nto reflect current market conditions, we\nupdate the historical data underlying\nour VaR model on a weekly basis, or more\nfrequently during periods of market\nstress, and regularly review the\nassumptions underlying the model. A\nminor portion of risks related to our\ntrading positions is not included in\nVaR. These risks are reviewed as part of\nour ICAAP. For more information\nregarding ICAAP, see Capital Management\non page 49.\n\nGlobal Risk Management continually\nreviews, evaluates and enhances our VaR\nmodel so that it reflects the material\nrisks in our trading portfolio. Changes\nto the VaR model are reviewed and\napproved prior to implementation and any\nmaterial changes are reported to\nmanagement through the appropriate\nmanagement committees.\n\nTrading limits on quantitative risk\nmeasures, including VaR, are\nindependently set by Global Markets Risk\nManagement and reviewed on a regular\nbasis so that trading limits remain\nrelevant and within our overall risk\nappetite for market risks. Trading\nlimits are reviewed in the context of\nmarket liquidity, volatility and\nstrategic business priorities. Trading\nlimits are set at both a granular level\nto allow for extensive coverage of risks\nas well as at aggregated portfolios to\naccount for correlations among risk\nfactors. All trading limits are approved\nat least annually. Approved trading\nlimits are stored and tracked in a\ncentralized limits management system.\nTrading limit excesses are communicated\nto management for review. Certain\nquantitative market risk measures and\ncorresponding limits have been\nidentified as critical in the\nCorporation\u2019s Risk Appetite Statement.\nThese risk appetite limits are reported\non a daily basis and are approved at\nleast annually by the ERC and the Board.\n\nIn periods of market stress, Global\nMarkets senior leadership communicates\ndaily to discuss losses, key risk\npositions and any limit excesses. As a\nresult of this process, the businesses\nmay selectively reduce risk.\n\nTable 43 presents the total market-based\nportfolio VaR, which is the combination\nof the total covered positions (and less\nliquid trading positions) portfolio and\nthe fair value option portfolio. Covered\npositions are defined by regulatory\nstandards as trading assets and\nliabilities, both on- and off-balance\nsheet, that meet a defined set of\nspecifications. These specifications\nidentify the most liquid trading\npositions which are intended to be held\nfor a short-term horizon and where we\nare able to hedge the material risk\nelements in a two-way market. Positions\nin less liquid markets, or where there\nare restrictions on the ability to trade\nthe positions, typically do not qualify\nas covered positions. Foreign exchange\nand commodity positions are always\nconsidered covered positions, except for\nstructural foreign currency positions\nthat are excluded with prior regulatory\napproval.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America76                                                               \n                                                                                  \nIn addition, Table 43 presents our fair\nvalue option portfolio, which includes\nsubstantially all of the funded and\nunfunded exposures for which we elect\nthe fair value option, and their\ncorresponding hedges. Additionally,\nmarket risk VaR for trading activities\nas presented in Table 43 differs from\nVaR used for regulatory capital\ncalculations due to the holding period\nbeing used. The holding period for VaR\nused for regulatory capital calculations\nis 10 days, while for the market risk\nVaR presented below, it is one day. Both\nmeasures utilize the same process and\nmethodology.\n\nThe total market-based portfolio VaR\nresults in Table 43 include market risk\nto which we are exposed from all\nbusiness segments, excluding credit\nvaluation adjustment (CVA), DVA and\nrelated hedges. The majority of this\nportfolio is within the Global Markets\nsegment.\n\nTable 43 presents year-end, average,\nhigh and low daily trading VaR for 2021\nand 2020 using a 99 percent confidence\nlevel. The amounts disclosed in Table 43\nand Table 44 align to the view of\ncovered positions used in the Basel 3\ncapital calculations. Foreign exchange\nand commodity positions are always\nconsidered covered positions, regardless\nof trading or banking treatment for the\ntrade, except for structural foreign\ncurrency positions that are excluded\nwith prior regulatory approval.\n\nThe annual average of total covered\npositions and less liquid trading\npositions portfolio VaR decreased for\n2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to\nan increase in diversification across\nasset classes.\n                                                                                  \n      \u2026                                                                           \n      \u2026                                                                           \n      \u2026                                                                           \n      \u2026       \u2026                                                                   \n      \u2026       \u2026                                      Y\u2026                           \n      \u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026       L\u2026    \u2026       E\u2026       \u2026       H\u2026       \u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n           $  \u2026    $  12    $  \u2026    $   5         $   8    $  7    $  25    $  2  \n              \u2026       40       \u2026       16            30       \u2026       39       7  \n              \u2026       69       \u2026       53            79       \u2026       91       \u2026  \n              \u2026       24       \u2026       19            20       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n              6        8       \u2026        4             4       6       12       3  \n              \u2026       -\u2026       \u2014        \u2014            -\u2026       \u2026        \u2014       \u2014  \n              \u2026       53       \u2026       34            69       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n              8       20       \u2014        \u2014            52       \u2026        \u2014       \u2014  \n              \u2026       73       \u2026       46            1\u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n              \u2026       50       \u2026       31            52       \u2026       84       7  \n              \u2026       16       \u2026       11            11       \u2026       17       9  \n              \u2026       -\u2026       \u2014        \u2014            -\u2026       \u2026        \u2014       \u2014  \n              \u2026       34       \u2026       23            46       \u2026       86       9  \n              \u2026       -\u2026       \u2014        \u2014            -4       \u2026        \u2014       \u2014  \n           $  \u2026    $  97       \u2026       54         $  1\u2026    $  \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n                                                                                  \n(1) The high and low for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading\ndays than the high and low for the components.

utilizing a one-\nday holding period, against a comparable\nsubset of trading revenue. A backtesting\nexcess occurs when a trading loss\nexceeds the VaR for the corresponding\nday. These excesses are evaluated to\nunderstand the positions and market\nmoves that produced the trading loss\nwith a goal to ensure that the VaR\nmethodology accurately represents those\nlosses. We expect the frequency of\ntrading losses in excess of VaR to be in\nline with the confidence level of the\nVaR statistic being tested. For example,\nwith a 99 percent confidence level, we\nexpect one trading loss in excess of VaR\nevery 100 days or between two to three\ntrading losses in excess of VaR over the\ncourse of a year. The number of\nbacktesting excesses observed can differ\nfrom the statistically expected number\nof excesses if the current level of\nmarket volatility is materially\ndifferent than the level of market\nvolatility that existed during the three\nyears of historical data used in the VaR\ncalculation.\n\nThe trading revenue used for backtesting\nis defined by regulatory agencies in\norder to most closely align with the VaR\ncomponent of the regulatory capital\ncalculation. This revenue differs from\ntotal trading-related revenue in that it\nexcludes revenue from trading activities\nthat either do not generate market risk\nor the market risk cannot be included in\nVaR. Some examples of the types of\nrevenue excluded for backtesting are\nfees, commissions, reserves, net\ninterest income and intra-day trading\nrevenues.\n\nWe conduct daily backtesting on the VaR\nresults used for regulatory capital\ncalculations as well as the VaR results\nfor key legal entities, regions and risk\nfactors. These results are reported to\nsenior market risk management. Senior\nmanagement regularly reviews and\nevaluates the results of these tests.\n\nDuring 2021, there were two days where\nthis subset of trading revenue had\nlosses that exceeded our total covered\nportfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day\nholding period.\n                                                                                  \n  Total Trading-related Revenue                                                   \n                                                                                  \nTotal trading-related revenue, excluding\nbrokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding\nvaluation adjustment gains (losses),\nrepresents the total amount earned from\ntrading positions, including market-\nbased net interest income, which are\ntaken in a diverse range of financial\ninstruments and markets. For more\ninformation on fair value, see Note 20 \u2013\nFair Value Measurements to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nTrading-related revenue can be volatile\nand is largely driven by general market\nconditions and customer demand. Also,\ntrading-related revenue is dependent on\nthe volume and type of transactions, the\nlevel of risk assumed, and the\nvolatility of price and rate movements\nat any given time within the ever-\nchanging market environment. Significant\ndaily revenue by business is monitored\nand the primary drivers of these are\nreviewed.\n\nThe following histogram is a graphic\ndepiction of trading volatility and\nillustrates the daily level of trading-\nrelated revenue for 2021 and 2020.\nDuring 2021, positive trading-related\nrevenue was recorded for 97 percent of\nthe trading days, of which 80 percent\nwere daily trading gains of over $25\nmillion, and the largest loss was $45\nmillion. This compares to 2020 where\npositive trading-related revenue was\nrecorded for 98 percent of the trading\ndays, of which 87 percent were daily\ntrading gains of over $25 million, and\nthe largest loss was $90 million.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America78                                                               \n                                                                                  \nTrading Portfolio Stress Testing Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests\nresults can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical\nwindow, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis\nestimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from\nabnormal market movements. A set of scenarios, categorized as either historical or\nhypothetical, are computed daily for the overall trading portfolio and individual\nbusinesses. These scenarios include shocks to underlying market risk factors that\nmay be well beyond the shocks found in the historical data used to calculate VaR.\nHistorical scenarios simulate the impact of the market moves that occurred during\na period of extended historical market stress. Generally, a multi-week period\nrepresenting the most severe point during a crisis is selected for each historical\nscenario. Hypothetical scenarios provide estimated portfolio impacts from\npotential future market stress events. Scenarios are reviewed and updated in\nresponse to changing positions and new economic or political information. In\naddition, new or ad hoc scenarios are developed to address specific potential\nmarket events or particular vulnerabilities in the portfolio. The stress tests are\nreviewed on a regular basis and the results are presented to senior management.\nStress testing for the trading portfolio is integrated with enterprise-wide stress\ntesting and incorporated into the limits framework. The macroeconomic scenarios\nused for enterprise-wide stress testing purposes differ from the typical trading\nportfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time horizon and the results are\nforecasted over multiple periods for use in consolidated capital and liquidity\nplanning.

Interest rate risk represents the most\nsignificant market risk exposure to our banking book balance sheet. Interest rate\nrisk is measured as the potential change in net interest income caused by\nmovements in market interest rates. Client-facing activities, primarily lending\nand deposit-taking, create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet.\nWe prepare forward-looking forecasts of net interest income. The baseline forecast\ntakes into consideration expected future business growth, ALM positioning -and the\ndirection of interest rate movements as implied by the market-based forward curve.\nWe then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios\nhave on the baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under\nvaried conditions. The net interest income forecast is frequently updated for\nchanging assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends, market\nconditions and business strategies. Thus, we continually monitor our balance sheet\nposition in order to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate\nchanges. The interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate balance sheet\nassumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding mix,\nproduct repricing, maturity characteristics and investment securities premium\namortization. Our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements\nin interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital.\nTable 45 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline\nforecasts at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n                                                                                  \n                 Forward         December 31,                                     \n  Table 45       Rates                   2021                                     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                      Federal       Three-month       10-Year     \n                                        Funds             LIBOR          Swap     \n  Spot rates                             0.25  %           0.21  %       1.58  %  \n  12-month                                                                        \n  forward                                1.00              1.07          1.84     \n  rates                                                                           \n                                 December 31,                                     \n                                         2020                                     \n  Spot rates                             0.25  %           0.24  %       0.93  %  \n  12-month                                                                        \n  forward                                0.25              0.19          1.06     \n  rates                                                                           \n                                                                                  \nTable 46 shows the pretax impact to\nforecasted net interest income over the\nnext 12 months from December 31, 2021\nand 2020 resulting from instantaneous\nparallel and non-parallel shocks to the\nmarket-based forward curve.\nPeriodically, we evaluate the scenarios\npresented so that they are meaningful in\nthe context of the current rate\nenvironment. The interest rate scenarios\nalso assume U.S. dollar rates are\nfloored at zero. During 2021, the\noverall decrease in asset sensitivity of\nour balance sheet to Up-rate and Down-\nrate scenarios was primarily due to ALM\nactivity and an increase in long-end\nrates. We continue to be asset sensitive\nto a parallel upward move in interest\nrates with the majority of that impact\ncoming from the short end of the yield\ncurve. Additionally, higher interest\nrates impact the fair value of debt\nsecurities and, accordingly, for debt\nsecurities classified as AFS, may\nadversely affect accumulated OCI and\nthus capital levels under the Basel 3\ncapital rules. Under instantaneous\nupward parallel shifts, the near-term\nadverse impact to Basel 3 capital is\nreduced over time by offsetting positive\nimpacts to net interest income.

As part of our ALM activities, we\nuse securities, certain residential\nmortgages, and interest rate and foreign\nexchange derivatives in managing\ninterest rate sensitivity. The behavior\nof our deposits portfolio in the\nbaseline forecast and in alternate\ninterest rate scenarios is a key\nassumption in our projected estimates of\nnet interest income. The sensitivity\nanalysis in Table 46 assumes no change\nin\n                                                                                  \n  79Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \ndeposit portfolio size or mix from the\nbaseline forecast in alternate rate\nenvironments. In higher rate scenarios,\nany customer activity resulting in the\nreplacement of low-cost or noninterest-\nbearing deposits with higher yielding\ndeposits or market-based funding would\nreduce our benefit in those scenarios.\n\nInterest Rate and Foreign Exchange\nDerivative Contracts\n\nWe use interest rate and foreign\nexchange derivative contracts in our ALM\nactivities to manage our interest rate\nand foreign exchange risks.\nSpecifically, we use those derivatives\nto manage both the variability in cash\nflows and changes in fair value of\nvarious assets and liabilities arising\nfrom those risks. Our interest rate\nderivative contracts are generally non-\nleveraged swaps tied to various\nbenchmark interest rates and foreign\nexchange basis swaps, options, futures\nand forwards, and our foreign exchange\ncontracts include cross-currency\ninterest rate swaps, foreign currency\nfutures contracts, foreign currency\nforward contracts and options.\n\nThe derivatives used in our ALM\nactivities can be split into two broad\ncategories: designated accounting hedges\nand other risk management derivatives.\nDesignated accounting hedges are\nprimarily used to manage our exposure to\ninterest rates as described in the\nInterest Rate Risk Management for the\nBanking Book section and are included in\nthe sensitivities presented in Table 46.\nThe Corporation also uses foreign\ncurrency derivatives in accounting\nhedges to manage substantially all of\nthe foreign exchange risk of our foreign\noperations. By hedging the foreign\nexchange risk of our foreign operations,\nthe Corporation's market risk exposure\nin this area is insignificant.\n\nRisk management derivatives are\npredominantly used to hedge foreign\nexchange risks related to various\nforeign currency-denominated assets and\nliabilities and eliminate substantially\nall foreign currency exposures in the\ncash flows of the Corporation\u2019s non-\ntrading foreign currency-denominated\nfinancial instruments. These foreign\nexchange derivatives are sensitive to\nother market risk exposures such as\ncross-currency basis spreads and\ninterest rate risk. However, as these\nfeatures are not a significant component\nof these foreign exchange derivatives,\nthe market risk related to this exposure\nis insignificant. For more information\non the accounting for derivatives, see\nNote 3 \u2013 Derivatives to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n                                                                                  \n   Mortgage Banking Risk Management                                               \n                                                                                  \nWe originate, fund and service mortgage\nloans, which subject us to credit,\nliquidity and interest rate risks, among\nothers. We determine whether loans will\nbe held for investment or held for sale\nat the time of commitment and manage\ncredit and liquidity risks by selling or\nsecuritizing a portion of the loans we\noriginate.\n\nInterest rate risk and market risk can\nbe substantial in the mortgage business.\nChanges in interest rates and other\nmarket factors impact the volume of\nmortgage originations. Changes in\ninterest rates also impact the value of\ninterest rate lock commitments (IRLCs)\nand the related residential first\nmortgage LHFS between the date of the\nIRLC and the date the loans are\n\nsold to the secondary market. An\nincrease in mortgage interest rates\ntypically leads to a decrease in the\nvalue of these instruments. Conversely,\nwhen there is an increase in interest\nrates, the value of the MSRs will\nincrease driven by lower prepayment\nexpectations. Because the interest rate\nrisks of these hedged items offset, we\ncombine them into one overall hedged\nitem with one combined economic hedge\nportfolio consisting of derivative\ncontracts and securities.\n\nDuring 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded\ngains of $39 million, $321 million and\n$291 million. For more information on\nMSRs, see Note 20 \u2013 Fair Value\nMeasurements to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n                                                                                  \n   Compliance and Operational Risk Management                                     \n                                                                                  \nCompliance risk is the risk of legal or\nregulatory sanctions, material financial\nloss or damage to the reputation of the\nCorporation arising from the failure of\nthe Corporation to comply with the\nrequirements of applicable laws, rules,\nregulations and our internal policies\nand procedures (collectively, applicable\nlaws, rules and regulations). We are\nsubject to comprehensive regulation\nunder federal and state laws, rules and\nregulations in the U.S. and the laws of\nthe various jurisdictions in which we\noperate, including those related to\nfinancial crimes and anti-money\nlaundering, market conduct, trading\nactivities, fair lending, privacy, data\nprotection and unfair, deceptive or\nabusive acts or practices.\n\nOperational risk is the risk of loss\nresulting from inadequate or failed\nprocesses or systems, people or external\nevents, and includes legal risk.\nOperational risk may occur anywhere in\nthe Corporation, including third-party\nbusiness processes, and is not limited\nto operations functions. The Corporation\nfaces a number of key operational risks\nincluding third-party risk, model risk,\nconduct risk, technology risk,\ninformation security risk and data risk.\nOperational risk can result in financial\nlosses and reputational impacts and is a\ncomponent in the calculation of total\nRWA used in the Basel 3 capital\ncalculation. For more information on\nBasel 3 calculations, see Capital\nManagement on page 49.\n\nFLUs and control functions are first and\nforemost responsible for managing all\naspects of their businesses, including\ntheir compliance and operational risk.\nFLUs and control functions are required\nto understand their business processes\nand related risks and controls,\nincluding third-party dependencies and\nthe related regulatory requirements, and\nmonitor and report on the effectiveness\nof the control environment. In order to\nactively monitor and assess the\nperformance of their processes and\ncontrols, they must conduct\ncomprehensive quality assurance\nactivities and identify issues and risks\nto remediate control gaps and\nweaknesses. FLUs and control functions\nmust also adhere to compliance and\noperational risk appetite limits to meet\nstrategic, capital and financial\nplanning objectives. Finally, FLUs and\ncontrol functions are responsible for\nthe proactive identification, management\nand escalation of compliance and\noperational risks across the\nCorporation. Collectively, these efforts\nare important to strengthen their\ncompliance and operational resiliency,\nwhich is the ability to deliver critical\noperations through disruption.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America80                                                               \n                                                                                  \nGlobal Compliance and Operational Risk\nteams independently assess compliance\nand operational risk, monitor business\nactivities and processes and evaluate\nFLUs and control functions for adherence\nto applicable laws, rules and\nregulations, including identifying\nissues and risks, determining and\ndeveloping tests to be conducted by the\nEnterprise Independent Testing unit and\nreporting on the state of the control\nenvironment. Enterprise Independent\nTesting, an independent testing function\nwithin GRM, works with Global Compliance\nand Operational Risk, the FLUs and\ncontrol functions in the identification\nof testing needs and test design, and is\naccountable for test execution,\nreporting and analysis of results.\nCorporate Audit provides an independent\nassessment and validation through\ntesting of key compliance and\noperational risk processes and controls\nacross the Corporation.\n\nThe Corporation's Global Compliance\nEnterprise Policy and Operational Risk\nManagement \u2013 Enterprise Policy set the\nrequirements for reporting compliance\nand operational risk information to\nexecutive management as well as the\nBoard or appropriate Board-level\ncommittees and reflect Global Compliance\nand Operational Risk\u2019s responsibilities\nfor conducting independent oversight of\nthe Corporation\u2019s compliance and\noperational risk management activities.\nThe Board provides oversight of\ncompliance risk through its Audit\nCommittee and the ERC, and operational\nrisk through its ERC.\n\nA key operational risk facing the\nCorporation is information security,\nwhich includes cybersecurity.\nCybersecurity risk represents, among\nother things, exposure to failures or\ninterruptions of service or breaches of\nsecurity, including as a result of\nmalicious technological attacks, that\nimpact the confidentiality, availability\nor integrity of our or third parties'\noperations, systems or data. The\nCorporation seeks to mitigate\ninformation security risk and associated\nreputational and compliance risk by\nemploying a multi-layered and\nintelligence-led Global Information\nSecurity Program, which is focused on\npreparing for, preventing, detecting,\nmitigating, responding to and recovering\nfrom cyber threats and incidents and\nensuring the Corporation\u2019s processes\noperate effectively and mitigate the\naforementioned risks.\n\nThe Global Information Security Program\nis supported by three lines of defense.\nThe Global Information Security Team\nwithin the first line of defense is\nresponsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Global Information\nSecurity Program, which includes\ndefining policies and procedures to\nsafeguard the Corporation\u2019s information\nsystems and data, conducting\nvulnerability and third-party\ninformation security assessments,\ninformation security event management\n(e.g., responding to ransomware and\ndistributed denial of service attacks),\nevaluation of external cyber\nintelligence, supporting industry\ncybersecurity efforts and working with\ngovernmental agencies, as well as\ndeveloping employee training to support\nadherence to the Corporation\u2019s policies\nand procedures. As the second line of\ndefense, Global Compliance and\nOperational Risk independently assesses,\nmonitors and tests information security\nrisk across the Corporation as well as\nthe effectiveness of the Global\nInformation Security Program. Corporate\nAudit serves as the third line of\ndefense, conducting additional\nindependent review and validation of the\nfirst line processes and functions.\n\nThrough established governance\nstructures, we have processes to help\nfacilitate appropriate and effective\noversight of information security risk.\nThese routines enable our three lines of\ndefense and management to debate\ninformation security risks and monitor\ncontrol performance to allow for further\nescalation to executive management,\nmanagement and Board-level committees or\nto the Board, as appropriate. The Board\nis actively engaged in the oversight of\nBank of America\u2019s Global Information\nSecurity Program, primarily through the\nERC.\n                                                                                  \n   Reputational Risk Management                                                   \n                                                                                  \nReputational risk is the risk that\nnegative perception of the Corporation\nmay adversely impact profitability or\noperations. Reputational risk may result\nfrom many of the Corporation\u2019s\nactivities, including those related to\nthe management of our strategic,\noperational, compliance and credit\nrisks.\n\nThe Corporation manages reputational\nrisk through established policies and\ncontrols embedded throughout its\nbusiness and risk management processes.\nWe proactively monitor and identify\npotential reputational risk events and\nhave processes established to mitigate\nreputational risks in a timely manner.\nIf reputational risk events occur, we\nfocus on remediating the underlying\nissue and taking action to minimize\ndamage to the Corporation\u2019s reputation.\nThe Corporation has processes and\nprocedures in place to respond to events\nthat give rise to reputational risk,\nincluding educating individuals and\norganizations that influence public\nopinion, implementing external\ncommunication strategies to mitigate the\nrisk, and informing key stakeholders of\npotential reputational risks. The\nCorporation\u2019s organization and\ngovernance structure provides oversight\nof reputational risks. Reputational risk\nreporting is provided regularly and\ndirectly to management and the ERC,\nwhich provides primary oversight of\nreputational risk. In addition, each FLU\nhas a committee, which includes\nrepresentatives from Legal and Risk,\nthat is responsible for the oversight of\nreputational risk, including approval\nfor business activities that present\nelevated levels of reputational risks.\n                                                                                  \n   Climate Risk Management                                                        \n                                                                                  \nClimate-related risks are divided into\ntwo major categories: (1) risks related\nto the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy, which may entail extensive\npolicy, legal, technology and market\nchanges, and (2) risks related to the\nphysical impacts of climate change,\ndriven by extreme weather events, such\nas hurricanes and floods, as well as\nchronic longer-term shifts, such as\nrising average global temperatures and\nsea-level rise. These changes and events\ncan have broad impacts on operations,\nsupply chains, distribution networks,\ncustomers and markets and are otherwise\nreferred to, respectively, as transition\nrisk and physical risk. These risks can\nimpact both financial and nonfinancial\nrisk types. The impacts of transition\nrisk can lead to and amplify credit risk\nor market risk by reducing our\ncustomers\u2019 operating income or the value\nof their assets as well as expose us to\nreputational and/or litigation risk due\nto increased regulatory scrutiny or\nnegative public sentiment. Physical risk\ncan lead to increased credit risk by\ndiminishing borrowers\u2019 repayment\ncapacity or impacting the value of\ncollateral. In addition, it could pose\nincreased operational risk to our\nfacilities and people.\n                                                                                  \n  81Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nEffective management of climate risk\nrequires coordinated governance, clearly\ndefined roles and responsibilities and\nwell-developed processes to identify,\nmeasure, monitor and control risks. We\ncontinue to build out and enhance our\nclimate risk management capabilities. As\nclimate risk is interconnected with all\nkey risk types, we have developed and\ncontinue to enhance processes to embed\nclimate risk considerations into our\nRisk Framework and risk management\nprograms established for strategic,\ncredit, market, liquidity, compliance,\noperational and reputational risks. Our\nEnvironmental and Social Risk Policy\nFramework (ESRPF) aligns with our Risk\nFramework and provides additional\nclarity and transparency regarding our\napproach to environmental and social\nrisks, inclusive of climate risk.\n\nOur governance framework establishes\noversight of climate risk practices and\nstrategies by the Board, supported by\nits Corporate Governance, ESG, and\nSustainability Committee and ERC, as\nwell as the MRC and the Global ESG\nCommittee, both of which are management-\nlevel committees comprised of senior\nleaders across every major FLU and\ncontrol function.\n\nOur climate risk management efforts are\noverseen by the Global Climate Risk\nExecutive who reports to the CRO. The\nGlobal Climate Risk Executive chairs the\nClimate Risk Steering Council, which\nmeets monthly and shapes our approach to\nmanaging climate-related risks in line\nwith our Risk Framework.\n\nAs outlined in our ESRPF, we are focused\non supporting and financing areas\ncritical to the transition to a low-\ncarbon economy. Accordingly, we have a\ngoal, publicly announced in early 2021,\nto achieve net zero greenhouse gas\nemissions in our financing activities,\noperations and supply chain before 2050\n(Net Zero Goal). More broadly, achieving\nthis goal will require technological\nadvances, clearly defined roadmaps for\nindustry sectors, public policies, and\nbetter emissions data reporting, as well\nas ongoing, strong and active engagement\nwith clients, suppliers, investors,\ngovernment officials and other\nstakeholders.\n\nOur progress towards achieving our Net\nZero Goal is based on establishing the\nbaseline for emissions associated with\nour financing activities often referred\nto as financed emissions. Currently, we\nare using the Partnership for Carbon\nAccounting Financials methodology to\nassess our financed emissions.\nAdditionally, given the urgency required\nto address climate change, we helped to\nlaunch the Net Zero Banking Alliance\n(NZBA) in April 2021, which outlines\nguidelines for banks to achieve net zero\ngreenhouse gas emissions including\nrequirements for setting interim\ntargets. As a member of NZBA, the\nCorporation and more than 100 other\nfinancial institution members\nrepresenting more than 40 percent of the\nworld\u2019s banking assets, have committed\nto set emission reduction targets for\n2030. We plan to begin disclosure of\nfinanced emissions by 2023, and set 2030\ntargets for the significant majority of\nemissions in our portfolio.\n\nIn 2021, we also announced a goal to\ndeploy $1 trillion by 2030 to accelerate\nthe transition to a low-carbon,\nsustainable economy by providing\nlending, capital raising, advisory and\ninvestment services, and by developing\nother client-driven financial solutions.\nThis commitment anchors a broader $1.5\n\ntrillion sustainable finance goal to\nsupport both environmental transition\nand social inclusive development, which\nspans business activities across the\nglobe. These goals are intended to help\ndrive business opportunities and enhance\nrisk management related to the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nFor more information about climate risk,\nsee the Bank of America website.

These\nstatements are not guarantees of future\nresults or performance and involve\ncertain known and unknown risks,\nuncertainties and assumptions that are\ndifficult to predict and are often\nbeyond the Corporation\u2019s control. Actual\noutcomes and results may differ\nmaterially from those expressed in, or\nimplied by, any of these forward-looking\nstatements.\n                                                                                  \n  Complex Accounting Estimates                                                    \n                                                                                  \nOur significant accounting principles,\nas described in Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements, are\nessential in understanding the MD&A.\nMany of our significant accounting\nprinciples require complex judgments to\nestimate the values of assets and\nliabilities. We have procedures and\nprocesses in place to facilitate making\nthese judgments.\n\nThe more judgmental estimates are\nsummarized in the following discussion.\nWe have identified and described the\ndevelopment of the variables most\nimportant in the estimation processes\nthat involve mathematical models to\nderive the estimates. In many cases,\nthere are numerous alternative judgments\nthat could be used in the process of\ndetermining the inputs to the models.\nWhere alternatives exist, we have used\nthe factors that we believe represent\nthe most reasonable value in developing\nthe inputs. Actual performance that\ndiffers from our estimates of the key\nvariables could materially impact our\nresults of operations. Separate from the\npossible future impact to our results of\noperations from input and model\nvariables, the value of our lending\nportfolio and market-sensitive assets\nand liabilities may change subsequent to\nthe balance sheet date, often\nsignificantly, due to the nature and\nmagnitude of future credit and market\nconditions. Such credit and market\nconditions may change quickly and in\nunforeseen ways and the resulting\nvolatility could have a significant,\nnegative effect on future operating\nresults. These fluctuations would not be\nindicative of deficiencies in our models\nor inputs.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America82                                                               \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Allowance for Credit Losses                                                     \n                                                                                  \nThe allowance for credit losses includes\nthe allowance for loan and lease losses\nand the reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments. Our process for determining\nthe allowance for credit losses is\ndiscussed in Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles and\nNote 5 \u2013 Outstanding Loans and Leases\nand Allowance for Credit Losses to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe determination of allowance for\ncredit losses is based on numerous\nestimates and assumptions, which require\na high degree of judgment and are often\ninterrelated. A critical judgment in the\nprocess is the weighting of our forward-\nlooking macroeconomic scenarios that are\nincorporated into our quantitative\nmodels. As any one economic outlook is\ninherently uncertain, the Corporation\nuses multiple macroeconomic scenarios in\nits expected credit losses (ECL)\ncalculation, which have included a\nbaseline scenario, which is derived from\nconsensus estimates, downside scenarios,\na tail risk scenario similar to the\nseverely adverse scenario used in stress\ntesting and an upside scenario.\nBeginning in 2020, the scenarios\nincorporated the potential impacts of\nthe pandemic and, beginning in the\nsecond quarter in 2021, an additional\nscenario was added to account for\ninflationary risk and higher interest\nrates. Generally, as the consensus\nestimates improve or deteriorate, the\nallowance for credit losses will change\nin a similar direction.\n\nThere are multiple variables that drive\nthe macroeconomic scenarios with the key\nvariables including, but not limited to,\nU.S. gross domestic product (GDP) and\nunemployment rates. As of December 31,\n2020, the weighted macroeconomic outlook\nfor U.S. average unemployment rate was\nforecasted at 6.6 percent, 5.5 percent\nand 5.0 percent in the fourth quarters\nof 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively,\nand the weighted macroeconomic outlook\nfor U.S. GDP was forecasted to grow at\n2.5 percent, 2.4 percent and 2.1 percent\nyear-over-year in the fourth quarters of\n2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. As of\nDecember 31, 2021 the latest consensus\nestimates for the U.S. average\nunemployment rate for the fourth quarter\nof 2021 was 4.4 percent and U.S. GDP was\nforecasted to grow 5.2 percent year-\nover-year in the fourth quarter of 2021,\nboth of which were meaningfully better\nthan our macroeconomic outlook as of\nDecember 31, 2020 and were factored into\nour December 31, 2021 allowance for\ncredit losses estimate. In addition, as\nof December 31, 2021, the weighted\nmacroeconomic outlook for the U.S.\naverage unemployment rate was forecasted\nat 5.2 percent and 4.7 percent in the\nfourth quarters of 2022 and 2023, and\nthe weighted macroeconomic outlook for\nU.S. GDP was forecasted to grow 2.1\npercent and 1.9 percent year-over-year\nin the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2023.\n\nIn addition to the above judgments and\nestimates, the allowance for credit\nlosses can also be impacted by\nunanticipated changes in asset quality\nof the portfolio, such as increases or\ndecreases in credit and/or internal risk\nratings in our commercial portfolio,\nimprovement or deterioration in borrower\ndelinquencies or credit scores in our\ncredit card portfolio and increases or\ndecreases in home prices, which is a\nprimary driver of LTVs, in our consumer\nreal estate portfolio, all\n\nof which have some degree of\nuncertainty. As the macroeconomic\noutlook improved in 2021, along with\nimprovements in asset quality, the\nallowance for credit losses decreased to\n$13.8 billion from $20.7 billion at\nDecember 31, 2020.\n\nTo provide an illustration of the\nsensitivity of the macroeconomic\nscenarios and other assumptions on the\nestimate of our allowance for credit\nlosses, the Corporation compared the\nDecember 31, 2021 modeled ECL from the\nbaseline scenario and our downside\nscenario. Relative to the baseline\nscenario, the downside scenario assumed\na peak U.S. unemployment rate of\napproximately three percentage points\nhigher than the consensus outlook, a\ndecline in U.S. GDP followed by a\nprolonged recovery and a lower home\nprice outlook with a difference of 14\npercent at the trough. This sensitivity\nanalysis resulted in a hypothetical\nincrease in the allowance for credit\nlosses of approximately $5 billion.\n\nWhile the sensitivity analysis may be\nuseful to understand how changes in\nmacroeconomic assumptions could impact\nour modeled ECLs, it is not meant to\nforecast how our allowance for credit\nlosses is expected to change in a\ndifferent macroeconomic outlook.\nImportantly, the analysis does not\nincorporate a variety of factors,\nincluding qualitative reserves and the\nweighting of alternate scenarios, which\ncould have offsetting effects on the\nestimate. Considering the variety of\nfactors contemplated when developing and\nweighting macroeconomic outlooks such as\nrecent economic events, leading economic\nindicators, views of internal and third-\nparty economists and industry trends, in\naddition to other qualitative factors,\nthe Corporation believes the allowance\nfor credit losses at December 31, 2021\nis appropriate.\n                                                                                  \n   Fair Value of Financial Instruments                                            \n                                                                                  \nUnder applicable accounting standards,\nwe are required to maximize the use of\nobservable inputs and minimize the use\nof unobservable inputs in measuring fair\nvalue. We classify fair value\nmeasurements of financial instruments\nand MSRs based on the three-level fair\nvalue hierarchy in the accounting\nstandards.\n\nThe fair values of assets and\nliabilities may include adjustments,\nsuch as market liquidity and credit\nquality, where appropriate. Valuations\nof products using models or other\ntechniques are sensitive to assumptions\nused for the significant inputs. Where\nmarket data is available, the inputs\nused for valuation reflect that\ninformation as of our valuation date.\nInputs to valuation models are\nconsidered unobservable if they are\nsupported by little or no market\nactivity. In periods of extreme\nvolatility, lessened liquidity or in\nilliquid markets, there may be more\nvariability in market pricing or a lack\nof market data to use in the valuation\nprocess. In keeping with the prudent\napplication of estimates and management\njudgment in determining the fair value\nof assets and liabilities, we have in\nplace various processes and controls\nthat include: a model validation policy\nthat requires review and approval of\nquantitative models used for deal\npricing, financial statement fair value\ndetermination and risk quantification; a\ntrading product valuation policy that\nrequires verification of all traded\nproduct valuations; and a periodic\nreview and substantiation of daily\nprofit and loss\n                                                                                  \n  83Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nreporting for all traded products.\nPrimarily through validation controls,\nwe utilize both broker and pricing\nservice inputs which can and do include\nboth market-observable and internally-\nmodeled values and/or valuation inputs.\nOur reliance on this information is\naffected by our understanding of how the\nbroker and/or pricing service develops\nits data with a higher degree of\nreliance applied to those that are more\ndirectly observable and lesser reliance\napplied to those developed through their\nown internal modeling. For example,\nbroker quotes in less active markets may\nonly be indicative and therefore less\nreliable. These processes and controls\nare performed independently of the\nbusiness.

The fair value of these Level\n3 financial assets and liabilities and\nMSRs is determined using pricing models,\ndiscounted cash flow methodologies or\nsimilar techniques for which the\ndetermination of fair value requires\nsignificant management judgment or\nestimation.\n\nLevel 3 financial instruments may be\nhedged with derivatives classified as\nLevel 1 or 2; therefore, gains or losses\nassociated with Level 3 financial\ninstruments may be offset by gains or\nlosses associated with financial\ninstruments classified in other levels\nof the fair value hierarchy. The Level 3\ngains and losses recorded in earnings\ndid not have a significant impact on our\nliquidity or capital. We conduct a\nreview of our fair value hierarchy\nclassifications on a quarterly basis.\nTransfers into or out of Level 3 are\nmade if the significant inputs used in\nthe financial models measuring the fair\nvalues of the assets and liabilities\nbecame unobservable or observable,\nrespectively, in the current\nmarketplace.

We currently file\nincome tax returns in more than 100\njurisdictions and consider many factors,\nincluding statutory, judicial and\n\nregulatory guidance, in estimating the\nappropriate accrued income taxes for\neach jurisdiction.\n\nNet deferred tax assets, reported as a\ncomponent of other assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, represent\nthe net decrease in taxes expected to be\npaid in the future because of net\noperating loss (NOL) and tax credit\ncarryforwards and because of future\nreversals of temporary differences in\nthe bases of assets and liabilities as\nmeasured by tax laws and their bases as\nreported in the financial statements.\nNOL and tax credit carryforwards result\nin reductions to future tax liabilities,\nand many of these attributes can expire\nif not utilized within certain periods.\nWe consider the need for valuation\nallowances to reduce net deferred tax\nassets to the amounts that we estimate\nare more likely than not to be realized.\n\nConsistent with the applicable\naccounting guidance, we monitor relevant\ntax authorities and change our estimates\nof accrued income taxes and/or net\ndeferred tax assets due to changes in\nincome tax laws and their interpretation\nby the courts and regulatory\nauthorities. These revisions of our\nestimates, which also may result from\nour income tax planning and from the\nresolution of income tax audit matters,\nmay be material to our operating results\nfor any given period.\n\nSee Note 19 \u2013 Income Taxes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements for a\ntable of significant tax attributes and\n\nadditional information.

Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because\nof changes in conditions, or that the\ndegree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of\nthe Corporation\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31,\n2021 based on the framework set forth by\nthe Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission\nin Internal Control \u2013 Integrated\nFramework (2013) . Based on that\nassessment, management concluded that,\nas of December 31, 2021, the\nCorporation\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting is effective.\n\nThe Corporation\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31,\n2021 has been audited by\nPricewaterhouseCoopers , LLP , an\nindependent registered public accounting\nfirm, as stated in their accompanying\nreport which expresses an unqualified\nopinion on the effectiveness of the\nCorporation\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31,\n2021.\n                                                                                  \n  Brian T.

Our\nresponsibility is to express opinions on\nthe Corporation\u2019s consolidated financial\nstatements and on the Corporation's\ninternal control over financial\nreporting based on our audits. We are a\npublic accounting firm registered with\nthe Public Company Accounting Oversight\nBoard (United States) (PCAOB) and are\nrequired to be independent with respect\nto the Corporation in accordance with\nthe U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance\nwith the standards of the PCAOB. Those\nstandards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated\nfinancial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and whether effective\ninternal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material\nrespects. Our audits of the consolidated\nfinancial statements included performing\nprocedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the\nconsolidated financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to\nthose risks. Such procedures included\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence\n\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in\nthe consolidated financial statements.\nOur audits also included evaluating the\naccounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the\noverall presentation of the consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our audit of\ninternal control over financial\nreporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, assessing the risk\nthat a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and\noperating effectiveness of internal\ncontrol based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such\nother procedures as we considered\nnecessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal\nControl over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting is a process\ndesigned to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external\npurposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A\ncompany\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those\npolicies and procedures that (i) pertain\nto the maintenance of records that, in\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly\nreflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of the\ncompany; (ii) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded\nas necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being\nmade only in accordance with\nauthorizations of management and\ndirectors of the company; and (iii)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company\u2019s assets that\ncould have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations,\ninternal control over financial\nreporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because\nof changes in conditions, or that the\ndegree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n                                                                                  \n  Critical Audit Matters                                                          \n                                                                                  \nThe critical audit matters communicated\nbelow are matters arising from the\ncurrent period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that were\ncommunicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and\nthat (i) relate to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the\nconsolidated financial statements and\n(ii) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex\njudgments. The communication of critical\naudit matters does not alter in any way\nour opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole,\nand we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matters below, providing\nseparate opinions on the critical audit\nmatters or on the accounts or\ndisclosures to which they relate.\n\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses -\nCommercial and Consumer Card Loans\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the\nconsolidated financial statements, the\nallowance for loan and lease losses\nrepresents management\u2019s estimate of the\nexpected credit losses in the\nCorporation\u2019s loan and lease portfolio,\nexcluding loans and unfunded lending\ncommitments accounted for under the fair\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America88                                                               \n                                                                                  \nvalue option. As of December 31, 2021,\nthe allowance for loan and lease losses\nwas $12.4 billion on total loans and\nleases of $971.3 billion, which excludes\nloans accounted for under the fair value\noption. For commercial and consumer card\nloans, the expected credit loss is\ntypically estimated using quantitative\nmethods that consider a variety of\nfactors such as historical loss\nexperience, the current credit quality\nof the portfolio as well as an economic\noutlook over the life of the loan. In\nits loss forecasting framework, the\nCorporation incorporates forward looking\ninformation through the use of\nmacroeconomic scenarios applied over the\nforecasted life of the assets. These\nmacroeconomic scenarios include\nvariables that have historically been\nkey drivers of increases and decreases\nin credit losses. These variables\ninclude, but are not limited to,\nunemployment rates, real estate prices,\ngross domestic product levels and\ncorporate bond spreads. The scenarios\nthat are chosen and the weighting given\nto each scenario depend on a variety of\nfactors including recent economic\nevents, leading economic indicators,\nviews of internal as well as third-party\neconomists and industry trends. Also\nincluded in the allowance for loan and\nlease losses are qualitative reserves to\ncover losses that are expected but, in\nthe Corporation's assessment, may not be\nadequately reflected in the quantitative\nmethods or the economic assumptions.\nFactors that the Corporation considers\ninclude changes in lending policies and\nprocedures, business conditions, the\nnature and size of the portfolio,\nportfolio concentrations, the volume and\nseverity of past due loans and\nnonaccrual loans, the effect of external\nfactors such as competition, and legal\nand regulatory requirements, among\nothers. Further, the Corporation\nconsiders the inherent uncertainty in\nquantitative models that are built on\nhistorical data.\n\nThe principal considerations for our\ndetermination that performing procedures\nrelating to the allowance for loan and\nlease losses for the commercial and\nconsumer card portfolios is a critical\naudit matter are (i) the significant\njudgment and estimation by management in\ndeveloping lifetime economic forecast\nscenarios, related weightings to each\nscenario and certain qualitative\nreserves, which in turn led to a high\ndegree of auditor judgment, subjectivity\nand effort in performing procedures and\nin evaluating audit evidence obtained,\nand (ii) the audit effort involved\nprofessionals with specialized skill and\nknowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved\nperforming procedures and evaluating\naudit evidence in connection with\nforming our overall opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements. These\nprocedures included testing the\neffectiveness of controls relating to\nthe allowance for loan and lease losses,\nincluding controls over the evaluation\nand approval of models, forecast\nscenarios and related weightings, and\nqualitative reserves. These procedures\nalso included, among others, testing\nmanagement\u2019s process for estimating the\nallowance for loan and lease losses,\nincluding (i) evaluating the\nappropriateness of the loss forecast\nmodels and methodology, (ii) evaluating\nthe reasonableness of certain\nmacroeconomic variables, (iii)\nevaluating the reasonableness of\nmanagement\u2019s development, selection and\nweighting of lifetime economic forecast\nscenarios used in the loss forecast\nmodels, (iv) testing the completeness\nand accuracy of data used in the\nestimate, and (v) evaluating the\nreasonableness of certain qualitative\nreserves made to the model output\nresults to determine the overall\nallowance for loan\n\nand lease losses.

The Corporation determines\nthe fair value of Level 3 financial\ninstruments using pricing models,\ndiscounted cash flow methodologies, or\nsimilar techniques that require inputs\nthat are both unobservable and are\nsignificant to the overall fair value\nmeasurement. Unobservable inputs, such\nas volatility or price, may be\ndetermined using quantitative-based\nextrapolations or other internal\nmethodologies which incorporate\nmanagement estimates and available\nmarket information.\n\nThe principal considerations for our\ndetermination that performing procedures\nrelating to the valuation of certain\nLevel 3 financial instruments is a\ncritical audit matter are the\nsignificant judgment and estimation used\nby management to determine the fair\nvalue of these financial instruments,\nwhich in turn led to a high degree of\nauditor judgment, subjectivity and\neffort in performing procedures and in\nevaluating audit evidence obtained,\nincluding the involvement of\nprofessionals with specialized skill and\nknowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved\nperforming procedures and evaluating\naudit evidence in connection with\nforming our overall opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements. These\nprocedures included testing the\neffectiveness of controls relating to\nthe valuation of financial instruments,\nincluding controls related to valuation\nmodels, significant unobservable inputs,\nand data. These procedures also\nincluded, among others, the involvement\nof professionals with specialized skill\nand knowledge to assist in developing an\nindependent estimate of fair value for a\nsample of these certain financial\ninstruments and comparison of\nmanagement\u2019s estimate to the\nindependently developed estimate of fair\nvalue. Developing the independent\nestimate involved testing the\ncompleteness and accuracy of data\nprovided by management and evaluating\nthe reasonableness of management\u2019s\nsignificant unobservable inputs.\n\nCharlotte, North Carolina\n\nFebruary 22, 2022\n\nWe have served as the Corporation\u2019s\nauditor since 1958.\n

diverse range of\nfinancial services and products\nthroughout the U.S. and in certain\ninternational markets. The term \u201cthe\nCorporation\u201d as used herein may refer to\nBank of America Corporation,\nindividually, Bank of America\nCorporation and its subsidiaries, or\ncertain of Bank of America Corporation\u2019s\nsubsidiaries or affiliates. Principles\nof Consolidation and Basis of\nPresentation The Consolidated Financial\nStatements include the accounts of the\nCorporation and its majority-owned\nsubsidiaries and those variable interest\nentities (VIEs) where the Corporation is\nthe primary beneficiary. Intercompany\naccounts and transactions have been\neliminated. Results of operations of\nacquired companies are included from the\ndates of acquisition, and for VIEs, from\nthe dates that the Corporation became\nthe primary beneficiary. Assets held in\nan agency or fiduciary capacity are not\nincluded in the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. The Corporation accounts for\ninvestments in companies for which it\nowns a voting interest and for which it\nhas the ability to exercise significant\ninfluence over operating and financing\ndecisions using the equity method of\naccounting. These investments, which\ninclude the Corporation\u2019s interests in\naffordable housing and renewable energy\npartnerships, are recorded in other\nassets. Equity method investments are\nsubject to impairment testing, and the\nCorporation\u2019s proportionate share of\nincome or loss is included in other\nincome. The preparation of the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in\nconformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States\nof America requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect\nreported amounts and disclosures. Actual\nresults could materially differ from\nthose estimates and assumptions. Certain\nprior-period amounts have been\nreclassified to conform to current\nperiod presentation. Significant\nAccounting Principles Cash and Cash\nEquivalents Cash and cash equivalents\ninclude cash on hand, cash items in the\nprocess of collection, cash segregated\nunder federal and other brokerage\nregulations, and amounts due from\ncorrespondent banks, the Federal Reserve\nBank and certain non-U.S. central banks.\nCertain cash balances are restricted as\nto withdrawal or usage by legally\nbinding contractual agreements or\nregulatory requirements. Securities\nFinancing Agreements Securities borrowed\nor purchased under agreements to resell\nand securities loaned or sold under\nagreements to repurchase (securities\nfinancing agreements) are treated as\ncollateralized financing transactions\nexcept in instances where the\ntransaction is required to be accounted\nfor as individual sale and purchase\ntransactions. Generally, these\nagreements are recorded at acquisition\nor sale price plus accrued interest. In\ninstances where the interest is\nnegative, the Corporation\u2019s policy is to\npresent negative interest on financial\nassets as interest income and negative\ninterest on financial liabilities as\ninterest expense. For securities\nfinancing agreements that are accounted\nfor under the fair value option, the\nchanges in the fair value of these\nsecurities financing agreements are\nrecorded in market\n\nmaking and similar activities in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income. The\nCorporation\u2019s policy is to monitor the\nmarket value of the principal amount\nloaned under resale agreements and\nobtain collateral from or return\ncollateral pledged to counterparties\nwhen appropriate. Securities financing\nagreements do not create material credit\nrisk due to these collateral provisions;\ntherefore, an allowance for loan losses\nis not necessary. In transactions where\nthe Corporation acts as the lender in a\nsecurities lending agreement and\nreceives securities that can be pledged\nor sold as collateral, it recognizes an\nasset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet\nat fair value, representing the\nsecurities received, and a liability,\nrepresenting the obligation to return\nthose securities. Collateral The\nCorporation accepts securities and loans\nas collateral that it is permitted by\ncontract or practice to sell or\nrepledge. At December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nthe fair value of this collateral was $\n854.8billion and $ 812.4billion, of\nwhich $ 782.7billion and $ 758.5billion\nwere sold or repledged. The primary\nsource of this collateral is securities\nborrowed or purchased under agreements\nto resell. The Corporation also pledges\ncompany-owned securities and loans as\ncollateral in transactions that include\nrepurchase agreements, securities\nloaned, public and trust deposits, U.S.\nTreasury tax and loan notes, and short-\nterm borrowings. This collateral, which\nin some cases can be sold or repledged\nby the counterparties to the\ntransactions, is parenthetically\ndisclosed on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. In certain cases, the Corporation\nhas transferred assets to consolidated\nVIEs where those restricted assets serve\nas collateral for the interests issued\nby the VIEs. These assets are included\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet in\nAssets of Consolidated VIEs. In\naddition, the Corporation obtains\ncollateral in connection with its\nderivative contracts. Required\ncollateral levels vary depending on the\ncredit risk rating and the type of\ncounterparty. Generally, the Corporation\naccepts collateral in the form of cash,\nU.S. Treasury securities and other\nmarketable securities. Based on\nprovisions contained in master netting\nagreements, the Corporation nets cash\ncollateral received against derivative\nassets. The Corporation also pledges\ncollateral on its own derivative\npositions which can be applied against\nderivative liabilities. Trading\nInstruments Financial instruments\nutilized in trading activities are\ncarried at fair value. Fair value is\ngenerally based on quoted market prices\nfor the same or similar assets and\nliabilities. If these market prices are\nnot available, fair values are estimated\nbased on dealer quotes, pricing models,\ndiscounted cash flow methodologies, or\nsimilar techniques where the\ndetermination of fair value may require\nsignificant management judgment or\nestimation. Realized gains and losses\nare recorded on a trade-date basis.\nRealized and unrealized gains and losses\nare recognized in market making and\nsimilar activities. Derivatives and\nHedging Activities Derivatives are\nentered into on behalf of customers, for\ntrading or to support risk management\nactivities. Derivatives used in risk\nmanagement activities include\nderivatives that are both designated in\nqualifying accounting hedge\nrelationships and derivatives used to\nhedge market risks in relationships that\nare\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America94                                                               \n                                                                                  \nnot designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships (referred to as other\nrisk management activities). The Corporation manages interest rate and foreign\ncurrency exchange rate sensitivity predominantly through the use of derivatives.\nDerivatives utilized by the Corporation include swaps, futures and forward\nsettlement contracts, and option contracts. All derivatives are recorded on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, taking into consideration the effects of\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements that allow the Corporation to settle\npositive and negative positions and offset cash collateral held with the same\ncounterparty on a net basis. For exchange-traded contracts, fair value is based on\nquoted market prices in active or inactive markets or is derived from observable\nmarket-based pricing parameters, similar to those applied to over-the-counter\n(OTC) derivatives. For non-exchange traded contracts, fair value is based on\ndealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar\ntechniques for which the determination of fair value may require significant\nmanagement judgment or estimation. Valuations of derivative assets and liabilities\nreflect the value of the instrument including counterparty credit risk. These\nvalues also take into account the Corporation\u2019s own credit standing. Trading\nDerivatives and Other Risk Management Activities Derivatives held for trading\npurposes are included in derivative assets or derivative liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet with changes in fair value included in market making\nand similar activities. Derivatives used for other risk management activities are\nincluded in derivative assets or derivative liabilities. Derivatives used in other\nrisk management activities have not been designated in qualifying accounting hedge\nrelationships because they did not qualify or the risk that is being mitigated\npertains to an item that is reported at fair value through earnings so that the\neffect of measuring the derivative instrument and the asset or liability to which\nthe risk exposure pertains will offset in the Consolidated Statement of Income to\nthe extent effective. The changes in the fair value of derivatives that serve to\nmitigate certain risks associated with mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), interest\nrate lock commitments (IRLCs) and first-lien mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS)\nthat are originated by the Corporation are recorded in other income. Changes in\nthe fair value of derivatives that serve to mitigate interest rate risk and\nforeign currency risk are included in market making and similar activities. Credit\nderivatives are also used by the Corporation to mitigate the risk associated with\nvarious credit exposures. The changes in the fair value of these derivatives are\nincluded in market making and similar activities and other income. Derivatives\nUsed For Hedge Accounting Purposes (Accounting Hedges) For accounting hedges, the\nCorporation formally documents at inception all relationships between hedging\ninstruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objectives and\nstrategies for undertaking various accounting hedges. Additionally, the\nCorporation primarily uses regression analysis at the inception of a hedge and for\neach reporting period thereafter to assess whether the derivative used in an\naccounting hedge transaction is expected to be and has been highly effective in\noffsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item or forecasted\ntransaction. The Corporation discontinues hedge accounting when it is determined\nthat a derivative is not expected to be or has ceased to be highly effective as a\nhedge, and then reflects changes in fair value of the derivative in earnings after\ntermination of the hedge relationship. Fair value hedges are used to protect\nagainst changes in the fair value of the Corporation\u2019s assets and liabilities that\nare attributable to interest rate or foreign exchange volatility. Changes in the\nfair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded in\nearnings, together and in the same income statement line item with changes in the\nfair value of the related hedged item. If a derivative instrument in a fair value\nhedge is terminated or the hedge designation removed, the previous adjustments to\nthe carrying value of the hedged asset or liability are subsequently accounted for\nin the same manner as other components of the carrying value of that asset or\nliability. For interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, such\nadjustments are amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the respective\nasset or liability. Cash flow hedges are used primarily to minimize the\nvariability in cash flows of assets and liabilities or forecasted transactions\ncaused by interest rate or foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The Corporation\nalso uses cash flow hedges to hedge the price risk associated with deferred\ncompensation. Changes in the fair value of derivatives used in cash flow hedges\nare recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) and are reclassified\ninto the line item in the income statement in which the hedged item is recorded in\nthe same period the hedged item affects earnings. Components of a derivative that\nare excluded in assessing hedge effectiveness are recorded in the same income\nstatement line item as the hedged item. Net investment hedges are used to manage\nthe foreign exchange rate sensitivity arising from a net investment in a foreign\noperation. Changes in the spot prices of derivatives that are designated as net\ninvestment hedges of foreign operations are recorded as a component of accumulated\nOCI. The remaining components of these derivatives are excluded in assessing hedge\neffectiveness and are recorded in market making and similar activities. Securities\nDebt securities are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their trade\ndate. Their classification is dependent on the purpose for which the securities\nwere acquired. Debt securities purchased for use in the Corporation\u2019s trading\nactivities are reported in trading account assets at fair value with unrealized\ngains and losses included in market making and similar activities. Substantially\nall other debt securities purchased are used in the Corporation\u2019s asset and\nliability management (ALM) activities and are reported on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet as either debt securities carried at fair value or as held-to-maturity (HTM)\ndebt securities. Debt securities carried at fair value are either available-for-\nsale (AFS) securities with unrealized gains and losses net-of-tax included in\naccumulated OCI or carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported\nin market making and similar activities. HTM debt securities are debt securities\nthat management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported at\namortized cost. The Corporation evaluates each AFS security where the value has\ndeclined below amortized cost. If the Corporation intends to sell or believes it\nis more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt security, it is\nwritten down to fair value through earnings. For AFS debt securities the\nCorporation intends to hold, the Corporation evaluates the debt securities for\nexpected credit losses (ECL), except for debt securities that are\n                                                                                  \n  95Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nguaranteed by the U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agencies or sovereign entities of\nhigh credit quality where the Corporation applies a zero credit loss assumption.\nFor the remaining AFS debt securities, the Corporation considers qualitative\nparameters such as internal and external credit ratings and the value of\nunderlying collateral. If an AFS debt security fails any of the qualitative\nparameters, a discounted cash flow analysis is used by the Corporation to\ndetermine if a portion of the unrealized loss is a result of an expected credit\nloss. The Corporation will then recognize either credit loss expense or a reversal\nof credit loss expense in other income for the amount necessary to adjust the debt\nsecurities valuation allowance to its current estimate of excepted credit losses.\nCash flows expected to be collected are estimated using all relevant information\navailable such as remaining payment terms, prepayment speeds, the financial\ncondition of the issuer, expected defaults and the value of the underlying\ncollateral. If any of the decline in fair value is related to market factors, that\namount is recognized in accumulated OCI. In certain instances, the credit loss may\nexceed the total decline in fair value, in which case, the allowance recorded is\nlimited to the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the\nasset. The Corporation separately evaluates its HTM debt securities for any credit\nlosses, of which substantially all qualify for the zero loss assumption. For the\nremaining securities, the Corporation performs a discounted cash flow analysis to\nestimate any credit losses which are then recognized as part of the allowance for\ncredit losses. Interest on debt securities, including amortization of premiums and\naccretion of discounts, is included in interest income. Premiums and discounts are\namortized or accreted to interest income at a constant effective yield over the\ncontractual lives of the securities. Realized gains and losses from the sales of\ndebt securities are determined using the specific identification method. Equity\nsecurities with readily determinable fair values that are not held for trading\npurposes are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in\nother income. Equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values\nare recorded at cost less impairment, if any, plus or minus qualifying observable\nprice changes. These securities are reported in other assets. Loans and Leases\nLoans, with the exception of loans accounted for under the fair value option, are\nmeasured at historical cost and reported at their outstanding principal balances\nnet of any unearned income, charge-offs, unamortized deferred fees and costs on\noriginated loans, and for purchased loans, net of any unamortized premiums or\ndiscounts. Loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred\nand recognized as adjustments to interest income over the lives of the related\nloans. Unearned income, discounts and premiums are amortized to interest income\nusing a level yield methodology. The Corporation elects to account for certain\nconsumer and commercial loans under the fair value option with interest reported\nin interest income and changes in fair value reported in market making and similar\nactivities or other income. Under applicable accounting guidance, for reporting\npurposes, the loan and lease portfolio is categorized by portfolio segment and,\nwithin each portfolio segment, by class of financing receivables. A portfolio\nsegment is defined as the level at which an entity develops and documents a\nsystematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses, and a class\nof financing receivables is defined as the level of disaggregation of portfolio\nsegments based on the initial measurement attribute, risk characteristics and\nmethods for assessing risk. The Corporation\u2019s threeportfolio segments are Consumer\nReal Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial. The classes within\nthe Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment are residential mortgage and home\nequity . The classes within the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment\nare credit card, direct/indirect consumer and other consumer. The classes within\nthe Commercial portfolio segment are U.S. commercial, non-U.S. commercial,\ncommercial real estate, commercial lease financing and U.S. small business\ncommercial. Leases The Corporation provides equipment financing to its customers\nthrough a variety of lessor arrangements. Direct financing leases and sales-type\nleases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments receivable plus the\nestimated residual value of the leased property less unearned income, which is\naccreted to interest income over the lease terms using methods that approximate\nthe interest method. Operating lease income is recognized on a straight-line\nbasis. The Corporation's lease arrangements generally do not contain non-lease\ncomponents. Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses includes\nboth the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments and represents management\u2019s estimate of the ECL in the Corporation\u2019s\nloan and lease portfolio, excluding loans and unfunded lending commitments\naccounted for under the fair value option. The ECL on funded consumer and\ncommercial loans and leases is referred to as the allowance for loan and lease\nlosses and is reported separately as a contra-asset to loans and leases on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. The ECL for unfunded lending commitments, including\nhome equity lines of credit (HELOCs), standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and\nbinding unfunded loan commitments is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in\naccrued expenses and other liabilities. The provision for credit losses related to\nthe loan and lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments is reported in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income at the amount necessary to adjust the allowance\nfor credit losses to the current estimate of ECL. For loans and leases, the ECL is\ntypically estimated using quantitative methods that consider a variety of factors\nsuch as historical loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio as\nwell as an economic outlook over the life of the loan. The life of the loan for\nclosed-ended products is based on the contractual maturity of the loan adjusted\nfor any expected prepayments. The contractual maturity includes any extension\noptions that are at the sole discretion of the borrower. For open-ended products\n(e.g., lines of credit), the ECL is determined based on the maximum repayment term\nassociated with future draws from credit lines unless those lines of credit are\nunconditionally cancellable (e.g., credit cards) in which case the Corporation\ndoes not record any allowance. In its loss forecasting framework, the Corporation\nincorporates forward-looking information through the use of macroeconomic\nscenarios applied over the forecasted life of the assets. These macroeconomic\nscenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases\nand decreases in credit losses. These variables include, but are not limited to,\nunemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels and\ncorporate bond spreads. As any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the\nCorporation leverages\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America96                                                               \n                                                                                  \nmultiple scenarios. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the weighting\ngiven to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic\nevents, leading economic indicators, views of internal and third-party economists\nand industry trends. The estimate of credit losses includes expected recoveries of\namounts previously charged off (i.e., negative allowance). If a loan has been\ncharged off, the expected cash flows on the loan are not limited by the current\namortized cost balance. Instead, expected cash flows can be assumed up to the\nunpaid principal balance immediately prior to the charge-off. The allowance for\nloan and lease losses for troubled debt restructurings (TDR) is measured based on\nthe present value of projected future lifetime principal and interest cash flows\ndiscounted at the loan\u2019s original effective interest rate, or in cases where\nforeclosure is probable or the loan is collateral dependent, at the loan\u2019s\ncollateral value or its observable market price, if available. The measurement of\nECL for the renegotiated consumer credit card TDR portfolio is based on the\npresent value of projected cash flows discounted using the average TDR portfolio\ncontractual interest rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior\nto restructuring. Projected cash flows for TDRs use the same economic outlook as\ndiscussed above. For purposes of computing this specific loss component of the\nallowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired\nloans are evaluated as a pool. Also included in the allowance for loan and lease\nlosses are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the\nCorporation's assessment, may not be adequately reflected in the quantitative\nmethods or the economic assumptions described above. For example, factors that the\nCorporation considers include changes in lending policies and procedures, business\nconditions, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the\nvolume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external\nfactors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements, among others.\nFurther, the Corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in quantitative models\nthat are built on historical data. With the exception of the Corporation's credit\ncard portfolio, the Corporation does not include reserves for interest receivable\nin the measurement of the allowance for credit losses as the Corporation generally\nclassifies consumer loans as nonperforming at 90 days past due and reverses\ninterest income for these loans at that time. For credit card loans, the\nCorporation reserves for interest and fees as part of the allowance for loan and\nlease losses. Upon charge-off of a credit card loan, the Corporation reverses the\ninterest and fee income against the income statement line item where it was\noriginally recorded. The Corporation has identified the following threeportfolio\nsegments and measures the allowance for credit losses using the following methods.\nConsumer Real Estate To estimate ECL for consumer loans secured by residential\nreal estate, the Corporation estimates the number of loans that will default over\nthe life of the existing portfolio, after factoring in estimated prepayments,\nusing quantitative modeling methodologies. The attributes that are most\nsignificant in estimating the Corporation\u2019s ECL include refreshed loan-to-value\n(LTV) or, in the case of a subordinated lien, refreshed combined LTV (CLTV),\nborrower credit score, months since origination and geography, all of which are\nfurther broken down by present collection status (whether the loan is current,\ndelinquent, in default, or in bankruptcy). The estimates are based on the\nCorporation\u2019s historical experience with the loan portfolio, adjusted to reflect\nthe economic outlook. The outlook on the unemployment rate and consumer real\nestate prices are key factors that impact the frequency and severity of loss\nestimates. The Corporation does not reserve for credit losses on the unpaid\nprincipal balance of loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and\nlong-term standby loans, as these loans are fully insured. The Corporation records\na reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the ECL associated with the undrawn\nportion of the Corporation\u2019s HELOCs, which can only be canceled by the Corporation\nif certain criteria are met. The ECL associated with these unfunded lending\ncommitments is calculated using the same models and methodologies noted above and\nincorporate utilization assumptions at time of default. For loans that are more\nthan 180 days past due and collateral-dependent TDRs, the Corporation bases the\nallowance on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral as of the\nreporting date less costs to sell. The fair value of the collateral securing these\nloans is generally determined using an automated valuation model (AVM) that\nestimates the value of a property by reference to market data including sales of\ncomparable properties and price trends specific to the Metropolitan Statistical\nArea in which the property being valued is located. In the event that an AVM value\nis not available, the Corporation utilizes publicized indices or if these methods\nprovide less reliable valuations, the Corporation uses appraisals or broker price\nopinions to estimate the fair value of the collateral. While there is inherent\nimprecision in these valuations, the Corporation believes that they are\nrepresentative of this portfolio in the aggregate. For loans that are more than\n180 days past due and collateral-dependent TDRs, with the exception of the\nCorporation\u2019s fully insured portfolio, the outstanding balance of loans that is in\nexcess of the estimated property value after adjusting for costs to sell is\ncharged off. If the estimated property value decreases in periods subsequent to\nthe initial charge-off, the Corporation will record an additional charge-off;\nhowever, if the value increases in periods subsequent to the charge-off, the\nCorporation will adjust the allowance to account for the increase but not to a\nlevel above the cumulative charge-off amount. Credit Cards and Other Consumer\nCredit cards are revolving lines of credit without a defined maturity date. The\nestimated life of a credit card receivable is determined by estimating the amount\nand timing of expected future payments (e.g., borrowers making full payments,\nminimum payments or somewhere in between) that it will take for a receivable\nbalance to pay off. The ECL on the future payments incorporates the spending\nbehavior of a borrower through time using key borrower-specific factors and the\neconomic outlook described above. The Corporation applies all expected payments in\naccordance with the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act\nof 2009 (i.e., paying down the highest interest rate bucket first). Then\nforecasted future payments are prioritized to pay off the oldest balance until it\nis brought to zero or an expected charge-off amount. Unemployment rate outlook,\nborrower credit score, delinquency status and historical payment behavior are all\nkey inputs into the credit card receivable loss forecasting model.\n                                                                                  \n  97Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nFuture draws on the credit card lines are excluded from the ECL as they are\nunconditionally cancellable. The ECL for the consumer vehicle lending portfolio is\nalso determined using quantitative methods supplemented with qualitative analysis.\nThe quantitative model estimates ECL giving consideration to key borrower and loan\ncharacteristics such as delinquency status, borrower credit score, LTV ratio,\nunderlying collateral type and collateral value. Commercial The ECL on commercial\nloans is forecasted using models that estimate credit losses over the loan\u2019s\ncontractual life at an individual loan level. The models use the contractual terms\nto forecast future principal cash flows while also considering expected\nprepayments. For open-ended commitments such as revolving lines of credit, changes\nin funded balance are captured by forecasting a borrower\u2019s draw and payment\nbehavior over the remaining life of the commitment. For loans collateralized with\ncommercial real estate and for which the underlying asset is the primary source of\nrepayment, the loss forecasting models consider key loan and customer attributes\nsuch as LTV ratio, net operating income and debt service coverage, and captures\nvariations in behavior according to property type and region. The outlook on the\nunemployment rate, gross domestic product, and forecasted real estate prices are\nutilized to determine indicators such as rent levels and vacancy rates, which\nimpact the ECL estimate. For all other commercial loans and leases, the loss\nforecasting model determines the probabilities of transition to different credit\nrisk ratings or default at each point over the life of the asset based on the\nborrower\u2019s current credit risk rating, industry sector, size of the exposure and\nthe geographic market. The severity of loss is determined based on the type of\ncollateral securing the exposure, the size of the exposure, the borrower\u2019s\nindustry sector, any guarantors and the geographic market. Assumptions of expected\nloss are conditioned to the economic outlook, and the model considers key economic\nvariables such as unemployment rate, gross domestic product, corporate bond\nspreads, real estate and other asset prices and equity market returns. In addition\nto the allowance for loan and lease losses, the Corporation also estimates ECL\nrelated to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial\nguarantees, unfunded bankers acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding\ncommitments accounted for under the fair value option. Reserves are estimated for\nthe unfunded exposure using the same models and methodologies as the funded\nexposure and are reported as reserves for unfunded lending commitments.\nNonperforming Loans and Leases, Charge-offs and Delinquencies Nonperforming loans\nand leases generally include loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual\nstatus. Loans accounted for under the fair value option and LHFS are not reported\nas nonperforming. When a nonaccrual loan is deemed uncollectible, it is charged\noff against the allowance for credit losses. If the charged-off amount is later\nrecovered, the amount is reversed through the allowance for credit losses at the\nrecovery date. Charge-offs are reported net of recoveries (net charge-offs). If\nrecoveries for the period are greater than charge-offs, net charge-offs are\nreported as a negative amount. In accordance with the Corporation\u2019s policies,\nconsumer real estate-secured loans, including residential mortgages and home\nequity loans, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as\nnonperforming at 90days past due unless repayment of the loan is insured by the\nFHA or through individually insured long-term standby agreements with Fannie Mae\n(FNMA) or Freddie Mac (FHLMC) (the fully-insured portfolio). Residential mortgage\nloans in the fully-insured portfolio are not placed on nonaccrual status and,\ntherefore, are not reported as nonperforming. Junior-lien home equity loans are\nplaced on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming when the underlying\nfirst-lien mortgage loan becomes 90days past due even if the junior-lien loan is\ncurrent. The outstanding balance of real estate-secured loans that is in excess of\nthe estimated property value less costs to sell is charged off no later than the\nend of the month in which the loan becomes 180days past due unless the loan is\nfully insured, or for loans in bankruptcy, within 60days of receipt of\nnotification of filing, with the remaining balance classified as nonperforming.\nConsumer loans secured by personal property, credit card loans and other unsecured\nconsumer loans are not placed on nonaccrual status prior to charge-off and,\ntherefore, are not reported as nonperforming loans, except for certain secured\nconsumer loans, including those that have been modified in a TDR. Personal\nproperty-secured loans (including auto loans) are charged off to collateral value\nno later than the end of the month in which the account becomes 120days past due,\nor upon repossession of an auto or, for loans in bankruptcy, within 60days of\nreceipt of notification of filing. Credit card and other unsecured customer loans\nare charged off no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes\n180days past due, within 60days after receipt of notification of death or\nbankruptcy, or upon confirmation of fraud. Commercial loans and leases, excluding\nbusiness card loans, that are past due 90days or more as to principal or interest,\nor where reasonable doubt exists as to timely collection, including loans that are\nindividually identified as being impaired, are generally placed on nonaccrual\nstatus and classified as nonperforming unless well-secured and in the process of\ncollection. Business card loans are charged off in the same manner as consumer\ncredit card loans. Other commercial loans and leases are generally charged off\nwhen all or a portion of the principal amount is determined to be uncollectible.\nThe entire balance of a consumer loan or commercial loan or lease is contractually\ndelinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the specified due date on the\ncustomer\u2019s billing statement. Interest and fees continue to accrue on past due\nloans and leases until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status, if\napplicable. Accrued interest receivable is reversed when loans and leases are\nplaced on nonaccrual status. Interest collections on nonaccruing loans and leases\nfor which the ultimate collectability of principal is uncertain are applied as\nprincipal reductions; otherwise, such collections are credited to income when\nreceived. Loans and leases may be restored to accrual status when all principal\nand interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal\nand interest is expected. Troubled Debt Restructurings Consumer and commercial\nloans and leases whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that\ngrants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties are\nclassified as TDRs. Concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate to\na rate that is below market on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of\nprincipal, forbearance or other actions designed to maximize collections. Loans\nthat are carried at fair value and LHFS are not classified as TDRs.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America98                                                               \n                                                                                  \nLoans and leases whose contractual terms have been modified in a TDR and are\ncurrent at the time of restructuring may remain on accrual status if there is\ndemonstrated performance prior to the restructuring and payment in full under the\nrestructured terms is expected. Otherwise, the loans are placed on nonaccrual\nstatus and reported as nonperforming, except for fully-insured consumer real\nestate loans, until there is sustained repayment performance for a reasonable\nperiod, generally six months. If accruing TDRs cease to perform in accordance with\ntheir modified contractual terms, they are placed on nonaccrual status and\nreported as nonperforming TDRs. Secured consumer loans that have been discharged\nin Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not been reaffirmed by the borrower are\nclassified as TDRs at the time of discharge. Such loans are placed on nonaccrual\nstatus and written down to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell no\nlater than at the time of discharge. If these loans are contractually current,\ninterest collections are generally recorded in interest income on a cash basis.\nConsumer real estate-secured loans for which a binding offer to restructure has\nbeen extended are also classified as TDRs. Credit card and other unsecured\nconsumer loans that have been renegotiated in a TDR generally remain on accrual\nstatus until the loan is either paid in full or charged off, which occurs no later\nthan the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180days past due or, for loans\nthat have been placed on a fixed payment plan, 120days past due. A loan that had\npreviously been modified in a TDR and is subsequently refinanced under current\nunderwriting standards at a market rate with no concessionary terms is accounted\nfor as a new loan and is no longer reported as a TDR. COVID-19 Programs The\nCorporation has implemented various consumer and commercial loan modification\nprograms to provide its borrowers relief from the economic impacts of the\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (the pandemic). In accordance with\nthe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), the\nCorporation has elected to not apply TDR classification to eligible COVID-19\nrelated loan modifications that were performed after March 1, 2020 to loans that\nwere current as of December 31, 2019. Accordingly, these restructurings are not\nclassified as TDRs. The availability of this election expired on January 1, 2022.\nIn addition, for loans modified in response to the pandemic that do not meet the\nabove criteria (e.g., current payment status at December 31, 2019), the\nCorporation is applying the guidance included in an interagency statement issued\nby the bank regulatory agencies. This guidance states that loan modifications\nperformed in light of the pandemic, including loan payment deferrals that are up\nto six months in duration, that were granted to borrowers who were current as of\nthe implementation date of a loan modification program or modifications granted\nunder government mandated modification programs, are not TDRs. For loan\nmodifications that include a payment deferral and are not TDRs, the borrowers'\npast due and nonaccrual status have not been impacted during the deferral period.\nThe Corporation has continued to accrue interest during the deferral period using\na constant effective yield method. For most mortgage, HELOC and commercial loan\nmodifications, the contractual interest that accrued during the deferral period is\npayable at the maturity of the loan. The Corporation includes these amounts with\nthe unpaid principal balance when computing its allowance for credit losses.\nAmounts that are subsequently deemed uncollectible are written off against the\nallowance for credit losses. Loans Held-for-sale Loans that the Corporation\nintends to sell in the foreseeable future, including residential mortgages, loan\nsyndications, and to a lesser degree, commercial real estate, consumer finance and\nother loans, are reported as LHFS and are carried at the lower of aggregate cost\nor fair value. The Corporation accounts for certain LHFS, including residential\nmortgage LHFS, under the fair value option. Loan origination costs for LHFS\ncarried at the lower of cost or fair value are capitalized as part of the carrying\nvalue of the loans and, upon the sale of a loan, are recognized as part of the\ngain or loss in noninterest income. LHFS that are on nonaccrual status and are\nreported as nonperforming, as defined in the policy herein, are reported\nseparately from nonperforming loans and leases. Premises and Equipment Premises\nand equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.\nDepreciation and amortization are recognized using the straight-line method over\nthe estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated lives range up to 40years for\nbuildings, up to 12years for furniture and equipment, and the shorter of lease\nterm or estimated useful life for leasehold improvements. Other Assets For the\nCorporation\u2019s financial assets that are measured at amortized cost and are not\nincluded in debt securities or loans and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet,\nthe Corporation evaluates these assets for ECL using various techniques. For\nassets that are subject to collateral maintenance provisions, including federal\nfunds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, where\nthe collateral consists of daily margining of liquid and marketable assets where\nthe margining is expected to be maintained into the foreseeable future, the\nexpected losses are assumed to be zero. For all other assets, the Corporation\nperforms qualitative analyses, including consideration of historical losses and\ncurrent economic conditions, to estimate any ECL which are then included in a\nvaluation account that is recorded as a contra-asset against the amortized cost\nbasis of the financial asset. Lessee Arrangements Substantially all of the\nCorporation\u2019s lessee arrangements are operating leases. Under these arrangements,\nthe Corporation records right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at lease\ncommencement. Right-of-use assets are reported in other assetson the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet, and the related lease liabilities are reported in accrued expenses\nand other liabilities. All leases are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet\nexcept leases with an initial term less than 12 months for which the Corporation\nmade the short-term lease election. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line\nbasis over the lease term and is recorded in occupancy and equipment expense in\nthe Consolidated Statement of Income. The Corporation made an accounting policy\nelection not to separate lease and non-lease components of a contract that is or\ncontains a lease for its real estate and equipment leases. As such, lease payments\nrepresent payments on both lease and non-lease components. At lease commencement,\nlease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease\npayments and discounted using the Corporation\u2019s incremental borrowing rate. Right-\nof-use assets initially equal the lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments\n                                                                                  \n  99Bank of America                                                               \n                                                                                  \nmade prior to lease commencement and for any lease incentives. Goodwill and\nIntangible Assets Goodwill is the purchase premium after adjusting for the fair\nvalue of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for\npotential impairment on an annual basis, or when events or circumstances indicate\na potential impairment, at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is a\nbusiness segment or one level below a business segment. The Corporation assesses\nthe fair value of each reporting unit against its carrying value, including\ngoodwill, as measured by allocated equity. For purposes of goodwill impairment\ntesting, the Corporation utilizes allocated equity as a proxy for the carrying\nvalue of its reporting units. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised\nof allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles\nspecifically assigned to the reporting unit. In performing its goodwill impairment\ntesting, the Corporation first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether\nit is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than\nits carrying value. Qualitative factors include, among other things, macroeconomic\nconditions, industry and market considerations, financial performance of the\nrespective reporting unit and other relevant entity- and reporting-unit specific\nconsiderations. If the Corporation concludes it is more likely than not that the\nfair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative\nassessment is performed. The Corporation has an unconditional option to bypass the\nqualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly\nto performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The Corporation may\nresume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. When\nperforming the quantitative assessment, if the fair value of the reporting unit\nexceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit would not be considered\nimpaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a\ngoodwill impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the reporting\nunit\u2019s allocated equity exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss recognized\ncannot exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. An impairment\nloss establishes a new basis in the goodwill, and subsequent reversals of goodwill\nimpairment losses are not permitted under applicable accounting guidance. For\nintangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment loss is recognized if the\ncarrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds fair value.\nThe carrying value of the intangible asset is considered not recoverable if it\nexceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of\nthe asset. Intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not\nsubject to amortization. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value of\nthe intangible asset with an indefinite life exceeds its fair value. Variable\nInterest Entities A VIE is an entity that lacks equity investors or whose equity\ninvestors do not have a controlling financial interest in the entity through their\nequity investments. The Corporation consolidates a VIE if it has both the power to\ndirect the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic\nperformance and an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits\nthat could potentially be significant to the VIE. On a quarterly basis, the\nCorporation reassesses its involvement with the VIE and evaluates the impact of\nchanges in governing documents and its financial interests in the VIE. The\nconsolidation status of the VIEs with which the Corporation is involved may change\nas a result of such reassessments. The Corporation primarily uses VIEs for its\nsecuritization activities, in which the Corporation transfers whole loans or debt\nsecurities into a trust or other vehicle. When the Corporation is the servicer of\nwhole loans held in a securitization trust, including non-agency residential\nmortgages, home equity loans, credit cards, and other loans, the Corporation has\nthe power to direct the most significant activities of the trust. The Corporation\ngenerally does not have the power to direct the most significant activities of a\nresidential mortgage agency trust except in certain circumstances in which the\nCorporation holds substantially all of the issued securities and has the\nunilateral right to liquidate the trust. The power to direct the most significant\nactivities of a commercial mortgage securitization trust is typically held by the\nspecial servicer or by the party holding specific subordinate securities which\nembody certain controlling rights. The Corporation consolidates a whole-loan\nsecuritization trust if it has the power to direct the most significant activities\nand also holds securities issued by the trust or has other contractual\narrangements, other than standard representations and warranties, that could\npotentially be significant to the trust. The Corporation may also transfer trading\naccount securities and AFS securities into municipal bond or resecuritization\ntrusts. The Corporation consolidates a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if\nit has control over the ongoing activities of the trust such as the remarketing of\nthe trust\u2019s liabilities or, if there are no ongoing activities, sole discretion\nover the design of the trust, including the identification of securities to be\ntransferred in and the structure of securities to be issued, and also retains\nsecurities or has liquidity or other commitments that could potentially be\nsignificant to the trust. The Corporation does not consolidate a municipal bond or\nresecuritization trust if one or a limited number of third-party investors share\nresponsibility for the design of the trust or have control over the significant\nactivities of the trust through liquidation or other substantive rights. Other\nVIEs used by the Corporation include collateralized debt obligations (CDOs),\ninvestment vehicles created on behalf of customers and other investment vehicles.\nThe Corporation does not routinely serve as collateral manager for CDOs and,\ntherefore, does not typically have the power to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact the economic performance of a CDO. However, following an\nevent of default, if the Corporation is a majority holder of senior securities\nissued by a CDO and acquires the power to manage its assets, the Corporation\nconsolidates the CDO. The Corporation consolidates a customer or other investment\nvehicle if it has control over the initial design of the vehicle or manages the\nassets in the vehicle and also absorbs potentially significant gains or losses\nthrough an investment in the vehicle, derivative contracts or other arrangements.\nThe Corporation does not consolidate an investment vehicle if a single investor\ncontrolled the initial design of the vehicle or manages the assets in the vehicles\nor if the Corporation does not have a variable interest that could potentially be\nsignificant to the vehicle. Retained interests in securitized assets are initially\nrecorded at fair value. In addition, the Corporation may invest in debt securities\nissued by unconsolidated VIEs. Fair values of these debt securities, which are\nclassified as trading account assets, debt securities carried at fair value or HTM\nsecurities, are based primarily on quoted market prices in active or inactive\nmarkets. Generally, quoted market prices for retained residual interests\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America100                                                              \n                                                                                  \nare not available; therefore, the Corporation estimates fair values based on the\npresent value of the associated expected future cash flows. Fair Value The\nCorporation measures the fair values of its assets and liabilities, where\napplicable, in accordance with accounting guidance that requires an entity to base\nfair value on exit price. Under this guidance, an entity is required to maximize\nthe use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in\nmeasuring fair value. Under applicable accounting standards, fair value\nmeasurements are categorized into one of three levels based on the inputs to the\nvaluation technique with the highest priority given to unadjusted quoted prices in\nactive markets and the lowest priority given to unobservable inputs. The\nCorporation categorizes its fair value measurements of financial instruments based\non this three-level hierarchy. Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets\nfor identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities include debt\nand equity securities and derivative contracts that are traded in an active\nexchange market, as well as certain U.S. Treasury securities that are highly\nliquid and are actively traded in OTC markets. Level 2 Observable inputs other\nthan Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities,\nquoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable\nor can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term\nof the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt\nsecurities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded\ninstruments and derivative contracts where fair value is determined using a\npricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived\nprincipally from or corroborated by observable market data. This category\ngenerally includes U.S. government and agency mortgage-backed (MBS) and asset-\nbacked securities (ABS), corporate debt securities, derivative contracts, certain\nloans and LHFS. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no\nmarket activity and that are significant to the overall fair value of the assets\nor liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments for\nwhich the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or\nestimation. The fair value for such assets and liabilities is generally determined\nusing pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques\nthat incorporate the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the\nasset or liability. This category generally includes retained residual interests\nin securitizations, consumer MSRs, certain ABS, highly structured, complex or\nlong-dated derivative contracts, certain loans and LHFS, IRLCs and certain CDOs\nwhere independent pricing information cannot be obtained for a significant portion\nof the underlying assets. Income Taxes There are two components of income tax\nexpense: current and deferred. Current income tax expense reflects taxes to be\npaid or refunded for the current period. Deferred income tax expense results from\nchanges in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. These gross\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes\nexpected to be paid in the future because of future reversals of temporary\ndifferences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and\ntheir bases as reported in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are also\nrecognized for tax attributes such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax\ncredit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax\nassets to the amounts management concludes are more likely than not to be\nrealized. Income tax benefits are recognized and measured based upon a two-step\nmodel: first, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained based\nsolely on its technical merits in order to be recognized, and second, the benefit\nis measured as the largest dollar amount of that position that is more likely than\nnot to be sustained upon settlement. The difference between the benefit recognized\nand the tax benefit claimed on a tax return is referred to as an unrecognized tax\nbenefit. The Corporation records income tax-related interest and penalties, if\napplicable, within income tax expense. Revenue Recognition The following\nsummarizes the Corporation\u2019s revenue recognition accounting policies for certain\nnoninterest income activities. Card Income Card income includes annual, late and\nover-limit fees as well as interchange, cash advances and other miscellaneous\nitems from credit and debit card transactions and from processing card\ntransactions for merchants. Card income is presented net of direct costs.\nInterchange fees are recognized upon settlement of the credit and debit card\npayment transactions and are generally determined on a percentage basis for credit\ncards and fixed rates for debit cards based on the corresponding payment network\u2019s\nrates. Substantially all card fees are recognized at the transaction date, except\nfor certain time-based fees such as annual fees, which are recognized over 12\nmonths. Fees charged to cardholders and merchants that are estimated to be\nuncollectible are reserved in the allowance for loan and lease losses. Included in\ndirect cost are rewards and credit card partner payments. Rewards paid to\ncardholders are related to points earned by the cardholder that can be redeemed\nfor a broad range of rewards including cash, travel and gift cards. The points to\nbe redeemed are estimated based on past redemption behavior, card product type,\naccount transaction activity and other historical card performance. The liability\nis reduced as the points are redeemed. The Corporation also makes payments to\ncredit card partners. The payments are based on revenue-sharing agreements that\nare generally driven by cardholder transactions and partner sales volumes. As part\nof the revenue-sharing agreements, the credit card partner provides the\nCorporation exclusive rights to market to the credit card partner\u2019s members or\ncustomers on behalf of the Corporation. Service Charges Service charges include\ndeposit and lending-related fees. Deposit-related fees consist of fees earned on\nconsumer and commercial deposit activities and are generally recognized when the\ntransactions occur or as the service is performed. Consumer fees are earned on\nconsumer deposit accounts for account maintenance and various transaction-based\nservices, such as ATM transactions, wire transfer activities, check and money\norder processing and insufficient funds/overdraft transactions. Commercial\ndeposit-related fees are from the Corporation\u2019s Global Transaction Services\nbusiness and consist of commercial deposit and treasury management services,\nincluding account maintenance and other services, such as payroll, sweep\n                                                                                  \n  101Bank of America                                                              \n                                                                                  \naccount and other cash management\nservices. Lending-related fees generally\nrepresent transactional fees earned from\ncertain loan commitments, financial\nguarantees and SBLCs. Investment and\nBrokerage Services Investment and\nbrokerage services consist of asset\nmanagement and brokerage fees. Asset\nmanagement fees are earned from the\nmanagement of client assets under\nadvisory agreements or the full\ndiscretion of the Corporation\u2019s\nfinancial advisors (collectively\nreferred to as assets under management\n(AUM)). Asset management fees are earned\nas a percentage of the client\u2019s AUM and\ngenerally range from 50basis points\n(bps) to 150bps of the AUM. In cases\nwhere a third party is used to obtain a\nclient\u2019s investment allocation, the fee\nremitted to the third party is recorded\nnet and is not reflected in the\ntransaction price, as the Corporation is\nan agent for those services. Brokerage\nfees include income earned from\ntransaction-based services that are\nperformed as part of investment\nmanagement services and are based on a\nfixed price per unit or as a percentage\nof the total transaction amount.\nBrokerage fees also include distribution\nfees and sales commissions that are\nprimarily in the Global Wealth &\nInvestment Management ( GWIM ) segment\nand are earned over time. In addition,\nprimarily in the Global Markets segment,\nbrokerage fees are earned when the\nCorporation fills customer orders to buy\nor sell various financial products or\nwhen it acknowledges, affirms, settles\nand clears transactions and/or submits\ntrade information to the appropriate\nclearing broker. Certain customers pay\nbrokerage, clearing and/or exchange fees\nimposed by relevant regulatory bodies or\nexchanges in order to execute or clear\ntrades. These fees are recorded net and\nare not reflected in the transaction\nprice, as the Corporation is an agent\nfor those services. Investment Banking\nIncome Investment banking income\nincludes underwriting income and\nfinancial advisory services income.\nUnderwriting consists of fees earned for\nthe placement of a customer\u2019s debt or\nequity securities. The revenue is\ngenerally earned based on a percentage\nof the fixed number of shares or\nprincipal placed. Once the number of\nshares or notes is determined and the\nservice is completed, the underwriting\nfees are recognized. The Corporation\nincurs certain out-of-pocket expenses,\nsuch as legal costs, in performing these\nservices. These expenses are recovered\nthrough the revenue the Corporation\nearns from the customer and are included\nin operating expenses. Syndication fees\nrepresent fees earned as the agent or\nlead lender responsible for structuring,\narranging and administering a loan\nsyndication. Financial advisory services\nconsist of fees earned for assisting\nclients with transactions related to\nmergers and acquisitions and financial\nrestructurings. Revenue varies depending\non the size of the transaction and scope\nof services performed and is generally\ncontingent on successful completion of\nthe transaction. Revenue is typically\nrecognized once the transaction is\ncompleted and all services have been\nrendered. Additionally, the Corporation\nmay earn a fixed fee in merger and\nacquisition transactions to provide a\nfairness opinion, with the fees\nrecognized when the opinion is delivered\nto the client. Other Revenue Measurement\nand Recognition Policies The Corporation\ndid not disclose the value of any open\nperformance obligations at December 31,\n2021, as its contracts with customers\ngenerally have a fixed term that is less\nthan one year, an open term with a\ncancellation period that is less than\none year, or provisions that allow the\nCorporation to recognize revenue at the\namount it has the right to invoice.\n\nEarnings Per Common Share Earnings per\ncommon share (EPS) is computed by\ndividing net income allocated to common\nshareholders by the weighted-average\ncommon shares outstanding, excluding\nunvested common shares subject to\nrepurchase or cancellation. Net income\nallocated to common shareholders is net\nincome adjusted for preferred stock\ndividends including dividends declared,\naccretion of discounts on preferred\nstock including accelerated accretion\nwhen preferred stock is repaid early,\nand cumulative dividends related to the\ncurrent dividend period that have not\nbeen declared as of period end, less\nincome allocated to participating\nsecurities. Diluted EPS is computed by\ndividing income allocated to common\nshareholders plus dividends on dilutive\nconvertible preferred stock and\npreferred stock that can be tendered to\nexercise warrants, by the weighted-\naverage common shares outstanding plus\namounts representing the dilutive effect\nof stock options outstanding, restricted\nstock, restricted stock units (RSUs),\noutstanding warrants and the dilution\nresulting from the conversion of\nconvertible preferred stock, if\napplicable. Foreign Currency Translation\nAssets, liabilities and operations of\nforeign branches and subsidiaries are\nrecorded based on the functional\ncurrency of each entity. When the\nfunctional currency of a foreign\noperation is the local currency, the\nassets, liabilities and operations are\ntranslated, for consolidation purposes,\nfrom the local currency to the U.S.\ndollar reporting currency at period-end\nrates for assets and liabilities and\ngenerally at average rates for results\nof operations. The resulting unrealized\ngains and losses are reported as a\ncomponent of accumulated OCI, net-of-\ntax. When the foreign entity\u2019s\nfunctional currency is the U.S. dollar,\nthe resulting remeasurement gains or\nlosses on foreign currency-denominated\nassets or liabilities are included in\nearnings. Paycheck Protection Program\nThe Corporation is participating in the\nPaycheck Protection Program (PPP), which\nis a loan program that originated from\nthe CARES Act and was subsequently\nexpanded by the Paycheck Protection\nProgram and Health Care Enhancement Act.\nThe PPP is designed to provide U.S.\nsmall businesses with cash-flow\nassistance through loans fully\nguaranteed by the Small Business\nAdministration (SBA). If the borrower\nmeets certain criteria and uses the\nproceeds towards certain eligible\nexpenses, the borrower\u2019s obligation to\nrepay the loan can be forgiven up to the\nfull principal amount of the loan and\nany accrued interest. Upon borrower\nforgiveness, the SBA pays the\nCorporation for the principal and\naccrued interest owed on the loan. If\nthe full principal of the loan is not\nforgiven, the loan will operate\naccording to the original loan terms\nwith the 100 percent SBA guaranty\nremaining. At December 31, 2021 and\n2020, the Corporation had approximately\n67,000and 332,000PPP loans with a\ncarrying value of $ 4.7billion and $\n22.7billion. As compensation for\noriginating the loans, the Corporation\nreceived lender processing fees from the\nSBA, which were capitalized, along with\nthe loan origination costs, and are\nbeing amortized over the loans\u2019\ncontractual lives and recognized as\ninterest income. Upon forgiveness of a\nloan and repayment by the SBA, any\nunrecognized net capitalized fees and\ncosts related to the loan are recognized\nas interest income in that period.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America102                                                              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  NOTE 2                                                                          \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  Net Interest Income and Noninterest Income                                      \n                                                                                  \nThe table below presents the Corporation\u2019s net interest income and noninterest\nincome disaggregated by revenue source for 2021, 2020 and 2019.

Derivatives The Corporation enters into International Swaps and\nDerivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) master netting agreements or similar\nagreements with substantially all of the Corporation\u2019s derivative counterparties.\nWhere legally enforceable, these master netting agreements give the Corporation,\nin the event of default by the counterparty, the right to liquidate securities\nheld as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same\ncounterparty. For purposes of the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation\noffsets derivative assets and liabilities and cash collateral held with the same\ncounterparty where it has such a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The\nfollowing table presents derivative instruments included in derivative assets and\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2021 and 2020 by\nprimary risk (e.g., interest rate risk) and the platform, where applicable, on\nwhich these derivatives are transacted. Balances are presented on a gross basis,\nprior to the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting. Total gross\nderivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into\nconsideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements, which\ninclude reducing the balance for counterparty netting and cash collateral received\nor paid.

Financial\ninstruments collateral includes securities collateral received or pledged and cash\nsecurities held and posted at third-party custodians that are not offset on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet but shown as a reduction to derive net derivative\nassets and liabilities.\nALM and Risk Management Derivatives The Corporation\u2019s ALM and risk management\nactivities include the use of derivatives to mitigate risk to the Corporation\nincluding derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships and\nderivatives used in other risk management activities. Interest rate, foreign\nexchange, equity, commodity and credit contracts are utilized in the Corporation's\nALM and risk management activities. The Corporation maintains an overall interest\nrate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate\ncontracts, which are generally non-leveraged generic interest rate and basis\nswaps, options, futures and forwards, to minimize significant fluctuations in\nearnings caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporation\u2019s goal is to manage\ninterest rate sensitivity and volatility so that movements in interest rates do\nnot significantly adversely affect earnings or capital. As a result of interest\nrate fluctuations, hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or\ndepreciate in fair value. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments that are\nlinked to the hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities are expected to\nsubstantially offset this unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Market risk,\nincluding interest rate risk, can be substantial in the mortgage business. Market\nrisk in the mortgage business is the risk that values of mortgage assets or\nrevenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as\ninterest rate movements. To mitigate the interest rate risk in mortgage banking\nproduction income, the Corporation utilizes forward loan sale commitments and\nother derivative instruments, including purchased options, and certain debt\nsecurities. The Corporation also utilizes derivatives such as interest rate\noptions, interest rate swaps, forward settlement contracts and eurodollar futures\nto hedge certain market risks of MSRs. The Corporation uses foreign exchange\ncontracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign\ncurrency-denominated assets and liabilities, as well as the Corporation\u2019s\ninvestments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. Exposure to loss on these contracts will\nincrease or decrease over their respective lives as currency exchange and interest\nrates fluctuate. The Corporation purchases credit derivatives to manage credit\nrisk related to certain funded and unfunded credit exposures. Credit derivatives\ninclude credit default swaps (CDS), total return swaps and swaptions. These\nderivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value with\nchanges in fair value recorded in other income. Derivatives Designated as\nAccounting Hedges The Corporation uses various types of interest rate and foreign\nexchange derivative contracts to protect against changes in the fair value of its\nassets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates\n(fair value hedges). The Corporation also uses these types of contracts to protect\nagainst changes in the cash flows of its assets and liabilities,\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America106                                                              \n                                                                                  \nand other forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges). The Corporation hedges its\nnet investment in consolidated non-U.S. operations determined to have functional\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward exchange contracts and cross-\ncurrency basis swaps, and by issuing foreign currency-denominated debt (net\ninvestment hedges).

Of\nthe $ 1.9billion after-tax net loss ($ 2.5billion pretax) on derivatives in\naccumulated OCI at December 31, 2021, gains of $ 477million after-tax ($\n630million pretax) related to both open and terminated cash flow hedges are\nexpected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months. These net gains\nreclassified into earnings are expected to primarily increase net interest income\nrelated to the respective hedged items. For terminated cash flow hedges, the time\nperiod over which the majority of the forecasted transactions are hedged is\napproximately 3years, with a maximum length of time for certain

At December 31, 2021 and\n2020, the Corporation had transferred $\n4.8billion and $ 5.2billion of non-U.S.\ngovernment-guaranteed mortgage-backed\nsecurities to a third-party trust and\nretained economic exposure to the\ntransferred assets through derivative\ncontracts. In connection with these\ntransfers, the Corporation received\ngross cash proceeds of $ 4.8billion and\n$ 5.2billion at the transfer dates. At\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, the fair\nvalue of the transferred securities was\n$ 5.0billion and $ 5.5billion. Sales and\nTrading Revenue The Corporation enters\ninto trading derivatives to facilitate\nclient transactions and to manage risk\nexposures arising from trading account\nassets and liabilities. It is the\nCorporation\u2019s policy to include these\nderivative instruments in its trading\nactivities, which include derivatives\nand non-derivative cash instruments. The\nresulting risk from these derivatives is\nmanaged on a portfolio basis as part of\nthe Corporation\u2019s Global Markets\nbusiness segment. The related sales and\ntrading revenue generated within Global\nMarkets is recorded in various income\nstatement line items, including market\nmaking and similar activities and net\ninterest income as well as other revenue\ncategories. Sales and trading revenue\nincludes changes in the fair value and\nrealized gains and losses on the sales\nof trading and other assets, net\ninterest income, and fees primarily from\ncommissions on equity securities.\nRevenue is generated by the difference\nin the client price for an instrument\nand the price at which the trading desk\ncan execute the trade in the dealer\nmarket. For equity securities,\ncommissions related to purchases and\nsales are recorded in the \u201cOther\u201d column\nin the Sales and Trading Revenue table.\nChanges in the fair value of these\nsecurities are included in market making\nand similar activities. For debt\nsecurities, revenue, with the exception\nof interest associated with the debt\nsecurities, is typically included in\nmarket making and similar activities.\nUnlike commissions for equity\nsecurities, the initial revenue related\nto broker-dealer\n\nservices for debt securities is\ntypically included in the pricing of the\ninstrument rather than being charged\nthrough separate fee arrangements.\nTherefore, this revenue is recorded in\nmarket making and similar activities as\npart of the initial mark to fair value.\nFor derivatives, the majority of revenue\nis included in market making and similar\nactivities. In transactions where the\nCorporation acts as agent, which include\nexchange-traded futures and options,\nfees are recorded in other income.\nThe table below, which includes both derivatives and non-derivative cash\ninstruments, identifies the amounts in the respective income statement line items\nattributable to the Corporation\u2019s sales and trading revenue in Global Markets ,\ncategorized by primary risk, for 2021, 2020 and 2019.

credit derivatives. However, the Corporation does not monitor its exposure to\ncredit derivatives based solely on the notional amount because this measure does\nnot take into consideration the probability of occurrence. As such, the notional\namount is not a reliable indicator of the Corporation\u2019s exposure to these\ncontracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to define risk tolerances and\nestablish limits so that certain credit risk-related losses occur within\nacceptable, predefined limits. Credit-related notes in the table above include\ninvestments in securities issued by CDO, collateralized loan obligation (CLO)\n                                                                                  \n  109Bank of America                                                              \n                                                                                  \nand credit-linked note vehicles. These\ninstruments are primarily classified as\ntrading securities. The carrying value\nof these instruments equals the\nCorporation\u2019s maximum exposure to loss.\nThe Corporation is not obligated to make\nany payments to the entities under the\nterms of the securities owned. Credit-\nrelated Contingent Features and\nCollateral The Corporation executes the\nmajority of its derivative contracts in\nthe OTC market with large, international\nfinancial institutions, including\nbroker-dealers and, to a lesser degree,\nwith a variety of non-financial\ncompanies. A significant majority of the\nderivative transactions are executed on\na daily margin basis. Therefore, events\nsuch as a credit rating downgrade\n(depending on the ultimate rating level)\nor a breach of credit covenants would\ntypically require an increase in the\namount of collateral required of the\ncounterparty, where applicable, and/or\nallow the Corporation to take additional\nprotective measures such as early\ntermination of all trades. Further, as\npreviously discussed on page 105, the\nCorporation enters into legally\nenforceable master netting agreements\nthat reduce risk by permitting closeout\nand netting of transactions with the\nsame counterparty upon the occurrence of\ncertain events. Certain of the\nCorporation\u2019s derivative contracts\ncontain credit risk-related contingent\nfeatures, primarily in the form of ISDA\nmaster netting agreements and credit\nsupport documentation that enhance the\ncreditworthiness of these instruments\ncompared to other obligations of the\nrespective counterparty with whom the\nCorporation has transacted. These\ncontingent features may be for the\nbenefit of the Corporation as well as\nits counterparties with respect to\nchanges in the Corporation\u2019s\ncreditworthiness and the mark-to-market\nexposure under the derivative\ntransactions. At December 31, 2021 and\n2020, the Corporation held cash and\nsecurities collateral of $ 91.4billion\nand $ 96.5billion and posted cash and\nsecurities collateral of $ 79.3billion\nand $ 88.6billion in the normal course\nof business under derivative agreements,\nexcluding cross-product margining\nagreements where clients are permitted\nto margin on a net basis for both\nderivative and secured financing\narrangements. In connection with certain\nOTC derivative contracts and other\ntrading agreements, the Corporation can\nbe required to provide additional\ncollateral or to terminate transactions\nwith certain counterparties in the event\nof a downgrade of the senior debt\nratings of the Corporation or certain\nsubsidiaries. The amount of additional\ncollateral required depends on the\ncontract and is usually a fixed\nincremental amount and/or the market\nvalue of the exposure. At December 31,\n2021, the amount of collateral,\ncalculated based on the terms of the\ncontracts, that the Corporation and\ncertain subsidiaries could be required\nto post to counterparties but had not\nyet posted to counterparties was $\n2.3billion, including $ 1.4billion for\nBank of America, National Association\n(BANA). Some counterparties are\ncurrently able to unilaterally terminate\ncertain contracts, or the Corporation or\ncertain subsidiaries may be required to\ntake other action such as find a\nsuitable replacement or obtain a\nguarantee. At December 31, 2021 and\n2020, the liability recorded for these\nderivative contracts was not\nsignificant. The following table\npresents the amount of additional\ncollateral that would have been\ncontractually required by\nderivative contracts and other trading agreements at December 31, 2021 if the\nrating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the\nCorporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch and by an additional\nsecond incremental notch. The table also presents derivative liabilities that\nwould be subject to unilateral termination by counterparties upon downgrade of the\nCorporation's or certain subsidiaries' long-term senior debt ratings.\n                                                                                  \n  Additional Collateral Required to be                                            \n  Posted and Derivative Liabilities Subject                                       \n  to Unilateral Termination Upon Downgrade                                        \n  at December 31, 2021                                                            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                           One            Second  \n  (Dollars in millions)                            incremental       incremental  \n                                                         notch             notch  \n  Additional collateral required to be                                            \n  posted upon downgrade                                                           \n  Bank of America Corporation                   $          316    $          823  \n  Bank of America, N.A. and                                 75               646  \n  subsidiaries(1)                                                                 \n  Derivative liabilities subject to                                               \n  unilateral termination upon downgrade                                           \n  Derivative liabilities                        $           32    $          994  \n  Collateral posted                                         25               634  \n                                                                                  \n(1) Included in Bank of America Corporation collateral requirements in this table.\nValuation Adjustments on Derivatives The\nCorporation records credit risk\nvaluation adjustments on derivatives in\norder to properly reflect the credit\nquality of the counterparties and its\nown credit quality. The Corporation\ncalculates valuation adjustments on\nderivatives based on a modeled expected\nexposure that incorporates current\nmarket risk factors. The exposure also\ntakes into consideration credit\nmitigants such as enforceable master\nnetting agreements and collateral. CDS\nspread data is used to estimate the\ndefault probabilities and severities\nthat are applied to the exposures. Where\nno observable credit default data is\navailable for counterparties, the\nCorporation uses proxies and other\nmarket data to estimate default\nprobabilities and severity.\nThe table below presents credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and FVA gains\n(losses) on derivatives (excluding the effect of any related hedge activities),\nwhich are recorded in market making and similar activities, for 2021, 2020 and\n2019. CVA gains reduce the cumulative CVA thereby increasing the derivative assets\nbalance. DVA gains increase the cumulative DVA thereby decreasing the derivative\nliabilities balance. CVA and DVA losses have the opposite impact. FVA gains\nrelated to derivative assets reduce the cumulative FVA thereby increasing the\nderivative assets balance. FVA gains related to derivative liabilities increase\nthe cumulative FVA thereby decreasing the derivative liabilities balance. FVA\nlosses have the opposite impact.\n                                                                                  \n  Valuation Adjustments Gains (Losses) on

For more information on the\nportfolio segments, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles .\nWithin the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment, the primary credit quality\nindicators are refreshed LTV and refreshed Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score.\nRefreshed LTV measures the carrying value of the loan as a percentage of the value\nof the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. Home equity loans are\nevaluated using combined loan-to-value (CLTV), which measures the carrying value\nof the Corporation\u2019s loan and available line of credit combined with any\noutstanding senior liens against the property as a percentage of the value of the\nproperty securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. FICO score measures the\ncreditworthiness of the borrower based on the financial obligations of the\nborrower and the borrower\u2019s credit history. FICO scores are typically refreshed\nquarterly or more frequently. Certain borrowers (e.g., borrowers that have had\ndebts discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding) may not have their FICO scores\nupdated. FICO scores are also a primary credit quality indicator for the Credit\nCard and Other Consumer portfolio segment and the business card portfolio within\nU.S. small business commercial. Within the Commercial portfolio segment, loans are\nevaluated using the internal classifications of pass rated or reservable\ncriticized as the primary credit quality indicators. The term reservable\ncriticized refers to those commercial loans that are internally classified or\nlisted by the Corporation as Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful, which are\nasset quality categories defined by regulatory authorities. These assets have an\nelevated level of risk and may have a high probability of default or total loss.\nPass rated refers to all loans not considered reservable criticized. In addition\nto these primary credit quality indicators, the Corporation uses other credit\nquality indicators for certain types of loans. The following tables present\ncertain credit quality indicators for the Corporation's Consumer Real Estate,\nCredit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio segments by class of\nfinancing receivables and year of origination for term loan balances at December\n31, 2021, including revolving loans that converted to term loans without an\nadditional credit decision after origination or through a TDR.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America116                                                              \n

Prior to\npermanently modifying a loan, the\nCorporation may enter into trial\nmodifications with certain borrowers\nunder both government and proprietary\nprograms. Trial modifications generally\nrepresent a three- to four-month period\nduring which the borrower makes monthly\npayments under the anticipated modified\npayment terms. Upon successful\ncompletion of the trial period, the\nCorporation and the borrower enter into\na permanent modification. Binding trial\nmodifications are classified as TDRs\nwhen the trial offer is made and\ncontinue to be classified as TDRs\nregardless of whether the borrower\nenters into a permanent modification.\nConsumer real estate loans of $\n306million that have been discharged in\nChapter 7 bankruptcy with no change in\n\nrepayment terms and not reaffirmed by\nthe borrower were included in TDRs at\nDecember 31, 2021, of which $ 87million\nwere classified as nonperforming and $\n55million were loans fully insured. At\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, remaining\ncommitments to lend additional funds to\ndebtors whose terms have been modified\nin a consumer real estate TDR were not\nsignificant. Consumer real estate\nforeclosed properties totaled $\n101million and $ 123million at December\n31, 2021 and 2020. The carrying value of\nconsumer real estate loans, including\nfully-insured loans, for which formal\nforeclosure proceedings were in process\nat December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $\n1.1billion and $ 1.2billion. During 2021\nand 2020, the Corporation reclassified $\n64million and $ 182million of consumer\nreal estate loans, to foreclosed\nproperties or, for properties acquired\nupon foreclosure of certain government-\nguaranteed loans (principally FHA-\ninsured loans), to other assets. The\nreclassifications represent non-cash\ninvesting activities and, accordingly,\nare not reflected in the Consolidated\nStatement of Cash Flows. The table below\npresents the December 31, 2021, 2020 and\n2019 unpaid principal balance, carrying\nvalue, and average pre- and post-\nmodification interest rates of consumer\nreal estate loans that were modified in\nTDRs during 2021, 2020 and 2019.

Credit card and other consumer loan\nmodifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on the account, placing\nthe customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months and canceling the\ncustomer\u2019s available line of credit, all of which are considered TDRs. The\nCorporation makes loan modifications directly with borrowers for debt held only by\nthe Corporation (internal programs). Additionally, the Corporation makes loan\nmodifications for borrowers working with third-party renegotiation agencies that\nprovide solutions to customers\u2019 entire unsecured debt structures (external\nprograms). The Corporation classifies other secured consumer loans that have been\ndischarged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy as TDRs, which are written down to collateral\nvalue and placed on nonaccrual status no later than the time of discharge.

twoconsecutive payments.\nPayment defaults are one of the factors\nconsidered when projecting future cash\nflows in the calculation of the\nallowance for loan and lease losses for\ncredit card and other consumer. Based on\nhistorical experience, the Corporation\nestimates that 10percent of new credit\ncard TDRs and 18percent of new\ndirect/indirect consumer TDRs may be in\npayment default within 12months after\nmodification.\nCommercial Loans Modifications of loans\nto commercial borrowers that are\nexperiencing financial difficulty are\ndesigned to reduce the Corporation\u2019s\nloss exposure while providing the\nborrower with an opportunity to work\nthrough financial difficulties, often to\navoid foreclosure or bankruptcy. Each\nmodification is unique and reflects the\nindividual circumstances of the\nborrower. Modifications that result in a\nTDR may include extensions of maturity\nat a concessionary (below market) rate\nof interest, payment forbearances or\nother actions designed to benefit the\nborrower while mitigating the\nCorporation\u2019s risk exposure. Reductions\nin interest rates are rare. Instead, the\ninterest rates are typically increased,\nalthough the increased rate may not\nrepresent a market rate of interest.\nInfrequently, concessions may also\ninclude principal forgiveness in\nconnection with foreclosure, short sale\nor other settlement agreements leading\nto termination or sale of the loan. At\nthe time of restructuring, the loans are\nremeasured to reflect the impact, if\nany, on projected cash flows resulting\nfrom the modified terms. If a portion of\nthe loan is deemed to be uncollectible,\na charge-off may be recorded at the time\nof restructuring. Alternatively, a\ncharge-off may have already been\nrecorded in a previous period such that\nno charge-off is required at the time of\nmodification. During 2021, the carrying\nvalue of the Corporation\u2019s commercial\nloans that were modified as TDRs was $\n1.3billion compared to $ 1.2billion and\n$ 1.7billion for 2020 and 2019. At\n\nDecember 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the\nCorporation had commitments to lend $\n283million, $ 402million and $\n445million to commercial borrowers whose\nloans were classified as TDRs. The\nbalance of commercial TDRs in payment\ndefault was $ 262million, $ 218million\nand $ 207million at December 31, 2021,\n2020 and 2019. Loans Held-for-sale The\nCorporation had LHFS of $ 15.6billion\nand $ 9.2billion at December 31, 2021\nand 2020. Cash and non-cash proceeds\nfrom sales and paydowns of loans\noriginally classified as LHFS were $\n43.6billion, $ 20.1billion and $\n30.6billion for 2021, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively. Cash used for originations\nand purchases of LHFS totaled $\n37.3billion, $ 19.7billion and $\n28.9billion for 2021, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively. Accrued Interest\nReceivable Accrued interest receivable\nfor loans and leases and loans held-for-\nsale at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $\n2.2billion and $ 2.4billion and is\nreported in customer and other\nreceivables on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Outstanding credit card loan\nbalances include unpaid principal,\ninterest and fees. Credit card loans are\nnot classified as nonperforming but are\ncharged off no later than the end of the\nmonth in which the account becomes 180\ndays past due, within 60 days after\nreceipt of notification of death or\nbankruptcy, or upon confirmation of\nfraud . During 2021 and 2020, the\nCorporation reversed $ 446million and $\n512million of interest and fee income\nagainst the income statement line item\nin which it was originally recorded upon\ncharge-off of the principal balance of\nthe loan . For the outstanding\nresidential mortgage, home equity,\ndirect/indirect consumer and commercial\nloan balances classified as\nnonperforming during 2021 and 2020,\ninterest and fee income reversed at the\ntime the loans were classified as\nnonperforming was not significant.

Upon adoption of the new accounting\nstandard, the Corporation recorded a $ 3.3billion, or 32percent, increase in the\nallowance for credit losses on January 1, 2020, which was comprised of a net\nincrease of $ 2.9billion in the allowance for loan and lease losses and a $\n310million increase in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The net\nincrease in the allowance for loan and lease losses was primarily driven by a $\n3.1billion increase in credit card as the Corporation now reserves for the life of\nthese receivables. The increase in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments\nincluded $ 119million in the consumer portfolio for the undrawn portion of HELOCs\nand $ 191million in the commercial portfolio. For more information on the\nCorporation's credit loss accounting policies including the allowance for credit\nlosses see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles . The allowance\nfor credit losses is estimated using quantitative and qualitative methods that\nconsider a variety of factors, such as historical loss experience, the current\ncredit quality of the portfolio and an economic outlook over the life of the loan.\nQualitative reserves cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's\nassessment, may not be adequately reflected in the quantitative methods or the\neconomic assumptions. The Corporation incorporates forward-looking information\nthrough the use of several macroeconomic scenarios in determining the weighted\neconomic outlook over the forecasted life of the assets. These scenarios include\nkey macroeconomic variables such as gross domestic product, unemployment rate,\nreal estate prices and corporate bond spreads. The scenarios that are chosen each\nquarter and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors\nincluding recent economic events, leading economic indicators, internal and third-\nparty economist views, and industry trends. The December 31, 2021 estimate for\nallowance for credit losses was based on various economic outlooks that included a\nbaseline scenario, which is derived from consensus estimates, a downside scenario\nthat assumed a significantly longer period until full economic recovery, a tail\nrisk scenario similar to the severely adverse scenario used in stress testing, a\nscenario to account for inflationary risk and higher interest rates and an upside\nscenario to consider the potential for improvement in the consensus outlooks. The\nweighted economic outlook assumes that the U.S. average unemployment rate will be\njust above fivepercent by the fourth quarter of 2022 and slowly declines to just\nunder fivepercent by the fourth quarter of 2023. Additionally, in this economic\noutlook, U.S. gross domestic product is forecasted to grow at 2.1percent and\n1.9percent year-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2023. For comparison,\nas of December 31, 2020, the weighted macroeconomic outlook for the U.S. average\nunemployment rate was forecasted at 6.6percent, 5.5percent and 5.0percent in the\nfourth quarters of 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively, and the weighted\nmacroeconomic outlook for U.S. GDP was forecasted to grow at 2.5percent,\n2.4percent and 2.1percent year-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2021, 2022 and\n2023, respectively. The allowance for credit losses considered the impact of\nenacted government stimulus measures and continued to factor in the uncertainty\nresulting from the unprecedented nature of the current public health crisis and\nrisks that may prevent a full economic recovery. While there has been improvement\nacross the U.S. economy, the Corporation continues to factor into its allowance\nfor credit losses an estimated impact from higher-risk segments that included\nleveraged loans and industries such as travel and entertainment, which have been\nadversely impacted by the effects of the pandemic. The allowance for credit losses\nat December 31, 2021 was $ 13.8billion, a decrease of $ 6.8billion compared to\nDecember 31, 2020. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses was primarily\ndriven by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and credit quality. The change\nin the allowance for credit losses was comprised of a net decrease of $ 6.4billion\nin the allowance for loan and lease losses and a $ 422million decrease in the\nreserve for unfunded lending commitments. The decrease in the allowance for credit\nlosses was attributed to $ 342million in the consumer real estate portfolio, $\n2.7billion in the credit card and other consumer portfolio, and $ 3.8billion in\nthe commercial portfolio. Similarly, the provision for credit losses improved $\n15.9billion to a benefit of $ 4.6billion in 2021 compared to provision expense of\n$ 11.3billion and $ 3.6billion in 2020 and 2019. The benefit in 2021 was primarily\ndriven by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and credit quality.\nOutstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the fair value\noption increased $ 50.1billion in 2021 driven by commercial loans, which increased\n$ 60.4billion, excluding small business, primarily driven by Global Markets .\nConsumer loans increased $ 7.0billion primarily driven by securities-based\nlending, partially offset by lower consumer real estate due to prepayments in a\nlow rate environment.

Securitizations and Other\nVariable Interest Entities\n\nThe Corporation utilizes VIEs in the\nordinary course of business to support\nits own and its customers\u2019 financing and\ninvesting needs. The Corporation\nroutinely securitizes loans and debt\nsecurities using VIEs as a source of\nfunding for the Corporation and as a\nmeans of transferring the economic risk\nof the loans or debt securities to third\nparties. The assets are transferred into\na trust or other securitization vehicle\nsuch that the assets are legally\nisolated from the creditors of the\nCorporation and are not available to\nsatisfy its obligations. These assets\ncan only be used to settle obligations\nof the trust or other securitization\nvehicle. The Corporation also\nadministers, structures or invests in\nother VIEs including CDOs, investment\nvehicles and other entities. For more\ninformation on the Corporation\u2019s use of\nVIEs, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles. The\ntables in this Note present the assets\nand liabilities of consolidated and\nunconsolidated VIEs at December 31, 2021\nand 2020 in situations where the\nCorporation has continuing involvement\nwith transferred assets or if the\nCorporation otherwise has a variable\ninterest in the VIE. The tables also\npresent the Corporation\u2019s maximum loss\nexposure at December 31, 2021 and 2020\nresulting from its involvement with\nconsolidated VIEs and unconsolidated\nVIEs in which the Corporation holds a\nvariable interest. The Corporation\u2019s\n\nmaximum loss exposure is based on the\nunlikely event that all of the assets in\nthe VIEs become worthless and\nincorporates not only potential losses\nassociated with assets recorded on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet but also\npotential losses associated with off-\nbalance sheet commitments, such as\nunfunded liquidity commitments and other\ncontractual arrangements. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure does\nnot include losses previously recognized\nthrough write-downs of assets. The\nCorporation invests in ABS issued by\nthird-party VIEs with which it has no\nother form of involvement and enters\ninto certain commercial lending\narrangements that may also incorporate\nthe use of VIEs, for example to hold\ncollateral. These securities and loans\nare included in Note 4 \u2013 Securities or\nNote 5 \u2013 Outstanding Loans and Leases\nand Allowance for Credit Losses. In\naddition, the Corporation has used VIEs\nin connection with its funding\nactivities. The Corporation did not\nprovide financial support to\nconsolidated or unconsolidated VIEs\nduring 2021, 2020 and 2019 that it was\nnot previously contractually required to\nprovide, nor does it intend to do so.\nThe Corporation had liquidity\ncommitments, including written put\noptions and collateral value guarantees,\nwith certain unconsolidated VIEs of $\n968million and $ 929million at December\n31, 2021 and 2020.\n                                                                                  \n  125Bank of America                                                              \n                                                                                  \nFirst-lien Mortgage Securitizations As part of its mortgage banking activities,\nthe Corporation securitizes a portion of the first-lien residential mortgage loans\nit originates or purchases from third parties, generally in the form of\nresidential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) guaranteed by government-sponsored\nenterprises, FNMA and FHLMC (collectively the GSEs), or the Government National\nMortgage Association (GNMA) primarily in the case of FHA-insured and U.S.\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA)-guaranteed mortgage loans. Securitization\nusually occurs in conjunction with or shortly after origination or purchase, and\nthe Corporation may also securitize loans held in its residential mortgage\nportfolio. In addition, the Corporation may, from time to time, securitize\ncommercial mortgages it originates or purchases from other entities. The\nCorporation typically services the loans it securitizes. Further, the Corporation\nmay retain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts including senior and\nsubordinate securities and equity tranches issued by the trusts. Except as\ndescribed in Note 12 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies , the Corporation does not\nprovide guarantees or recourse to the securitization trusts other than standard\nrepresentations and warranties.

Substantially all of these securities are\nclassified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy and are typically sold\nshortly after receipt.\n\n(2) A majority of the first-lien residential mortgage loans securitized are\ninitially classified as LHFS and accounted for under the fair value option. Gains\nrecognized on these LHFS prior to securitization, which totaled $ 121million, $\n160million and $ 64million net of hedges, during 2021, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively, are not included in the table above.\n\n(3) The Corporation may have the option to repurchase delinquent loans out of\nsecuritization trusts, which reduces the amount of servicing advances it is\nrequired to make. The Corporation may also repurchase loans from securitization\ntrusts to perform modifications. Repurchased loans include FHA-insured mortgages\ncollateralizing GNMA securities.\nThe Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale or securitization of\nconsumer real estate loans. The unpaid principal balance of loans serviced for\ninvestors, including residential mortgage and home equity loans, totaled $\n115.4billion and $ 160.4billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Servicing fee and\nancillary fee income on serviced loans was $ 392million, $ 474million and $\n585million during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Servicing advances on\nserviced loans, including loans serviced for others and loans held for investment,\nwere $ 2.0billion and $ 2.2billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. For more\ninformation on MSRs, see Note 20 \u2013 Fair Value Measurements . During 2020, the\nCorporation completed the sale of $ 9.3billion of consumer real estate loans\nthrough GNMA loan securitizations. As part of the securitizations, the Corporation\nretained $ 8.4billion of MBS, which are classified as debt securities carried at\nfair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Total gains on loan sales of $\n704million were recorded in other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\nThe following table summarizes select information related to first-lien mortgage\nsecuritization trusts in which the Corporation held a variable interest at\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America126                                                              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n         \u2026                                                                        \n         \u2026                                                                        \n         \u2026                                                                        \n         \u2026               \u2026                                                        \n         \u2026               \u2026               \u2026               \u2026                        \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  8    $  2    $  \u2026    $  8    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2026                \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014                \n         \u2014       \u2014       3       6       \u2026       \u2026       2       1                \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $    \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $    \n                                                                                  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $      $    \n                                                                                  \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $      $    \n         \u2014       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014                \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $      $    \n      $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  9    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $      $    \n                                                                                  \n(1) Maximum loss exposure includes obligations under loss-sharing reinsurance and\nother arrangements for non-agency residential mortgage and commercial mortgage\nsecuritizations, but excludes the reserve for representations and warranties\nobligations and corporate guarantees and also excludes servicing advances and\nother servicing rights and obligations.

For more information, see Note 12 \u2013\nCommitments and Contingencies .\n(2) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, loans and leases in the consolidated credit\ncard trust included $ 4.3billion and $ 7.6billion of seller\u2019s interest.\n(3) The retained senior securities were valued using quoted market prices or\nobservable market inputs (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy).\n                                                                                  \n  127Bank of America                                                              \n                                                                                  \nHome Equity Loans The Corporation retains interests, primarily senior securities,\nin home equity securitization trusts to which it transferred home equity loans. In\naddition, the Corporation may be obligated to provide subordinate funding to the\ntrusts during a rapid amortization event. This obligation is included in the\nmaximum loss exposure in the table above. The charges that will ultimately be\nrecorded as a result of the rapid amortization events depend on the undrawn\nportion of the home equity lines of credit, performance of the loans, the amount\nof subsequent draws and the timing of related cash flows. Credit Card\nSecuritizations The Corporation securitizes originated and purchased credit card\nloans. The Corporation\u2019s continuing involvement with the securitization trust\nincludes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided interest (seller\u2019s\ninterest) in the receivables, and holding certain retained interests, including\nsubordinate interests in accrued interest and fees on the securitized receivables\nand cash reserve accounts. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Corporation issued new\nsenior debt securities issued to third-party investors from the credit card\nsecuritization trust of $ 1.0billion, $ 1.0billion and $ 1.3billion, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation held subordinate securities issued\nby the credit card securitization trust with a notional principal amount of $\n6.5billion and $ 6.8billion. These securities serve as a form of credit\nenhancement to the senior debt securities and have a stated interest rate of\nzeropercent. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, the credit card securitization trust\nissued $ 161million, $ 161million and $ 202million, respectively, of these\nsubordinate securities. Resecuritization Trusts The Corporation transfers\nsecurities, typically MBS, into resecuritization VIEs generally at the request of\ncustomers seeking securities with specific characteristics. Generally, there are\nno significant ongoing activities performed in a resecuritization trust, and no\nsingle investor has the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust. The Corporation\nresecuritized $ 28.9billion, $ 39.0billion and $ 24.4billion of securities during\n2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Securities transferred into resecuritization\nVIEs were measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in market\nmaking and similar activities prior to the resecuritization and, accordingly, no\ngain or loss on sale was recorded. Securities received from the resecuritization\nVIEs were recognized at their fair value of $ 2.2billion, $ 6.1billion and $\n5.2billion during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2021 and 2019,\nsubstantially all of the securities were classified as trading account assets. All\nof the securities received as resecuritization proceeds during 2020 were\nclassified as trading account assets. Of the securities received as\nresecuritization proceeds during 2020, $ 2.4billion, $ 2.1billion and $ 1.7billion\nwere classified as trading account assets, debt securities carried at fair value\nand HTM securities, respectively. Substantially all of the trading account\nsecurities carried at fair value were categorized as Level 2 within the fair value\nhierarchy. Municipal Bond Trusts The Corporation administers municipal bond trusts\nthat hold highly-rated, long-term, fixed-rate municipal bonds. The trusts obtain\nfinancing by issuing floating-rate trust certificates that reprice on a weekly or\nother short-term basis to third-party investors. The Corporation\u2019s liquidity\ncommitments to unconsolidated municipal bond trusts, including those for which the\nCorporation was transferor, totaled $ 4.1billion and $ 3.5billion at December 31,\n2021 and 2020. The weighted-average remaining life of bonds held in the trusts at\nDecember 31, 2021 was 6.3years. There were no significant write-downs or\ndowngrades of assets or issuers during 2021, 2020 and 2019.

Customer VIEs include\ncredit-linked, equity-linked and\ncommodity-linked note VIEs, repackaging\nVIEs and asset acquisition VIEs, which\nare typically created on behalf of\ncustomers who wish to obtain market or\ncredit exposure to a specific company,\nindex, commodity or financial\ninstrument. The Corporation\u2019s maximum\nloss exposure to consolidated and\nunconsolidated customer VIEs totaled $\n2.9billion and $ 2.3billion at December\n31, 2021 and 2020, including the\nnotional amount of derivatives to which\nthe Corporation is a counterparty, net\nof losses previously recorded, and the\nCorporation\u2019s investment, if any, in\nsecurities issued by the VIEs.\nCollateralized Debt Obligation VIEs The\nCorporation receives fees for\nstructuring CDO VIEs, which hold\ndiversified pools of fixed-income\nsecurities, typically corporate debt or\nABS, which the CDO VIEs fund by issuing\nmultiple tranches of debt and equity\nsecurities. CDOs are generally managed\nby third-party portfolio managers. The\nCorporation typically transfers assets\nto these CDOs, holds securities issued\nby the CDOs and may be a derivative\ncounterparty to the CDOs. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure to\nconsolidated and unconsolidated CDOs\ntotaled $ 235million and $ 298million at\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020. Investment\nVIEs The Corporation sponsors, invests\nin or provides financing, which may be\nin connection with the sale of assets,\nto a variety of investment VIEs that\nhold loans, real estate, debt securities\nor other financial instruments and are\ndesigned to provide the desired\ninvestment profile to investors or the\nCorporation. At December 31, 2021 and\n2020, the Corporation\u2019s consolidated\ninvestment VIEs had total assets of $\n1.0billion and $ 494million. The\nCorporation also held investments in\nunconsolidated VIEs with total assets of\n$ 7.1billion and $ 5.4billion at\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure\nassociated with both consolidated and\nunconsolidated investment VIEs totaled $\n2.0billion and $ 1.5billion at December\n31, 2021 and 2020 comprised primarily of\non-balance sheet assets less non-\nrecourse liabilities. Leveraged Lease\nTrusts The Corporation\u2019s net investment\nin consolidated leveraged lease trusts\ntotaled $ 1.5billion and $ 1.7billion at\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020. The trusts\nhold long-lived equipment such as rail\ncars, power generation and distribution\nequipment, and commercial aircraft. The\nCorporation structures the trusts and\nholds a significant residual interest.\nThe net investment represents the\nCorporation\u2019s maximum loss exposure to\nthe trusts in the unlikely event that\nthe leveraged lease investments become\nworthless. Debt issued by the leveraged\nlease trusts is non-recourse to the\nCorporation. Tax Credit VIEs The\nCorporation holds investments in\nunconsolidated limited partnerships and\nsimilar entities that construct, own and\noperate affordable housing, wind and\nsolar projects. An unrelated third party\nis typically the general partner or\nmanaging\n\nmember and has control over the\nsignificant activities of the VIE. The\nCorporation earns a return primarily\nthrough the receipt of tax credits\nallocated to the projects. The maximum\nloss exposure included in the Other VIEs\ntable was $ 25.7billion and $\n22.0billion at December 31, 2021 and\n2020. The Corporation\u2019s risk of loss is\ngenerally mitigated by policies\nrequiring that the project qualify for\nthe expected tax credits prior to making\nits investment. The Corporation\u2019s\ninvestments in affordable housing\npartnerships, which are reported in\nother assets on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet, totaled $ 12.6billion and $\n11.2billion, including unfunded\ncommitments to provide capital\ncontributions of $ 5.8billion and $\n5.0billion, at December 31, 2021 and\n2020. The unfunded commitments are\nexpected to be paid over the next five\nyears. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, the\nCorporation recognized tax credits and\nother tax benefits from investments in\naffordable housing partnerships of $\n1.3billion, $ 1.2billion and $\n1.0billion and reported pretax losses in\nother income of $ 1.1billion, $\n1.0billion and $ 882million,\nrespectively. These tax credits are\nrecognized as part of the Corporation\u2019s\nannual effective tax rate used to\ndetermine tax expense in a given\nquarter.

During\n2020, the Corporation issued $ 56.9billion of long-term debt consisting of $\n43.8billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, $ 4.8billion of notes\nissued by Bank of America, N.A. and $ 8.3billion of other debt. During 2021, the\nCorporation had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate\nof $ 46.4billion consisting of $ 24.4billion for Bank of America Corporation, $\n10.4billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $ 11.6billion of other debt. During\n2020, the Corporation had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the\naggregate of $ 47.1billion consisting of $ 22.6billion for Bank of America\nCorporation, $ 11.5billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $ 13.0billion of other\ndebt. Bank of America Corporation and Bank of America, N.A. maintain various U.S.\nand non-U.S. debt programs to offer both senior and subordinated notes. The notes\nmay be denominated in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies. At December 31, 2021 and\n2020, the amount of foreign currency-denominated debt translated into U.S. dollars\nincluded in total long-term debt was $ 53.1billion and $ 54.6billion. Foreign\ncurrency contracts may be used to convert certain foreign currency-denominated\ndebt into U.S. dollars. The weighted-average effective interest rates for total\nlong-term debt (excluding senior structured notes), total fixed-rate debt and\ntotal floating-rate debt were 2.83percent, 3.08percent and 0.75percent,\nrespectively, at December 31, 2021, and 3.02percent, 3.29percent and 0.71percent,\nrespectively, at December 31, 2020. The Corporation\u2019s ALM activities maintain an\noverall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of\ninterest rate contracts to manage fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate\nvolatility. The Corporation\u2019s goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that\nmovements in interest rates do not have a significantly adverse effect on earnings\nand capital. The weighted-average rates are the contractual interest rates on the\ndebt and do not reflect the impacts of derivative transactions. The following\ntable shows the carrying value for aggregate annual contractual maturities of\nlong-term debt as of December 31, 2021. Included in the table are certain\nstructured notes issued by the Corporation that contain provisions whereby the\nborrowings are redeemable at the option of the holder (put options) at specified\ndates prior to maturity. Other structured notes have coupon or repayment terms\nlinked to the performance of debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or\ncommodities, and the maturity may be accelerated based on the value of a\nreferenced index or security. In both cases, the Corporation or a subsidiary may\nbe required to settle the obligation for cash or other securities prior to the\ncontractual maturity date. These borrowings are reflected in the table as maturing\nat their contractual maturity date.\n                                                                                  \n  133Bank of America

\n(1) Represents liabilities of consolidated VIEs included in total long-term debt\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nNOTE 12 Commitments and Contingencies\n\nIn the normal course of business, the\nCorporation enters into a number of off-\nbalance sheet commitments. These\ncommitments expose the Corporation to\nvarying degrees of credit and market\nrisk and are subject to the same credit\nand market risk limitation reviews as\nthose instruments recorded on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Credit\nExtension Commitments The Corporation\nenters into commitments to extend credit\nsuch as loan commitments, SBLCs and\ncommercial letters of credit to meet the\nfinancing needs of its customers. The\nfollowing table includes the notional\namount of unfunded legally binding\nlending commitments net of amounts\ndistributed (i.e., syndicated or\nparticipated) to other financial\ninstitutions. The distributed amounts\nwere $ 10.7billion and $ 10.5billion at\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020. The carrying\nvalue of the Corporation\u2019s credit\nextension commitments at December 31,\n2021 and 2020, excluding commitments\naccounted for under\n\nthe fair value option, was $ 1.5billion\nand $ 1.9billion, which predominantly\nrelated to the reserve for unfunded\nlending commitments. The carrying value\nof these commitments is classified in\naccrued expenses and other liabilities\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nLegally binding commitments to extend\ncredit generally have specified rates\nand maturities. Certain of these\ncommitments have adverse change clauses\nthat help to protect the Corporation\nagainst deterioration in the borrower\u2019s\nability to pay. The following table\nincludes the notional amount of\ncommitments of $ 4.8billion and $\n4.0billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020\nthat are accounted for under the fair\nvalue option. However, the table\nexcludes the cumulative net fair value\nfor these commitments of $ 97million and\n$ 99million at December 31, 2021 and\n2020, which is classified in accrued\nexpenses and other liabilities.

At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation had commitments to\npurchase commodities, primarily liquefied natural gas, of $ 949million and $\n582million, which upon settlement will be included in trading account assets. At\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation had commitments to enter into resale\nand forward-dated resale and securities borrowing agreements of $ 92.0billion and\n$ 66.5billion, and commitments to enter into forward-dated repurchase and\nsecurities lending agreements of $ 32.6billion and $ 32.1billion. These\ncommitments generally expire within the next 12 months. At December 31, 2021 and\n2020, the Corporation had a commitment to originate or purchase up to $ 4.0billion\nand $ 3.9billion on a rolling 12-month basis, of auto loans and leases from a\nstrategic partner. This commitment extends through November 2026 and can be\nterminated with 12months prior notice. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the\nCorporation had unfunded equity investment commitments of $ 395million and $\n213million. Other Guarantees Bank-owned Life Insurance Book Value Protection The\nCorporation sells products that offer book value protection to insurance carriers\nwho offer group life insurance policies to corporations, primarily banks. At\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, the notional amount of these guarantees totaled $\n6.3billion and $ 7.1billion. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum exposure related to these guarantees totaled $ 928million and $\n1.1billion, with estimated maturity dates between 2033 and 2039. Indemnifications\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Corporation enters into various agreements\nthat contain indemnifications, such as tax indemnifications, whereupon payment may\nbecome due if certain external events occur, such as a change in tax law. The\nindemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and were entered into\nin the normal course of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss\nwould be remote. These agreements typically contain an early termination clause\nthat permits the Corporation to exit the agreement upon these events. The maximum\npotential future payment under indemnification agreements is difficult to assess\nfor several reasons, including the occurrence of an external event, the inability\nto predict future changes in tax and other laws, the difficulty in determining how\nsuch laws would apply to parties in contracts, the absence of exposure limits\ncontained in standard contract language and the timing of any early termination\nclauses. Historically, any payments made under these guarantees have been de\nminimis. The Corporation has assessed the probability of making such payments in\nthe future as remote. Merchant Services Prior to July 1, 2020, a significant\nportion of the Corporation's merchant processing activity was performed by a joint\nventure in which the Corporation held a 49percent ownership interest. Effective\nJuly 1, 2020, the Corporation received its share of the joint venture's merchant\ncontracts and began performing merchant processing services for these merchants.\n                                                                                  \n  135Bank of America                                                              \n                                                                                  \nThe Corporation in its role as merchant acquirer or as a sponsor of other merchant\nacquirers may be held liable for any reversed charges that cannot be collected\nfrom the merchants, due to, among other things, merchant fraud or insolvency. If\ncharges are properly reversed after a purchase and cannot be collected from either\nthe merchants or merchant acquirers, the Corporation may be held liable for these\nreversed charges. The ability to reverse a charge is primarily governed by the\napplicable regulatory and card network rules, which include, but are not limited\nto, the type of charge, type of payment used and time limits. The total amount of\ntransactions processed for the preceding six-month period, which was $\n476.2billion, is an estimate of the Corporation\u2019s maximum potential exposure as of\nDecember 31, 2021. The Corporation\u2019s risk in this area primarily relates to\ncircumstances where a cardholder has purchased goods or services for future\ndelivery. The Corporation mitigates this risk by requiring cash deposits,\nguarantees, letters of credit or other types of collateral from certain merchants.\nThe Corporation\u2019s reserves for contingent losses and the losses incurred related\nto the merchant processing activity were not significant. The Corporation\ncontinues to monitor its exposure in this area due to the potential economic\nimpacts of the pandemic. Exchange and Clearing House Member Guarantees The\nCorporation is a member of various securities and derivative exchanges and\nclearinghouses, both in the U.S. and other countries. As a member, the Corporation\nmay be required to pay a pro-rata share of the losses incurred by some of these\norganizations as a result of another member default and under other loss\nscenarios. The Corporation\u2019s potential obligations may be limited to its\nmembership interests in such exchanges and clearinghouses, to the amount (or\nmultiple) of the Corporation\u2019s contribution to the guarantee fund or, in limited\ninstances, to the full pro-rata share of the residual losses after applying the\nguarantee fund. The Corporation\u2019s maximum potential exposure under these\nmembership agreements is difficult to estimate; however, the Corporation has\nassessed the probability of making any such payments as remote. Prime Brokerage\nand Securities Clearing Services In connection with its prime brokerage and\nclearing businesses, the Corporation performs securities clearance and settlement\nservices with other brokerage firms and clearinghouses on behalf of its clients.\nUnder these arrangements, the Corporation stands ready to meet the obligations of\nits clients with respect to securities transactions. The Corporation\u2019s obligations\nin this respect are secured by the assets in the clients\u2019 accounts and the\naccounts of their customers as well as by any proceeds received from the\ntransactions cleared and settled by the Corporation on behalf of clients or their\ncustomers. The Corporation\u2019s maximum potential exposure under these arrangements\nis difficult to estimate; however, the potential for the Corporation to incur\nmaterial losses pursuant to these arrangements is remote. Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation Sponsored Member Repo Program The Corporation acts as a sponsoring\nmember in a repo program whereby the Corporation clears certain eligible resale\nand repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed\nIncome Clearing Corporation on behalf of clients that are sponsored members in\naccordance with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation\u2019s rules. As part of this\nprogram, the Corporation guarantees the payment and performance of its sponsored\nmembers to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. The Corporation\u2019s guarantee\nobligation is secured by a security interest in cash or high-quality securities\ncollateral placed by clients with the clearinghouse and therefore, the potential\nfor the Corporation to incur significant losses under this arrangement is remote.\nThe Corporation\u2019s maximum potential exposure, without taking into consideration\nthe related collateral, was $ 42.0billion and $ 22.5billion at December 31, 2021\nand 2020. Other Guarantees In the normal course of business, the Corporation\nperiodically guarantees the obligations of its affiliates in a variety of\ntransactions including ISDA-related transactions and non-ISDA related transactions\nsuch as commodities trading, repurchase agreements, prime brokerage agreements and\nother transactions. Guarantees of Certain Long-term Debt The Corporation, as the\nparent company, fully and unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by BofA\nFinance LLC, a consolidated finance subsidiary of the Corporation, and effectively\nprovides for the full and unconditional guarantee of trust securities issued by\ncertain statutory trust companies that are 100percent owned finance subsidiaries\nof the Corporation. Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate\nGuarantees The Corporation securitizes first-lien residential mortgage loans\ngenerally in the form of RMBS guaranteed by the GSEs or by GNMA in the case of\nFHA-insured, VA-guaranteed and Rural Housing Service-guaranteed mortgage loans,\nand sells pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans in the form of whole\nloans. In addition, in prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold\npools of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-\nlabel securitizations or in the form of whole loans. In connection with these\ntransactions, the Corporation or certain of its subsidiaries or legacy companies\nmake and have made various representations and warranties. Breaches of these\nrepresentations and warranties have resulted in and may continue to result in the\nrequirement to repurchase mortgage loans or to otherwise make whole or provide\nindemnification or other remedies to sponsors, investors, securitization trusts,\nguarantors, insurers or other parties (collectively, repurchases). Unresolved\nRepurchase Claims Unresolved representations and warranties repurchase claims\nrepresent the notional amount of repurchase claims made by counterparties,\ntypically the outstanding principal balance or the unpaid principal balance at the\ntime of default. In the case of first-lien mortgages, the claim amount is often\nsignificantly greater than the expected loss amount due to the benefit of\ncollateral and, in some cases, mortgage insurance or mortgage guarantee payments.\nThe notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims at December 31, 2021 and 2020\nwas $ 8.4billion and $ 8.5billion. These balances included $ 2.8billion and $\n2.9billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020 of claims related to loans in specific\nprivate-label securitization groups or tranches where the Corporation owns\nsubstantially all of the outstanding securities or will otherwise realize the\nbenefit of any repurchase claims paid.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America136                                                              \n                                                                                  \nDuring 2021, the Corporation received $\n49million in new repurchase claims that\nwere not time-barred. During 2021, $\n141million in claims were resolved.\nReserve and Related Provision The\nreserve for representations and\nwarranties obligations and corporate\nguarantees was $ 1.2billion and $\n1.3billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020\nand is included in accrued expenses and\nother liabilities on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet, and the related provision\nis included in other income in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income. The\nrepresentations and warranties reserve\nrepresents the Corporation\u2019s best\nestimate of probable incurred losses, is\nbased on its experience in previous\nnegotiations, and is subject to\njudgment, a variety of assumptions and\nknown or unknown uncertainties. Future\nrepresentations and warranties losses\nmay occur in excess of the amounts\nrecorded for these exposures; however,\nthe Corporation does not expect such\namounts to be material to the\nCorporation's financial condition and\nliquidity. See Litigation and Regulatory\nMatters below for the Corporation's\ncombined range of possible loss in\nexcess of the reserve for\nrepresentations and warranties and the\naccrued liability for litigation.\n\nLitigation and Regulatory Matters In the\nordinary course of business, the\nCorporation and its subsidiaries are\nroutinely defendants in or parties to\nmany pending and threatened legal,\nregulatory and governmental actions and\nproceedings. In view of the inherent\ndifficulty of predicting the outcome of\nsuch matters, particularly where the\nclaimants seek very large or\nindeterminate damages or where the\nmatters present novel legal theories or\ninvolve a large number of parties, the\nCorporation generally cannot predict the\neventual outcome of the pending matters,\ntiming of the ultimate resolution of\nthese matters, or eventual loss, fines\nor penalties related to each pending\nmatter. As a matter develops, the\nCorporation, in conjunction with any\noutside counsel handling the matter,\nevaluates whether such matter presents a\nloss contingency that is probable and\nestimable, and, for the matters\ndescribed below whether a loss in excess\nof any accrued liability is reasonably\npossible in future periods. Once the\nloss contingency is deemed to be both\nprobable and estimable, the Corporation\nwill establish an accrued liability and\nrecord a corresponding amount of\nlitigation-related expense. The\nCorporation continues to monitor the\nmatter for further developments that\ncould affect the amount of the accrued\nliability that has been previously\nestablished. Excluding expenses of\ninternal and external legal service\nproviders, litigation-related expense of\n$ 164million and $ 823million was\nrecognized in 2021 and 2020. For any\nmatter disclosed in this Note for which\na loss in future periods is reasonably\npossible and estimable (whether in\nexcess of an accrued liability or where\nthere is no accrued liability) and for\nrepresentations and warranties\nexposures, the Corporation\u2019s estimated\nrange of possible loss is $ 0to $\n1.0billion in excess of the accrued\nliability, if any, as of December 31,\n2021. The accrued liability and\nestimated range of possible loss are\nbased upon currently available\ninformation and subject to significant\njudgment, a variety of assumptions and\nknown and unknown uncertainties. The\nmatters underlying the accrued liability\nand estimated range of possible loss are\nunpredictable and may change from time\nto time, and actual losses may vary\nsignificantly from the current estimate\nand accrual. The\n\nestimated range of possible loss does\nnot represent the Corporation\u2019s maximum\nloss exposure. Information is provided\nbelow regarding the nature of the\nlitigation and, where specified,\nassociated claimed damages. Based on\ncurrent knowledge, and taking into\naccount accrued liabilities, management\ndoes not believe that loss contingencies\narising from pending matters, including\nthe matters described below, will have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the\nconsolidated financial condition or\nliquidity of the Corporation. However,\nin light of the significant judgment,\nvariety of assumptions and uncertainties\ninvolved in these matters, some of which\nare beyond the Corporation\u2019s control,\nand the very large or indeterminate\ndamages sought in some of these matters,\nan adverse outcome in one or more of\nthese matters could be material to the\nCorporation\u2019s business or results of\noperations for any particular reporting\nperiod, or cause significant\nreputational harm. Ambac Bond Insurance\nLitigation Ambac Assurance Corporation\nand the Segregated Account of Ambac\nAssurance Corporation (together, Ambac)\nhave filed fourseparate lawsuits against\nthe Corporation and its subsidiaries\nrelating to bond insurance policies\nAmbac provided on certain securitized\npools of HELOCs, first-lien subprime\nhome equity loans, fixed-rate second-\nlien mortgage loans and negative\namortization pay-option adjustable-rate\nmortgage loans. Ambac alleges that they\nhave paid or will pay claims as a result\nof defaults in the underlying loans and\nasserts that the defendants\nmisrepresented the characteristics of\nthe underlying loans and/or breached\ncertain contractual representations and\nwarranties regarding the underwriting\nand servicing of the loans. In those\nactions where the Corporation is named\nas a defendant, Ambac contends the\nCorporation is liable on successor and\nvicarious liability theories. These\nactions are at various procedural stages\nwith material developments provided\nbelow. Ambac v. Countrywide I Ambac\nnamed the Corporation and several\nCountrywide entities as defendants in an\naction filed on September 28, 2010 in\nNew York Supreme Court asserting claims\nfor fraudulent inducement as well as\nbreach of contract and seeking damages\nin excess of $ 2.2billion, plus punitive\ndamages. The Supreme Court dismissed\nAmbac\u2019s fraudulent inducement claim, and\non May 11, 2021, the First Department, a\nNew York State appellate court (First\nDepartment), affirmed the dismissal. The\nSupreme Court has scheduled a non-jury\ntrial for September 7, 2022 on the\ncontract claim that remains. Ambac v.\nCountrywide II On December 30, 2014,\nAmbac filed a complaint in New York\nSupreme Court against the same\ndefendants, claiming fraudulent\ninducement against Countrywide, and\nsuccessor and vicarious liability\nagainst the Corporation, while seeking\ndamages in excess of $ 600million, plus\npunitive damages. Ambac v. Countrywide\nIV On July 21, 2015, Ambac filed an\naction in New York Supreme Court against\nCountrywide asserting the same claims\nfor fraudulent inducement that Ambac\nasserted in the now dismissed Ambac v.\nCountrywide III. The complaint seeks\ndamages in excess of $ 350million, plus\npunitive damages. On December 8, 2020,\nthe New York Supreme Court dismissed\nAmbac\u2019s complaint. On February 8, 2022,\nthe First Department affirmed the\ndismissal.\n                                                                                  \n  137Bank of America                                                              \n                                                                                  \nAmbac v. First Franklin On April 16,\n2012, Ambac filed an action against\nBANA, First Franklin and various Merrill\nLynch entities, including Merrill Lynch,\nPierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, in\nNew York Supreme Court relating to\nguaranty insurance Ambac provided on a\nFirst Franklin securitization sponsored\nby Merrill Lynch. The complaint alleges\nfraudulent inducement and breach of\ncontract, including breach of contract\nclaims against BANA based upon its\nservicing of the loans in the\nsecuritization. Ambac seeks as damages\nhundreds of millions of dollars that\nAmbac alleges it has paid or will pay in\nclaims. Deposit Insurance Assessment On\nJanuary 9, 2017, the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (FDIC) filed suit\nagainst BANA in the U.S. District Court\nfor the District of Columbia alleging\nfailure to pay a December 15, 2016\ninvoice for additional deposit insurance\nassessments and interest in the amount\nof $ 542million for the quarters ending\nJune 30, 2013 through December 31, 2014.\nOn April 7, 2017, the FDIC amended its\ncomplaint to add a claim for additional\ndeposit insurance and interest in the\namount of $ 583million for the quarters\nending March 31, 2012 through March 31,\n2013. The FDIC asserts these claims\nbased on BANA\u2019s alleged underreporting\nof counterparty exposures that resulted\nin underpayment of assessments for those\nquarters and its Enforcement Section is\nalso conducting a parallel investigation\nrelated to the same alleged reporting\nerror. BANA disagrees with the FDIC\u2019s\ninterpretation of the regulations as\nthey existed during the relevant time\nperiod and is defending itself against\nthe FDIC\u2019s claims. Pending final\nresolution, BANA has pledged security\nsatisfactory to the FDIC related to the\ndisputed additional assessment amounts.\nOn March 27, 2018, the U.S. District\nCourt for the District of Columbia\ndenied BANA\u2019s partial motion to dismiss\ncertain of the FDIC\u2019s claims. LIBOR The\nCorporation, BANA and certain Merrill\nLynch entities have been named as\ndefendants along with most of the other\nLIBOR panel banks in a number of\nindividual and putative class actions by\npersons alleging they sustained losses\non U.S. dollar LIBOR-based financial\ninstruments as a result of collusion or\nmanipulation by defendants regarding the\nsetting of U.S. dollar LIBOR. Plaintiffs\nassert a variety of claims, including\nantitrust, Commodity Exchange Act,\nRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt\nOrganizations (RICO), Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, common law fraud\nand breach of contract claims, and seek\ncompensatory, treble and punitive\ndamages, and injunctive relief. All but\none of the cases naming the Corporation\nand its affiliates relating to U.S.\ndollar LIBOR are pending in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Southern District\nof New York (\u201cDistrict Court\u201d). The\nDistrict Court has dismissed all RICO\nclaims, and dismissed all manipulation\nclaims against Bank of America entities\nbased on alleged trader conduct. The\nDistrict Court has also substantially\nlimited the scope of antitrust,\nCommodity Exchange Act and various other\nclaims, including by dismissing in their\nentirety certain individual and putative\nclass plaintiffs\u2019 antitrust claims for\nlack of standing. On December 30, 2021,\nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second\nCircuit affirmed the dismissal of these\nantitrust claims for lack of standing.\nCertain individual and putative class\nactions remain pending against the\nCorporation, BANA and certain Merrill\nLynch entities. On February 28, 2018,\nthe District Court granted certification\nof a\n\nclass of persons that purchased OTC\nswaps and notes that referenced U.S.\ndollar LIBOR from one of the U.S. dollar\nLIBOR panel banks, limited to claims\nunder Section 1 of the Sherman Act. U.S.\nBank - Harborview and SURF/OWNIT\nRepurchase Litigation Beginning in 2011,\nU.S. Bank, National Association (U.S.\nBank), as trustee for the HarborView\nMortgage Loan Trust 2005-10 and various\nSURF/OWNIT RMBS trusts filed complaints\nagainst the Corporation, Countrywide\nentities, Merrill Lynch entities and\nother affiliates in New York Supreme\nCourt alleging breaches of\nrepresentations and warranties. The\ndefendants and certain certificate-\nholders in the trusts agreed to settle\nthe respective matters in amounts not\nmaterial to the Corporation, subject to\nacceptance by U.S. Bank. The litigations\nhave been stayed pending finalization of\nthe settlements.

As a\nfinancial holding company, the\nCorporation is subject to capital\nadequacy rules issued by the Federal\nReserve. The Corporation\u2019s banking\nentity affiliates are subject to capital\nadequacy rules issued by the OCC.\nThe Corporation and its primary banking\nentity affiliate, BANA, are Advanced\napproaches institutions under Basel 3.\nAs Advanced approaches institutions, the\nCorporation and its banking entity\naffiliates are required to report\nregulatory risk-based capital ratios and\nrisk-weighted assets under both the\nStandardized and Advanced approaches.\nThe approach that yields the lower ratio\nis used to assess capital adequacy,\nincluding under the Prompt Corrective\nAction (PCA) framework. The Corporation\nis required to maintain a minimum\nsupplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of\n3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of\n2.0 percent in order to avoid certain\nrestrictions on capital distributions\nand discretionary bonus payments. The\nCorporation\u2019s insured depository\ninstitution subsidiaries are required to\nmaintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be\nconsidered well capitalized under the\nPCA framework.

capital ratios are calculated using the\nregulatory capital rule that allows a five-year transition period related to the\nadoption of the CECL accounting standard.\n\n(2) The capital conservation buffer and global systemically important bank (G-SIB)\nsurcharge were 2.5percent at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. At December 31, 2021\nand 2020 the Corporation's stress capital buffer of 2.5 percent was applied in\nplace of the capital conservation buffer under the Standardized approach. The\ncountercyclical capital buffer for both periods was zero. The CET1 capital\nregulatory minimum is the sum of the CET1 capital ratio minimum of 4.5 percent,\nthe Corporation\u2019s G-SIB surcharge of 2.5 percent and the Corporation\u2019s SCB or the\ncapital conservation buffer, as applicable, of 2.5 percent. The SLR regulatory\nminimum includes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent.\n\n(3) Risk-based capital regulatory minimums at December 31, 2021 and 2020 are the\nminimum ratios under Basel 3, including a capital conservation buffer of 2.5\npercent. The regulatory minimums for the leverage ratios as of both period ends\nare the percent required to be considered well capitalized under the PCA\nframework.\n\n(4) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized\napproach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to\nthe qualifying allowance for credit losses.\n\n(5) Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions.\n\n(6) Supplementary leverage exposure for the Corporation at December 31, 2020\nreflects the temporary exclusion of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at\nFederal Reserve Banks. The temporary relief expired after March 31, 2021 and is\nnot reflected in supplementary leverage exposure at December 31, 2021.\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America142                                                              \n                                                                                  \nThe capital adequacy rules issued by the\nU.S. banking regulators require\ninstitutions to meet the established\nminimums outlined in the table above.\nFailure to meet the minimum requirements\ncan lead to certain mandatory and\ndiscretionary actions by regulators that\ncould have a material adverse impact on\nthe Corporation\u2019s financial position. At\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, the\nCorporation and its banking entity\naffiliates were well capitalized. Due to\nuncertainty from the pandemic, the\nFederal Reserve imposed various\nrestrictions on share repurchase\nprograms and dividends during 2020 and\nthe first half of 2021. In conjunction\nwith its release of 2021 CCAR\nsupervisory stress test results, the\nFederal Reserve announced those\nrestrictions would end as of July 1,\n2021 for large banks, including the\nCorporation, and large banks would be\nsubject to the normal restrictions under\nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s SCB framework. For\nmore information, see Note 13 \u2013\nShareholders\u2019 Equity . Other Regulatory\nMatters The Federal Reserve requires the\nCorporation\u2019s bank subsidiaries to\nmaintain reserve requirements based on a\npercentage of certain deposit\nliabilities. The average daily reserve\nbalance requirements, in excess of vault\ncash, maintained by the Corporation with\nthe Federal Reserve Bank were $ 0for\n2021 and $ 3.8billion for 2020. At\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, the\nCorporation had cash and cash\nequivalents in the amount of $\n4.0billion and $ 4.9billion, and\nsecurities with a fair value of $\n10.6billion and $ 16.8billion that were\nsegregated in compliance with securities\nregulations. Cash held on deposit with\nthe Federal Reserve Bank to meet reserve\nrequirements and cash and cash\nequivalents segregated in compliance\nwith securities regulations are\ncomponents of restricted cash. For more\ninformation, see Note 10 \u2013 Securities\nFinancing Agreements, Short-term\nBorrowings and Restricted Cash . In\naddition, at December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nthe Corporation had cash deposited with\nclearing organizations of $ 28.6billion\nand $ 10.9billion primarily recorded in\nother assets on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Bank Subsidiary Distributions The\nprimary sources of funds for cash\ndistributions by the Corporation to its\nshareholders are capital distributions\nreceived from its bank subsidiaries,\nBANA and Bank of America California,\nN.A. In 2021, the Corporation received\ndividends of $ 15.6billion from BANA and\n$ 29million from Bank of America\nCalifornia, N.A. The amount of dividends\nthat a subsidiary bank may declare in a\ncalendar year without OCC approval is\nthe subsidiary bank\u2019s net profits for\nthat year combined with its retained net\nprofits for the preceding two years.\nRetained net profits, as defined by the\nOCC, consist of net income less\ndividends declared during the period. In\n2022, BANA can declare and pay dividends\nof approximately $ 14.7billion to the\nCorporation plus an additional amount\nequal to its retained net profits for\n2022 up to the date of any such dividend\ndeclaration. Bank of America California,\nN.A. can pay dividends of $ 234million\nin 2022 plus an additional amount equal\nto its retained net profits for 2022 up\nto the date of any such dividend\ndeclaration.\n\nNOTE 17 Employee Benefit Plans\n\nPension and Postretirement Plans The\nCorporation sponsors a qualified\nnoncontributory trusteed pension plan\n(Qualified Pension Plan), a number of\nnoncontributory nonqualified pension\nplans and postretirement health and life\nplans that cover eligible employees.\nNon-U.S. pension plans sponsored by the\nCorporation vary based on the country\nand local practices. The Qualified\nPension Plan has a balance guarantee\nfeature for account balances with\nparticipant-selected investments,\napplied at the time a benefit payment is\nmade from the plan that effectively\nprovides principal protection for\nparticipant balances transferred and\ncertain compensation credits. The\nCorporation is responsible for funding\nany shortfall on the guarantee feature.\nBenefits earned under the Qualified\nPension Plan have been frozen.\nThereafter, the cash balance accounts\ncontinue to earn investment credits or\ninterest credits in accordance with the\nterms of the plan document. The\nCorporation has an annuity contract that\nguarantees the payment of benefits\nvested under a terminated U.S. pension\nplan (Other Pension Plan). The\nCorporation, under a supplemental\nagreement, may be responsible for or\nbenefit from actual experience and\ninvestment performance of the annuity\nassets. The Corporation made\nnocontribution under this agreement in\n2021 or 2020. Contributions may be\nrequired in the future under this\nagreement. The Corporation\u2019s\nnoncontributory, nonqualified pension\nplans are unfunded and provide\nsupplemental defined pension benefits to\ncertain eligible employees. In addition\nto retirement pension benefits, certain\nbenefits-eligible employees may become\neligible to continue participation as\nretirees in health care and/or life\ninsurance plans sponsored by the\nCorporation. These plans are referred to\nas the Postretirement Health and Life\nPlans. The Pension and Postretirement\nPlans table summarizes the changes in\nthe fair value of plan assets, changes\nin the projected benefit obligation\n(PBO), the funded status of both the\naccumulated benefit obligation (ABO) and\nthe PBO, and the weighted-average\nassumptions used to determine benefit\nobligations for the pension plans and\npostretirement plans at December 31,\n2021 and 2020. The estimate of the\nCorporation\u2019s PBO associated with these\nplans considers various actuarial\nassumptions, including assumptions for\nmortality rates and discount rates. The\ndiscount rate assumptions are derived\nfrom a cash flow matching technique that\nutilizes rates that are based on Aa-\nrated corporate bonds with cash flows\nthat match estimated benefit payments of\neach of the plans. The increases in the\nweighted-average discount rates in 2021\nresulted in a decrease to the PBO of $\n895million at December 31, 2021. The\ndecreases in the weighted-average\ndiscount rates in 2020 resulted in an\nincrease to the PBO of approximately $\n1.9billion at December 31, 2020.\nSignificant gains and losses related to\nchanges in the PBO for 2021 and 2020\nprimarily resulted from changes in the\ndiscount rate.\n                                                                                  \n  143Bank of

asset valuation method used to calculate the expected return on plan assets\ncomponent of net periodic benefit cost for the Qualified Pension Plan recognizes\n60percent of the prior year\u2019s market gains or losses at the next measurement date\nwith the remaining 40percent spread equally over the subsequent four years. Gains\nand losses for all benefit plans except postretirement health care are recognized\nin accordance with the standard amortization provisions of the applicable\naccounting guidance. Net periodic postretirement health and life expense was\ndetermined using the \u201cprojected unit credit\u201d actuarial method. For the\nPostretirement Health and Life Plans, 50percent of the unrecognized gain or loss\nat the beginning of the year (or at subsequent remeasurement) is recognized on a\nlevel basis during the year. Assumed health care cost trend rates affect the\npostretirement benefit obligation and benefit cost reported for the Postretirement\nHealth and Life Plans. The assumed health care cost trend rate used to measure the\nexpected cost of benefits covered by the Postretirement Health and Life Plans is\n6.25percent for 2022, reducing in steps to 5.00percent in 2027 and later years.\nThe Corporation\u2019s net periodic benefit cost (income) recognized for the plans is\nsensitive to the discount rate and expected return on plan assets. For the\nQualified Pension Plan, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, Nonqualified and Other Pension\nPlans, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans, a 25 bp decline in discount rates\nand expected return on assets would not have had a significant impact on the net\nperiodic benefit cost for 2021.\n                                                                                  \n                                         \u2026               \u2026                        \n                                         \u2026               \u2026                        \n         \u2026               \u2026               \u2026               \u2026                        \n         \u2026               \u2026               \u2026               \u2026                        \n         \u2026               \u2026               \u2026               \u2026                        \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  4    $  \u2026    $      $    \n         \u2014       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026                \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  1    $  \u2026    $      $    \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                \n         \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       3       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014       \u2014                \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n  145Bank of America                                                              \n                                                                                  \nPlan Assets The Qualified Pension Plan has been established as a retirement\nvehicle for participants, and trusts have been established to secure benefits\npromised under the Qualified Pension Plan. The Corporation\u2019s policy is to invest\nthe trust assets in a prudent manner for the exclusive purpose of providing\nbenefits to participants and defraying reasonable expenses of administration. The\nCorporation\u2019s investment strategy is designed to provide a total return that, over\nthe long term, increases the ratio of assets to liabilities. The strategy attempts\nto maximize the investment return on assets at a level of risk deemed appropriate\nby the Corporation while complying with ERISA and any applicable regulations and\nlaws. The investment strategy utilizes asset allocation as a principal determinant\nfor establishing the risk/return profile of the assets. Asset allocation ranges\nare established, periodically reviewed and adjusted as funding levels and\nliability characteristics change. Active and passive investment managers are\nemployed to help enhance the risk/return profile of the assets. An additional\naspect of the investment strategy used to minimize risk (part of the asset\nallocation plan) includes matching the exposure of participant-selected investment\nmeasures. The assets of the Non-U.S. Pension Plans are primarily attributable to a\nU.K. pension plan. This U.K. pension plan\u2019s assets are invested prudently so that\nthe benefits promised to members are provided with consideration given to the\nnature and the duration of the plans' liabilities. The selected asset allocation\nstrategy is designed to achieve a higher return than the lowest risk strategy. The\nexpected rate of return on plan assets assumption was developed through analysis\nof historical market returns, historical asset class volatility and correlations,\ncurrent market conditions, anticipated future asset allocations, the funds\u2019 past\nexperience and expectations on potential future market returns. The expected\nreturn on plan assets assumption is determined using the calculated market-related\nvalue for the Qualified Pension Plan and the Other Pension Plan and the fair value\nfor the Non-U.S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The\nexpected return on plan assets assumption represents a long-term average view of\nthe performance of the assets in the Qualified Pension Plan, the Non-U.S. Pension\nPlans, the Other Pension Plan, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans, a return\nthat may or may not be achieved during any one calendar year. The Other Pension\nPlan is invested solely in an annuity contract, which is primarily invested in\nfixed-income securities structured such that asset maturities match the duration\nof the plan\u2019s obligations. The target allocations for 2022 by asset category for\nthe Qualified Pension Plan, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, and Nonqualified and Other\nPension Plans are presented in the table below. Equity securities for the\nQualified Pension Plan include common stock of the Corporation in the amounts of $\n398million ( 1.80percent of total plan assets) and $ 274million ( 1.26percent of\ntotal plan assets) at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n                                                                            \n  2022 Target Allocation                                                    \n                            Percentage                                      \n                            Qualified       Non-U.S.         Nonqualified   \n  Asset Category            Pension Plan    Pension Plans    and Other      \n                                                             Pension Plans  \n  Equity securities         15-50%          0-25%            0-5%           \n  Debt securities           45-80%          40-70%           95-100%        \n  Real estate               0-10%           0-15%            0-5%           \n  Other                     0-5%            10-40%           0-5%           \n                                                                            \nFair Value Measurements\nFor more information on fair value measurements, including descriptions of Level\n1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy and the valuation methods employed by the\nCorporation, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 20\n\u2013 Fair Value Measurements .

plans. The Corporation\nrecorded expense of $ 1.2billion in both\n2021 and 2020 and $ 1.0billion in 2019\nrelated to the qualified defined\ncontribution plans. At December 31, 2021\nand 2020, 173million and 189million\nshares of the Corporation\u2019s common stock\nwere held by these plans. Payments to\nthe plans for dividends on common stock\nwere $ 139million, $ 138million and $\n133million in 2021, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively. Certain non-U.S. employees\nare covered under defined contribution\npension plans that are separately\nadministered in accordance with local\nlaws. NOTE 18 Stock-based Compensation\nPlans The Corporation administers a\nnumber of equity compensation plans,\nwith awards being granted predominantly\nfrom the Bank of America Key Employee\nEquity Plan (KEEP). On April 20, 2021,\nBank of America\u2019s shareholders approved\nthe amendment and restatement of the\nKEEP, changing its name to the \u201cBank of\nAmerica Corporation Equity Plan\u201d and\nincreasing the number of shares\navailable for grant by 115million.\nSubsequent to the amendment and\nrestatement, 715million shares of the\nCorporation\u2019s common stock are\nauthorized to be used for grants of\nawards under this plan. During 2021 and\n2020, the Corporation granted 99million\nand 86million RSU awards to certain\nemployees under the KEEP. These RSUs\nwere authorized to settle predominantly\nin shares of common stock of the\nCorporation. Certain RSUs will be\nsettled in cash or contain settlement\nprovisions that subject these awards to\nvariable accounting whereby compensation\nexpense is adjusted to fair value based\non changes in the share price of the\nCorporation\u2019s common stock up to the\nsettlement date. Of the RSUs granted in\n2021 and 2020, 81million and 29million\nwill generally vest over four yearsand\n18million and 57million will vest over\nthree years. The four-year awards vest\nprimarily in one-fourth increments on\neach of the first four anniversaries of\nthe grant date while the three-year\nawards vest primarily in one-third\nincrements on each of the first three\nanniversaries of the grant date,\nprovided that the employee remains\ncontinuously employed with the\nCorporation during that time, and will\nbe expensed ratably over the vesting\nperiod, net of estimated forfeitures,\nfor non-retirement eligible employees\nbased on the grant-date fair value of\nthe shares. Of the RSUs granted in 2021\nand 2020 that vest over four years,\n27million and 25million do not include\nretirement eligibility. For all other\nRSUs granted to employees who are\nretirement eligible, they are deemed\nauthorized as of the beginning of the\nyear preceding the grant date when the\nincentive award plans are generally\napproved. As a result, the estimated\nvalue is expensed ratably over the year\npreceding the grant date. The\ncompensation cost for the stock-based\nplans was $ 3.0billion, $ 2.1billion and\n$ 2.1billion, and the related income tax\nbenefit was $ 723million, $ 505million\nand $ 511million for 2021, 2020 and\n2019, respectively. At December 31,\n2021, there was an estimated $\n2.3billion of total unrecognized\ncompensation cost related to certain\nshare-based compensation awards that is\nexpected to be recognized over a period\nof up to four years, with a weighted-\naverage period of 2.4years.\n\nRestricted Stock and Restricted Stock\nUnits\nThe total fair value of restricted stock\nand restricted stock units vested in\n2021, 2020 and 2019 was $ 2.3billion, $\n2.3billion and $ 2.6billion,\nrespectively.

the inclusion of\ninterest in the Reconciliation of Income\nTax Expense table.\nAt December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the\nbalance of the Corporation\u2019s UTBs which\nwould, if recognized, affect the\nCorporation\u2019s effective tax rate was $\n959million, $ 976million and $\n814million, respectively. Included in\nthe UTB balance are some items the\nrecognition of which would not affect\nthe effective tax rate, such as the tax\neffect of certain temporary differences,\nthe portion of gross state UTBs that\nwould be offset by the tax benefit of\nthe associated federal deduction and the\nportion of gross non-U.S. UTBs that\nwould be offset by tax reductions in\nother jurisdictions. It is reasonably\npossible that the UTB balance may\ndecrease by as much as $ 398million\nduring the next 12 months, since\nresolved items will be removed from the\nbalance whether their resolution results\nin payment or recognition. The\nCorporation recognized interest expense\nof $ 32million and $ 9million in 2021\nand 2020 and an interest benefit of $\n19million in 2019.

losses that may be carried\nforward indefinitely.\n(2) The net operating losses and related\nvaluation allowances for U.S. states\nbefore considering the benefit of\nfederal deductions were $ 1.5billion and\n$ 772million.\nManagement concluded that novaluation\nallowance was necessary to reduce the\ndeferred tax assets related to the U.K.\nNOL carryforwards and U.S. federal and\ncertain state NOL carryforwards since\nestimated future taxable income will be\nsufficient to utilize these assets prior\nto their expiration. The majority of the\nCorporation\u2019s U.K. net deferred tax\nassets, which consist primarily of NOLs,\nare expected to be realized by certain\nsubsidiaries over an extended number of\nyears. Management\u2019s conclusion is\nsupported by financial results, profit\nforecasts for the relevant entities and\nthe indefinite period to carry forward\nNOLs. However, a material change in\nthose estimates could lead management to\nreassess such valuation allowance\nconclusions.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, U.S. federal\nincome taxes had not been provided on\napproximately $ 5.0billion of temporary\ndifferences associated with investments\nin non-U.S. subsidiaries that are\nessentially permanent in duration. If\nthe Corporation were to record the\nassociated deferred tax liability, the\namount would be approximately $\n1.0billion.\nNOTE 20 Fair Value Measurements Under applicable accounting standards, fair value\nis defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market\nfor the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants\non the measurement date. The Corporation determines the fair values of its\nfinancial instruments under applicable accounting standards that require an entity\nto maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable\ninputs. The Corporation categorizes its financial instruments into three levels\nbased on the established fair value hierarchy and conducts a review of fair value\nhierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of fair\nvalue hierarchy classifications are made if the significant inputs used in the\nfinancial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities become\nunobservable or observable in the current marketplace. For more information\nregarding the fair value hierarchy and how the Corporation measures fair value,\nsee Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles . The Corporation\naccounts for certain financial instruments under the\n\nfair value option. For more information, see Note 21 \u2013 Fair Value Option.\nValuation Techniques The following sections outline the valuation methodologies\nfor the Corporation\u2019s assets and liabilities. While the Corporation believes its\nvaluation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants,\nthe use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of\ncertain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value\nat the reporting date. During 2021, there were no significant changes to valuation\napproaches or techniques that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on\nthe Corporation\u2019s consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nTrading Account Assets and Liabilities and Debt Securities The fair values of\ntrading account assets and liabilities are primarily based on actively traded\nmarkets where prices are based on either direct market quotes or observed\ntransactions. The fair values of debt securities are generally based on quoted\nmarket prices or market prices for similar assets. Liquidity is a significant\nfactor in the determination of the fair values of trading account assets and\nliabilities and debt securities. Market price quotes may not be readily available\nfor some positions such as positions within a market sector where trading activity\nhas slowed significantly or ceased. Some of these instruments are valued using a\ndiscounted cash flow model, which estimates the fair value of the securities using\ninternal credit risk, and interest rate and prepayment risk models that\nincorporate management\u2019s best estimate of current key assumptions such as default\nrates, loss severity and prepayment rates. Principal and interest cash flows are\ndiscounted using an observable discount rate for similar instruments with\nadjustments that management believes a market participant would consider in\ndetermining fair value for the specific security. Other instruments are valued\nusing a net asset value approach which considers the value of the underlying\nsecurities. Underlying assets are valued using external pricing services, where\navailable, or matrix pricing based on the vintages and ratings. Situations of\nilliquidity generally are triggered by the market\u2019s perception of credit\nuncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market sector. In these\ninstances, fair value is determined based on limited available market information\nand other factors, principally from reviewing the issuer\u2019s financial statements\nand changes in credit ratings made by one or more rating agencies. Derivative\nAssets and Liabilities The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded\nin the OTC market are determined using quantitative models that utilize multiple\nmarket inputs including interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous\nyield or pricing curves and volatility factors to value the position. The majority\nof market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external\nsources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services.\nWhen third-party pricing services are used, the methods and assumptions are\nreviewed by the Corporation. Estimation risk is greater for derivative asset and\nliability positions that are either option-based or have longer maturity\n                                                                                  \n  Bank of America150                                                              \n                                                                                  \ndates where observable market inputs are less readily available, or are\nunobservable, in which case, quantitative-based extrapolations of rate, price or\nindex scenarios are used in determining fair values. The fair values of derivative\nassets and liabilities include adjustments for market liquidity, counterparty\ncredit quality and other instrument-specific factors, where appropriate. In\naddition, the Corporation incorporates within its fair value measurements of OTC\nderivatives a valuation adjustment to reflect the credit risk associated with the\nnet position. Positions are netted by counterparty, and fair value for net long\nexposures is adjusted for counterparty credit risk while the fair value for net\nshort exposures is adjusted for the Corporation\u2019s own credit risk. The Corporation\nalso incorporates FVA within its fair value measurements to include funding costs\non uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives where the Corporation is not\npermitted to use the collateral it receives. An estimate of severity of loss is\nalso used in the determination of fair value, primarily based on market data.\nLoans and Loan Commitments The fair values of loans and loan commitments are based\non market prices, where available, or discounted cash flow analyses using market-\nbased credit spreads of comparable debt instruments or credit derivatives of the\nspecific borrower or comparable borrowers. Results of discounted cash flow\nanalyses may be adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect other market conditions or\nthe perceived credit risk of the borrower. Mortgage Servicing Rights The fair\nvalues of MSRs are primarily determined using an option-adjusted spread valuation\napproach, which factors in prepayment risk to determine the fair value of MSRs.\nThis approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under multiple interest\nrate scenarios and discounting these cash flows using risk-adjusted discount\nrates. Loans Held-for-sale The fair values of LHFS are based on quoted market\nprices, where available, or are determined by discounting estimated cash flows\nusing interest rates approximating the Corporation\u2019s current origination rates for\nsimilar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk. The borrower-specific\ncredit risk is embedded within the quoted market prices or is implied by\nconsidering loan performance when selecting comparables. Short-term Borrowings and\nLong-term Debt The Corporation issues structured liabilities that have coupons or\nrepayment terms linked to the performance of debt or equity securities, interest\nrates, indices, currencies or commodities. The fair values of these structured\nliabilities are estimated using quantitative models for the combined derivative\nand debt portions of the notes. These models incorporate observable and, in some\ninstances, unobservable inputs including security prices, interest rate yield\ncurves, option volatility, currency, commodity or equity rates and correlations\namong these inputs. The Corporation also considers the impact of its own credit\nspread in determining the discount rate used to value these liabilities. The\ncredit spread is determined by reference to observable spreads in the secondary\nbond market. Securities Financing Agreements The fair values of certain reverse\nrepurchase agreements, repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions\nare determined using quantitative models, including discounted cash flow models\nthat require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates and\nspreads to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, and volatility factors.\nThe majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through\nexternal sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing\nservices. Deposits The fair values of deposits are determined using quantitative\nmodels, including discounted cash flow models that require the use of multiple\nmarket inputs including interest rates and spreads to generate continuous yield or\npricing curves, and volatility factors. The majority of market inputs are actively\nquoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market\ntransactions and third-party pricing services. The Corporation considers the\nimpact of its own credit spread in the valuation of these liabilities. The credit\nrisk is determined by reference to observable credit spreads in the secondary cash\nmarket. Asset-backed Secured Financings The fair values of asset-backed secured\nfinancings are based on external broker bids, where available, or are determined\nby discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating the\nCorporation\u2019s current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the\ninherent credit risk.\n

The Corporation uses multiple market approaches\nin valuing certain of its Level 3 financial instruments. For example, market\ncomparables and discounted cash flows are used together. For a given product, such\nas corporate debt securities, market comparables may be used to estimate some of\nthe unobservable inputs and then these inputs are incorporated into a discounted\ncash flow model. Therefore, the balances disclosed encompass both of these\ntechniques. The levels of aggregation and diversity within the products disclosed\nin the tables result in certain ranges of inputs being wide and unevenly\ndistributed across asset and liability categories. Uncertainty of Fair Value\nMeasurements from Unobservable Inputs Loans and Securities A significant increase\nin market yields, default rates, loss severities or duration would have resulted\nin a significantly lower fair value for long positions. Short positions would have\nbeen impacted in a directionally opposite way. The impact of changes in prepayment\nspeeds would have resulted in differing impacts depending on the seniority of the\ninstrument and, in the case of CLOs, whether prepayments can be reinvested. A\nsignificant increase in price would have resulted in a significantly higher fair\nvalue for long positions, and short positions would have been impacted in a\ndirectionally opposite way. Structured Liabilities and Derivatives For credit\nderivatives, a significant increase in market yield, upfront points (i.e., a\nsingle upfront payment made by a protection buyer at inception), credit spreads,\ndefault rates or loss severities would have resulted in a significantly lower fair\nvalue for protection sellers and higher fair value for protection buyers. The\nimpact of changes in prepayment speeds would have resulted in differing impacts\ndepending on the seniority of the instrument. Structured credit derivatives are\nimpacted by credit correlation. Default correlation is a parameter that describes\nthe degree of dependence among credit default rates within a credit portfolio that\nunderlies a credit derivative instrument. The sensitivity of this input on the\nfair value varies depending on the level of subordination of the tranche. For\nsenior tranches that are net purchases of protection, a significant increase in\ndefault correlation would have resulted in a significantly higher fair value. Net\nshort protection positions would have been impacted in a directionally opposite\nway. For equity derivatives, commodity derivatives, interest rate derivatives and\nstructured liabilities, a significant change in long-dated rates and volatilities\nand correlation inputs (i.e., the degree of correlation between an equity security\nand an index, between two different commodities, between two different interest\nrates, or between interest rates and foreign exchange rates) would have resulted\nin a significant impact to the fair value; however, the magnitude and direction of\nthe impact depend on whether the Corporation is long or short the exposure. For\nstructured liabilities, a significant increase in yield or decrease in price would\nhave resulted in a significantly lower fair value. Nonrecurring Fair Value The\nCorporation holds certain assets that are measured at fair value only in certain\nsituations (e.g., the impairment of an asset), and these measurements are referred\nto herein as nonrecurring. The amounts below represent assets still held as of the\nreporting date for which a nonrecurring fair value adjustment was recorded during\n2021, 2020 and 2019.\n                                                                                  \n  Assets                                                                          \n  Measured                                                                        \n  at Fair                                                                         \n  Value on a                                                                      \n  Nonrecurr\u2026          December                            December                \n  Basis               31, 2021                            31, 2020                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (Dollars                                                                        \n  in                   Level 2           Level 3           Level 2       Level 3  \n  millions)                                                                       \n  Assets                                                                          \n  Loans         $          634    $           24    $        1,020    $      792  \n  held-for-\u2026                                                                      \n  Loans and                  \u2014               213                 \u2014           301  \n  leases(1)                                                                       \n  Foreclosed                                                                      \n  propertie\u2026                 \u2014                 5                 \u2014            17  \n  3)                                                                              \n  Other                    256             2,046               323           576  \n  assets                                                                          \n                                           Gains                                  \n                                        (Losses)                                  \n                                            2021              2020          2019  \n  Assets                                                                          \n  Loans                           $          -44    $          -79    $      -14  \n  held-for-\u2026                                                                      \n  Loans and                                  -60               -73           -81  \n  leases(1)                                                                       \n  Foreclosed                                  -2                -6            -9  \n  properties                                                                      \n  Other                                     -492               -98        -2,145  \n  assets                                                                          \n                                                                                  \n(1) Includes $ 24million, $ 30million and $ 36million of losses on loans that were\nwritten down to a collateral value of zero during 2021, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively.\n(2) Amounts are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and\nrepresent the carrying value of foreclosed properties that were written down\nsubsequent to their initial classification as foreclosed properties.

dissolution of the Corporation's merchant services\njoint venture.\nn/a = not applicable\nNOTE 21 Fair Value Option\nLoans and Loan Commitments The\nCorporation elects to account for\ncertain loans and loan commitments that\nexceed the Corporation\u2019s single-name\ncredit risk concentration guidelines\nunder the fair value option. Lending\ncommitments are actively managed and, as\nappropriate, credit risk for these\nlending relationships may be mitigated\nthrough the use of credit derivatives,\nwith the Corporation\u2019s public side\ncredit view and market perspectives\ndetermining the size and timing of the\nhedging activity. These credit\nderivatives do not meet the requirements\nfor designation as accounting hedges and\nare carried at fair value. The fair\nvalue option allows the Corporation to\ncarry these loans and loan commitments\nat fair value, which is more consistent\nwith management\u2019s view of the underlying\neconomics and the manner in which they\nare managed. In addition, the fair value\noption allows the Corporation to reduce\nthe accounting volatility that would\notherwise result from the asymmetry\ncreated by accounting for the financial\ninstruments at historical cost and the\ncredit derivatives at fair value. Loans\nHeld-for-sale The Corporation elects to\naccount for residential mortgage LHFS,\ncommercial mortgage LHFS and certain\nother LHFS under the fair value option.\nThese loans are actively managed and\nmonitored and, as appropriate, certain\nmarket risks of the loans may be\nmitigated through the use of\nderivatives. The Corporation has elected\nnot to designate the derivatives as\nqualifying accounting hedges, and\ntherefore, they are carried at fair\nvalue. The changes in fair value of the\nloans are largely offset by changes in\nthe fair value of the derivatives. The\nfair value option allows the Corporation\nto reduce the accounting volatility that\nwould otherwise result from the\nasymmetry created by accounting for the\nfinancial instruments at the lower of\ncost or fair value and the derivatives\nat fair value. The Corporation has not\nelected to account for certain other\nLHFS under the fair value option\nprimarily because these loans are\nfloating-rate loans that are not hedged\nusing derivative instruments.\n\nLoans Reported as Trading Account Assets\nThe Corporation elects to account for\ncertain loans that are held for the\npurpose of trading and are risk-managed\non a fair value basis under the fair\nvalue option. Other Assets The\nCorporation elects to account for\ncertain long-term fixed-rate margin\nloans that are hedged with derivatives\nunder the fair value option. Election of\nthe fair value option allows the\nCorporation to reduce the accounting\nvolatility that would otherwise result\nfrom the asymmetry created by accounting\nfor the financial instruments at\nhistorical cost and the derivatives at\nfair value. Securities Financing\nAgreements The Corporation elects to\naccount for certain securities financing\nagreements, including resale and\nrepurchase agreements, under the fair\nvalue option. These elections include\ncertain agreements collateralized by the\nU.S. government and its agencies, which\nare generally short-dated and have\nminimal interest rate risk. Long-term\nDeposits The Corporation elects to\naccount for certain long-term fixed-rate\nand rate-linked deposits that are hedged\nwith derivatives that do not qualify for\nhedge accounting. Election of the fair\nvalue option allows the Corporation to\nreduce the accounting volatility that\nwould otherwise result from the\nasymmetry created by accounting for the\nfinancial instruments at historical cost\nand the derivatives at fair value. The\nCorporation has not elected to carry\nother long-term deposits at fair value\nbecause they are not hedged using\nderivatives. Short-term Borrowings The\nCorporation elects to account for\ncertain short-term borrowings, primarily\nshort-term structured liabilities, under\nthe fair value option because this debt\nis risk-managed on a fair value basis.\n                                                                                  \n  159Bank of America                                                              \n                                                                                  \nThe Corporation also elects to account for certain asset-backed secured\nfinancings, which are also classified in short-term borrowings, under the fair\nvalue option. Election of the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce\nthe accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created\nby accounting for the asset-backed secured financings at historical cost and the\ncorresponding mortgage LHFS securing these financings at fair value. Long-term\nDebt The Corporation elects to account for certain long-term debt, primarily\nstructured liabilities, under the fair value option. This long-term debt is either\nrisk-managed on a fair value basis or the related hedges do not qualify for hedge\naccounting. Fair Value Option Elections The following tables provide information\nabout the fair value carrying amount and the contractual principal outstanding of\nassets and liabilities accounted for under the fair value option at December 31,\n2021 and 2020, and information about where changes in the fair value of assets and\nliabilities accounted for under the fair value option are included in

Certain loans,\ndeposits, long-term debt, unfunded\nlending commitments and other financial\ninstruments are accounted for under the\nfair value option. For more information,\nsee Note 21 \u2013 Fair Value Option . The\nfollowing disclosures include financial\ninstruments that are not carried at fair\nvalue or only a portion of the ending\nbalance is carried at fair value on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Short-term\nFinancial Instruments The carrying value\nof short-term financial instruments,\nincluding cash and cash equivalents,\ncertain time deposits placed and other\nshort-term investments, federal funds\nsold and purchased, certain resale and\nrepurchase agreements and short-term\nborrowings, approximates the fair value\nof these instruments. These financial\ninstruments generally expose the\nCorporation to\n\nlimited credit risk and have no stated\nmaturities or have short-term maturities\nand carry interest rates that\napproximate market. The Corporation\naccounts for certain resale and\nrepurchase agreements under the fair\nvalue option. Under the fair value\nhierarchy, cash and cash equivalents are\nclassified as Level 1. Time deposits\nplaced and other short-term investments,\nsuch as U.S. government securities and\nshort-term commercial paper, are\nclassified as Level 1 or Level 2.\nFederal funds sold and purchased are\nclassified as Level 2.

All Other All Other\nprimarily consists of ALM activities, liquidating businesses and certain expenses\nnot otherwise allocated to a business segment. ALM activities encompass interest\nrate and foreign currency risk management activities for which substantially all\nof the results are allocated to the business segments. Basis of Presentation The\nmanagement accounting and reporting process derives segment and business results\nby utilizing allocation methodologies for revenue and expense. The net income\nderived for the businesses is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations using an\nactivity-based costing model, funds transfer pricing, and other methodologies and\nassumptions management believes are appropriate to reflect the results of the\nbusiness. Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on\nan FTE basis and noninterest income. The adjustment of net interest income to an\nFTE basis results in a corresponding increase in income tax expense. The segment\nresults also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies that are utilized\nto determine net income. The net interest income of the businesses includes the\nresults of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities\nwith similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. In segments\nwhere the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are generally\ndeposit-taking segments, the Corporation allocates assets to match liabilities.\nNet interest income of the business segments also includes an allocation of net\ninterest income generated by certain of the Corporation\u2019s ALM activities. The\nCorporation\u2019s ALM activities include an overall interest rate risk management\nstrategy that incorporates the use of various derivatives and cash instruments to\nmanage fluctuations in earnings and capital that are caused by interest rate\nvolatility. The Corporation\u2019s goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that\nmovements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and\ncapital.

Certain expenses not\ndirectly attributable to a specific business segment are allocated to the\nsegments. The costs of certain centralized or shared functions are allocated based\non methodologies that reflect utilization. Effective October 1, 2021, a business\nactivity previously included in the Global Markets segment is being reported as a\nliquidating business in All Other , consistent with a realignment in performance\nreporting to senior management. While this activity was not material to Global\nMarkets\u2019 results of operations and historical results have not been restated, this\nactivity\u2019s noninterest expense of $ 309million and $ 473million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2021 and June 30, 2021 was elevated and would have been\nexcluded from Global Markets\u2019 results of operations for those periods under the\nnew basis of presentation.

operations are highly\nintegrated with operations in both U.S.\nand non-U.S. markets. The non-U.S.\nbusiness activities are largely\nconducted in Europe, the Middle East and\nAfrica and in Asia.
