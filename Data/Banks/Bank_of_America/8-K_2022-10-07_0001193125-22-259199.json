As disclosed in    \nthose filings, the pending lawsuits, with damages claims of more than $3 billion, \nwere brought by Ambac against Countrywide entities and other legacy entities      \nrelated to bond insurance policies that Ambac provided before the 2008 financial  \ncrisis. Under the terms of the agreement, in exchange for the Corporation\u2019s       \npayment of $1.84 billion to Ambac (the \u201cSettlement Payment\u201d), Ambac, among other  \nthings, will (i) cause all pending litigation between the parties to be dismissed \nwith prejudice, and (ii) release the Corporation and its subsidiaries from all    \noutstanding claims related to Ambac\u2019s issuance of bond insurance policies for     \ncertain of the Corporation\u2019s and legacy entities\u2019 securitized pools of residential\nmortgage loans. The Corporation previously accrued for certain amounts of the     \nSettlement Payment. As a result of the previous accruals and in consideration of  \nthe Settlement Payment, the Corporation expects to incur a pre-tax expense in the \nthird quarter of 2022 of approximately $354 million, or $0.03 per share on an     \nafter tax basis.                                                                  \n                                                                                  \nSIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,   \nthe Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the      \nundersigned hereunto duly authorized.                                             \n                                                                                  \n       BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION                                                \n  By:                               /s/ Ross E.
