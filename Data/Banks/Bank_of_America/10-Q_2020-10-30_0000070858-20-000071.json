Based on our\nresults, we are subject to a\n2.5 percent SCB for the period\nbeginning October 1, 2020 and\nending on September 30, 2021.\n\nDue to economic uncertainty\nresulting from the Coronavirus\nDisease 2019 (COVID-19)\npandemic, the Federal Reserve\nrequired all large banks to\nsuspend share repurchase\nprograms in the third quarter\nof 2020, except for repurchases\nto offset shares awarded under\nequity-based compensation\nplans, and to limit dividends\nto existing rates that do not\nexceed the average of the last\nfour quarters\u2019 net income. In\nSeptember 2020, the Federal\nReserve announced that these\nmeasures would remain in place\nfor the fourth quarter of 2020.\nLarge banks will also be\nrequired to resubmit and update\ntheir capital plans in November\n\n2020 based on the Federal\nReserve\u2019s updated supervisory\nstress test scenarios. The\nFederal Reserve announced that\nthey will publish the results\nof the additional supervisory\nstress tests by December 31,\n2020.\n\nOn October 21, 2020, the Board\nof Directors (the Board)\ndeclared a quarterly common\nstock dividend at the current\nrate of $0.18 per share.

In an\nattempt to contain the spread\nand impact of the COVID-19\npandemic, travel bans and\nrestrictions, quarantines,\nshelter-in-place orders and\nlimitations on business\nactivity have been implemented.\nAdditionally, there has been a\ndecline in global economic\nactivity, reduced U.S. and\nglobal economic output and a\ndeterioration in macroeconomic\nconditions in the U.S. and\nglobally. This has resulted in,\namong other things, high rates\nof unemployment and\nunderemployment and caused\nvolatility and disruptions in\nthe global financial markets,\nincluding the energy and\ncommodity markets. Although\nsome restrictive measures have\nbeen eased in certain areas,\nbusinesses, market\nparticipants, our\ncounterparties and clients, and\nthe U.S. and global economies\nhave been negatively impacted\nand are likely to be so for an\nextended period of time, as\nthere remains significant\nuncertainty about the timing\nand strength of an economic\nrecovery.\n\nIn response to the pandemic,\nthe Corporation has implemented\nprotocols and processes to\nexecute its business continuity\nplans and help protect its\nemployees and support its\nclients.

Based on guidance in\nthe CARES Act that the\nCorporation adopted, COVID-19\nrelated modifications to\nconsumer and commercial loans\nthat were current as of\nDecember 31, 2019 are exempt\nfrom troubled debt\nrestructuring (TDR)\nclassification under accounting\nprinciples generally accepted\nin the United States of America\n(GAAP). In addition, the bank\nregulatory agencies issued\ninteragency guidance stating\nthat COVID-19 related short-\nterm modifications (i.e., six\nmonths or less) granted to\nconsumer or commercial loans\nthat were current as of the\nloan modification program\nimplementation date are not\nTDRs. For more information, see\nNote 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant\nAccounting Principles and Note\n5 \u2013 Outstanding Loans and\nLeases and Allowance for Credit\nLosses to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements .\n\nWe have provided borrowers with\nrelief from the economic\nimpacts of COVID-19 through\npayment deferral and\nforbearance programs. A\nsignificant portion of\ndeferrals expired in the third\nquarter of 2020, reflecting a\ndecline in customer requests\nfor assistance.\n\nAs of October 21, 2020,\ndeferred consumer and small\nbusiness loans recorded on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\ntotaled $9.8 billion,\nconsisting of $9.0 billion of\nresidential mortgage and home\nequity loans, including loans\nserviced by others, that are\nwell-collateralized, $298\nmillion of consumer credit card\nloans and $582 million of small\nbusiness and consumer vehicle\nloans. For deferred residential\nmortgage and home equity loans,\nthe weighted average loan-to-\nvalue (LTV) and combined LTV\n(CLTV) ratios were 61 percent\nand 57 percent, respectively.\nOf the consumer credit card\nloans for which payment\ndeferral programs have expired,\n91 percent of cardholders have\nmade at least one payment since\nexiting deferral.\n\nAs of October 21, 2020,\nexcluding small business,\ndeferred commercial balances\ntotaled $1.4 billion, or 0.29\npercent of total commercial\nloans.\n                                                                \n  Other Related Matters                                         \n                                                                \nAlthough the macroeconomic\noutlook improved modestly in\nthe three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2020, the future\ndirect and indirect impact of\nCOVID-19 on our businesses,\nresults of operations and\nfinancial condition of the\nCorporation remain highly\nuncertain.

As part\nof this program, the\nCorporation continues to\nidentify, assess and monitor\nrisks associated with the\nexpected discontinuation or\nunavailability of LIBOR and\nother benchmarks. Additionally,\nthe Corporation continues to\nevaluate and address\ndocumentation and contractual\nmechanics of outstanding IBOR-\nbased products and contracts\nthat may mature after LIBOR is\nno longer deemed a\nrepresentative benchmark, as\nwell as new and potential\nfuture ARR-based products and\ncontracts to achieve\noperational readiness.\n\nThis program, which is led by\nthe Corporation's Chief\nOperating Officer, includes\nactive involvement of senior\nmanagement and regular reports\nto the Enterprise Risk\nCommittee. The program is\nstructured to address the\nCorporation's industry and\nregulatory engagement, client\nand financial contract changes,\ninternal and external\ncommunications, technology and\noperations modifications,\nintroduction of new products,\nmigration of existing clients,\nand program strategy and\ngovernance.\n\nAs the markets for ARRs\ncontinue to grow, the\nCorporation continues to\nmonitor and participate in the\ndevelopment and usage of ARRs,\nincluding the Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate (SOFR) and the\nSterling Overnight Index\nAverage (SONIA). The\nCorporation issued debt and\ndeposits linked to SOFR and\nSONIA, facilitated debt\nissuances by clients linked to\nSOFR and SONIA, and executed\nSOFR- and SONIA-based\nderivative contracts to make\nmarkets and facilitate client\nactivities.\n                                                                \n  Bank of America4                                              \n                                                                \nIn accordance with the\nindustry-wide transition from\nIBORs to ARRs, central clearing\ncounterparties (CCPs) in Europe\nand the U.S., which act as\nintermediaries and require\ncollateral deposits for the\nclearing and settlement of\ninterest rate swap products and\nother derivatives, changed the\ninterest rate used to calculate\namounts due to counterparties\nfor collateral deposits posted\nwith them from the European\nOvernight Index Average (EONIA)\nto the Euro Short-Term Rate\n(ESTR) and the Effective Fed\nFunds Rate (EFFR) to SOFR in\nJuly and October 2020,\nrespectively. In connection\nwith this transition, the\nCorporation updated its\noperational models, systems,\nprocedures and internal\ninfrastructure. The earnings\nimpact from the changes in net\nvaluations of these derivatives\nwas not significant at the\npoint of conversion, as the\nCorporation either provided or\nreceived compensation to/from\nthe CCPs. Additionally, in\nOctober 2020, the Corporation\nand certain of its subsidiaries\nadhered to the International\nSwaps and Derivatives\nAssociation, Inc. 2020 IBOR\nFallbacks Protocol, effective\nJanuary 25, 2021, which\nprovides a mechanism to enable\nmarket participants to\nincorporate fallbacks for\ncertain legacy non-cleared\nderivatives linked to certain\nIBORs.\n\nThe Corporation continues to\nmonitor the impact of COVID-19\non the market and industry\ntransition to ARRs, including\nthe readiness of impacted\nclients and their operational\nreadiness to transition to\nARRs.

The decline in net income\nwas primarily due to higher\nprovision for credit losses\ndriven by the weaker economic\noutlook related to COVID-19 and\nlower net interest income,\npartially offset by a $2.1\nbillion pretax impairment\ncharge related to the notice of\nthe termination of the merchant\nservices joint venture in the\nprior year.\n\nTotal assets increased $304.4\nbillion from December 31, 2019\nto $2.7 trillion primarily\ndriven by an increase in cash\nand cash equivalents, debt\nsecurities and federal funds\nsold and securities borrowed or\npurchased under agreements to\nresell primarily due to cash\ndeployed from higher deposit\nbalances. The increase in\nassets was partially offset by\nlower loans and leases\nprimarily driven by a decline\nin credit card originations and\npromotional balances, mortgage\npaydowns and lower origination\nvolumes.\n\nTotal liabilities increased\n$300.3 billion from December\n31, 2019 to $2.5 trillion\nprimarily driven by higher\ndeposit inflows resulting from\ngovernment stimulus actions and\nclient responses to market\nvolatility as clients improved\ntheir liquidity positions. The\nincrease in liabilities was\nalso due to higher federal\nfunds purchased and securities\nloaned or sold under agreements\nto repurchase primarily due to\nhigher inventory in Fixed\nIncome, Currencies and\nCommodities (FICC) within\nGlobal Markets. Long-term debt\nalso increased primarily driven\nby\n\nvaluations due to lower\ninterest rates, as well as debt\nissuances.\n\nShareholders\u2019 equity increased\n$4.0 billion from December 31,\n2019 primarily due to net\nincome and market value\nincreases on debt securities,\npartially offset by returns of\ncapital to shareholders through\ncommon stock repurchases and\ncommon and preferred stock\ndividends as well as the impact\nof the adoption of the new\ncredit loss accounting\nstandard.\n                                                                \n  Net Interest Income                                           \n                                                                \nNet interest income decreased\n$2.1 billion to $10.1 billion,\nand $3.6 billion to $33.1\nbillion for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2020\ncompared to the same periods in\n2019. Net interest yield on a\nfully taxable-equivalent (FTE)\nbasis decreased 69 basis points\n(bps) to 1.72 percent, and 49\nbps to 1.96 percent for the\nsame periods. The decrease in\nnet interest income was\nprimarily driven by lower\ninterest rates, partially\noffset by reduced deposit and\nfunding costs, the deployment\nof excess deposits into\nsecurities and an additional\nday of interest accrual. We\nexpect net interest income to\nremain relatively flat or to\nmodestly increase in the fourth\nquarter of 2020 as compared to\nthe third quarter of 2020\nassuming economic conditions do\nnot deteriorate and interest\nrates remain stable as compared\nto September 30, 2020.

The increase in the\nthree-month period was\nprimarily driven by higher\nincome related to the\nprocessing of unemployment\ninsurance and higher merchant\nprocessing, partially offset by\nlower client activity related\nto the impact of COVID-19. The\ndecrease in the nine-month\nperiod was primarily due to\nlower levels of consumer\nspending driven by the impact\nof COVID-19.\n\n\u25cf Service charges decreased\n$158 million and $435 million\nprimarily due to higher deposit\nbalances and lower client\nactivity due to the impact of\nCOVID-19.\n\n\u25cf Investment and brokerage\nservices income increased $129\nmillion and $479 million\nprimarily due to higher client\ntransactional activity, higher\nmarket valuations and assets\n\nunder management (AUM) flows,\npartially offset by declines in\nAUM pricing.\n\n\u25cf Investment banking fees\nincreased $236 million and $1.1\nbillion primarily due to higher\nequity underwriting fees and\nfor the nine-month period,\nhigher debt underwriting fees,\nas well.\n\n\u25cf Market making and similar\nactivities decreased $429\nmillion and $284 million. The\ndecrease in both periods was\nprimarily due to the impact of\nlower U.S. interest rates on\ncertain risk management\nderivatives. The decrease in\nthe nine-month period was also\npartially offset by increased\nclient activity and strong\ntrading performance in FICC.\n\n\u25cf Other income decreased $294\nmillion and $533 million. The\ndecrease in the three-month\nperiod was primarily due to\nhigher partnership losses on\ntax credit investments,\nprimarily affordable housing\nand renewable energy, as well\nas loan sales in the prior\nperiod. The decrease in the\nnine-month period was primarily\ndue to lower equity investment\nincome and higher partnership\nlosses on tax credit\ninvestments.\n                                                                \n  Bank of America6                                              \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Provision for Credit Losses                                   \n                                                                \nThe provision for credit losses increased $610 million to $1.4\nbillion, and $8.6 billion to $11.3 billion for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same\nperiods in 2019 primarily driven by higher ECL due to a weaker\neconomic outlook related to COVID-19.

Our\nrecurring tax preference\nbenefits primarily consist of\ntax credits from investments in\naffordable housing and\nrenewable energy, aligning with\nour responsible growth strategy\nto address global\nsustainability challenges. We\nexpect the effective tax rate\nfor the fourth quarter of 2020\nto be approximately 10 percent,\nexcluding unusual items. Absent\nthese tax credits, the\neffective tax rate would be\napproximately 26 percent.\n\nOn July 22, 2020, the U.K.\nenacted a reversal of the final\ntwo percent of scheduled\ndecreases in the U.K.\ncorporation tax rate, which had\nbeen previously enacted. This\nchange will unfavorably affect\nincome tax expense on future\nU.K. earnings, and requires a\nreversal of the adjustment to\nthe U.K. net deferred tax\nassets recognized at the time\nthe related tax rate decrease\nwas originally enacted.\nAccordingly, during the third\nquarter of 2020, the\nCorporation recorded a positive\nincome tax adjustment of\napproximately $700 million\nalong with a corresponding\nincrease to the U.K. net\ndeferred tax assets.\n                                                                \n  7Bank of America                                              \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Supplemental Financial Data                                   \n                                                                \n                                                                \n   Non-GAAP Financial Measures                                  \n                                                                \nIn this Form 10-Q, we present\ncertain non-GAAP financial\nmeasures. Non-GAAP financial\nmeasures exclude certain items\nor otherwise include components\nthat differ from the most\ndirectly comparable measures\ncalculated in accordance with\nGAAP. Non-GAAP financial\nmeasures are provided as\nadditional useful information\nto assess our financial\ncondition, results of\noperations (including period-\nto-period operating\nperformance) or compliance with\nprospective regulatory\nrequirements. These non-GAAP\nfinancial measures are not\nintended as a substitute for\nGAAP financial measures and may\nnot be defined or calculated\nthe same way as non-GAAP\nfinancial measures used by\nother companies.\n\nWe view net interest income and\nrelated ratios and analyses on\nan FTE basis, which when\npresented on a consolidated\nbasis are non-GAAP financial\nmeasures. To derive the FTE\nbasis, net interest income is\nadjusted to reflect tax-exempt\nincome on an equivalent before-\ntax basis with a corresponding\nincrease in income tax expense.\nFor purposes of this\ncalculation, we use the federal\nstatutory tax rate of 21\npercent and a representative\nstate tax rate. Net interest\nyield, which measures the basis\npoints we earn over the cost of\nfunds, utilizes net interest\nincome on an FTE basis. We\nbelieve that presentation of\nthese items on an FTE basis\nallows for comparison of\namounts from both taxable and\ntax-exempt sources and is\nconsistent with industry\npractices.\n\nWe may present certain key\nperformance indicators and\nratios excluding certain items\n(e.g., debit valuation\nadjustment (DVA) gains\n(losses)) which result in non-\nGAAP financial measures. We\nbelieve that the presentation\nof measures that exclude these\nitems is useful because such\nmeasures provide additional\ninformation to assess the\nunderlying operational\nperformance and trends of our\nbusinesses and to allow better\ncomparison of period-to-period\noperating performance.\n\nWe also evaluate our business\nbased on certain ratios that\nutilize tangible equity, a non-\nGAAP financial measure.\nTangible equity represents\nshareholders\u2019 equity or common\nshareholders\u2019 equity reduced by\ngoodwill and intangible assets\n(excluding mortgage servicing\nrights (MSRs)), net of related\ndeferred tax liabilities\n(\"adjusted\" shareholders'\nequity or common shareholders'\nequity). These measures are\nused to evaluate our use of\nequity. In addition,\nprofitability, relationship and\ninvestment models use both\nreturn on average tangible\n\ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity and\nreturn on average tangible\nshareholders\u2019 equity as key\nmeasures to support our overall\ngrowth objectives. These ratios\nare as follows:\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible\ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity\nmeasures our net income\napplicable to common\nshareholders as a percentage of\nadjusted average common\nshareholders\u2019 equity. The\ntangible common equity ratio\nrepresents adjusted ending\ncommon shareholders\u2019 equity\ndivided by total tangible\nassets.\n\n\u25cf Return on average tangible\nshareholders' equity measures\nour net income as a percentage\nof adjusted average total\nshareholders\u2019 equity. The\ntangible equity ratio\nrepresents adjusted ending\nshareholders\u2019 equity divided by\ntotal tangible assets.\n\n\u25cf Tangible book value per\ncommon share represents\nadjusted ending common\nshareholders\u2019 equity divided by\nending common shares\noutstanding.\n\nWe believe ratios utilizing\ntangible equity provide\nadditional useful information\nbecause they present measures\nof those assets that can\ngenerate income. Tangible book\nvalue per common share provides\nadditional useful information\nabout the level of tangible\nassets in relation to\noutstanding shares of common\nstock.\n\nThe aforementioned supplemental\ndata and performance measures\nare presented in Tables 5 and\n6.\n\nFor more information on the\nreconciliation of these non-\nGAAP financial measures to the\ncorresponding GAAP financial\nmeasures, see Non-GAAP\nReconciliations on page 51.\n                                                                \n  Key Performance Indicators                                    \n                                                                \nWe present certain key\nfinancial and nonfinancial\nperformance indicators (key\nperformance indicators) that\nmanagement uses when assessing\nour consolidated and/or segment\nresults.

The seven\nkey types of risk faced by the\nCorporation are strategic,\ncredit, market, liquidity,\ncompliance, operational and\nreputational. Sound risk\nmanagement enables us to serve\nour customers and deliver for\nour shareholders. If not\nmanaged well, risks can result\nin financial loss, regulatory\nsanctions and penalties, and\ndamage to our reputation, each\nof which may adversely impact\nour ability to execute our\nbusiness strategies. We take a\ncomprehensive approach to risk\nmanagement with a defined Risk\nFramework and an articulated\nRisk Appetite Statement which\nare approved annually by the\nEnterprise Risk Committee and\nthe Board.\n\nOur Risk Framework serves as\nthe foundation for the\nconsistent and effective\nmanagement of risks facing the\nCorporation. The Risk Framework\nsets forth clear roles,\nresponsibilities and\naccountability for the\nmanagement of risk and provides\na blueprint for how the Board,\nthrough delegation of authority\nto committees and executive\nofficers, establishes risk\nappetite and associated limits\nfor our activities.\n\nOur Risk Appetite Statement is\nintended to ensure that the\nCorporation maintains an\nacceptable risk profile by\nproviding a common framework\nand a comparable set of\nmeasures for senior management\nand the Board to clearly\nindicate the level of risk the\nCorporation is willing to\naccept. Risk appetite is set at\nleast annually and is aligned\nwith the Corporation\u2019s\nstrategic, capital and\nfinancial operating plans. Our\nline-of-business strategies and\nrisk appetite are also\nsimilarly aligned.\n\nFor more information about the\nCorporation's risks related to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, see Part\nII, Item 1A. Risk Factors on\npage 105. These COVID-19\nrelated risks are being managed\nwithin our Risk Framework and\nsupporting risk management\nprograms.\n\nFor more information on our\nRisk Framework, our risk\nmanagement activities and the\nkey types of risk faced by the\nCorporation, see the Managing\nRisk through Reputational Risk\nsections in the MD&A of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2019 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\n                                                                \n  Capital Management                                            \n                                                                \nThe Corporation manages its\ncapital position so that its\ncapital is more than adequate\nto support its business\nactivities and aligns with\nrisk, risk appetite and\nstrategic planning.

In June\n2020, the Federal Reserve\nnotified BHCs of their 2020\nCCAR supervisory stress test\nresults, which included a\npreliminary stress capital\nbuffer (SCB) that was finalized\nin August 2020. Based on our\nresults, we are subject to a\n2.5 percent SCB for the period\nbeginning October 1, 2020 and\nending on September 30, 2021.\nOur Common equity tier 1 (CET1)\ncapital ratio under the\nStandardized approach must\nremain above 9.5 percent during\nthis period (the sum of our\nCET1 capital ratio minimum of\n4.5 percent, global\nsystemically important bank\n(G-SIB) surcharge of 2.5\npercent and our SCB of 2.5\npercent) in order to avoid\nrestrictions on capital\ndistributions and discretionary\nbonus payments.\n\nDue to economic uncertainty\nresulting from the COVID-19\npandemic, the Federal Reserve\nrequired all large banks to\nsuspend share repurchase\nprograms in the third quarter\nof 2020, except for repurchases\nto offset shares awarded under\nequity-based compensation\nplans, and to limit dividends\nto existing rates that do not\nexceed the average of the last\nfour quarters\u2019 net income. In\nSeptember 2020, the Federal\nReserve announced that these\nmeasures would remain in place\nfor the fourth quarter of 2020.\nLarge banks will also be\nrequired to update and resubmit\ntheir capital plans in November\n2020 based on the Federal\nReserve\u2019s updated supervisory\nstress test scenarios. The\nFederal Reserve announced that\nit will publish the results of\nthe additional supervisory\nstress tests by December 31,\n2020.\n\nAs previously disclosed, the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s directives\nregarding share repurchases\naligned with our decision to\nvoluntarily suspend our general\ncommon stock repurchase program\nduring the first half of 2020.\nThe suspension of our\nrepurchases did not include\nrepurchases to offset shares\nawarded under our equity-based\ncompensation plans, for which\nwe repurchased $114 million of\ncommon stock during the third\nquarter of 2020 pursuant to the\nBoard\u2019s repurchase\nauthorization.\n\nWe intend to maintain the\nquarterly common stock dividend\nat the current rate of $0.18\nper share until further notice,\nsubject to approval by the\nBoard. We will also continue\nour current suspension of\ncommon stock repurchases in the\nfourth quarter of 2020, except\nfor repurchases to offset\nshares awarded under our\nequity-based compensation\nplans, which have previously\nbeen authorized by the Board.\n\nOur general common stock\nrepurchase program is subject\nto the Board\u2019s approval, and at\nsuch time that we reinstate our\nstock repurchase program, our\nstock repurchases will be\nsubject to various factors,\nincluding the Corporation\u2019s\ncapital position, liquidity,\nfinancial performance and\nalternative uses of capital,\nstock trading price and general\nmarket conditions, and may be\nsuspended at any time. Such\nrepurchases may be effected\nthrough open market purchases\nor privately negotiated\ntransactions, including\nrepurchase plans that satisfy\nthe conditions of Rule 10b5-1\nof the Securities Exchange Act\nof 1934, as amended (Exchange\nAct).\n                                                                \n  23Bank of America                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Regulatory Capital                                            \n                                                                \nAs a financial services holding\ncompany, we are subject to\nregulatory capital rules,\nincluding Basel 3, issued by\nU.S. banking regulators.

The\napproach that yields the lower\nratio is used to assess capital\nadequacy including under the\nPCA framework. As of September\n30, 2020, the CET1, Tier 1\ncapital and Total capital\nratios for the Corporation were\nlower under the Standardized\napproach.\n                                                                \n  Minimum Capital Requirements                                  \n                                                                \nIn order to avoid restrictions\non capital distributions and\ndiscretionary bonus payments,\nthe Corporation must meet risk-\nbased capital ratio\nrequirements that include a\ncapital conservation buffer\ngreater than 2.5 percent, plus\nany\n\napplicable countercyclical\ncapital buffer and a G-SIB\nsurcharge. On October 1, 2020,\nthe capital conservation buffer\nwas replaced by the SCB for the\nCorporation\u2019s Standardized\napproach ratio requirements.\nThe buffers and surcharge must\nbe comprised solely of CET1\ncapital.\n\nThe Corporation is also\nrequired to maintain a minimum\nsupplementary leverage ratio\n(SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a\nleverage buffer of 2.0 percent\nin order to avoid certain\nrestrictions on capital\ndistributions and discretionary\nbonus payments.

These liquidity risk\nmanagement practices have\nallowed us to effectively\nmanage the market stress that\nbegan in the first quarter of\n2020 from the COVID-19\npandemic.

We\ndefine liquidity as readily\navailable assets, limited to\ncash and high-quality, liquid,\nunencumbered securities that we\ncan use to meet our contractual\nand contingent financial\nobligations as those\nobligations arise. We manage\nour liquidity position through\nline-of-business and ALM\nactivities, as well as through\nour legal entity funding\nstrategy, on both a forward and\ncurrent (including intraday)\nbasis under both expected and\nstressed conditions. We believe\nthat a centralized approach to\nfunding and liquidity\nmanagement enhances our ability\nto monitor liquidity\nrequirements, maximizes access\nto funding sources, minimizes\nborrowing costs and facilitates\ntimely responses to liquidity\nevents.

NB\nHoldings Corporation We have\nintercompany arrangements with\ncertain key subsidiaries under\nwhich we transferred certain\nassets of Bank of America\nCorporation, as the parent\ncompany, which is a separate\nand distinct legal entity from\nour banking and nonbank\nsubsidiaries, and agreed to\ntransfer certain additional\nparent company assets not\nneeded to satisfy anticipated\nnear term expenditures, to NB\nHoldings Corporation, a wholly-\nowned holding company\nsubsidiary (NB Holdings). The\nparent company is expected to\ncontinue to have access to the\nsame flow of dividends,\ninterest and other amounts of\ncash necessary to service its\ndebt, pay dividends and perform\nother obligations as it would\nhave had if it had not entered\ninto these arrangements and\ntransferred any assets. These\narrangements support our\npreferred single point of entry\nresolution strategy, under\nwhich only the parent company\nwould be resolved under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code.

We maintain liquidity\navailable to the Corporation,\nincluding the parent company\nand selected subsidiaries, in\nthe form of cash and high-\nquality, liquid, unencumbered\nsecurities. Typically, parent\ncompany and NB Holdings\nliquidity is in the form of\ncash deposited with BANA. Our\nbank subsidiaries\u2019 liquidity is\nprimarily driven by deposit and\nlending activity, as well as\nsecurities valuation and net\ndebt activity. Liquidity at\nbank subsidiaries excludes the\ncash deposited by the parent\ncompany and NB Holdings. Our\nbank subsidiaries can also\ngenerate incremental liquidity\nby pledging a range of\nunencumbered loans and\nsecurities to certain Federal\nHome Loan Banks (FHLBs) and the\nFederal Reserve\n\nDiscount Window. The cash we\ncould have obtained by\nborrowing against this pool of\nspecifically-identified\neligible assets was $320\nbillion and $372 billion at\nSeptember 30, 2020 and December\n31, 2019.

Due to regulatory\nrestrictions, liquidity\ngenerated by the bank\nsubsidiaries can generally be\nused only to fund obligations\nwithin the bank subsidiaries,\nand transfers to the parent\ncompany or nonbank subsidiaries\nmay be subject to prior\nregulatory approval. Liquidity\nheld in other regulated\nentities, comprised primarily\nof broker-dealer subsidiaries,\nis primarily available to meet\nthe obligations of that entity,\nand transfers to the parent\ncompany or to any other\nsubsidiary may be subject to\nprior regulatory approval due\nto regulatory restrictions and\nminimum requirements. Our other\nregulated entities also hold\nunencumbered investment-grade\nsecurities and equities that we\nbelieve could be used to\ngenerate additional liquidity.\nTable 14 presents the\ncomposition of average GLS for\nthe three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2020 and December\n31, 2019.\n                                                                \n                                        Three                   \n                Average                Months                   \n  Table 14      Global                  Ended                   \n  (Dollars      Liquidity           September         December  \n  in            Sources                    30               31  \n  billions)     Composition              2020             2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Cash on                      $          244    $         103  \n  deposit                                                       \n  U.S.                                                          \n  Treasury                                166               98  \n  securities                                                    \n  U.S.                                                          \n  agency                                                        \n  securitie\u2026                                                    \n  mortgage-\u2026                              426              358  \n  securitie\u2026                                                    \n  and other                                                     \n  investmen\u2026                                                    \n  securities                                                    \n  Non-U.S.                                                      \n  government                               23               17  \n  securities                                                    \n  Total                                                         \n  Average                                                       \n  Global                       $          859    $         576  \n  Liquidity                                                     \n  Sources                                                       \n                                                                \nOur GLS are substantially the\nsame in composition to what\nqualifies as High Quality\nLiquid Assets (HQLA) under the\nfinal U.S. Liquidity Coverage\nRatio (LCR) rules.

We may, from\ntime to time, purchase\noutstanding debt instruments in\nvarious transactions, depending\non market conditions, liquidity\nand other factors. Our other\nregulated entities may also\nmake markets in our debt\ninstruments to provide\nliquidity for investors.\n\nWe use derivative transactions\nto manage the duration,\ninterest rate and currency\nrisks of our borrowings,\nconsidering the characteristics\nof the assets they are funding.\nFor more information on our ALM\nactivities, see Interest Rate\nRisk Management for the Banking\nBook on page 48.\n\nWe may issue unsecured debt in\nthe form of structured notes\nfor client purposes, certain of\nwhich qualify as TLAC-eligible\ndebt. During the nine months\nended September 30, 2020, we\nissued $6.1 billion of\nstructured notes, which are\nunsecured debt obligations that\npay investors returns linked to\nother debt or equity\nsecurities, indices, currencies\nor commodities. We typically\nhedge the returns we are\nobligated to\n\npay on these liabilities with\nderivatives and/or investments\nin the underlying instruments,\nso that from a funding\nperspective, the cost is\nsimilar to our other unsecured\nlong-term debt. We could be\nrequired to settle certain\nstructured note obligations for\ncash or other securities prior\nto maturity under certain\ncircumstances, which we\nconsider for liquidity planning\npurposes. We believe, however,\nthat a portion of such\nborrowings will remain\noutstanding beyond the earliest\nput or redemption date.\n\nSubstantially all of our senior\nand subordinated debt\nobligations contain no\nprovisions that could trigger a\nrequirement for an early\nrepayment, require additional\ncollateral support, result in\nchanges to terms, accelerate\nmaturity or create additional\nfinancial obligations upon an\nadverse change in our credit\nratings, financial ratios,\nearnings, cash flows or stock\nprice.

negatively\nimpacted economic activity in\nthe U.S. and around the world.\nHowever, there were also\npositive signs during this\nperiod as parts of the economy\nbegan to reopen, and\nunemployment dropped from\ndouble-digit highs in the\nsecond quarter of 2020. To\nprovide relief to individuals\nand businesses in the U.S., the\nPresident signed into law four\neconomic stimulus packages in\nMarch and April 2020, including\nthe CARES Act, and also signed\nan executive order in August\n2020 to establish the Lost Wage\nAssistance Program. In\naddition, U.S. bank regulatory\nagencies also issued\ninteragency guidance to\nfinancial institutions that are\nworking with borrowers affected\nby COVID-19.\n\nConsumer charge-offs remained\nlow during the nine months\nended September 30, 2020 due to\npayment deferrals and\ngovernment stimulus benefits.\nHowever, we experienced\nincreases in nonperforming\nloans and commercial reservable\ncriticized utilized exposures\nas a result of weaker economic\nconditions arising from\nCOVID-19, particularly in\ncertain sectors of the economy\nthat have been more\nsignificantly impacted during\nthe pandemic (e.g., travel and\nentertainment).\n\nTo support our customers, we\nimplemented various loan\nmodification programs and other\nforms of support beginning in\nMarch 2020, including offering\nloan payment deferrals,\nrefunding certain fees, and\npausing foreclosure sales,\nevictions and repossessions.\nDuring the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2020, we\nexperienced a decline in the\nneed for customer assistance as\nthe number of customer accounts\nand balances on deferral\ndecreased significantly. For\ninformation on the accounting\nfor loan modifications related\nto the COVID-19\n\npandemic, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary\nof Significant Accounting\nPrinciples to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n                                                                \n   Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management                    \n                                                                \nCredit risk management for the\nconsumer portfolio begins with\ninitial underwriting and\ncontinues throughout a\nborrower\u2019s credit cycle.\nStatistical techniques in\nconjunction with experiential\njudgment are used in all\naspects of portfolio management\nincluding underwriting, product\npricing, risk appetite, setting\ncredit limits, and establishing\noperating processes and metrics\nto quantify and balance risks\nand returns. Statistical models\nare built using detailed\nbehavioral information from\nexternal sources such as credit\nbureaus and/or internal\nhistorical experience and are a\ncomponent of our consumer\ncredit risk management process.\nThese models are used in part\nto assist in making both new\nand ongoing credit decisions,\nas well as portfolio management\nstrategies, including\nauthorizations and line\nmanagement, collection\npractices and strategies, and\ndetermination of the allowance\nfor loan and lease losses and\nallocated capital for credit\nrisk.\n                                                                \n  Consumer Credit Portfolio                                     \n                                                                \nWhile COVID-19 is severely\nimpacting economic activity,\nand is contributing to\nincreasing delinquencies and\nnonperforming loans within\ncertain consumer portfolios, it\ndid not have a significant\nimpact on consumer portfolio\ncharge-offs during the three\nand nine months ended September\n30, 2020 due to payment\ndeferrals and government\nstimulus benefits. However,\nCOVID-19 could lead to adverse\nimpacts to credit quality\nmetrics in future periods if\nnegative economic conditions\ncontinue or worsen. Net charge-\noffs decreased $58 million to\n$564 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2020\ndue to lower credit card losses\nand remained relatively flat at\n$2.2 billion for the nine\nmonths ended September 30,\n2020.\n\nThe consumer allowance for loan\nand lease losses increased $6.1\nbillion during the nine months\nended September 30, 2020 to\n$10.7 billion due to the\nadoption of the new CECL\naccounting standard and\ndeterioration in the economic\noutlook resulting\n                                                                \n  Bank of America30                                             \n                                                                \nfrom the impact of COVID-19.\nFor more information, see\nAllowance for Credit Losses on\npage 44.\n\nFor more information on our\naccounting policies regarding\ndelinquencies, nonperforming\nstatus, charge-offs and TDRs\nfor the consumer portfolio, see\nNote 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant\nAccounting Principles and Note\n5 \u2013 Outstanding Loans and\nLeases to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2019 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.

Significant\nAccounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\n(2) Includes loans that are\ncontractually current which\nprimarily consist of\ncollateral-dependent TDRs,\nincluding those that have been\ndischarged in Chapter 7\nbankruptcy and loans that have\nnot yet demonstrated a\nsustained period of payment\nperformance following a TDR.\n\n(3) These vintages of loans\naccounted for $481 million, or\n29 percent, and $365 million,\nor 25 percent, of nonperforming\nresidential mortgage loans at\nSeptember 30, 2020 and December\n31, 2019.\n\nNonperforming outstanding\nbalances in the residential\nmortgage portfolio increased\n$205 million during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2020\nprimarily driven by loans with\ndeferrals that expired and have\nsubsequently become\nnonperforming, and the\ninclusion of certain loans\nthat, upon adoption of the new\ncredit loss standard, became\naccounted for on an individual\nbasis, which previously had\nbeen accounted for under a pool\nbasis. Of the nonperforming\nresidential mortgage loans at\nSeptember 30, 2020, $531\nmillion, or 32 percent, were\ncurrent on contractual\npayments. Loans accruing past\ndue 30 days or more increased\n$98 million driven primarily by\nborrowers whose deferrals\nexpired throughout the year and\nhave subsequently become\ndelinquent.\n\nNet charge-offs increased $32\nmillion and $24 million to a\nnet recovery of $6 million and\n$27 million for the three and\nnine months ended September 30,\n2020 compared to the same\nperiods in 2019. This increase\nis due largely to lower\nrecoveries from the sales of\npreviously charged-off loans.\n\nOf the $221.0 billion in total\nresidential mortgage loans\noutstanding at September 30,\n2020, as shown in Table 20, 27\npercent were originated as\ninterest-only loans. The\noutstanding balance of\ninterest-only residential\nmortgage loans that have\nentered the amortization period\nwas $6.3 billion, or 11\npercent, at September 30, 2020.\nResidential mortgage loans that\nhave entered the amortization\nperiod generally have\nexperienced a higher rate of\nearly stage delinquencies and\nnonperforming status compared\nto the residential mortgage\nportfolio as a\n\nwhole. At September 30, 2020,\n$101 million, or two percent of\noutstanding interest-only\nresidential mortgages that had\nentered the amortization period\nwere accruing past due 30 days\nor more compared to $1.4\nbillion, or less than one\npercent, for the entire\nresidential mortgage portfolio.\nIn addition, at September 30,\n2020, $329 million, or five\npercent, of outstanding\ninterest-only residential\nmortgage loans that had entered\nthe amortization period were\nnonperforming, of which $71\nmillion were contractually\ncurrent, compared to $1.7\nbillion, or one percent, for\nthe entire residential mortgage\nportfolio. Loans that have yet\nto enter the amortization\nperiod in our interest-only\nresidential mortgage portfolio\nare primarily well-\ncollateralized loans to our\nwealth management clients and\nhave an interest-only period of\nthree to ten years.\nApproximately 97 percent of\nthese loans that have yet to\nenter the amortization period\nwill not be required to make a\nfully-amortizing payment until\n2022 or later.\n\nTable 21 presents outstandings,\nnonperforming loans and net\ncharge-offs by certain state\nconcentrations for the\nresidential mortgage portfolio.\nThe Los Angeles-Long Beach-\nSanta Ana Metropolitan\nStatistical Area (MSA) within\nCalifornia represented 16\npercent of outstandings at both\nSeptember 30, 2020 and December\n31, 2019. In the New York area,\nthe New York-Northern New\nJersey-Long Island MSA made up\n14 percent and 13 percent of\noutstandings at September 30,\n2020 and December 31, 2019.\n                                                                \n                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n          $      $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n          $      $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n          $      $                                              \n                                                                \n(1) Outstandings and nonperforming loans exclude loans accounted\nfor under the fair value option.\n                                                                \n  33Bank of America                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Home Equity                                                   \n                                                                \nAt September 30, 2020, the home\nequity portfolio made up eight\npercent of the consumer\nportfolio and was comprised of\nhome equity lines of credit\n(HELOCs), home equity loans and\nreverse mortgages.

HELOCs generally have an\ninitial draw period of 10\nyears, and after the initial\ndraw period ends, the loans\ngenerally convert to 15- or\n20-year amortizing loans.\n\nAt September 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019, our home\nequity loan portfolio had an\noutstanding balance of $974\nmillion and $1.2 billion, or\nthree percent, of the total\nhome equity portfolio.

Outstanding balances in the\nhome equity portfolio decreased\n$3.7 billion during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2020\nprimarily due to paydowns\noutpacing new originations and\ndraws on existing lines.

of\nloans where we serviced the\nunderlying first lien at\nSeptember 30, 2020 and December\n31, 2019.\n\n(3) Includes loans that are\ncontractually current which\nprimarily consist of\ncollateral-dependent TDRs,\nincluding those that have been\ndischarged in Chapter 7\nbankruptcy, junior-lien loans\nwhere the underlying first lien\nis 90 days or more past due, as\nwell as loans that have not yet\ndemonstrated a sustained period\nof payment performance\nfollowing a TDR.\n\n(4) These vintages of loans\naccounted for 36 percent and 34\npercent of nonperforming home\nequity

2020\nprimarily driven by loans with\ndeferrals that expired and have\nsubsequently become\nnonperforming . Of the\nnonperforming home equity loans\nat September 30, 2020, $262\nmillion, or 41 percent, were\ncurrent on contractual\npayments. In addition, $223\nmillion, or 35 percent, of\nnonperforming home equity loans\nwere 180 days or more past due\nand had been written down to\nthe estimated fair value of the\ncollateral, less costs to sell.\nAccruing loans that were 30\ndays or more past due decreased\n$3 million during the nine\nmonths ended September 30,\n2020.\n\nNet charge-offs increased $182\nmillion to a net recovery of\n$20 million, and $301 million\nto a net recovery of $45\nmillion for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2020\ncompared to the same periods in\n2019 as the prior-year period\nincluded recoveries from non-\ncore home equity loan sales.\n\nOf the $36.5 billion in total\nhome equity portfolio\noutstandings at September 30,\n2020, as shown in Table 22, 15\npercent require interest-only\npayments. The outstanding\nbalance of HELOCs that have\nreached the end of their draw\nperiod and have entered the\namortization period was $9.9\nbillion at September 30, 2020.\nThe HELOCs that have entered\nthe\n\namortization period have\nexperienced a higher percentage\nof early stage delinquencies\nand nonperforming status when\ncompared to the HELOC portfolio\nas a whole. At September 30,\n2020, $145 million, or one\npercent of outstanding HELOCs\nthat had entered the\namortization period were\naccruing past due 30 days or\nmore. In addition, at September\n30, 2020, $473 million, or five\npercent, were nonperforming.\nLoans that have yet to enter\nthe amortization period in our\ninterest-only portfolio are\nprimarily post-2008 vintages\nand generally have better\ncredit quality than the\nprevious vintages that had\nentered the amortization\nperiod. We communicate to\ncontractually current customers\nmore than a year prior to the\nend of their draw period to\ninform them of the potential\nchange to the payment structure\nbefore entering the\namortization period, and\nprovide payment options to\ncustomers prior to the end of\nthe draw period.\n\nAlthough we do not actively\ntrack how many of our home\nequity customers pay only the\nminimum amount due on their\nhome equity loans and lines, we\ncan infer some of this\ninformation through a review of\nour HELOC portfolio that we\nservice and that is still in\nits revolving period. During\nthe three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2020, 17 percent\nof these customers with an\noutstanding balance did not pay\nany principal on their HELOCs.\n                                                                \n  Bank of America34                                             \n                                                                \nTable 23 presents outstandings,\nnonperforming balances and net\ncharge-offs by certain state\nconcentrations for the home\nequity portfolio.

However, there\nwere also positive signs during\nthis period. The draws by large\ncorporate and commercial\nclients contributing to the\n$67.2 billion loan growth in\nthe first quarter of 2020 have\nlargely been repaid over the\npast six months as emergency or\ncontingent funding was no\nlonger needed or clients were\nable to access capital markets.\nAdditionally, as part of the\nCARES Act, we had $24.7 billion\nof PPP loans outstanding with\nour small business clients at\nSeptember 30, 2020, which are\nincluded in U.S. small business\ncommercial in the tables in\nthis section. For more\ninformation on PPP loans, see\nNote 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant\nAccounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nCredit quality of commercial\nreal estate borrowers has begun\nto stabilize in many sectors as\ncertain economies have\nreopened. Certain sectors,\nincluding hospitality and\nretail, continue to be\nnegatively impacted as a result\nof COVID-19. Moreover, many\nreal estate markets, while\nimproving, are still\nexperiencing some disruptions\nin demand, supply chain\nchallenges and tenant\ndifficulties.\n\nThe commercial allowance for\nloan and lease losses increased\n$4.0 billion during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2020\nto $8.9 billion due to the\ndeterioration in the economic\noutlook resulting from the\nimpact of COVID-19. For more\ninformation, see Allowance for\nCredit Losses on page 44.\n\nTotal commercial utilized\ncredit exposure decreased $4.1\nbillion during the nine months\nended September 30, 2020 to\n$631.2 billion driven by lower\nloans held-for-sale (LHFS) and\nlower loans and leases. The\nutilization rate for loans and\nleases, standby letters of\ncredit (SBLCs) and financial\nguarantees, and commercial\nletters of credit, in the\naggregate, was 58 percent at\nboth September 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019.\n                                                                \n  37Bank of America                                             \n                                                                \nTable 28 presents commercial\ncredit exposure by type for\nutilized, unfunded and total\nbinding committed credit\nexposure.

Our energy-related\ncommitted exposure decreased\n$1.8 billion, or five percent,\nduring the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2020 to $34.5\n\nbillion, driven by declines in\nexploration and production,\nenergy equipment and services\nand refining and marketing\nexposure offset, in part, by an\nincrease in our integrated\nclient exposure.

For\nmore information, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk\nManagement \u2013 Risk Mitigation.\nRisk Mitigation We purchase\ncredit protection to cover the\nfunded portion as well as the\nunfunded portion of certain\ncredit exposures. To lower the\ncost of obtaining our desired\ncredit protection levels, we\nmay add credit exposure within\nan industry, borrower or\ncounterparty group by selling\nprotection. At September 30,\n2020 and December 31, 2019, net\nnotional credit default\nprotection purchased in our\ncredit derivatives portfolio to\nhedge our funded and unfunded\nexposures for which we elected\nthe fair value option, as well\nas certain other credit\nexposures, was $5.2 billion and\n$3.3 billion. We recorded net\nlosses on these positions of\n$104 million and $106 million\nfor the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2020\ncompared to net losses of $15\nmillion and $93 million for the\nsame periods in 2019.

We define country risk as the risk\nof loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions,\ncurrency fluctuations, social instability and changes in\ngovernment policies. A risk management framework is in place to\nmeasure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In\naddition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we\nalso are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the\ncollateral received on secured financing transactions or related\nto client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are\nmanaged in the normal course of business through credit, market\nand operational risk governance, rather than through country\nrisk governance. Table 38 presents our 20 largest non-U.S.\ncountry exposures at September 30, 2020. These exposures\naccounted for 91 percent and 88 percent of our total non-U.S.\nexposure at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Net\ncountry exposure for these 20 countries increased $37.9 billion\nin the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The majority of the\nincrease was due to higher deposits with central banks in\nGermany and Japan.\n                                                                \n                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n          $      $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n          $      $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \nOur largest non-U.S. country\nexposure at September 30, 2020\nwas the U.K. with net exposure\nof $55.0 billion, which\nrepresents an $813 million\ndecrease from December 31,\n2019. Our second largest\nnon-U.S. country exposure was\nGermany with net exposure of\n$50.1 billion at September 30,\n2020, a $19.2 billion increase\nfrom December 31, 2019. The\nincrease in Germany was\nprimarily driven by an increase\nin deposits with the central\nbank.\n\nIn light of the global COVID-19\npandemic, we are monitoring our\nnon-U.S. exposure closely,\nparticularly in countries where\nrestrictions on certain\nactivities, in an attempt to\ncontain the spread and impact\nof the virus, have affected and\nwill likely\n\ncontinue to adversely affect\neconomic activity. We are\nmanaging the impact to our\ninternational business\noperations as part of our\noverall response framework and\nare taking actions to manage\nexposure carefully in impacted\nregions while supporting the\nneeds of our clients. The\nmagnitude and duration of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and its full\nimpact on the global economy\ncontinue to be highly\nuncertain. The impact of\nCOVID-19 could have an adverse\nimpact on the global economy\nfor a prolonged period of time.\nFor more information on how the\nCOVID-19 pandemic may affect\nour operations, see Executive\nSummary - Recent Developments \u2013\nCOVID-19 Pandemic on page 3 and\nPart II, Item 1A.

Upon\nadoption of the new accounting\nstandard, the Corporation\nrecorded a net increase of $3.3\nbillion in the allowance for\ncredit losses which was\ncomprised of a net increase of\n$2.9 billion in the allowance\nfor loan and lease losses and\nan increase of $310 million in\nthe reserve for unfunded\nlending commitments. The net\nincrease was primarily driven\nby a $3.1 billion increase\nrelated to the credit card\nportfolio.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses\nfurther increased by $8.0\nbillion from January 1, 2020 to\n$21.5 billion at September 30,\n2020, which included a $5.2\nbillion increase in the\ncommercial portfolio and a $2.8\nbillion increase in the\nconsumer portfolio. The\nincreases were driven by\ndeterioration in the economic\noutlook resulting from the\nimpact of COVID-19. Assuming\nthe macroeconomic outlook does\nnot deteriorate further, we do\nnot expect to increase the\nlevel of the allowance for\ncredit losses in the fourth\nquarter of 2020.

This risk is inherent\nin the financial instruments\nassociated with our operations,\nprimarily within our Global\nMarkets segment. We are also\nexposed to these risks in other\nareas of the Corporation (e.g.,\nour ALM activities). In the\nevent of market stress, these\nrisks could have a material\nimpact on our results.\n\nWe have been affected, and\nexpect to continue to be\naffected, by market stress\nresulting from the COVID-19\npandemic that began in the\nfirst quarter of 2020. For more\ninformation on the effects of\nthe pandemic, see Executive\nSummary - Recent Developments \u2013\nCOVID-19 Pandemic on page 3.\n                                                                \n   Trading Risk Management                                      \n                                                                \nTo evaluate risks in our\ntrading activities, we focus on\nthe actual and potential\nvolatility of revenues\ngenerated by individual\npositions as well as portfolios\nof positions. VaR is a common\nstatistic used to measure\nmarket risk. Our primary VaR\nstatistic is equivalent to a 99\npercent confidence level, which\nmeans that for a VaR with a\none-day holding period, there\nshould not be losses in excess\nof VaR, on average, 99 out of\n100 trading days.\n\nTable 41 presents the total\nmarket-based portfolio VaR\nwhich is the combination of the\ntotal covered positions (and\nless liquid trading positions)\nportfolio and the fair value\noption portfolio. For more\ninformation on the market risk\nVaR for trading activities, see\nTrading Risk Management in the\nMD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2019\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe total market-based\nportfolio VaR results in Table\n41 include market risk to which\nwe are exposed from all\nbusiness segments, excluding\ncredit valuation adjustment\n(CVA), DVA and related hedges.\nThe majority of this portfolio\nis within the Global Markets\nsegment.\n\nTable 41 presents period-end,\naverage, high and low daily\ntrading VaR for the three\nmonths ended September 30,\n2020, June 30, 2020 and\nSeptember 30, 2019 using a 99\npercent confidence level, as\nwell as average daily trading\nVaR for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2020 and 2019.\nThe amounts disclosed in Table\n41 and Table 42 align to the\nview of covered positions used\nin the Basel 3 capital\ncalculations. Foreign exchange\nand commodity positions are\nalways considered covered\npositions, regardless of\ntrading or banking treatment\nfor the trade, except for\nstructural foreign currency\npositions that are excluded\nwith prior regulatory approval.\n\nThe average of total covered\npositions and less liquid\ntrading positions portfolio VaR\nincreased for the three months\nended September 30, 2020\ncompared to the prior quarter\nprimarily due to a decrease in\nportfolio diversification.\n                                                                \n                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n(1) The high and low for each portfolio may have occurred on\ndifferent trading days than the high and low for the components.\nTherefore the impact from less liquid exposures and the amount\nof portfolio diversification, which is the difference between\nthe total portfolio and the sum of the individual components, is\nnot relevant.\n                                                                \n  Bank of America46                                             \n                                                                \nThe graph below presents the\ndaily covered positions and\nless liquid trading positions\nportfolio VaR for the previous\nfive quarters, corresponding to\nthe data in Table 41.

Periodically we\nevaluate the scenarios\npresented so that they are\nmeaningful in the context of\nthe current rate environment.\nThe interest rate scenarios\nalso assume U.S. dollar rates\nare floored at zero. In the\nnine months ended September 30,\n2020, the asset sensitivity of\nour balance sheet increased in\nboth up-rate and down-rate\nscenarios primarily due to\nhigher deposit balances. We\ncontinue to be asset sensitive\nto a parallel upward move in\ninterest rates with the\nmajority of that impact coming\nfrom the short end of the yield\ncurve. Additionally, higher\ninterest rates impact the fair\nvalue of debt securities and,\naccordingly, for debt\n\nsecurities classified as AFS,\nmay adversely affect OCI and\nthus capital levels under the\nBasel 3 capital rules. Under\ninstantaneous upward parallel\nshifts, the near-term adverse\nimpact to Basel 3 capital is\nreduced over time by offsetting\npositive impacts to net\ninterest income.

As\npart of our ALM activities, we\nuse securities, certain\nresidential mortgages, and\ninterest rate and foreign\nexchange derivatives in\nmanaging interest rate\nsensitivity. The behavior of\nour deposits portfolio in the\nbaseline forecast and in\nalternate interest rate\nscenarios is a key assumption\nin our projected estimates of\nnet interest income. The\nsensitivity analysis in Table\n44 assumes no change in deposit\nportfolio size or mix from the\nbaseline forecast in alternate\nrate environments. In higher\nrate scenarios, any customer\nactivity resulting in the\nreplacement of low-cost or\nnoninterest-bearing deposits\nwith higher yielding deposits\nor market-based funding would\nreduce our benefit in those\nscenarios. Interest Rate and\nForeign Exchange Derivative\nContracts Interest rate and\nforeign exchange derivative\ncontracts are utilized in our\nALM activities and serve as an\nefficient tool to manage our\ninterest rate and foreign\nexchange risk. We use\nderivatives to hedge the\nvariability in cash flows or\nchanges in fair value on our\nbalance sheet due to interest\nrate and foreign exchange\ncomponents. For more\ninformation on our hedging\nactivities, see Note 3 \u2013\nDerivatives to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements. For more\ninformation on interest rate\ncontracts and risk management,\nsee Interest Rate Risk\nManagement for the Banking Book\nin the MD&A of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2019 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K. We use\ninterest rate derivative\ninstruments to hedge the\nvariability in the cash flows\nof our assets and liabilities\nand other forecasted\ntransactions (collectively\nreferred to as cash flow\nhedges). The net results on\nboth open and terminated cash\nflow hedge derivative\ninstruments recorded in\naccumulated OCI\n                                                                \n  Bank of America48                                             \n                                                                \nwere a gain of $557 million and\na loss of $496 million, on a\npretax basis, at September 30,\n2020 and December 31, 2019.\nThese gains and losses are\nexpected to be reclassified\ninto earnings in the same\nperiod as the hedged cash flows\naffect earnings and will\ndecrease income or increase\nexpense on the respective\nhedged cash flows. Assuming no\nchange in open cash flow\nderivative hedge positions and\nno changes in prices or\ninterest rates beyond what is\nimplied in forward yield curves\nat September 30, 2020, the\nafter-tax net gains are\nexpected to be reclassified\ninto earnings as follows: a\ngain of $191 million within the\nnext year, a gain of $352\nmillion in years two through\nfive, a loss of $79 million in\nyears six through ten, with the\nremaining loss of $56 million\nthereafter. For more\ninformation on derivatives\ndesignated as cash flow hedges,\nsee Note 3 \u2013 Derivatives to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nWe hedge our net investment in\nnon-U.S. operations determined\nto have functional currencies\nother than the U.S.\n\ndollar using forward foreign\nexchange contracts that\ntypically settle in less than\n180 days, cross-currency basis\nswaps and foreign exchange\noptions. We recorded net after-\ntax losses on derivatives in\naccumulated OCI associated with\nnet investment hedges which\nwere offset by gains on our net\ninvestments in consolidated\nnon-U.S. entities at September\n30, 2020.\n\nTable 45 presents derivatives\nutilized in our ALM activities\nand shows the notional amount,\nfair value, weighted-average\nreceive-fixed and pay-fixed\nrates, expected maturity and\naverage estimated durations of\nour open ALM derivatives at\nSeptember 30, 2020 and December\n31, 2019. These amounts do not\ninclude derivative hedges on\nour MSRs. During the nine\nmonths ended September 30,\n2020, the fair value of\nreceive-fixed interest rate\nswaps increased while pay-fixed\ninterest swaps decreased,\nprimarily driven by lower swap\nrates on

Many of\nour significant accounting\nprinciples require complex\njudgments to estimate the\nvalues of assets and\nliabilities. We have procedures\nand processes in place to\nfacilitate making these\njudgments. For more\ninformation, see Complex\nAccounting Estimates in the\nMD&A of the Corporation\u2019s 2019\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K and\nNote 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant\nAccounting Principles to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements of the Corporation\u2019s\n2019 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. Except as noted below\nunder Allowance for Credit\nLosses, there have not been any\nmaterial updates to our complex\naccounting estimates as\ndisclosed in the MD&A of the\nCorporation's Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\n                                                                \n  Allowance for Credit Losses                                   \n                                                                \nOn January 1, 2020, the\nCorporation adopted the new\naccounting standard that\nrequires the measurement of the\nallowance for credit losses,\nwhich includes the allowance\nfor loan and lease losses and\nthe reserve for unfunded\nlending commitments, to be\nbased on management\u2019s best\nestimate of lifetime ECL\ninherent in the Corporation's\nrelevant financial assets.\n\nThe Corporation's estimate of\nlifetime ECL includes the use\nof quantitative models that\nincorporate forward-looking\n\nmacroeconomic scenarios that\nare applied over the\ncontractual life of the loan\nportfolios, adjusted for\nexpected prepayments and\nborrower-controlled extension\noptions. These macroeconomic\nscenarios include variables\nthat have historically been key\ndrivers of increases and\ndecreases in credit losses.\nThese variables include, but\nare not limited to,\nunemployment rates, real estate\nprices, gross domestic product\nlevels, corporate bond spreads\nand long-term interest rate\nforecasts. As any one economic\noutlook is inherently\nuncertain, the Corporation\nleverages multiple scenarios.\nThe scenarios that are chosen\neach quarter and the amount of\nweighting given to each\nscenario depend on a variety of\nfactors including recent\neconomic events, leading\neconomic indicators, views of\ninternal and third-party\neconomists and industry trends.\n\nThe Corporation also includes\nqualitative reserves to cover\nlosses that are expected but,\nin the Corporation's\nassessment, may not be\nadequately represented in the\neconomic assumptions described\nabove. For example, factors\nthat the Corporation considers\ninclude changes in lending\npolicies and procedures,\nbusiness conditions, the nature\nand size of the portfolio,\nportfolio concentrations, the\nvolume and severity of past due\nloans and nonaccrual loans, the\neffect of external factors such\nas competition and legal and\nregulatory requirements, among\nothers. Further, the\nCorporation considers the\ninherent uncertainty in\nquantitative models that are\nbuilt on historical data.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses\ncan also be impacted by\nunanticipated changes in asset\nquality of the portfolio, such\nas increases in risk rating\ndowngrades in our commercial\nportfolio, deterioration in\nborrower delinquencies or\ncredit scores in our credit\ncard portfolio or increases in\nLTVs in our consumer real\nestate portfolio. In addition,\nwhile we have incorporated our\nestimated impact of COVID-19\ninto our allowance for credit\nlosses, the ultimate impact of\nthe pandemic is still unknown,\nincluding how long economic\nactivities will be impacted and\nwhat effect the unprecedented\nlevels of government fiscal and\nmonetary actions will have on\nthe economy and our credit\nlosses.\n\nAs described above, the process\nto determine the allowance for\ncredit losses requires numerous\nestimates and assumptions, some\nof which require a high degree\nof judgment and are often\ninterrelated. Changes in the\nestimates and assumptions can\nresult in significant changes\nin the allowance for credit\nlosses. Our process for\ndetermining the allowance for\ncredit losses is further\ndiscussed in Note 1 \u2013 Summary\nof Significant Accounting\nPrinciples and Note 5 \u2013\nOutstanding Loans and Leases\nand Allowance for Credit Losses\nto the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\n                                                                \n  Bank of America50                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Non-GAAP Reconciliations                                      \n                                                                \nTable 46 provides reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial\nmeasures to the most closely related GAAP financial measures.\n                                                                \n       P\u2026                                                       \n       a\u2026                                                       \n       A\u2026                                                       \n       S\u2026                                                       \n       F\u2026                                                       \n       D\u2026                         A\u2026                            \n       a\u2026                         T\u2026                \u2026           \n  \u2026    R\u2026                         M\u2026                \u2026           \n  \u2026    to       P\u2026       D\u2026       E\u2026                \u2026           \n  \u2026    G\u2026       S\u2026       31       S\u2026                \u2026           \n  \u2026    F\u2026       30       2\u2026       30                \u2026           \n  \u2026    M\u2026       2\u2026       2\u2026       2\u2026       2\u2026       \u2026           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026          $  2\u2026    $  2\u2026    $  2\u2026    $  2\u2026    $  \u2026    $  2\u2026  \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026             -\u2026       -\u2026       -\u2026       -\u2026       \u2026       -\u2026  \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026             -\u2026       -\u2026       -\u2026       -\u2026       \u2026       -\u2026  \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026             9\u2026       7\u2026       8\u2026       7\u2026       \u2026       7\u2026  \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026          $  1\u2026    $  1\u2026    $  1\u2026    $  2\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026  \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026             -\u2026       -\u2026       -\u2026       -\u2026       \u2026       -\u2026  \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026          $  1\u2026    $  1\u2026    $  1\u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026  \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026          $  2\u2026    $  2\u2026                                     \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026             -\u2026       -\u2026                                     \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026             -\u2026       -\u2026                                     \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026             9\u2026       7\u2026                                     \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026          $  2\u2026    $  2\u2026                                     \n  \u2026                                                             \n                                                                \n(1) Presents reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to\nthe most closely related GAAP financial measures.

Assets held in an\nagency or fiduciary capacity\nare not included in the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements. The Corporation\naccounts for investments in\ncompanies for which it owns a\nvoting interest and for which\nit has the ability to exercise\nsignificant influence over\noperating and financing\ndecisions using the equity\nmethod of accounting. These\ninvestments are included in\nother assets. Equity method\ninvestments are subject to\nimpairment testing, and the\nCorporation\u2019s proportionate\nshare of income or loss is\nincluded in other income. The\npreparation of the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in\nconformity with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted\nin the United States of America\nrequires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that\naffect reported amounts and\ndisclosures. Actual results\ncould materially differ from\nthose estimates and\nassumptions. These unaudited\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements should be read in\nconjunction with the audited\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements of the Corporation\u2019s\n2019 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. The nature of the\nCorporation\u2019s business is such\nthat the results of any interim\nperiod are not necessarily\nindicative of results for a\nfull year. In the opinion of\nmanagement, all adjustments,\nwhich consist of normal\nrecurring adjustments necessary\nfor a fair statement of the\ninterim period results, have\nbeen made. The Corporation\nevaluates subsequent events\nthrough the date of filing with\nthe Securities and Exchange\nCommission. Certain prior-\nperiod amounts have been\nreclassified to conform to\ncurrent period presentation.\nNew Accounting Standards\nReference Rate Reform In March\n2020, the FASB issued a new\naccounting standard related to\ncontracts or hedging\nrelationships that reference\nLIBOR or other reference rates\nthat are expected to be\ndiscontinued due to reference\nrate reform. The new standard\nprovides for optional\nexpedients and other guidance\nregarding the accounting\nrelated to modifications of\ncontracts, hedging\nrelationships and other\ntransactions affected by\nreference rate reform. The\nCorporation has elected to\nretrospectively adopt the new\nstandard as of January 1, 2020\nwhich resulted in noimmediate\nimpact. While reference rate\nreform is not expected to have\na material accounting impact on\nthe Corporation\u2019s\n\nconsolidated financial position\nor results of operations, the\nstandard will ease the\nadministrative burden in\naccounting for the future\neffects of reference rate\nreform. Accounting for\nFinancial Instruments -- Credit\nLosses On January 1, 2020, the\nCorporation adopted the new\naccounting standard that\nrequires the measurement of the\nallowance for credit losses to\nbe based on management\u2019s best\nestimate of lifetime expected\ncredit losses (ECL) inherent in\nthe Corporation\u2019s relevant\nfinancial assets. Upon adoption\nof the standard on January 1,\n2020, the Corporation recorded\na $ 3.3billion, or 32percent,\nincrease to the allowance for\ncredit losses. After adjusting\nfor deferred taxes and other\nadoption effects, a $\n2.4billion decrease was\nrecorded in retained earnings\nthrough a cumulative-effect\nadjustment. Accounting\nPrinciples for Credit Losses\nThe following summarizes the\nCorporation\u2019s accounting\npolicies for certain credit\nloss activities. Allowance for\nCredit Losses The allowance for\ncredit losses includes both the\nallowance for loan and lease\nlosses and the reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments\nand represents management\u2019s\nestimate of the ECL in the\nCorporation\u2019s loan and lease\nportfolio, excluding loans and\nunfunded lending commitments\naccounted for under the fair\nvalue option. The ECL on funded\nconsumer and commercial loans\nand leases is referred to as\nthe allowance for loan and\nlease losses and is reported\nseparately as a contra-asset to\nloans and leases on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. The\nECL for unfunded lending\ncommitments, including home\nequity lines of credit\n(HELOCs), standby letters of\ncredit (SBLCs) and binding\nunfunded loan commitments is\nreported on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet in accrued\nexpenses and other liabilities.\nThe provision for credit losses\nrelated to the loan and lease\nportfolio and unfunded lending\ncommitments is reported in the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome. For loans and leases,\nthe ECL is typically estimated\nusing quantitative methods that\nconsider a variety of factors\nsuch as historical loss\nexperience, the current credit\nquality of the portfolio as\nwell as an economic outlook\nover the life of the loan. The\nlife of the loan for closed-\nended products is based on the\ncontractual maturity of the\nloan adjusted for any expected\nprepayments. The contractual\nmaturity includes any extension\noptions that are at the sole\ndiscretion of the borrower. For\nopen-ended products (e.g.,\nlines of credit), the ECL is\ndetermined based on the maximum\nrepayment term associated with\nfuture draws from credit lines\nunless those lines of credit\nare unconditionally cancellable\n(e.g., credit cards) in which\ncase the Corporation does not\nrecord any allowance. In its\nloss forecasting framework, the\nCorporation incorporates\nforward-looking information\nthrough the use of\nmacroeconomic scenarios applied\nover the forecasted life of the\nassets. These macroeconomic\nscenarios include variables\nthat have historically been key\ndrivers of increases and\ndecreases in credit losses.\nThese variables include, but\nare not limited to,\nunemployment rates, real estate\nprices, gross domestic product\nlevels, corporate bond spreads\nand long-term interest rate\nforecasts. As any one economic\noutlook is inherently\nuncertain, the Corporation\nleverages multiple scenarios.\nThe scenarios that are chosen\neach quarter and the amount of\nweighting given to each\nscenario depend on a variety of\nfactors including recent\neconomic events, leading\neconomic indicators, views of\ninternal as well as third-party\neconomists and industry trends.\n                                                                \n  Bank of America56                                             \n                                                                \nThe estimate of credit losses includes expected recoveries of\namounts previously charged off (i.e., negative allowance). If a\nloan has been charged off, the expected cash flows on the loan\nare not limited by the current amortized cost balance. Instead,\nexpected cash flows can be assumed up to the unpaid principal\nbalance immediately prior to the charge-off. The allowance for\nloan and lease losses for troubled debt restructurings (TDR) is\nmeasured based on the present value of projected future lifetime\nprincipal and interest cash flows discounted at the loan\u2019s\noriginal effective interest rate, or in cases where foreclosure\nis probable or the loan is collateral dependent, at the loan\u2019s\ncollateral value or its observable market price, if available.\nThe measurement of ECL for the renegotiated consumer credit card\nTDR portfolio is based on the present value of projected cash\nflows discounted using the average TDR portfolio contractual\ninterest rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect\nprior to restructuring. Projected cash flows for TDRs use the\nsame economic outlook as discussed above. For purposes of\ncomputing this specific loss component of the allowance, larger\nimpaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired\nloans are evaluated as a pool. Also included in the allowance\nfor loan and lease losses are qualitative reserves to cover\nlosses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment,\nmay not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or\nthe economic assumptions described above. For example, factors\nthat the Corporation considers include changes in lending\npolicies and procedures, business conditions, the nature and\nsize of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and\nseverity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of\nexternal factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory\nrequirements, among others. Further, the Corporation considers\nthe inherent uncertainty in quantitative models that are built\non historical data. With the exception of the Corporation's\ncredit card portfolio, the Corporation does not include reserves\nfor interest receivable in the measurement of the allowance for\ncredit losses as the Corporation generally classifies consumer\nloans as nonperforming at 90 days past due and reverses interest\nincome for these loans at that time. For credit card loans, the\nCorporation reserves for interest and fees as part of the\nallowance for loan and lease losses. Upon charge-off of a credit\ncard loan, the Corporation reverses the interest and fee income\nagainst the income statement line item where it was originally\nrecorded. The Corporation has identified the following\nthreeportfolio segments and measures the allowance for credit\nlosses using the following methods. Consumer Real Estate To\nestimate ECL for consumer loans secured by residential real\nestate, the Corporation estimates the number of loans that will\ndefault over the life of the existing portfolio, after factoring\nin estimated prepayments, using quantitative modeling\nmethodologies. The attributes that are most significant in\nestimating the Corporation\u2019s ECL include refreshed loan-to-value\n(LTV) or, in the case of a subordinated lien, refreshed combined\nLTV (CLTV), borrower credit score, months since origination and\ngeography, all of which are further broken down by present\ncollection status (whether the loan is current, delinquent, in\ndefault, or in bankruptcy). The estimates are based on the\nCorporation\u2019s historical experience with the loan portfolio,\nadjusted to reflect the economic outlook. The outlook on the\nunemployment rate and consumer real estate prices are key\nfactors that impact the frequency and severity of loss\nestimates. The Corporation does not reserve for credit losses on\nthe unpaid principal balance of loans insured by the Federal\nHousing Administration (FHA) and long-term standby loans, as\nthese loans are fully insured. The Corporation records a reserve\nfor unfunded lending commitments for the ECL associated with the\nundrawn portion of the Corporation\u2019s HELOCs, which can only be\ncanceled by the Corporation if certain criteria are met. The ECL\nassociated with these unfunded lending commitments is calculated\nusing the same models and methodologies noted above and\nincorporate utilization assumptions at time of default. For\nloans that are more than 180 days past due and collateral-\ndependent TDRs, the Corporation bases the allowance on the\nestimated fair value of the underlying collateral as of the\nreporting date less costs to sell. The fair value of the\ncollateral securing these loans is generally determined using an\nautomated valuation model (AVM) that estimates the value of a\nproperty by reference to market data including sales of\ncomparable properties and price trends specific to the\nMetropolitan Statistical Area in which the property being valued\nis located. In the event that an AVM value is not available, the\nCorporation utilizes publicized indices or if these methods\nprovide less reliable valuations, the Corporation uses\nappraisals or broker price opinions to estimate the fair value\nof the collateral. While there is inherent imprecision in these\nvaluations, the Corporation believes that they are\nrepresentative of this portfolio in the aggregate. For loans\nthat are more than 180 days past due and collateral-dependent\nTDRs, with the exception of the Corporation\u2019s fully insured\nportfolio, the outstanding balance of loans that is in excess of\nthe estimated property value after adjusting for costs to sell\nis charged off. If the estimated property value decreases in\nperiods subsequent to the initial charge-off, the Corporation\nwill record an additional charge-off; however, if the value\nincreases in periods subsequent to the charge-off, the\nCorporation will adjust the allowance to account for the\nincrease but not to a level above the cumulative charge-off\namount. Credit Cards and Other Consumer Credit cards are\nrevolving lines of credit without a defined maturity date. The\nestimated life of a credit card receivable is determined by\nestimating the amount and timing of expected future payments\n(e.g., borrowers making full payments, minimum payments or\nsomewhere in between) that it will take for a receivable balance\nto pay off. The ECL on the future payments incorporates the\nspending behavior of a borrower through time using key borrower-\nspecific factors and the economic outlook described above. The\nCorporation applies all expected payments in accordance with the\nCredit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of\n2009 (i.e., paying down the highest interest rate bucket first).\nThen forecasted future payments are prioritized to pay off the\noldest balance until it is brought to zero or an expected\ncharge-off amount. Unemployment rate outlook, borrower credit\nscore, delinquency status and historical payment behavior are\nall key inputs into the credit card receivable loss forecasting\nmodel. Future draws on the credit card lines are excluded from\nthe ECL as they are unconditionally cancellable.\n                                                                \n  57Bank of America                                             \n                                                                \nThe ECL for the consumer vehicle lending portfolio is also\ndetermined using quantitative methods supplemented with\nqualitative analysis. The quantitative model estimates ECL\ngiving consideration to key borrower and loan characteristics\nsuch as delinquency status, borrower credit score, LTV ratio,\nunderlying collateral type and collateral value. Commercial The\nECL on commercial loans is forecasted using models that estimate\ncredit losses over the loan\u2019s contractual life at an individual\nloan level. The models use the contractual terms to forecast\nfuture principal cash flows while also considering expected\nprepayments. For open-ended commitments such as revolving lines\nof credit, changes in funded balance are captured by forecasting\na borrower\u2019s draw and payment behavior over the remaining life\nof the commitment. For loans collateralized with commercial real\nestate and for which the underlying asset is the primary source\nof repayment, the loss forecasting models consider key loan and\ncustomer attributes such as LTV ratio, net operating income and\ndebt service coverage, and captures variations in behavior\naccording to property type and region. The commercial real\nestate model also utilizes key economic variables to forecast\nmarket indicators such as rent levels and vacancy rates, which\nimpact the ECL estimate. For all other commercial loans and\nleases, the loss forecasting model determines the probabilities\nof transition to different credit risk ratings or default at\neach point over the life of the asset based on the borrower\u2019s\ncurrent credit risk rating, industry sector, size of the\nexposure and the geographic market. The severity of loss is\ndetermined based on the type of collateral securing the\nexposure, the size of the exposure, the borrower\u2019s industry\nsector, any guarantors and the geographic market. Assumptions of\nexpected loss are conditioned to the economic outlook and the\nmodel considers key economic variables such as unemployment\nrate, gross domestic product, credit risk spreads, asset prices\nand equity market returns. In addition to the allowance for loan\nand lease losses, the Corporation also estimates ECL related to\nunfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit,\nfinancial guarantees, unfunded bankers acceptances and binding\nloan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the\nfair value option. Reserves are estimated for the unfunded\nexposure using the same models and methodologies as the funded\nexposure and are reported as reserves for unfunded lending\ncommitments. Securities The Corporation evaluates each\navailable-for-sale (AFS) security where the value has declined\nbelow amortized cost. If the Corporation intends to sell or\nbelieves it is more likely than not that it will be required to\nsell the debt security, it is written down to fair value through\nearnings. For AFS debt securities the Corporation intends to\nhold, the Corporation evaluates the debt securities for ECL\nexcept for debt securities that are guaranteed by the U.S.\nTreasury, U.S. government agencies or sovereign entities of high\ncredit quality where the Corporation applies a zero credit loss\nassumption. For the remaining AFS debt securities, the\nCorporation considers qualitative parameters such as internal\nand external credit ratings and the value of underlying\ncollateral. If an AFS debt security fails any of the qualitative\nparameters, a discounted cash flow analysis is used by the\nCorporation to determine if a portion of the unrealized loss is\na result of a credit loss. Any credit losses determined are\nrecognized as an increase to the allowance for credit losses\nthrough provision expense recorded in other income. Cash flows\nexpected to be collected are estimated using all relevant\ninformation available such as, remaining payment terms,\nprepayment speeds, the financial condition of the issuer,\nexpected defaults and the value of the underlying collateral. If\nany of the decline in fair value is related to market factors,\nthat amount is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (OCI). In certain instances, the credit loss may exceed\nthe total decline in fair value, in which case, the allowance\nrecorded is limited to the difference between the amortized cost\nand the fair value of the asset. The Corporation separately\nevaluates its held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities for any\ncredit losses, of which substantially all qualify for the zero\nloss assumption. For the remaining securities, the Corporation\nperforms a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate any credit\nlosses which are then recognized as part of the allowance for\ncredit losses. Other Assets For the Corporation\u2019s financial\nassets that are measured at amortized cost and are not included\nin debt securities or loans and leases on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet, the Corporation evaluates these assets for ECL\nusing various techniques. For assets that are subject to\ncollateral maintenance provisions, including federal funds sold\nand securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell,\nwhere the collateral consists of daily margining of liquid and\nmarketable assets where the margining is expected to be\nmaintained into the foreseeable future, the expected losses are\nassumed to be zero. For all other assets, the Corporation\nperforms qualitative analyses, including consideration of\nhistorical losses and current economic conditions, to estimate\nany ECL which are then included in a valuation account that is\nrecorded as a contra-asset against the amortized cost basis of\nthe financial asset. Troubled Debt Restructurings The\nCorporation has implemented various consumer and commercial loan\nmodification programs to provide its borrowers relief from the\neconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In accordance with\nthe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES\nAct), the Corporation has elected to not apply TDR\nclassification to any COVID-19 related loan modifications that\nwere performed after March 1, 2020 to borrowers who were current\nas of December 31, 2019. Accordingly, these restructurings are\nnot classified as TDRs. In addition, for loans modified in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic that do not meet the above\ncriteria (e.g., current payment status at December 31, 2019),\nthe Corporation is applying the guidance included in an\ninteragency statement issued by the bank regulatory agencies.\nThis guidance states that loan modifications performed in light\nof the COVID-19 pandemic, including loan payment deferrals that\nare up to six months in duration, that were granted to borrowers\nwho were current as of the implementation date of a loan\nmodification program or modifications granted under government\nmandated modification programs, are not TDRs. For loan\nmodifications that include a payment deferral and are not TDRs,\nthe borrowers' past due and nonaccrual status have not been\nimpacted during the deferral period. The Corporation has\ncontinued to accrue interest during the deferral period using a\nconstant effective yield method. For most mortgage, HELOC and\ncommercial loan modifications, the contractual interest that\naccrued during the deferral period is payable at the maturity of\nthe loan. The Corporation includes these amounts with the unpaid\nprincipal balance when computing its allowance for credit\nlosses. Amounts that are subsequently deemed uncollectible\n                                                                \n  Bank of America58                                             \n                                                                \nare written off against the\nallowance for credit losses.\nFor more information on the\nCorporation's TDR accounting,\nsee Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting\nPrinciples to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2019 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K. Paycheck\nProtection Program The\nCorporation is participating in\nthe Paycheck Protection Program\n(PPP), which is a loan program\nthat originated from the CARES\nAct and was subsequently\nexpanded by the Paycheck\nProtection Program and Health\nCare Enhancement Act. The PPP\nis designed to provide U.S.\nsmall businesses with cash-flow\nassistance through loans fully\nguaranteed by the Small\nBusiness Administration (SBA).\nIf the borrower meets certain\ncriteria and uses the proceeds\ntowards certain eligible\nexpenses, the borrower\u2019s\nobligation to repay the loan\ncan be forgiven up to the full\nprincipal amount of the loan\nand any accrued interest. Upon\nborrower forgiveness, the SBA\npays the Corporation for the\nprincipal and accrued interest\nowed on the loan. If the full\nprincipal of the loan is not\nforgiven, the loan will operate\naccording to the original loan\nterms with the 100 percent SBA\nguaranty remaining. As of\nSeptember 30, 2020,\nthe Corporation had\napproximately 343,000PPP loans\nwith outstanding balances\ntotaling $ 24.7billion. As\ncompensation for originating\nthe loans, the Corporation\nreceived lender processing fees\nfrom the SBA, which are\ncapitalized, along with the\nloan origination costs, and\nwill be amortized over the\nloans\u2019 contractual lives and\nrecognized as interest income.\nUpon forgiveness of a loan and\nrepayment by the SBA, any\nunrecognized net capitalized\nfees and costs related to the\nloan will be recognized as\ninterest income in that period.\nNOTE 2 Net Interest Income and\nNoninterest Income\nThe table below presents the\nCorporation\u2019s net interest\nincome and noninterest income\ndisaggregated by revenue source\nfor the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2020 and\n2019.

For more information on ALM and risk\nmanagement derivatives, see Note 3 \u2013 Derivatives to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2019\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. Derivatives Designated as Accounting\nHedges The Corporation uses various types of interest rate and\nforeign exchange derivative contracts to protect against changes\nin the fair value of its assets and liabilities due to\nfluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates (fair value\nhedges). The Corporation also uses these types of contracts to\nprotect against changes in the cash flows of its assets and\nliabilities, and other forecasted transactions (cash flow\nhedges). The Corporation hedges its net investment in\nconsolidated non-U.S. operations determined to have functional\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward exchange\ncontracts and cross-currency basis swaps, and by issuing foreign\ncurrency-denominated debt (net investment hedges).

At September 30,\n2020 and December 31, 2019, the Corporation had transferred $\n5.1billion and $ 5.2billion of non-U.S. government-guaranteed\nmortgage-backed securities (MBS) to a third-party trust and\nretained economic exposure to the transferred assets through\nderivative contracts. In connection with these transfers, the\nCorporation received gross cash proceeds of $ 5.1billion and $\n5.2billion at the transfer dates. At September 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019, the fair value of the transferred securities\nwas $ 5.2billion and $ 5.3billion. Sales and Trading Revenue The\nCorporation enters into trading derivatives to facilitate client\ntransactions and to manage risk exposures arising from trading\naccount assets and liabilities. It is the Corporation\u2019s policy\nto include these derivative instruments in its trading\nactivities, which include derivatives and non-derivative cash\ninstruments. The resulting risk from these derivatives is\nmanaged on a portfolio basis as part of the Corporation\u2019s Global\nMarkets business segment. For more information on sales and\ntrading revenue, see Note 3 \u2013 Derivatives to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2019 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K. The following table, which includes both derivatives\nand non-derivative cash instruments, identifies the amounts in\nthe respective income statement line items attributable to the\nCorporation\u2019s sales and trading revenue in Global Markets ,\ncategorized by primary risk, for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2020 and 2019.

                 \nThe notional amount represents the maximum amount payable by the\nCorporation for most credit derivatives. However, the\nCorporation does not monitor its exposure to credit derivatives\nbased solely on the notional amount because this measure does\nnot take into consideration the probability of occurrence. As\nsuch, the notional amount is not a reliable indicator of the\nCorporation\u2019s exposure to these contracts. Instead, a risk\nframework is used to define risk tolerances and establish limits\nso that certain credit risk-related losses occur within\nacceptable, predefined limits. Credit-related notes in the table\nabove include investments in securities issued by collateralized\ndebt obligation (CDO), collateralized loan obligation and\ncredit-linked note vehicles. These instruments are primarily\nclassified as trading securities.\n                                                                \n  65Bank of America                                             \n                                                                \nThe carrying value of these instruments equals the Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum exposure to loss. The Corporation is not obligated to\nmake any payments to the entities under the terms of the\nsecurities owned. Credit-related Contingent Features and\nCollateral Certain of the Corporation\u2019s derivative contracts\ncontain credit risk-related contingent features, primarily in\nthe form of ISDA master netting agreements and credit support\ndocumentation that enhance the creditworthiness of these\ninstruments compared to other obligations of the respective\ncounterparty with whom the Corporation has transacted. These\ncontingent features may be for the benefit of the Corporation as\nwell as its counterparties with respect to changes in the\nCorporation\u2019s creditworthiness and the mark-to-market exposure\nunder the derivative transactions. At September 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019, the Corporation held cash and securities\ncollateral of $ 91.7billion and $ 84.3billion and posted cash\nand securities collateral of $ 79.9billion and $ 69.1billion in\nthe normal course of business under derivative agreements,\nexcluding cross-product margining agreements where clients are\npermitted to margin on a net basis for both derivative and\nsecured financing arrangements. In connection with certain over-\nthe-counter derivative contracts and other trading agreements,\nthe Corporation can be required to provide additional collateral\nor to terminate transactions with certain counterparties in the\nevent of a downgrade of the senior debt ratings of the\nCorporation or certain subsidiaries. The amount of additional\ncollateral required depends on the contract and is usually a\nfixed incremental amount and/or the market value of the\nexposure. For more information on credit-related contingent\nfeatures and collateral, see Note 3 \u2013 Derivatives to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation\u2019s 2019\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. At September 30, 2020, the amount of\ncollateral, calculated based on the terms of the contracts, that\nthe Corporation and certain subsidiaries could be required to\npost to counterparties but had not yet posted to counterparties\nwas $ 1.9billion, including $ 945million for Bank of America,\nNational Association. Some counterparties are currently able to\nunilaterally terminate certain contracts, or the Corporation or\ncertain subsidiaries may be required to take other action such\nas find a suitable replacement or obtain a guarantee. At\nSeptember 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the liability recorded\nfor these derivative contracts was not significant.

The Corporation also pledged $\n168.2billion of loans with no related outstanding borrowings to\nsecure potential borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve\nBank and Federal Home Loan Bank.\nThe Corporation categorizes consumer real estate loans as core\nand non-core based on loan and customer characteristics such as\norigination date, product type, LTV, Fair Isaac Corporation\n(FICO) score and delinquency status consistent with its current\nconsumer and mortgage servicing strategy. Generally, loans that\nwere originated after January 1, 2010, qualified under\ngovernment-sponsored enterprise (GSE) underwriting guidelines,\nor otherwise met the Corporation\u2019s underwriting guidelines in\nplace in 2015 are characterized as core loans. All other loans\nare generally characterized as non-core loans and represent\nrunoff portfolios. The Corporation has entered into long-term\ncredit protection agreements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on\nloans totaling $ 8.8billion and $ 7.5billion at September 30,\n2020 and December 31, 2019, providing full credit protection on\nresidential mortgage loans that become severely delinquent. All\nof these loans are individually insured, and therefore the\nCorporation does not record an allowance for credit losses\nrelated to these loans. Nonperforming Loans and Leases\nCommercial nonperforming loans increased to $ 2.2billion at\nSeptember 30, 2020 from $ 1.5billion at December 31, 2019 with\nbroad-based increases across multiple industries. Consumer\nnonperforming loans increased to $ 2.4billion at September 30,\n2020 from $ 2.1billion at December 31, 2019 driven by loans with\ndeferrals that expired and have subsequently become\nnonperforming, as well as the inclusion of $ 137million of\ncertain loans that were previously classified as purchased\ncredit-impaired loans and accounted for under a pool basis. The\ntable below presents the Corporation\u2019s nonperforming loans and\nleases including nonperforming TDRs, and loans accruing past due\n90 days or more at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nNonperforming loans held-for-sale (LHFS) are excluded from\nnonperforming loans and leases as they are recorded at either\nfair value or the lower of cost or fair value.

Consumer\nReal Estate, Credit Card and\nOther Consumer, and Commercial\nportfolio segments based on\nprimary credit quality\nindicators. For more\ninformation on the portfolio\nsegments, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary\nof Significant Accounting\nPrinciples . Within the\nConsumer Real Estate portfolio\nsegment, the primary credit\nquality indicators are\nrefreshed LTV and refreshed\nFICO score. Refreshed LTV\nmeasures the carrying value of\nthe loan as a percentage of the\nvalue of the property securing\nthe loan, refreshed quarterly.\nHome equity loans are evaluated\nusing CLTV, which measures the\ncarrying value of the\nCorporation\u2019s loan and\navailable line of credit\ncombined with any outstanding\nsenior liens against the\nproperty as a percentage of the\nvalue of the property securing\nthe loan, refreshed quarterly.\nFICO score measures the\ncreditworthiness of the\nborrower based on the financial\nobligations of the borrower and\nthe borrower\u2019s credit history.\nFICO scores are typically\nrefreshed quarterly or more\n\nfrequently. Certain borrowers\n(e.g., borrowers that have had\ndebts discharged in a\nbankruptcy proceeding) may not\nhave their FICO scores updated.\nFICO scores are also a primary\ncredit quality indicator for\nthe Credit Card and Other\nConsumer portfolio segment and\nthe business card portfolio\nwithin U.S. small business\ncommercial. Within the\nCommercial portfolio segment,\nloans are evaluated using the\ninternal classifications of\npass rated or reservable\ncriticized as the primary\ncredit quality indicators. The\nterm reservable criticized\nrefers to those commercial\nloans that are internally\nclassified or listed by the\nCorporation as Special Mention,\nSubstandard or Doubtful, which\nare asset quality categories\ndefined by regulatory\nauthorities. These assets have\nan elevated level of risk and\nmay have a high probability of\ndefault or total loss. Pass\nrated refers to all loans not\nconsidered reservable\ncriticized. In addition to\nthese primary credit quality\nindicators, the Corporation\nuses other credit quality\nindicators for certain types of\nloans. The following tables\npresent certain credit quality\nindicators for the\nCorporation's Consumer Real\nEstate, Credit Card and Other\nConsumer, and Commercial\nportfolio segments by class of\nfinancing receivables and year\nof origination for term loan\nbalances at September 30, 2020,\nincluding revolving loans that\nconverted to term loans without\nan additional credit decision\nafter

Commercial\nreservable criticized utilized\nexposure increased to $\n35.7billion at September 30,\n2020 from $ 11.5billion (to\n6.55percent from 2.09percent of\ntotal commercial reservable\nutilized exposure) at December\n31, 2019 with increases spread\nacross multiple industries\nincluding travel and\nentertainment.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings\nThe Corporation began entering\ninto loan modifications with\nborrowers in response to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, which have\nnot been classified as TDRs,\nand therefore are not included\nin the discussion below. For\nmore information on the\ncriteria for classifying loans\nas TDRs, see Note 1 \u2013 Summary\nof Significant Accounting\nPrinciples . Consumer Real\nEstate Modifications of\nconsumer real estate loans are\nclassified as TDRs when the\nborrower is experiencing\nfinancial difficulties and a\nconcession has been granted.\nConcessions may include\nreductions in interest rates,\ncapitalization of past due\namounts, principal and/or\ninterest forbearance, payment\nextensions, principal and/or\ninterest forgiveness, or\ncombinations thereof. Prior to\npermanently modifying a loan,\nthe Corporation may enter into\ntrial modifications with\ncertain borrowers under both\ngovernment and proprietary\nprograms. Trial modifications\ngenerally represent a three- to\nfour-month period during which\n\nthe borrower makes monthly\npayments under the anticipated\nmodified payment terms. Upon\nsuccessful completion of the\ntrial period, the Corporation\nand the borrower enter into a\npermanent modification. Binding\ntrial modifications are\nclassified as TDRs when the\ntrial offer is made and\ncontinue to be classified as\nTDRs regardless of whether the\nborrower enters into a\npermanent modification.\nConsumer real estate loans of $\n385million that have been\ndischarged in Chapter 7\nbankruptcy with no change in\nrepayment terms and not\nreaffirmed by the borrower were\nincluded in TDRs at September\n30, 2020, of which $ 101million\nwere classified as\nnonperforming and $ 71million\nwere loans fully insured.\nConsumer real estate TDRs are\nmeasured primarily based on the\nnet present value of the\nestimated cash flows discounted\nat the loan\u2019s original\neffective interest rate. If the\ncarrying value of a TDR exceeds\nthis amount, a specific\nallowance is recorded as a\ncomponent of the allowance for\nloan and lease losses.\nAlternatively, consumer real\nestate TDRs that are considered\nto be dependent solely on the\ncollateral for repayment (e.g.,\ndue to the lack of income\nverification) are measured\nbased on the estimated fair\nvalue of the collateral, and a\ncharge-off is recorded if the\ncarrying value exceeds the fair\nvalue of the collateral.\nConsumer real estate loans that\nreach 180 days past due prior\nto modification are charged off\nto their net realizable value,\nless costs to sell, before they\nare modified as TDRs in\naccordance with established\npolicy. Subsequent declines in\nthe fair value of the\ncollateral after a loan has\nreached 180 days\n                                                                \n  Bank of America74                                             \n                                                                \npast due are recorded as charge-offs. Fully-insured loans are\nprotected against principal loss, and therefore, the Corporation\ndoes not record an allowance for loan and lease losses on the\noutstanding principal balance, even after they have been\nmodified in a TDR. At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019,\nremaining commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose\nterms have been modified in a consumer real estate TDR were not\nsignificant. Consumer real estate foreclosed properties totaled\n$ 135million and $ 229million at September 30, 2020 and December\n31, 2019. The carrying value of consumer real estate loans,\nincluding fully-insured loans, for which formal foreclosure\nproceedings were in process at September 30, 2020 was $\n1.3billion. Although the Corporation has paused formal loan\nforeclosure proceedings and foreclosure sales for occupied\nproperties, during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the\nCorporation reclassified $ 169million of consumer real estate\nloans completed or which were in process prior to the pause in\nforeclosures, to foreclosed properties or, for properties\nacquired upon foreclosure of certain government-guaranteed loans\n(principally FHA-insured loans), to other assets. The\nreclassifications represent non-cash investing activities and,\naccordingly, are not reflected in the Consolidated Statement of\nCash Flows. The table below presents the September 30, 2020 and\n2019 unpaid principal balance, carrying value, and average pre-\nand post-modification interest rates of consumer real estate\nloans that were modified in TDRs during the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. The following Consumer\nReal Estate portfolio segment tables include loans that were\ninitially classified as TDRs during the period and also loans\nthat had previously been classified as TDRs and were modified\nagain during the period.\n                                                                \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026

Based on\nhistorical experience, the\nCorporation estimates that\n14percent of new credit card\nTDRs and 22percent of new\ndirect/indirect consumer TDRs\nmay be in payment default\nwithin 12months after\nmodification.\nCommercial Loans Modifications\nof loans to commercial\nborrowers that are experiencing\nfinancial difficulty are\ndesigned to reduce the\nCorporation\u2019s loss exposure\nwhile providing the borrower\nwith an opportunity to work\nthrough financial difficulties,\noften to avoid foreclosure or\nbankruptcy. Each modification\nis unique and reflects the\nindividual circumstances of the\nborrower. Modifications that\nresult in a TDR may include\nextensions of maturity at a\nconcessionary (below market)\nrate of interest, payment\nforbearances or other actions\ndesigned to benefit the\nborrower while mitigating the\nCorporation\u2019s risk exposure.\n\nReductions in interest rates\nare rare. Instead, the interest\nrates are typically increased,\nalthough the increased rate may\nnot represent a market rate of\ninterest. Infrequently,\nconcessions may also include\nprincipal forgiveness in\nconnection with foreclosure,\nshort sale or other settlement\nagreements leading to\ntermination or sale of the\nloan. At the time of\nrestructuring, the loans are\nremeasured to reflect the\nimpact, if any, on projected\ncash flows resulting from the\nmodified terms. If a portion of\nthe loan is deemed to be\nuncollectible, a charge-off may\nbe recorded at the time of\nrestructuring. Alternatively, a\ncharge-off may have already\nbeen recorded in a previous\nperiod such that no charge-off\nis required at the time of\nmodification.

At September 30,\n2020 and December 31, 2019,\nremaining commitments to lend\nadditional funds to debtors\nwhose terms have been modified\nin a commercial loan TDR were $\n471million and $ 445million.\nThe balance of commercial TDRs\nin payment default was $\n391million at September 30,\n2020 and $ 207million at\nDecember 31, 2019.\n                                                                \n  Bank of America76                                             \n                                                                \nLoans Held-for-sale The\nCorporation had LHFS of $\n4.4billion and $ 9.2billion at\nSeptember 30, 2020 and December\n31, 2019. Cash and non-cash\nproceeds from sales and\npaydowns of loans originally\nclassified as LHFS were $\n16.1billion and $ 19.6billion\nfor the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2020 and 2019.\nCash used for originations and\npurchases of LHFS totaled\napproximately $ 11.1billion and\n$ 18.7billion for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2020\nand 2019. Accrued Interest\nReceivable Accrued interest\nreceivable for loans and leases\nand loans held-for-sale at\nSeptember 30, 2020 and December\n31, 2019 was $ 2.5billion and $\n2.6billion and is reported in\ncustomer and other receivables\non the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Outstanding credit card\nloan balances include unpaid\nprincipal, interest and fees.\nCredit card loans are not\nclassified as nonperforming but\nare charged off no later than\nthe end of the month in which\nthe account becomes 180 days\npast due, within 60 days after\nreceipt of notification of\ndeath or bankruptcy, or upon\nconfirmation of fraud . During\nthe three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2020, the\nCorporation reversed $\n111million and $ 417million of\ninterest and fee income against\nthe income statement line item\nin which it was originally\nrecorded upon charge-off of the\nprincipal balance of the loan .\nFor the outstanding residential\nmortgage, home equity,\ndirect/indirect consumer and\ncommercial loan balances\nclassified as nonperforming\nduring the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30,\n2020, the Corporation reversed\n$ 11million and $ 29million of\ninterest and fee income at the\ntime the loans were classified\nas nonperforming against the\nincome statement line item in\nwhich it was originally\nrecorded. For more information\non the Corporation's\nnonperforming loan policies,\nsee Note 1 \u2013 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting\nPrinciples to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of the\nCorporation\u2019s 2019 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses On\nJanuary 1, 2020, the\nCorporation adopted the new\naccounting standard that\nrequires the measurement of the\nallowance for credit losses to\nbe based on management\u2019s best\nestimate of lifetime ECL\ninherent in the Corporation\u2019s\nrelevant financial assets. Upon\nadoption of the new accounting\nstandard, the Corporation\nrecorded a $ 3.3billion, or\n32percent, increase in the\nallowance for credit losses on\nJanuary 1, 2020, which was\ncomprised of a net increase of\n$ 2.9billion in the allowance\nfor loan and lease losses and a\n$ 310million increase in the\nreserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments. The net increase\nin the allowance for loan and\nlease losses was primarily\ndriven by a $ 3.1billion\nincrease in credit card as the\nCorporation now reserves for\nthe life of these receivables.\nThe increase in the reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments\nincluded $ 119million in the\nconsumer portfolio for the\nundrawn portion of HELOCs and $\n191million in the commercial\nportfolio. For more information\non the Corporation's credit\nloss accounting policies\nincluding the allowance for\ncredit losses see Note 1 \u2013\nSummary of Significant\nAccounting Principles .\n\nThe allowance for credit losses\nis estimated using quantitative\nand qualitative methods that\nconsider a variety of factors\nsuch as historical loss\nexperience, the current credit\nquality of the portfolio as\nwell as an economic outlook\nover the life of the loan.\nQualitative reserves cover\nlosses that are expected but,\nin the Corporation's\nassessment, may not be\nadequately represented in the\nquantitative methods or the\neconomic assumptions. The\nCorporation incorporates\nforward-looking information\nthrough the use of several\nmacroeconomic scenarios in\ndetermining the weighted\neconomic outlook over the\nforecasted life of the assets.\nThese scenarios include key\nmacroeconomic variables such as\ngross domestic product,\nunemployment rate and home\nprice index. The scenarios that\nare chosen each quarter and the\nweighting given to each\nscenario depend on a variety of\nfactors including recent\neconomic events, leading\neconomic indicators, internal\nand third-party economist\nviews, and industry trends. As\nof January 1, 2020, to\ndetermine the allowance for\ncredit losses, the Corporation\nused a series of economic\noutlooks that resulted in an\neconomic outlook that was\nweighted towards the potential\nof a recession with some\nexpectation of tail risk\nsimilar to the severely adverse\nscenario used in stress\ntesting. Various economic\noutlooks were also used in the\nSeptember 30, 2020 estimate for\nallowance for credit losses\nthat included consensus\nestimates, multiple downside\nscenarios which assumed a\nsignificantly longer period\nuntil economic recovery, a tail\nrisk scenario similar to the\nseverely adverse scenario used\nin stress testing and an upside\nscenario to reflect the\npotential for continued\nimprovement in the consensus\noutlooks. The unemployment rate\nunder this weighted economic\noutlook is nearly ninepercent\nas of the fourth quarter of\n2020 and continues to gradually\ndecline to sevenpercent in late\n2021. Additionally, in this\neconomic outlook, gross\ndomestic product returns to\npre-pandemic levels in late\n2022. The Corporation also\nfactored into its allowance for\ncredit losses an estimated\nimpact from higher-risk\nsegments that included\nleveraged loans and industries\nsuch as travel and\nentertainment, which have been\nadversely impacted from the\neffects of COVID-19, as well as\nthe energy sector. The\nCorporation also holds\nadditional reserves for\nborrowers who requested\ndeferrals that take into\naccount their credit\ncharacteristics and payment\nbehavior subsequent to\ndeferral. The allowance for\ncredit losses at September 30,\n2020 was $ 21.5billion, an\nincrease of $ 8.0billion\ncompared to January 1, 2020.\nThe increase in the allowance\nfor credit losses was driven by\nthe deterioration in the\neconomic outlook resulting from\nthe impact of COVID-19. The\nincrease in the allowance for\ncredit losses was comprised of\na net increase of $ 7.2billion\nin the allowance for loan and\nlease losses and a $ 787million\nincrease in the reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments.\nThe increase in the allowance\nfor loan and lease losses was\nattributed to $ 415million in\nthe consumer real estate\nportfolio, $ 2.4billion in the\ncredit card and other consumer\nportfolio, and $ 4.4billion in\nthe commercial portfolio.\nOutstanding loans and leases\nexcluding loans accounted for\nunder the fair value option\ndecreased $ 27.2billion in the\nnine months ended September 30,\n2020, driven by consumer loans,\nwhich decreased $ 26.0billion\nprimarily due to a decline in\ncredit card loans from reduced\nconsumer spending.\n

For both\nconsolidated and unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs, the\nmaximum loss exposure excludes the reserve for representations\nand warranties obligations and corporate guarantees. For more\ninformation, see Note 10 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies .\n(2) At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, loans and\nleases in the consolidated credit card trust included $\n9.0billion and $ 10.5billion of seller\u2019s interest.\n(3) The retained senior securities were valued using quoted\nmarket prices or observable market inputs (Level 2 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy).\nHome Equity Loans The Corporation retains interests, primarily\nsenior securities, in home equity securitization trusts to which\nit transferred home equity loans. In addition, the Corporation\nmay be obligated to provide subordinate funding to the trusts\nduring a rapid amortization event. This obligation is included\nin the maximum loss exposure in the table above. The charges\nthat will ultimately be recorded as a result of the rapid\namortization\n                                                                \n  Bank of America80                                             \n                                                                \nevents depend on the undrawn portion of the HELOCs, performance\nof the loans, the amount of subsequent draws and the timing of\nrelated cash flows. Credit Card Securitizations The Corporation\nsecuritizes originated and purchased credit card loans. The\nCorporation\u2019s continuing involvement with the securitization\ntrust includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided\ninterest (seller\u2019s interest) in the receivables, and holding\ncertain retained interests including subordinate interests in\naccrued interest and fees on the securitized receivables and\ncash reserve accounts. During the nine months ended September\n30, 2019, there were $ 1.3billion of new senior debt securities\nissued to third-party investors from the credit card\nsecuritization trust. There were nonew senior debt securities\nissued to third-party investors from the credit card\nsecuritization trust during the nine months ended September 30,\n2020. At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the\nCorporation held subordinate securities issued by the credit\ncard securitization trust with a notional principal amount of $\n6.9billion and $ 7.4billion. These securities serve as a form of\ncredit enhancement to the senior debt securities and have a\nstated interest rate of zeropercent. There were $ 202million of\nthese subordinate securities issued by the credit card\nsecuritization trust during the nine months ended September 30,\n2019. There were nosubordinate securities issued by the credit\ncard securitization trust during the nine months ended September\n30, 2020. Resecuritization Trusts The Corporation transfers\nsecurities, typically MBS, into resecuritization VIEs generally\nat the request of customers seeking securities with specific\ncharacteristics. Generally, there are no significant ongoing\nactivities performed in a resecuritization trust, and no single\ninvestor has the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust. The\nCorporation resecuritized $ 8.3billion and $ 26.4billion of\nsecurities during the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2020 compared to $ 5.2billion and $ 13.7billion for the same\nperiods in 2019. Securities transferred into resecuritization\nVIEs were measured at fair value with changes in fair value\nrecorded in market making and similar activities prior to the\nresecuritization and, accordingly, no gain or loss on sale was\nrecorded. Securities received from the resecuritization VIEs\nwere recognized at their fair value of $ 598million and $\n5.5billion during the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2020 compared to $ 750million and $ 3.5billion for the same\nperiods in 2019, of which substantially all of the securities in\nthe prior-year period were classified as trading account assets.\nAll of the securities received as resecuritization proceeds\nduring the three months ended September 30, 2020 were classified\nas trading account assets. Of the securities received as\nresecuritizations proceeds during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2020, $ 1.8billion, $ 2.1billion and $ 1.7billion\nwere classified as trading account assets, debt securities\ncarried at fair value and HTM securities, respectively.\nSubstantially all of the trading account securities and debt\nsecurities carried at fair value were categorized as Level 2\nwithin the fair value hierarchy. Municipal Bond Trusts The\nCorporation administers municipal bond trusts that hold highly-\nrated, long-term, fixed-rate municipal bonds. The trusts obtain\nfinancing by issuing floating-rate trust certificates that\nreprice on a weekly or other short-term basis to third-party\ninvestors. The Corporation\u2019s liquidity commitments to\nunconsolidated municipal bond trusts, including those for which\nthe Corporation was transferor, totaled $ 3.3billion and $\n3.7billion at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

normal course of\nbusiness, the Corporation\nenters into a number of off-\nbalance sheet commitments.\nThese commitments expose the\nCorporation to varying degrees\nof credit and market risk and\nare subject to the same credit\nand market risk limitation\nreviews as those instruments\nrecorded on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet.

Credit Extension\nCommitments The Corporation\nenters into commitments to\nextend credit such as loan\ncommitments, SBLCs and\ncommercial letters of credit to\nmeet the financing needs of its\ncustomers. The following table\nincludes the notional amount of\nunfunded legally binding\nlending commitments net of\namounts distributed (i.e.,\n\nsyndicated or participated) to\nother financial institutions.\nThe distributed amounts were $\n10.3billion and $ 10.6billion\nat September 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019. At September\n30, 2020, the carrying value of\nthese commitments, excluding\ncommitments accounted for under\nthe fair value option, was $\n1.9billion, including deferred\nrevenue of $ 17million and a\nreserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments of $ 1.9billion. At\nDecember 31, 2019, the\ncomparable amounts were $\n829million, $ 16million and $\n813million, respectively. The\ncarrying value of these\ncommitments is classified in\naccrued expenses and other\nliabilities on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. Legally binding\ncommitments to extend credit\ngenerally have specified rates\nand maturities. Certain of\nthese commitments have adverse\nchange clauses that help to\nprotect the Corporation against\ndeterioration in the borrower\u2019s\nability to pay. The table below\nincludes the notional amount of\ncommitments of $ 3.3billion and\n$ 4.4billion at September 30,\n2020 and December 31, 2019 that\nare accounted for under the\nfair value option. However, the\ntable excludes cumulative net\nfair value of $ 122million and\n$ 90million at September 30,\n2020 and December 31, 2019 on\nthese commitments, which is\nclassified in accrued expenses\nand other liabilities.

For more information, see\nNote 6 \u2013 Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities .\n\n(4) Includes business card unused lines of credit.\nOther Commitments At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019,\nthe Corporation had commitments to purchase loans (e.g.,\nresidential mortgage and commercial real estate) of $ 169million\nand $ 86million, which upon settlement will be included in\ntrading account assets, loans or LHFS, and commitments to\npurchase commercial loans of $ 365million and $ 1.1billion,\nwhich upon settlement will be included in trading account\nassets. At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the\nCorporation had commitments to purchase commodities, primarily\nliquefied natural gas, of $ 539million and $ 830million, which\nupon settlement will be included in trading account assets. At\nSeptember 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Corporation had\ncommitments to enter into resale and forward-dated resale and\nsecurities borrowing agreements of $ 127.7billion and $\n97.2billion, and commitments to enter into forward-dated\nrepurchase and securities lending agreements of $ 68.7\n                                                                \n  85Bank of America                                             \n                                                                \nbillion and $ 24.9billion. These commitments generally expire\nwithin the next 12 months. At September 30, 2020 and December\n31, 2019, the Corporation had a commitment to originate or\npurchase up to $ 3.8billion and $ 3.3billion on a rolling\n12-month basis, of auto loans and leases from a strategic\npartner. This commitment extends through November 2022 and can\nbe terminated with 12months prior notice. Other Guarantees Bank-\nowned Life Insurance Book Value Protection The Corporation sells\nproducts that offer book value protection to insurance carriers\nwho offer group life insurance policies to corporations,\nprimarily banks. At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019,\nthe notional amount of these guarantees totaled $ 7.1billion and\n$ 7.3billion. At both September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019,\nthe Corporation\u2019s maximum exposure related to these guarantees\ntotaled $ 1.1billion, with estimated maturity dates between 2033\nand 2039. Merchant Services Prior to July 1, 2020, a significant\nportion of the Corporation's merchant processing activity was\nperformed by a joint venture in which it held a 49percent\nownership interest. On July 29, 2019, the Corporation gave\nnotice to the joint venture partner of the termination of the\njoint venture upon the conclusion of its current term on June\n30, 2020. Effective July 1, 2020, the Corporation received its\nshare of the joint venture's merchant contracts and began\nperforming merchant processing services for these merchants.\nWhile merchants bear responsibility for any credit or debit card\ncharges properly reversed by the cardholder, the Corporation, in\nits role as merchant acquirer, may be held liable for any\nreversed charges that cannot be collected from the merchants due\nto, among other things, merchant fraud or insolvency. The\nCorporation, as a card network member bank, also sponsors other\nmerchant acquirers, principally its former joint venture partner\nwith respect to merchants distributed to that partner upon the\ntermination of the joint venture. If reversed charges applicable\nto these merchants cannot be collected from either the merchants\nor merchant acquirers, the Corporation may be held liable for\nthese reversed charges. The Corporation\u2019s risk in this area\nprimarily relates to circumstances where a cardholder has\npurchased goods or services for future delivery. The Corporation\nmitigates this risk by requiring cash deposits, guarantees,\nletters of credit or other types of collateral from certain\nmerchants. The total amount of transactions processed for the\npreceding six-month period, which was $ 311.7billion, is an\nestimate of the Corporation\u2019s maximum potential exposure as of\nSeptember 30, 2020. However, for the reasons described above,\nthe Corporation does not believe the maximum potential exposure\nis representative of the actual potential loss exposure. At\nSeptember 30, 2020 and 2019, the Corporation\u2019s reserves for\ncontingent losses and the losses incurred related to the\nmerchant processing activity were not significant. The\nCorporation will continue to monitor its exposure in this area\ndue to the potential economic impacts of COVID-19.\nRepresentations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate\nGuarantees For more information on representations and\nwarranties obligations and corporate guarantees, see Note 13 \u2013\nCommitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements of the Corporation\u2019s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe reserve for representations and warranties obligations and\ncorporate guarantees was $ 1.4billion and $ 1.8billion at\nSeptember 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 and is included in\naccrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet and the related provision is included in other\nincome in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The\nrepresentations and warranties reserve represents the\nCorporation\u2019s best estimate of probable incurred losses, is\nbased on our experience in previous negotiations, and is subject\nto judgment, a variety of assumptions, and known or unknown\nuncertainties. Future representations and warranties losses may\noccur in excess of the amounts recorded for these exposures;\nhowever, the Corporation does not expect such amounts to be\nmaterial to the Corporation's financial condition and liquidity.\nSee Litigation and Regulatory Matters below for the\nCorporation's combined range of possible loss in excess of the\nreserve for representations and warranties and the accrued\nliability for litigation. Fixed Income Clearing Corporation\nSponsored Member Repo Program The Corporation acts as a\nsponsoring member in a repo program whereby the Corporation\nclears certain eligible resale and repurchase agreements through\nthe Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation on behalf of clients that are sponsored members in\naccordance with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation\u2019s rules.\nAs part of this program, the Corporation guarantees the payment\nand performance of its sponsored members to the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation. The Corporation\u2019s guarantee obligation is\nsecured by a security interest in cash or high-quality\nsecurities collateral placed by clients with the clearinghouse\nand therefore, the potential for the Corporation to incur\nsignificant losses under this arrangement is remote. The\nCorporation\u2019s maximum potential exposure, without taking into\nconsideration the related collateral, was $ 8.0billion and $\n9.3billion at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Other\nGuarantees The Corporation has entered into additional guarantee\nagreements and commitments, including sold risk participation\nswaps, liquidity facilities, lease-end obligation agreements,\npartial credit guarantees on certain leases, real estate joint\nventure guarantees, divested business commitments and sold put\noptions that require gross settlement. The maximum potential\nfuture payments under these agreements are approximately $\n9.0billion and $ 8.7billion at September 30, 2020 and December\n31, 2019. The estimated maturity dates of these obligations\nextend up to 2049. The Corporation has made no material payments\nunder these guarantees. For more information on maximum\npotential future payments under VIE-related liquidity\ncommitments, see Note 6 \u2013 Securitizations and Other Variable\nInterest Entities .\n                                                                \n  Bank of America86                                             \n                                                                \nIn the normal course of\nbusiness, the Corporation\nperiodically guarantees the\nobligations of its affiliates\nin a variety of transactions\nincluding ISDA-related\ntransactions and non-ISDA\nrelated transactions such as\ncommodities trading, repurchase\nagreements, prime brokerage\nagreements and other\ntransactions. Guarantees of\nCertain Long-term Debt The\nCorporation, as the parent\ncompany, fully and\nunconditionally guarantees the\nsecurities issued by BofA\nFinance LLC, a 100percent owned\nfinance subsidiary of the\nCorporation, and effectively\nprovides for the full and\nunconditional guarantee of\ntrust securities issued by\ncertain statutory trust\ncompanies that are 100percent\nowned finance subsidiaries of\nthe Corporation. Litigation and\nRegulatory Matters The\nfollowing disclosure\nsupplements the disclosure in\nNote 13 \u2013 Commitments and\nContingencies to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements of the Corporation\u2019s\n2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n(the prior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure). In\nthe ordinary course of\nbusiness, the Corporation and\nits subsidiaries are routinely\ndefendants in or parties to\nmany pending and threatened\nlegal, regulatory and\ngovernmental actions and\nproceedings. In view of the\ninherent difficulty of\npredicting the outcome of such\nmatters, particularly where the\nclaimants seek very large or\nindeterminate damages or where\nthe matters present novel legal\ntheories or involve a large\nnumber of parties, the\nCorporation generally cannot\npredict the eventual outcome of\nthe pending matters, the timing\nof the ultimate resolution of\nthese matters, or any eventual\nloss, fines or penalties\nrelated to each pending matter.\nIn accordance with applicable\naccounting guidance, the\nCorporation establishes an\naccrued liability when those\nmatters present loss\ncontingencies that are both\nprobable and estimable. In such\ncases, there may be an exposure\nto loss in excess of any\namounts accrued. As a matter\ndevelops, the Corporation, in\nconjunction with any outside\ncounsel handling the matter,\nevaluates on an ongoing basis\nwhether such matter presents a\nloss contingency that is\nprobable and estimable. Once\nthe loss contingency is deemed\nto be both probable and\nestimable, the Corporation will\nestablish an accrued liability\nand record a corresponding\namount of litigation-related\nexpense. The Corporation\ncontinues to monitor the matter\nfor further developments that\ncould affect the amount of the\naccrued liability that has been\npreviously established.\nExcluding expenses of internal\nand external legal service\nproviders, litigation-related\nexpense of $ 636million and $\n717million was recognized for\nthe three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2020 compared to\n$ 352million and $ 539million\nfor the same periods in 2019.\nFor a limited number of the\nmatters disclosed in the prior\ncommitments and contingencies\ndisclosure, for which a loss,\nwhether in excess of a related\naccrued liability or where\nthere is no accrued liability,\nis reasonably possible in\nfuture periods, the Corporation\nis able to estimate a range of\npossible loss. In determining\nwhether it is possible to\nestimate a range of possible\nloss, the Corporation reviews\nand evaluates these matters on\nan ongoing basis, in\nconjunction with any outside\ncounsel handling the matter, in\nlight of potentially relevant\nfactual and legal developments.\nWith respect to such matters,\nin cases in which the\nCorporation possesses\nsufficient appropriate\ninformation to estimate a range\nof possible loss, that estimate\nis aggregated and disclosed\nbelow. There may be other\ndisclosed matters for which a\nloss is probable or\n\nreasonably possible but such an\nestimate of the range of\npossible loss may not be\npossible. For those disclosed\nmatters where an estimate of\nthe range of possible loss is\npossible, as well as for\nrepresentations and warranties\nexposures, management currently\nestimates the aggregate range\nof reasonably possible loss for\nthese exposures is $ 0to $\n1.3billion in excess of the\naccrued liability, if any. The\nestimated range of possible\nloss, as well as the\nCorporation's accrued\nliability, is based upon\ncurrently available information\nand is subject to significant\njudgment, a variety of\nassumptions and known and\nunknown uncertainties. The\nmatters underlying the\nestimated range of possible\nloss and liability accrual are\nunpredictable and will change\nfrom time to time, and actual\nlosses may vary significantly\nfrom the current estimate or\naccrual. Therefore, this\nestimated range of possible\nloss represents what the\nCorporation believes to be an\nestimate of possible loss only\nfor certain matters meeting\nthese criteria. It does not\nrepresent the Corporation\u2019s\nmaximum loss exposure.\nInformation is provided in the\nprior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure\nregarding the nature of the\nlitigation and, where\nspecified, associated claimed\ndamages. Based on current\nknowledge, and taking into\naccount accrued liabilities,\nmanagement does not believe\nthat loss contingencies arising\nfrom pending matters in the\nprior commitments and\ncontingencies disclosure will\nhave a material adverse effect\non the consolidated financial\ncondition or liquidity of the\nCorporation. However, in light\nof the significant judgment,\nvariety of assumptions and\nuncertainties involved in these\nmatters, some of which are\nbeyond the Corporation\u2019s\ncontrol, and the very large or\nindeterminate damages sought in\nsome of these matters, an\nadverse outcome in one or more\nof these matters could be\nmaterial to the Corporation\u2019s\nbusinesses or results of\noperations for any particular\nreporting period, or cause\nsignificant reputational harm.\nNOTE 11 Shareholders\u2019 Equity\n\nCommon Stock\n                                                                \n  Declared                                                      \n  Quarterly                                                     \n  Cash                                                          \n  Dividends                                                     \n  on Common                                                     \n  Stock(1)                                                      \n  Declarati\u2026                    Payment           Dividend Per  \n  Date          Record Date     Date                     Share  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  October       December 4,     December       $          0.18  \n  21, 2020      2020            24, 2020                        \n  July 22,      September 4,    September                 0.18  \n  2020          2020            25, 2020                        \n  April 22,     June 5, 2020    June 26,                  0.18  \n  2020                          2020                            \n  January       March 6,        March 27,                 0.18  \n  29, 2020      2020            2020                            \n                                                                \n(1) In 2020, and through\nOctober 30, 2020.\nIn June 2020, the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal\nReserve System (Federal\nReserve) announced that due to\neconomic uncertainty resulting\nfrom COVID-19, all large banks\nwould be required to suspend\nshare repurchase programs in\nthe third quarter of 2020,\nexcept for repurchases to\noffset shares awarded under\nequity-based compensation\nplans, and to limit dividends\nto existing rates that do not\nexceed the average of the last\nfour quarters\u2019 net income.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s\ndirectives regarding share\nrepurchases aligned with the\nCorporation's decision to\nvoluntarily suspend repurchases\nduring the first half of 2020.\nThe suspension of the\nCorporation's repurchases did\nnot include repurchases to\noffset shares awarded under its\nequity-based compensation\nplans.\n                                                                \n  87Bank of America                                             \n                                                                \nDuring the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30,\n2020, the Corporation\nrepurchased and retired\n4million and 216million shares\nof common stock, which reduced\nshareholders\u2019 equity by $\n114million and $ 6.8billion.\nDuring the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2020, in\nconnection with employee stock\nplans, the Corporation issued\n66million shares of its common\nstock and, to satisfy tax\nwithholding obligations,\nrepurchased 26million shares of\nits common stock.

exchange price\nthat would be received for an\nasset or paid to transfer a\nliability (an exit price) in\nthe principal or most\nadvantageous market for the\nasset or liability in an\norderly transaction between\nmarket participants on the\nmeasurement date. The\nCorporation determines the fair\nvalues of its financial\ninstruments under applicable\naccounting standards and\nconducts a review of its fair\nvalue hierarchy classifications\non a quarterly basis. Transfers\ninto or out of fair value\nhierarchy classifications are\nmade if the significant inputs\nused in the financial models\nmeasuring the fair values of\nthe assets and liabilities\nbecome unobservable or\nobservable in the current\nmarketplace. During the nine\nmonths ended September 30,\n2020, there were no changes to\nvaluation approaches or\ntechniques that had, or are\nexpected to have, a material\nimpact on the Corporation\u2019s\nconsolidated financial position\nor results of operations. For\nmore information regarding the\nfair value hierarchy, how the\nCorporation measures fair value\nand valuation techniques, see\nNote 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant\nAccounting Principles and Note\n21 \u2013 Fair Value Measurements to\nthe Consolidated Financial\nStatements of the Corporation\u2019s\n2019 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. The Corporation accounts\nfor certain financial\ninstruments under the fair\nvalue option.

Risk FactorsOur Annual Report on Form 10-K   \u2502\n\u2502  for the year ended December 31, 2019 (2019 Form 10-K)       \u2502\n\u2502  describes market, credit, geopolitical and business         \u2502\n\u2502  operations risk factors that could affect our businesses,   \u2502\n\u2502  results of operations or financial condition due to, among  \u2502\n\u2502  other things, \u201cwidespread health emergencies or             \u2502\n\u2502  pandemics.\u201d On March 11, 2020, the World Health             \u2502\n\u2502  Organization declared the outbreak of a strain of novel     \u2502\n\u2502  coronavirus disease, COVID-19, a global pandemic. As        \u2502\n\u2502  conditions and circumstances related to the COVID-19        \u2502\n\u2502  pandemic evolved subsequent to our 2019 Form 10-K filing,   \u2502\n\u2502  the Corporation disclosed a risk factor in its Quarterly    \u2502\n\u2502  Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2020   \u2502\n\u2502  and June 30, 2020 captioned \u201cCoronavirus Disease 2019\u201d to   \u2502\n\u2502  supplement the risk factors described in its 2019 Form      \u2502\n\u2502  10-K. The following supplements the risk factors described  \u2502\n\u2502  in the Corporation\u2019s 2019 Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports   \u2502\n\u2502  on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2020 and June  \u2502\n\u2502  30, 2020.Coronavirus Disease 2019The COVID-19 pandemic has  \u2502\n\u2502  caused a significant global economic downturn that has      \u2502\n\u2502  adversely affected, and is expected to continue to          \u2502\n\u2502  adversely affect, the Corporation\u2019s businesses and results  \u2502\n\u2502  of operations, and the duration and future impacts of the   \u2502\n\u2502  COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. and/or global economy and     \u2502\n\u2502  the Corporation\u2019s businesses, results of operations and     \u2502\n\u2502  financial condition remain uncertain.The COVID-19 pandemic  \u2502\n\u2502  has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures  \u2502\n\u2502  intended to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19,      \u2502\n\u2502  such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter  \u2502\n\u2502  in place orders, and limitations on business activity,      \u2502\n\u2502  including closures. These measures have severely            \u2502\n\u2502  restricted economic activity, reduced economic output and   \u2502\n\u2502  resulted in a deterioration in economic conditions,         \u2502\n\u2502  globally and in the U.S. This has led to, among other       \u2502\n\u2502  things, high rates of unemployment and underemployment and  \u2502\n\u2502  caused volatility and disruptions in consumer spending and  \u2502\n\u2502  the global financial markets, including the energy and      \u2502\n\u2502  commodity markets. Although some of these restrictive       \u2502\n\u2502  measures have been eased in certain areas, many of the      \u2502\n\u2502  restrictive measures remain in place or have been           \u2502\n\u2502  reinstated, and in some cases additional restrictive        \u2502\n\u2502  measures are being or may need to be implemented.           \u2502\n\u2502  Businesses, market participants, our counterparties and     \u2502\n\u2502  clients, and the U.S. and global economy have been          \u2502\n\u2502  negatively impacted and may continue to be so for an        \u2502\n\u2502  extended period of time, as there remains significant       \u2502\n\u2502  uncertainty about the timing and strength of an economic    \u2502\n\u2502  recovery.The negative economic conditions arising from the  \u2502\n\u2502  COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted our financial         \u2502\n\u2502  results during the third   quarter   in   various           \u2502\n\u2502  respects,   including  allowance  for credit losses and     \u2502\n\u2502  noninterest expense. These negative economic conditions     \u2502\n\u2502  may have a continued adverse effect on                      \u2502\n\u2502                                                              \u2502\n\u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256f\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                                              \u2502\n\u2502  our businesses and results of operations, which could       \u2502\n\u2502  include, but not be limited to: decreased demand for and    \u2502\n\u2502  use of our products and services; protracted periods of     \u2502\n\u2502  historically low interest rates; lower fees, including      \u2502\n\u2502  asset management fees; lower sales and trading revenue due  \u2502\n\u2502  to decreased market liquidity resulting from heightened     \u2502\n\u2502  volatility; increased noninterest expense, including        \u2502\n\u2502  operational losses; and increased credit losses due to our  \u2502\n\u2502  customers' and clients' inability to fulfill contractual    \u2502\n\u2502  obligations and deterioration in the financial condition    \u2502\n\u2502  of our consumer and commercial borrowers, which may vary    \u2502\n\u2502  by region, sector or industry, that may increase our        \u2502\n\u2502  provision for credit losses and net charge-offs. Our        \u2502\n\u2502  provision for credit losses and net charge-offs may also    \u2502\n\u2502  continue to be impacted by volatility in the energy and     \u2502\n\u2502  commodity markets. Additionally, our liquidity and/or       \u2502\n\u2502  regulatory capital could be adversely impacted by           \u2502\n\u2502  customers\u2019 withdrawal of deposits, volatility and           \u2502\n\u2502  disruptions in the capital and credit markets, volatility   \u2502\n\u2502  in foreign exchange rates and customer draws on lines of    \u2502\n\u2502  credit. Continued adverse macroeconomic conditions caused   \u2502\n\u2502  by COVID-19 could also result in potential downgrades to    \u2502\n\u2502  our credit ratings, negative impacts to regulatory capital  \u2502\n\u2502  and liquidity and further restrictions on dividends and/or  \u2502\n\u2502  repurchases of our common stock, which could limit the      \u2502\n\u2502  capital we return to shareholders.If we become unable to    \u2502\n\u2502  operate our business from remote locations including, for   \u2502\n\u2502  example, because of an internal or external failure of our  \u2502\n\u2502  information technology infrastructure, we experience        \u2502\n\u2502  increased rates of employee illness or unavailability, or   \u2502\n\u2502  governmental restrictions are placed on our employees or    \u2502\n\u2502  operations, this could also have an adverse effect on our   \u2502\n\u2502  business continuity status and result in disruption to our  \u2502\n\u2502  businesses. Additionally we rely on third parties who       \u2502\n\u2502  could experience adverse effects on their business          \u2502\n\u2502  continuity status and business interruptions, which could   \u2502\n\u2502  increase our risks and have an adverse impact on the        \u2502\n\u2502  Corporation's businesses.
