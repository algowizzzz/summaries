For any\nparticular series we may offer, we will describe in the\napplicable supplement:\n                                 \n      the specific designation;  \n                                 \n                                               \n      the aggregate number of shares offered;  \n                                               \n                                                         \n      the dividend rate and periods, or manner of        \n      calculating the dividend rate and periods, if      \n      any;                                               \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      the stated value and liquidation preference        \n      amount, if any;                                    \n                                                         \n                                  \n      the voting rights, if any;  \n                                  \n                                                         \n      the terms on which the series of preferred stock   \n      is convertible into shares of our common stock,    \n      preferred stock of another series, or other        \n      securities, if any;                                \n                                                         \n                                         \n      the redemption terms, if any;\u00a0and  \n                                         \n                                               \n      any other specific terms of the series.  \n                                               \nWe also may offer depositary shares, each of which will\nrepresent a fractional interest in a share or multiple\nshares of our preferred stock. We will describe in the\napplicable supplement any specific terms of the\ndepositary shares. We will issue the depositary shares\nunder deposit agreements that we will enter into with\none or more depositories. Form of Securities Unless we\nspecify otherwise in the applicable supplement, we will\nissue the securities in book-entry only form through\none or more depositories, such as The Depository Trust\nCompany, Euroclear Bank SA/NV, Clearstream Banking\nS.A., Luxembourg, or CDS Clearing and Depository\nServices Inc., as identified in the applicable\nsupplement. We will issue the securities only in\nregistered form, without coupons, although we may issue\nthe securities in bearer form if we so specify in the\napplicable supplement. The securities issued in book-\nentry only form will be uncertificated or will be\nrepresented by a global security registered in the name\nof the specified depository, rather than certificated\nsecurities in definitive form registered in the name of\neach individual owner. Unless we specify otherwise in\nthe applicable supplement, each sale of securities in\nbook-entry only form will settle in immediately\navailable funds through the specified depository. A\nglobal security may be exchanged for certificated\nsecurities in definitive form registered in the names\nof the beneficial owners only under the limited\ncircumstances described in this prospectus. Payment\nCurrencies All amounts payable in respect of the\nsecurities, including the purchase price, will be\npayable in U.S. dollars, unless we specify otherwise in\nthe applicable supplement.\n\n6\n\nListing We will state in the applicable supplement\nwhether the particular securities that we are offering\nwill be listed or quoted on a securities exchange or\nquotation system. Distribution We may offer the\nsecurities under this prospectus:\n                             \n      through underwriters;  \n                             \n                        \n      through dealers;  \n                        \n                          \n      through agents;\u00a0or  \n                          \n                               \n      directly to purchasers.  \n                               \nThe applicable supplement will include any required\ninformation about the firms we use and the discounts or\ncommissions we may pay them for their services. BofA\nSecurities, Inc., or any of our other broker-dealer\naffiliates, may be an underwriter, dealer or agent for\nus. Market-Making by Our Affiliates Following the\ninitial distribution of an offering of securities, BofA\nSecurities, Inc., and other broker-dealer affiliates of\nours, may offer and sell those securities in the course\nof their businesses as broker-dealers. BofA Securities,\nInc. and any such other broker-dealer affiliates may\nact as a principal or agent in these transactions.

This summary does not describe all\nof the risks and investment considerations with respect\nto an investment in our securities, including risks and\nconsiderations relating to a prospective investor\u0092s\nparticular circumstances. For information regarding\nrisks and uncertainties that may materially affect our\nbusiness and results, please refer to the information\nunder the caption \u0093Item 1A. Risk Factors\u0094 in our annual\nreport on Form 10-Kfor the year ended December 31,\n2020, which is incorporated by reference in this\nprospectus, as well as those risks and uncertainties\ndiscussed in our subsequent filings that are\nincorporated by reference in this prospectus. You also\nshould review the risk factors that will be set forth\nin other documents that we will file after the date of\nthis prospectus, together with the risk factors set\nforth in any applicable supplement for a particular\noffering of securities. Prospective investors should\nconsult their own financial, legal, tax, and other\nprofessional advisors as to the risks associated with\nan investment in our securities and the suitability of\nthe investment for the investor.\n\nRisks Relating to Regulatory Resolution Strategies and\nLong-Term Debt Requirements\n\nA resolution under our single point of entry resolution\nstrategy could materially adversely affect our\nliquidity and financial condition and our ability to\npay our obligations on our securities.\n\nWe are required periodically to submit a plan to the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u0093FDIC\u0094) and the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n(\u0093Federal Reserve\u0094) describing our resolution strategy\nunder the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of material\nfinancial distress or failure. In our current plan, our\npreferred resolution strategy is a single point of\nentry (\u0093SPOE\u0094) strategy. This strategy provides that\nonly Bank of America (the parent holding company) files\nfor resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and\ncontemplates providing certain key operating\nsubsidiaries with sufficient capital and liquidity to\noperate through severe stress and to enable such\nsubsidiaries to continue operating or be wound down in\na solvent manner following a Bank of America\nbankruptcy. We have entered into intercompany\narrangements governing the contribution of most of our\ncapital and liquidity to these key subsidiaries. As\npart of these arrangements, we have transferred most of\nour assets (and have agreed to transfer additional\nassets) to a wholly-owned holding company subsidiary in\nexchange for a subordinated note. Certain of our\nremaining assets secure our ongoing obligations under\nthese intercompany arrangements. The wholly-owned\nholding company subsidiary also has provided us with a\ncommitted line of credit that, in addition to our cash,\ndividends and interest payments, including interest\npayments we receive in respect of the subordinated\nnote, may be used to fund our obligations. These\nintercompany arrangements include provisions to\nterminate the line of credit and forgive the\nsubordinated note and require us to contribute our\nremaining financial assets to the wholly-owned holding\ncompany subsidiary if our projected liquidity resources\ndeteriorate so severely that our resolution becomes\nimminent, which could materially and adversely affect\nour liquidity and ability to meet our obligations on\nour securities. In addition, our preferred resolution\nstrategy could result in holders of our securities\nbeing in a worse position and suffering greater losses\nthan would have been the case under a bankruptcy\nproceeding or other resolution scenarios or plans.\n\nUnder Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and\nConsumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \u0093Financial Reform\nAct\u0094), when a global systemically important banking\norganization (\u0093G-SIB\u0094),such as Bank of America, is in\ndefault or danger of default, the FDIC may be appointed\nreceiver in order to conduct an orderly liquidation of\nsuch institution. In the event of such appointment, the\nFDIC could, among other things, invoke the orderly\nliquidation authority, instead of the U.S. Bankruptcy\nCode, if the Secretary of the U.S. Department of\nTreasury makes certain financial\n\n8\n\ndistress and systemic risk determinations. In 2013, the\nFDIC issued a notice describing its preferred \u0093single\npoint of entry\u0094 strategy for resolving a G-SIB.Under\nthis approach, the FDIC could replace Bank of America\nwith a bridge holding company, which could continue\noperations and result in an orderly resolution of the\nunderlying bank, but whose equity would be held solely\nfor the benefit of our creditors. The FDIC\u0092s single\npoint of entry strategy may result in holders of our\nsecurities suffering greater losses than would have\nbeen the case under a bankruptcy proceeding or a\ndifferent resolution strategy.\n\nIf we enter a resolution proceeding, holders of our\ndebt securities and equity securities would be at risk\nof absorbing our losses.\n\nIf we enter a resolution proceeding under either the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code or Title II of the Financial\nReform Act, our losses would be imposed first on\nholders of our equity securities and thereafter on our\nunsecured debt, including our debt securities, and some\nor all of such securities could be significantly\nreduced or eliminated as a result of such resolution\nproceeding.\n\nUnder our SPOE resolution strategy, and the single\npoint of entry strategy preferred by the FDIC under\nTitle II of the Financial Reform Act, the value that\nwould be distributed to holders of our unsecured debt,\nincluding our debt securities, may not be sufficient to\nrepay all or part of the principal amount and interest\non such debt, and holders of such debt could receive no\nconsideration at all under these resolution scenarios.\nEither of these resolution strategies could result in\nholders of our debt securities being in a worse\nposition and suffering greater losses than would have\nbeen the case under a different resolution strategy.\nAlthough SPOE is our preferred resolution strategy,\nneither Bank of America nor a bankruptcy court would be\nobligated to follow our SPOE strategy. Additionally,\nthe FDIC is not obligated to follow its \u0093single point\nof entry\u0094 strategy to resolve Bank of America under\nTitle II of the Financial Reform Act. For more\ninformation regarding the financial consequences of any\nsuch resolution proceeding, see \u0093Description of Debt\nSecurities\u0097Financial Consequences to Unsecured\nDebtholders of Single Point of Entry Resolution\nStrategy\u0094 below.\n\nWe are subject to the Federal Reserve\u0092s final rules\nrequiring U.S. G-SIBsto maintain minimum amounts of\nlong-term debt meeting specified eligibility\nrequirements.\n\nUnder the rules of the Federal Reserve relating to\ntotal loss-absorbing capacity (the \u0093TLAC Rules\u0094), we,\nas a U.S. G-SIB,are required to, among other things,\nmaintain minimum amounts of unsecured external long-\nterm debt satisfying certain eligibility criteria\n(\u0093eligible LTD\u0094) and other loss-absorbing capacity for\nthe purpose of absorbing our losses in a resolution\nproceeding under either the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or\nTitle II of the Financial Reform Act. Any senior long-\nterm debt must include terms required by the TLAC Rules\nin order to qualify as eligible LTD. Actions required\nto comply with the TLAC Rules could impact our funding\nand liquidity risk management plans.\n\nRisks Relating to Debt Securities Generally\n\nOur obligations on the debt securities will be\nstructurally subordinated to liabilities of our\nsubsidiaries.\n\nBecause we are a holding company, our right to\nparticipate in any distribution of assets of any\nsubsidiary upon such subsidiary\u0092s liquidation or\nreorganization or otherwise is subject to the prior\nclaims of creditors of that subsidiary, except to the\nextent we may ourselves be recognized as a creditor of\nthat subsidiary. As a result, our obligations under the\ndebt securities will be structurally subordinated to\nall existing and future liabilities of our\nsubsidiaries, and claimants should look only to our\nassets for payments. Further, creditors of subsidiaries\nrecapitalized pursuant to our\n\n9\n\nresolution plan generally would be entitled to payment\nof their claims from the assets of the subsidiaries,\nincluding our contributed assets. In addition, our debt\nsecurities will be unsecured and, therefore, in a\nbankruptcy or similar proceeding, will effectively rank\njunior to our secured obligations to the extent of the\nvalue of the assets securing such obligations. Holders\nof our debt securities could be at greater risk for\nbeing structurally subordinated if we sell or convey\nall or substantially all of our assets to one or more\nof our majority-owned subsidiaries. We may sell, convey\nor transfer all or substantially all of our assets to\none or more entities that are direct or indirect\nmajority-owned subsidiaries of ours in which we or one\nor more of our subsidiaries owns more than 50% of the\ncombined voting power, and under the indentures under\nwhich the debt securities will be issued, such\nsubsidiary or subsidiaries will not be required to\nassume our obligations under such debt securities, and\nwe will remain the sole obligor on such debt\nsecurities. In such event, creditors of any such\nsubsidiary or subsidiaries would have additional assets\nfrom which to recover on their claims while holders of\nour debt securities would be structurally subordinated\nto creditors of such subsidiary or subsidiaries with\nrespect to such transferred assets. See \u0093Description of\nDebt Securities\u0097Limitation on Mergers and Sales of\nAssets\u0094 below for more information. Events for which\nacceleration rights under our senior debt securities\nmay be exercised are more limited than those available\npursuant to the terms of our outstanding senior debt\nsecurities issued prior to January 13, 2017. In\nresponse to the TLAC Rules, on January 13, 2017, we\nmodified the terms of our senior debt securities to be\nissued on or after that date to, among other things,\nlimit the circumstances under which the payment of the\nprincipal amount of such senior debt securities can be\naccelerated (unless specified otherwise in the\napplicable supplement). All or substantially all of our\noutstanding senior debt securities issued prior to\nJanuary 13, 2017 (the \u0093Pre-2017Senior Debt Securities\u0094)\nprovide acceleration rights for nonpayment or\nbankruptcy. The Pre-2017Senior Debt Securities also\nprovide acceleration rights if we default in the\nperformance of our covenants in those debt securities\nor the applicable indenture under which those\nsecurities were issued. In addition, the Pre-2017Senior\nDebt Securities do not require a 30-daycure period\nbefore a nonpayment of principal becomes an event of\ndefault and acceleration rights become exercisable with\nrespect to such nonpayment. However, under the Senior\nIndenture (as defined below), unless we specify\notherwise in the applicable supplement, payment of the\nprincipal amount of our senior debt securities issued\nunder such indenture:\n                                                         \n      may be accelerated only (i)\u00a0if we default in the   \n      payment of the principal of or interest on those   \n      senior debt securities and, in each case, the      \n      default continues for a period of 30 days, or      \n      (ii)\u00a0upon our voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy  \n      and, in the case of our involuntary bankruptcy,    \n      the event continues for a period of 60 days; and   \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      may not be accelerated if we default in the        \n      performance of any other covenants contained in    \n      such senior debt securities or the Senior          \n      Indenture.                                         \n                                                         \nAs a result of these differing provisions, if we breach\nor otherwise default in the performance of a covenant\n(other than a payment covenant) that applies both to\nsenior debt securities that we 10\n\nissued on or after January 13, 2017 and the\nPre-2017Senior Debt Securities, the Pre-2017Senior Debt\nSecurities would have acceleration rights that would not\nbe available to the holders of our other senior debt\nsecurities. In addition, if we fail to pay principal when\ndue with respect to our senior debt securities issued on\nor after on or after January 13, 2017 and the\nPre-2017Senior Debt Securities, an event of default would\noccur immediately with respect to the Pre-2017Senior Debt\nSecurities (and the exercise of acceleration rights could\nproceed immediately in accordance with the provisions of\nthe indenture under which those debt securities were\nissued), while the holders of our other senior debt\nsecurities must wait for the 30-daycure period to expire\nbefore such nonpayment of principal becomes an event of\ndefault and any acceleration rights are triggered with\nrespect to such nonpayment. Any repayment of the\nprincipal amount of Pre-2017Senior Debt Securities\nfollowing the exercise of acceleration rights in\ncircumstances in which such rights are not available to\nthe holders of our other senior debt securities could\nadversely affect our ability to make timely payments on\nsuch other senior debt securities thereafter. The market\nvalue of the debt securities may be less than the\nprincipal amount of the debt securities. The market for,\nand market value of, the debt securities may be affected\nby a number of factors. These factors include:\n                                                         \n      the method of calculating the principal of or any  \n      premium, interest or other amounts payable on the  \n      debt securities;                                   \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      the time remaining to maturity of the debt         \n      securities;                                        \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      the aggregate amount outstanding of the relevant   \n      debt securities;                                   \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      any redemption or repayment features of the debt   \n      securities;                                        \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      the level, direction, and volatility of market     \n      interest rates generally;                          \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      general economic conditions of the capital         \n      markets in the United States;                      \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      geopolitical conditions and other financial,       \n      political, regulatory and judicial events that     \n      affect the financial markets generally; and        \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      any market-making activities with respect to the   \n      debt securities.                                   \n                                                         \nOften, the only way to liquidate your investment in the\ndebt securities prior to maturity will be to sell the\ndebt securities. At that time, there may be a very\nilliquid market for the debt securities or no market at\nall. If you sell your debt securities prior to maturity,\nyou may receive less than the principal amount of such\ndebt securities. Acceleration rights for our subordinated\ndebt securities are available only in limited\ncircumstances. The rights of acceleration under our\nsubordinated debt securities are more limited than those\navailable pursuant to the terms of our senior debt\nsecurities. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable\nsupplement, the payment of principal of our subordinated\ndebt securities may be accelerated only in the event of\nour voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy under U.S.\nfederal bankruptcy laws (and, in the case of our\ninvoluntary bankruptcy, such event continues for a period\nof 60 days). If you purchase any subordinated debt\nsecurities, you will have no right to accelerate 11\n\nthe payment of principal of the subordinated debt\nsecurities if we fail to pay principal or interest when\ndue on those subordinated debt securities or if we fail\nin the performance of any of our other obligations under\nthose subordinated debt securities.\n\nOur obligations under subordinated debt securities will\nbe subordinated.\n\nHolders of our subordinated debt securities should\nrecognize that contractual provisions in the Subordinated\nIndenture (as defined below) may prohibit us from making\npayments on the subordinated debt securities. The\nsubordinated debt securities are unsecured and\nsubordinate and junior in right of payment to all of our\nsenior indebtedness (as defined in the Subordinated\nIndenture), to the extent and in the manner provided in\nthe Subordinated Indenture. In addition, the subordinated\ndebt securities may be fully subordinated to interests\nheld by the U.S. government in the event we enter into a\nreceivership, insolvency, liquidation or similar\nproceedings, including a proceeding under Title II of the\nFinancial Reform Act. For additional information\nregarding the subordination provisions applicable to the\nsubordinated debt securities, see \u0093Description of Debt\nSecurities\u0097Subordination\u0094 below.\n\nRedemption of our debt securities prior to maturity may\nresult in a reduced return on your investment.\n\nThe terms of our debt securities may permit or require\nredemption of the debt securities prior to maturity. That\nredemption may occur at a time when prevailing interest\nrates are relatively low. As a result, a holder of the\nredeemed debt securities may not be able to invest the\nredemption proceeds in a new investment that yields a\nsimilar return.\n\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock and Preferred Stock\n\nOur ability to pay dividends on our common stock and\npreferred stock may be limited by regulatory policies and\nrequirements.\n\nWe are subject to various regulatory policies and\nrequirements relating to capital actions, including\npayment of dividends. For example, Federal Reserve\nregulations require us to submit a capital plan as part\nof an annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\n(CCAR) in order to assess our capital planning process,\nincluding any planned capital actions, such as payment of\ndividends. We may be prohibited from taking capital\nactions, such as paying or increasing dividends on our\ncommon stock or preferred stock, if the Federal Reserve\nobjects to our CCAR capital plan. Our ability to pay\ndividends is also affected by the various minimum capital\nrequirements, capital ratios and buffers established by\nthe Federal Reserve. Adverse business and economic\nconditions may reduce our capital ratios below\nrequirements. Additionally, the applicable federal\nregulatory authority is authorized to determine, under\ncertain circumstances relating to the financial condition\nof a bank or a bank holding company, like Bank of\nAmerica, that the payment of dividends by such entity\nwould be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit\npayment of those dividends.\n\nYou may not receive dividends on our common stock.\n\nHolders of our common stock are only entitled to receive\nsuch dividends as our board of directors may declare out\nof funds legally available for such payments.\nFurthermore, holders of our common stock are subject to\nthe prior dividend rights of holders of our preferred\nstock or the depositary shares representing such\npreferred stock then outstanding. Although we have\nhistorically declared cash dividends on our common stock,\nwe are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate\nour common stock dividend in the future.\n\n12\n\nOur common stock is equity and is subordinate to our\nexisting and future indebtedness and preferred stock.\n\nShares of our common stock are equity interests in us and\ndo not constitute indebtedness. This means that shares of\nour common stock will rank junior to all of our\nindebtedness and to other non-equityclaims against us and\nour assets available to satisfy claims against us,\nincluding claims in our liquidation. Additionally,\nholders of our common stock are subject to the prior\ndividend and liquidation rights of holders of our\noutstanding preferred stock or depositary shares\nrepresenting interests in such preferred stock then\noutstanding. Our board of directors is authorized to\nissue additional classes or series of preferred stock\nwithout any action on the part of the holders of our\ncommon stock. As of June 24, 2021, the aggregate\nliquidation preference of all our outstanding preferred\nstock was approximately $23.7 billion.\n\nOur preferred stock is equity and is subordinate to our\nexisting and future indebtedness.\n\nShares of our preferred stock are equity interests in us\nand do not constitute indebtedness. This means that\nshares of our preferred stock and any depositary shares\nwhich represent interests in shares of our preferred\nstock will rank junior to all of our indebtedness and to\nother non-equityclaims against us and our assets\navailable to satisfy claims against us, including claims\nin our liquidation. Our existing and future indebtedness\nmay restrict payment of dividends on our preferred stock.\nIn addition, holders of our preferred stock or depositary\nshares representing interests in shares of our preferred\nstock may be fully subordinated to interests held by the\nU.S. government in the event that we enter into a\nreceivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar\nproceeding.\n\nCash dividends on our preferred stock are subject to\ncertain limitations.\n\nUnlike indebtedness, where principal and interest\ncustomarily are payable on specified due dates, in the\ncase of our preferred stock (1) dividends are payable\nonly when, as and if declared by our board of directors\nor a duly authorized committee of our board of directors\nand (2) as a corporation, we are restricted to making\ndividend payments and redemption payments on our\npreferred stock out of legally available funds. In\naddition, under the Federal Reserve\u0092s risk-based capital\nrules related to additional Tier 1 capital instruments,\ndividends on our preferred stock may only be paid out of\nour net income, retained earnings or surplus related to\nother additional Tier 1 capital instruments.\n\nIf we are deferring payments on our outstanding junior\nsubordinated notes or are in default under the indentures\ngoverning those securities, we will be prohibited from\nmaking distributions on our common stock and preferred\nstock, or redeeming our preferred stock.\n\nThe terms of our currently outstanding junior\nsubordinated notes prohibit us from declaring or paying\nany dividends or distributions on our common stock and\npreferred stock, or redeeming, purchasing, acquiring, or\nmaking a liquidation payment on such stock, if we are\naware of any event that would be an event of default\nunder the indenture governing those junior subordinated\nnotes or at any time when we have deferred payment of\ninterest on those junior subordinated notes.\n\n13\n\nOther Risks\n\nOur ability to pay dividends on our common stock and\npreferred stock and to make payments on our debt\nsecurities depends upon our receipt of funds from our\nsubsidiaries and applicable laws and regulations, and\nactions we have taken pursuant to our resolution plan,\ncould restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to\ntransfer funds to us.\n\nWe are a holding company and conduct substantially all of\nour operations through our subsidiaries. We depend on\ndividends and other distributions, loans and other\npayments from our subsidiaries to fund dividend payments\non our common stock and preferred stock and to fund\npayments on our other obligations, including the debt\nsecurities. Any inability of our subsidiaries to pay\ndividends or make payments to us may adversely affect our\ncash flow and financial condition. Many of our\nsubsidiaries, including our bank and broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries, are subject to laws that restrict dividend\npayments or authorize regulatory bodies to block or\nreduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to us or\nto our other subsidiaries. In addition, our bank and\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on\ntheir ability to lend or transact with affiliates and to\nminimum regulatory capital and liquidity requirements.\nLower earnings in our subsidiaries can reduce the amount\nof funds available to us. Adverse business and economic\nconditions, including changes in interest and currency\nexchange rates, illiquidity or volatility in areas where\nwe have concentrated credit risk, and a failure in or\nbreach of our operational or security systems or\ninfrastructure, could affect our businesses and results\nof operations. Intercompany arrangements we have entered\ninto in connection with our resolution planning could\nrestrict the amount of funding available to us from our\nsubsidiaries under certain adverse conditions, as\ndescribed above under \u0093\u0097A resolution under our single\npoint of entry resolution strategy could materially\nadversely affect our liquidity and financial condition\nand our ability to pay our obligations on our\nsecurities.\u0094 These restrictions could prevent those\nsubsidiaries from paying dividends or making other\ndistributions to us or otherwise providing funds to us\nthat we need in order to pay dividends or make payments\non our securities. Also, our right to participate in any\ndistribution of assets of any of our subsidiaries upon\nsuch subsidiary\u0092s liquidation or otherwise will be\nsubject to the prior claims of creditors of that\nsubsidiary, except to the extent that any of our claims\nas a creditor of such subsidiary may be recognized.\n\nWe cannot assure you that a trading market for your\nsecurities will ever develop or be maintained.\n\nWe may not list our securities on any securities\nexchange. We cannot predict how these securities will\ntrade in the secondary market or whether that market will\nbe liquid or illiquid. The number of potential buyers of\nour securities in any secondary market may be limited.\nAlthough any underwriters or agents may purchase and sell\nour securities in the secondary market from time to time,\nthese underwriters or agents will not be obligated to do\nso and may discontinue making a market for the securities\nat any time without giving us notice. We cannot assure\nyou that a secondary market for any of our securities\nwill develop, or that if one develops, it will be\nmaintained.\n\nOur trading activities may create conflicts of interest\nwith you.\n\nWe or one or more of our broker-dealer affiliates,\nincluding BofA Securities, Inc., may engage in trading\nactivities that are not for your account or on your\nbehalf. These trading activities may present a conflict\nof interest between the interest of holders of the\nsecurities and the interests we and our affiliates may\nhave in our proprietary accounts, in facilitating\ntransactions, including block trades, for our other\ncustomers, and in accounts under our management. These\ntrading activities\n\n14\n\ncould influence secondary trading (if any) in the\nsecurities, or otherwise could be adverse to the\ninterests of a beneficial owner of the securities.\n\nPayments on the securities are subject to our credit\nrisk, and actual or perceived changes in our\ncreditworthiness may affect the value of our securities.\n\nOur credit ratings are an assessment of our ability to\npay our obligations. Consequently, our perceived\ncreditworthiness and actual or anticipated changes in our\ncredit ratings may affect the market value of our\nsecurities. However, because the return on our securities\ngenerally depends upon factors in addition to our ability\nto pay our obligations, an improvement in our credit\nratings will not reduce the other investment risks, if\nany, related to our securities.\n\nCurrency Risks\n\nWe may issue securities denominated in, or with respect\nto which principal, interest and/or other amounts payable\nare payable in, a currency other than U.S. dollars, which\nwe refer to as \u0093Non-U.S.Dollar-Denominated Securities.\u0094\nIf you intend to invest in any Non-U.S.Dollar-Denominated\nSecurities, you should consult your own financial and\nlegal advisors as to the currency risks related to your\ninvestment. Non-U.S.Dollar-Denominated Securities are not\nan appropriate investment for you if you are not\nknowledgeable about the significant terms and conditions\nof Non-U.S.Dollar-Denominated Securities, non-U.S.dollar\ncurrency transactions, or financial matters in general.\nThe information in this prospectus is directed primarily\nto investors who are U.S. residents.\n\nAn investment in a Non-U.S.Dollar-Denominated Security\ninvolves currency-related risks.\n\nAn investment in a Non-U.S.Dollar-Denominated Security\nentails significant risks that are not associated with a\nsimilar investment in a security that is payable solely\nin U.S. dollars. These risks include possible significant\nchanges in rates of exchange between the U.S. dollar and\nthe relevant non-U.S.dollar currency or currencies and\nthe imposition or modification of foreign exchange\ncontrols or other conditions by either the United States\nor non-U.S. governments.These risks generally depend on\nfactors over which we have no control, such as economic\nand political events and the supply of and demand for the\nrelevant currencies in the global markets.\n\nChanges in currency exchange rates can be volatile and\nmay adversely affect an investment in Non-U.S.Dollar-\nDenominated Securities.\n\nIn recent years, exchange rates between the U.S. dollar\nand a number of other currencies have been highly\nvolatile. This volatility may continue and could spread\nto other currencies in the future. Fluctuations in\ncurrency exchange rates could affect adversely an\ninvestment in a Non-U.S.Dollar-Denominated Security, and\nsuch changes in exchange rates may vary considerably\nduring the life of that security. Depreciation of the\nspecified currency against the U.S. dollar could result\nin a decrease in the U.S. dollar-equivalent value of\npayments on Non-U.S. Dollar-DenominatedSecurities,\nincluding the principal or other amounts payable at\nmaturity or the redemption amount payable upon those\nsecurities. That in turn could cause the market value of\nNon-U.S.Dollar-Denominated Securities to fall.\n\nWe will not adjust Non-U.S.Dollar-Denominated Securities\nto compensate for changes in foreign currency exchange\nrates.\n\nExcept as described below or in the applicable\nsupplement, we will not make any adjustment in or change\nto the terms of Non-U.S. Dollar-DenominatedSecurities for\nchanges in the foreign\n\n15\n\ncurrency exchange rate for the relevant currency,\nincluding any devaluation, revaluation, or imposition of\nexchange or other regulatory controls or taxes, or for\nother developments affecting that currency, the U.S.\ndollar, or any other currency. Consequently, you will\nbear the risk that your investment may be affected\nadversely by these types of events.\n\nGovernment policy can adversely affect foreign currency\nexchange rates and an investment in a Non-U.S.Dollar-\nDenominated Security.\n\nForeign currency exchange rates either can float or be\nfixed by sovereign governments. Governments or\ngovernmental bodies, including the European Central Bank,\nmay intervene from time to time in their economies to\nalter the exchange rate or exchange characteristics of\ntheir currencies. For example, a central bank may\nintervene to devalue or revalue a currency or to replace\nan existing currency. In addition, a government may\nimpose regulatory controls or taxes to affect the\nexchange rate of its currency or may issue a new currency\nor replace an existing currency. As a result, the amounts\npayable on and rate of return of a Non-U.S.Dollar-\nDenominated Security could be affected significantly and\nunpredictably by governmental actions. Even in the\nabsence of governmental action directly affecting\ncurrency exchange rates, political or economic\ndevelopments in the country or region issuing the\nspecified currency for a Non-U.S.Dollar-Denominated\nSecurity or elsewhere could result in significant and\nsudden changes in the exchange rate between the U.S.\ndollar and the specified currency. Changes in exchange\nrates could affect the value of Non-U.S. Dollar-\nDenominatedSecurities as participants in the global\ncurrency markets move to buy or sell the specified\ncurrency or U.S. dollars in reaction to these\ndevelopments.\n\nIf a governmental authority imposes exchange controls or\nother conditions, such as taxes on the exchange or\ntransfer of the specified currency, there may be limited\navailability of the specified currency for payment on\nNon-U.S. Dollar-DenominatedSecurities at their maturity\nor on any other payment date. In addition, the ability of\na holder to move currency freely out of the country in\nwhich payment in the currency is received or to convert\nthe currency at a freely determined market rate could be\nlimited by governmental actions.\n\nNon-U.S.Dollar-Denominated Securities may permit us to\nmake payments in U.S. dollars if we are unable to obtain\nthe specified currency.\n\nThe terms of any Non-U.S. Dollar-DenominatedSecurities\nmay provide that we may have the right to make a payment\nin U.S. dollars instead of the specified currency, if at\nor about the time when the payment on Non-U.S. Dollar-\nDenominatedSecurities comes due, the specified currency\nis subject to convertibility, transferability, market\ndisruption, or other conditions affecting its\navailability because of circumstances beyond our control.\nThese circumstances could include the imposition of\nexchange controls, our inability to obtain the specified\ncurrency because of a disruption in the currency markets\nfor the specified currency, or unavailability because the\nspecified currency is no longer used by the government of\nthe relevant country or for settlement of transactions by\npublic institutions of or within the international\nbanking community. In addition, if the specified currency\nfor a debt security has been replaced by a new currency,\nwe may have the option to choose whether we make payments\non such debt security in the replacement currency or in\nU.S. dollars. In either case, the exchange rate used to\nmake payment in U.S. dollars or the replacement currency,\nif any, may be based on limited information and would\ninvolve significant discretion on the part of the\nexchange rate agent, which may be one of our affiliates,\nto be appointed by us. As a result, the value of the\npayment in U.S. dollars may be less than the value of the\npayment you would have received in the specified currency\nif the specified currency had been available. The\nexchange rate agent generally will not have any liability\nfor its determinations.\n\n16\n\nAn investor may bear foreign currency exchange risk in a\nlawsuit for payment on Non-U.S.Dollar-Denominated\nSecurities.\n\nAny Non-U.S.Dollar-Denominated Securities issued under\nthe Senior Indenture or the Subordinated Indenture will\nbe governed by New York law. Other Non-U.S.Dollar-\nDenominated Securities also may be governed by New York\nLaw. Under Section 27 of the New York Judiciary Law, a\nstate court in the State of New York rendering a judgment\non Non-U.S.Dollar-Denominated Securities governed by New\nYork law would be required to render the judgment in the\nspecified currency. In turn, the judgment would be\nconverted into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate\nprevailing on the date of entry of the judgment.\nConsequently, in a lawsuit for payment on Non-U.S.Dollar-\nDenominated Securities governed by New York law, you\nwould bear currency exchange risk until judgment is\nentered, which could be a long time.\n\nIn courts outside of New York, you may not be able to\nobtain judgment in a specified currency other than U.S.\ndollars. For example, a judgment for money in an action\nbased on Non-U.S.Dollar-Denominated Securities in many\nother U.S. federal or state courts ordinarily would be\nenforced in the United States only in U.S. dollars. The\ndate and method used to determine the rate of conversion\nof the specified currency into U.S. dollars will depend\non various factors, including which court renders the\njudgment.\n\nInformation about foreign currency exchange rates may not\nbe indicative of future performance.\n\nIf we issue a Non-U.S.Dollar-Denominated Security, we may\ninclude in the applicable supplement information about\nhistorical exchange rates for the relevant non-U.S.dollar\ncurrency or currencies. Any information about exchange\nrates that we may provide will be furnished as a matter\nof information only, and you should not regard the\ninformation as indicative of the range of, or trends in,\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates that may occur in\nthe future.\n\n17\n\nBANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION Bank of America Corporation\nis a Delaware corporation, a bank holding company, and a\nfinancial holding company. Through various bank and\nnonbank subsidiaries throughout the United States and in\ninternational markets, we provide a diversified range of\nbanking and nonbank financial services and products.

USE OF PROCEEDS Unless we describe a\ndifferent use in the applicable supplement, we will use\nthe net proceeds from the sale of the securities for\ngeneral corporate purposes. General corporate purposes\ninclude, but are not limited to, the following:\n                                  \n      our working capital needs;  \n                                  \n                                                         \n      the funding of investments in, or extensions of    \n      credit to, our subsidiaries;                       \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      possible reductions, redemptions, repayments or    \n      repurchases of outstanding indebtedness or equity  \n      securities;                                        \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      the possible acquisitions of, or investments in,   \n      other financial institutions or other businesses;  \n      and                                                \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      other uses in the ordinary course of conducting    \n      our business.                                      \n                                                         \nUntil we designate the use of these net proceeds, we will\ninvest them temporarily. From time to time, we may engage\nin additional financings as we determine appropriate\nbased on our needs and prevailing market conditions.\nThese additional financings may include the sale of other\nsecurities. 18\n\nDESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES\n\nGeneral\n\nWe may issue senior or subordinated debt securities.\nNeither the senior debt securities nor the subordinated\ndebt securities will be secured by any of our property or\nassets. As a result, by owning a debt security, you are\none of our unsecured creditors.\n\nThe senior debt securities will constitute part of our\nsenior debt, will be issued under our Senior Indenture\ndescribed below, and will rank equally in right of\npayment with all of our other unsecured and\nunsubordinated debt from time to time outstanding, except\nobligations that are subject to any priorities or\npreferences by law.\n\nThe subordinated debt securities will constitute part of\nour subordinated debt, will be issued under our\nSubordinated Indenture described below, and will be\nsubordinated and junior in right of payment to all of our\n\u0093senior indebtedness,\u0094 as defined in the Subordinated\nIndenture, from time to time outstanding to the extent\nand in the manner provided in the Subordinated Indenture.\nThe subordinated debt securities will rank equally in\nright of payment with all our other unsecured and\nsubordinated indebtedness, other than unsecured and\nsubordinated indebtedness that by its terms is\nsubordinated to the subordinated debt securities. Neither\nthe Senior Indenture nor the Subordinated Indenture\nlimits our ability to incur additional \u0093senior\nindebtedness.\u0094\n\nThis section of the prospectus provides a summary of the\nmaterial terms of the Senior Indenture and the\nSubordinated Indenture and certain specific terms of debt\nsecurities that may be applicable if so specified in the\napplicable supplement for such debt securities.\n\nFinancial Consequences to Unsecured Debtholders of Single\nPoint of Entry Resolution Strategy\n\nWe are subject to the TLAC Rules, which aim to improve\nthe resiliency and resolvability of U.S. global\nsystemically important bank holding companies (\u0093covered\nBHCs\u0094), including Bank of America, in the event of\nfailure or material financial distress. The TLAC Rules\ninclude the requirement that each covered BHC maintain a\nminimum amount of eligible LTD and other loss-absorbing\ncapacity. The eligible LTD would absorb the covered BHC\u0092s\nlosses, following the depletion of its equity, upon its\nentry into a resolution proceeding under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code or a resolution proceeding administered\nby the FDIC under Title II of the Financial Reform Act.\n\nUnder Title I of the Financial Reform Act, we are\nrequired by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC to\nperiodically submit a plan for a rapid and orderly\nresolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of\nmaterial financial distress or failure. Our preferred\nresolution strategy under this plan is our SPOE strategy\nunder which only Bank of America would enter bankruptcy\nproceedings. Under this strategy, and pursuant to\nexisting intercompany arrangements which we have\ntransferred most of our assets to a wholly-owned holding\ncompany subsidiary, which holds the equity interests in\nour key operating subsidiaries, we would contribute our\nremaining financial assets, less a holdback to cover our\nbankruptcy expenses, to this wholly-owned holding company\nsubsidiary prior to filing for bankruptcy. We would then\nfile for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code. Pursuant to an order from the bankruptcy\ncourt under section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, we, as\ndebtor-in-possession,would transfer our subsidiaries to a\nnewly-formed entity (\u0093NewCo\u0094) that would be held in trust\nfor the sole and exclusive benefit of our bankruptcy\nestate.\n\nUnder our SPOE resolution strategy, the obligations of\nBank of America on its unsecured debt, including the debt\nsecurities offered pursuant to this prospectus, would not\nbe assumed by NewCo;\n\n19\n\ninstead, the claims on such obligations would be left\nbehind in the bankruptcy proceeding. After the\ntransferred subsidiaries were stabilized, NewCo\u0092s\nresidual value in the form of shares or proceeds from the\nsale of shares would be distributed to the holders of\nclaims against the bankruptcy estate in accordance with\nthe priority of their claims, including to holders of our\ndebt securities. In 2013, the FDIC issued a notice\ndescribing its similar preferred \u0093single point of entry\u0094\nrecapitalization model for resolving a global\nsystemically important banking group, such as Bank of\nAmerica, under Title II of the Financial Reform Act.\nUnder Title II, when a covered BHC is in default or\ndanger of default, the FDIC may be appointed receiver in\norder to conduct an orderly liquidation of such\ninstitution as an alternative to resolution of the entity\nunder the U.S. Bankruptcy Code if the Secretary of the\nTreasury makes certain financial distress and systemic\nrisk determinations. Pursuant to the single point of\nentry recapitalization model, the FDIC would use its\npower to create a \u0093bridge entity\u0094 for the covered BHC;\ntransfer the systemically important and viable parts of\nthe covered BHC\u0092s business to the bridge entity;\nrecapitalize those subsidiaries using assets of the\ncovered BHC that have been transferred to the bridge\nentity; and exchange external debt claims against the\ncovered BHC, including claims of holders of our debt\nsecurities and other unsecured debt, for equity in the\nbridge entity. This strategy would allow operating\nsubsidiaries of the covered BHC to continue to operate\nand impose losses on stockholders and creditors of the\ncovered BHC, which could include holders of our debt\nsecurities. The Indentures The senior debt securities and\nthe subordinated debt securities each are governed by a\ndocument called an indenture, which is a contract between\nus and the applicable trustee. Senior debt securities\nwill be issued under the Indenture dated as of June 27,\n2018 (for senior debt securities) (as supplemented from\ntime to time, the \u0093Senior Indenture\u0094) between us, as\nissuer, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company,\nN.A., as trustee, and subordinated debt securities will\nbe issued under the Indenture dated as of June 27, 2018\n(for subordinated debt securities) (as supplemented from\ntime to time, the \u0093Subordinated Indenture\u0094) between us,\nas issuer, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company,\nN.A., as trustee. These indentures are substantially\nidentical in all material respects, except for:\n                                                         \n      the covenant described below under \u0093\u0097Sale or         \n      Issuance of Capital Stock of Banks,\u0094 which is       \n      included only in the Senior Indenture;             \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      the provisions relating to subordination           \n      described below under \u0093\u0097Subordination,\u0094 which are     \n      included only in the Subordinated                  \n      Indenture;\u00a0and                                     \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      the events of default relating to payment          \n      defaults and specific provisions for covenant      \n      breaches, as described below under \u0093\u0097Events of       \n      Default and Rights of Acceleration; Covenant       \n      Breaches,\u0094 which are not included in the            \n      Subordinated Indenture.                            \n                                                         \nIn this prospectus, when we refer to \u0093debt securities,\u0094\nwe mean both our senior debt securities and our\nsubordinated debt securities, and when we refer to the\n\u0093indenture\u0094 or the \u0093trustee\u0094 with respect to any debt\nsecurities, we mean the indenture under which those debt\nsecurities are issued and the trustee under that\nindenture. The trustee under each indenture has two\nprincipal functions:\n                                                         \n      First, the trustee can enforce your rights         \n      against us if we default. However, there are       \n      limitations on the extent to which the trustee     \n      may act on your                                    \n      behalf, which we describe below under \u0093\u0097Collection   \n      of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by       \n      Trustee.\u0094                                           \n                                                         \n20\n                                                         \n      Second, the trustee performs administrative        \n      duties for us, including the delivery of interest  \n      payments and notices.                              \n                                                         \nNeither of the indentures limit the aggregate amount of\ndebt securities that we may issue or the number of series\nor the aggregate amount of any particular series of debt\nsecurities. The indentures and the debt securities also\ndo not limit our ability to incur other indebtedness or\nto issue other securities. This means that we may issue\nadditional debt securities and other securities at any\ntime without your consent and without notifying you. In\naddition, neither of the indentures contain provisions\nprotecting holders against a decline in our credit\nquality resulting from takeovers, recapitalizations, the\nincurrence of additional indebtedness, or restructuring.\nIf our credit quality declines as a result of an event of\nthis type, or otherwise, any ratings of our debt\nsecurities then outstanding may be withdrawn or\ndowngraded. This section is a summary of the general\nterms and provisions of the indentures. We have filed the\nindentures with the SEC as exhibits to the registration\nstatement of which this prospectus forms a part. See\n\u0093Where You Can Find More Information\u0094 below for\ninformation on how to obtain copies of the indentures.\nWhenever we refer to the defined terms of an indenture in\nthis prospectus or in a supplement hereto without\ndefining them, the terms have the meanings given to them\nin that indenture. You must look to the indentures for\nthe most complete description of the information\nsummarized in this prospectus. Form and Denomination of\nDebt Securities Unless we specify otherwise in the\napplicable supplement, we will issue each debt security\nin book-entry only form. Debt securities in book-entry\nonly form will be represented by a global security\nregistered in the name of a depository. Accordingly, the\ndepository will be the registered holder of all the debt\nsecurities represented by the global security. Those who\nown beneficial interests in a global security will do so\nthrough participants in the depository\u0092s securities\nclearing system, and the rights of these indirect owners\nwill be governed solely by the applicable procedures of\nthe depository and its participants. We describe the\nprocedures applicable to book-entry only securities below\nunder the heading \u0093Registration and Settlement.\u0094\nGenerally, all debt securities represented by the same\nglobal security will have the same terms. We may,\nhowever, issue a global security that represents multiple\ndebt securities that have different terms and are issued\nat different times. We call this kind of global security\na master global security. Your debt securities will not\nbe represented by a master global security unless we so\nspecify in the applicable supplement. Unless we specify\notherwise in the applicable supplement, we will issue our\ndebt securities in fully registered form, without\ncoupons. If we issue a debt security in bearer form, we\nwill describe the special considerations applicable to\nbearer securities in the applicable supplement. Some of\nthe features that we describe in this prospectus may not\napply to bearer securities. Our debt securities may be\ndenominated, and cash payments with respect to the debt\nsecurities may be made, in U.S. dollars or in another\ncurrency. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable\nsupplement, the debt securities will be denominated, and\ncash payments with respect to the debt securities will be\nmade, in U.S. dollars, and unless we specify otherwise in\nthe applicable supplement, the debt securities will be\nissued in denominations of $1,000 and multiples of $1,000\nin excess of $1,000. If any of the debt securities are\ndenominated, or if principal, any premium, interest, and\nany other amounts payable on any of the debt securities\nis payable, in a foreign currency, the specified\ncurrency, as well as any additional investment\nconsiderations, risk factors, restrictions, tax\nconsequences, specific terms and other information\nrelating to that series of debt 21\n\nsecurities and the specified currency will be described\nin the applicable supplement. We describe some of those\ninvestment considerations relating to securities\ndenominated or payable in a currency other than U.S.\ndollars above under the heading \u0093Risk Factors.\u0094 Currency\nConversions For any debt securities denominated or\npayable in a currency other than U.S. dollars (referred\nto as \u0093non-U.S.dollar-denominated debt securities\u0094), the\ninitial investors will be required to pay for the debt\nsecurities in that foreign currency. The applicable\nselling agent may arrange for the conversion of U.S.\ndollars into the applicable foreign currency to\nfacilitate payment for the non-U.S.dollar-denominated\ndebt securities by U.S. purchasers desiring to make the\ninitial payment in U.S. dollars. Any such conversion will\nbe made by that selling agent on the terms and subject to\nthe conditions, limitations, and charges as it may\nestablish from time to time in accordance with its\nregular foreign exchange procedures, and subject to U.S.\nlaws and regulations. All costs of any such conversion\nfor the initial purchase of the non-U.S.dollar-\ndenominated debt securities will be borne by the initial\ninvestors using those conversion arrangements. Different\nSeries of Debt Securities We may issue our debt\nsecurities from time to time in one or more series with\nthe same or different maturities. We also may \u0093reopen\u0094 a\nseries of our debt securities. This means that we can\nincrease the principal amount of a series of our debt\nsecurities by selling additional debt securities with the\nsame terms, provided that such additional debt securities\nshall be fungible for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nWe may do so without notice to the existing holders of\ndebt securities of that series. However, any new debt\nsecurities of this kind may begin to bear interest at a\ndifferent date. This section of the prospectus summarizes\nthe material terms of the debt securities that are common\nto all series under the respective indentures. We will\ndescribe the financial and other specific terms of the\nseries of debt securities being offered in the applicable\nsupplement. The applicable supplement also may describe\nany differences from the material terms described in this\nprospectus. If there are any differences between the\napplicable supplement and this prospectus, the applicable\nsupplement will control. The terms of your series of debt\nsecurities as described in the applicable supplement may\ninclude the following:\n                                                  \n      the title and type of the debt securities;

For\nexample, a debt security may bear interest at a fixed\nrate for some interest periods and at a floating rate in\nother interest periods. We will describe the\ndetermination of interest or other amounts payable for\nany of these debt securities in the applicable\nsupplement.\n\nFixed-Rate Reset Notes\n\nWe may issue debt securities that bear interest at a\nfixed rate for a specified portion of their term and then\nreset that fixed rate at specified intervals for the\nremainder of their term. The rate of interest on such\ndebt securities will be specified in, and will be\ndetermined in accordance with the terms and provisions\nset forth in, the applicable supplement.\n\nCalculation Agents for Certain Types of Debt Securities\n\nFor any (a) floating-rate notes, (b) fixed/floating rate\nnotes, during any floating-rate period, or (c) fixed-rate\nreset notes, calculations will be made by the applicable\ncalculation agent, which will be an institution that we\nappoint as our agent for this purpose. The calculation\nagent may be one of our affiliates and may also be The\nBank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. For floating-\nrate notes, we will identify in the applicable supplement\nthe initial calculation agent we have appointed for a\nparticular series of debt securities as of the original\nissue date for such debt securities. For fixed/floating\nrate notes and fixed-rate reset notes, we may identify\nthe initial calculation agent in the applicable\nsupplement or we may appoint the calculation agent for a\nparticular series of debt securities after the original\nissue date for such debt securities, at any time prior to\nthe commencement of the first floating-rate period, in\nthe case of fixed/floating rate notes, or before the\nfirst date on which a calculation is required to be\nperformed, in the case of fixed-rate reset notes. We may\nremove and/or appoint different calculation agents from\ntime to time after the original issue date for a series\nof debt securities, or we may elect to act as the\ncalculation agent with respect to such debt securities,\nin each case without your consent and without notifying\nyou of the change. Absent manifest error, all\ndeterminations of the calculation agent will be final and\nbinding on you, the trustee and us.\n\nOriginal Issue Discount Notes\n\nAny of the types of notes described above may be an\noriginal issue discount note. Original issue discount\nnotes are debt securities that are issued at a price\nlower than their stated principal amount or lower than\ntheir minimum guaranteed repayment amount at maturity.\nOriginal issue discount notes may bear no interest (which\nwe refer to as zero coupon notes) or may bear interest at\na rate that is below market rates at the time of\nissuance. Upon an acceleration of the maturity of an\noriginal issue discount note, the amount of interest\npayable will be determined in accordance with the terms\nof that debt security, as described in the applicable\nsupplement. That amount normally is less than the amount\npayable at the maturity date. A debt security issued at a\ndiscount to its\n\n24\n\nprincipal may, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, be\nconsidered an original issue discount note, regardless of\nthe amount payable upon redemption or acceleration of\nmaturity. See \u0093U.S. Federal Income Tax\nConsiderations\u0097Taxation of Debt Securities\u0094 below for a\nsummary of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of\nowning an original issue discount note.\n\nPayment of Principal, Interest, and Other Amounts Payable\n\nPaying Agents\n\nWe may appoint one or more financial institutions to act\nas our paying agents. Initially, we have appointed The\nBank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. to act as our\npaying agent, security registrar, and transfer agent with\nrespect to the debt securities through its corporate\ntrust office currently located at 4655 Salisbury Road,\nSuite 300, Jacksonville, Florida 32256. We may add,\nreplace or terminate paying agents from time to time in\naccordance with the applicable indenture, in each case\nwithout your consent and without notifying you of such\nchange. In addition, we may decide to act as our own\npaying agent with respect to some or all of the debt\nsecurities, and the paying agent may resign, in each case\nwithout your consent and without notifying you of such\nevent.\n\nPayments to Holders and Record Dates for Interest\n\nWe refer to each date on which interest is payable on a\ndebt security as an \u0093interest payment date.\u0094 Subject to\nany applicable business day convention set forth in the\napplicable supplement, interest payments on the debt\nsecurities will be made on each interest payment date\napplicable to, and at the maturity date, or earlier\nredemption date, of, the debt securities. Interest\npayable on any interest payment date other than the\nmaturity date, or earlier redemption date, will be paid\nto the registered holder of the debt security at the\nclose of business on the regular record date for that\ninterest payment date. However, unless we specify\notherwise in the applicable supplement, the initial\ninterest payment on a debt security issued between a\nregular record date and the interest payment date\nimmediately following the regular record date will be\nmade on the second interest payment date following the\noriginal issue date to the holder of record on the\nregular record date preceding the second interest payment\ndate. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable\nsupplement, the principal and interest payable at\nmaturity, or earlier redemption, will be paid to the\nholder of the debt security at the time of payment by the\npaying agent.\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement,\nthe record date for any interest payment for a debt\nsecurity in book-entry only form generally will be the\ndate that is two business days (in the case of notes\ndenominated in Canadian dollars) or one business day (for\nall other notes, unless we specify otherwise in the\napplicable supplement) prior to the payment date, unless\nsuch debt security is a non-U.S.dollar denominated debt\nsecurity held through DTC, in which case the record date\nfor an interest payment date will be the fifteenth\ncalendar day prior to such interest payment date, whether\nor not such record date is a business day. If the debt\nsecurity is in a form that is other than book-entry only,\nand unless we specify otherwise in the applicable\nsupplement, the regular record date for an interest\npayment date will be the fifteenth calendar day prior to\nsuch interest payment date, whether or not such record\ndate is a business day.\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement,\nthe term \u0093business day\u0094 means any weekday that is not a\nlegal holiday in New York, New York, Charlotte, North\nCarolina, or any other place of payment of the debt\nsecurity, and is not a date on which banking institutions\nin those cities are authorized or required by law or\nregulation to be closed.\n\n25\n\nPayments Due in U.S. Dollars\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement,\nwe will follow the practices described in this subsection\nwhen we pay amounts that are due in U.S. dollars.\n\nWe will make payments on debt securities in book-entry\nonly form in accordance with arrangements then in place\nbetween the paying agent and the depository or its\nnominee, as holder. An indirect owner\u0092s right to receive\nthose payments will be governed by the rules and\npractices of the depository and its participants, as\ndescribed below under the heading \u0093Registration and\nSettlement.\u0094\n\nBook-entry and other indirect owners should contact their\nbanks or brokers for information on how they will receive\npayments on their debt securities.\n\nWe will pay any interest on debt securities in definitive\nform on each interest payment date other than the\nmaturity date, or earlier redemption date, by, in our\ndiscretion, wire transfer of immediately available funds\nor check mailed to holders of the debt securities on the\napplicable record date at the address appearing on our or\nthe security registrar\u0092s records. We will pay principal\nand any premium, interest, and other amounts payable at\nthe maturity date, or earlier redemption date, of a debt\nsecurity in definitive form by wire transfer of\nimmediately available funds to the holder of the debt\nsecurity at the time of payment.\n\nPayments Due in Other Currencies\n\nGeneral\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement,\nwe will follow the practices described in this subsection\nwhen we pay amounts that are due on non-U.S.dollar-\ndenominated debt securities. Unless we specify otherwise\nin the applicable supplement, and except as described\nbelow, holders of non-U.S.dollar-denominated debt\nsecurities are not entitled to receive payments in U.S.\ndollars of an amount due in another currency, either on a\nglobal debt security or a debt security in definitive\nform.\n\nWe will make payments on non-U.S. dollar-denominateddebt\nsecurities in book-entry only form in the applicable\nspecified currency in accordance with arrangements then\nin place between the paying agent and the depository or\nits nominee, as holder. An indirect owner\u0092s right to\nreceive those payments will be governed by the rules and\npractices of the depository and its participants, as\ndescribed below under the heading \u0093Registration and\nSettlement.\u0094\n\nNon-U.S.Dollar-Denominated Debt Securities Held Through\nDTC\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement,\nholders of beneficial interests in non-U.S.dollar-\ndenominated debt securities through a participant in The\nDepository Trust Company, or \u0093DTC,\u0094 will receive payments\nin U.S. dollars, unless they elect to receive payments on\nthose debt securities in the applicable foreign currency.\nIf a holder of such beneficial interests through DTC does\nnot make an election through its DTC participant to\nreceive payments in the applicable foreign currency, the\nexchange rate agent for the relevant non-U.S.dollar-\ndenominated debt securities to be appointed by us will\nconvert payments to that holder into U.S. dollars, and\nall costs of those conversions will be borne by that\nholder by deduction from the applicable payments.\n\nThe holder of a beneficial interest in global\nnon-U.S.dollar-denominated debt securities held through a\nDTC participant may elect to receive payments on those\ndebt securities in the foreign\n\n26\n\ncurrency by notifying the DTC participant through which\nit holds its beneficial interests on or prior to the\nfifteenth business day prior to the record date for the\napplicable debt securities of (1) that holder\u0092s election\nto receive all or a portion of the payment in the\napplicable foreign currency and (2) wire transfer\ninstructions to an account for the applicable foreign\ncurrency outside the United States. DTC must be notified\nof the election and wire transfer instructions (a) on or\nprior to the fifth business day after the record date for\nany payment of interest and (b) on or prior to the tenth\nbusiness day prior to the date for any payment of\nprincipal. DTC will notify the trustee or other\napplicable paying agent of the election and wire transfer\ninstructions (1) on or prior to the fifth business day\nafter the record date for any payment of interest and (2)\non or prior to the tenth business day prior to the date\nfor any payment of principal. If complete instructions\nare forwarded to and received by DTC through a DTC\nparticipant and forwarded by DTC to the trustee or other\napplicable paying agent and received on or prior to the\ndates described above, the holder will receive payment in\nthe applicable foreign currency outside DTC; otherwise,\nonly U.S. dollar payments will be made by the trustee or\nother applicable paying agent to DTC.\n\nFor holders of non-U.S.dollar-denominated debt securities\nheld through a DTC participant not electing payment in\nthe applicable foreign currency, the U.S. dollar amount\nof any payment will be the amount of the applicable\nforeign currency otherwise payable, converted into U.S.\ndollars at the applicable exchange rate prevailing as of\n11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the second business\nday prior to the relevant payment date, less any costs\nincurred by the exchange rate agent for that conversion\nunless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement.\nThe costs of those conversions will be shared pro rata\namong the holders of beneficial interests in the\napplicable global notes receiving U.S. dollar payments in\nthe proportion of their respective holdings. The exchange\nrate agent, to be appointed by us at the time of issuance\nfor such non-U.S.dollar-denominated debt securities held\nthrough a DTC participant, will make those conversions in\naccordance with prevailing market practice and the terms\nof the applicable debt security and with any applicable\narrangements between us and the exchange rate agent.\n\nIf an exchange rate quotation is unavailable from the\nentity or source ordinarily used by the exchange rate\nagent in the normal course of business, the exchange rate\nagent will obtain a quotation from a leading foreign\nexchange bank in New York City, which may be an affiliate\nof the exchange rate agent or another entity selected by\nthe exchange rate agent for that purpose after\nconsultation with us. If no quotation from a leading\nforeign exchange bank is available, payment will be made\nin the applicable foreign currency to the account or\naccounts specified by DTC to the trustee or other\napplicable paying agent, unless the applicable foreign\ncurrency is unavailable due to the imposition of exchange\ncontrols or other circumstances beyond our control.\n\nUnavailability of Currencies and Replacement Currencies\n\nIf, at or about the time of payment of any principal,\npremium or interest on a non-U.S.dollar-denominated debt\nsecurity, the relevant specified currency is not legal\ntender for the payment of public and private debts in the\ncountry issuing the currency as of the original issue\ndate of such debt security or is otherwise unavailable,\nand the relevant specified currency has been replaced by\nanother currency that has become legal tender for the\npayment of public and private debts in such country (a\n\u0093replacement currency\u0094), any amount payable pursuant to\nsuch debt security may be paid, at our option, in the\nreplacement currency or in U.S. dollars, at a rate of\nexchange which takes into account the conversion, at the\nrate prevailing on the most recent date on which official\nconversion rates were quoted or set by the national\ngovernment or other authority responsible for issuing the\nreplacement currency, from the specified currency to the\nreplacement currency or to U.S. dollars, if applicable,\nand, if necessary, the conversion of the replacement\ncurrency into U.S. dollars at the rate prevailing on the\ndate of such conversion. In this circumstance, we will\nappoint a financial institution to act as exchange rate\nagent for purposes of making the required conversions\n\n27\n\nin accordance with prevailing market practice and the\nterms of the applicable debt security and with any\napplicable arrangements between us and the exchange rate\nagent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the relevant\nspecified currency may not be available to us for making\npayments of principal of or any premium, interest or\nother amounts payable on any non-U.S.dollar-denominated\ndebt securities. This could occur due to the imposition\nof exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our\ncontrol, or if the specified currency is no longer used\nby the government of the country issuing that currency or\nby public institutions within the international banking\ncommunity for the settlement of transactions. If the\nspecified currency is unavailable and has not been\nreplaced, and unless otherwise specified in the\napplicable supplement, we may satisfy our obligations to\nholders of the relevant non-U.S.dollar-denominated debt\nsecurities by making those payments due in the relevant\nspecified currency on the date of payment in U.S.\ndollars. The amount of such payments made in U.S. dollars\nwill be determined by an exchange rate agent to be\nappointed by us on the basis of the noon dollar buying\nrate in The City of New York for cable transfers of the\nspecified currency or currencies in which a payment on\nany such non-U.S.dollar-denominated debt securities was\nto be made, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New\nYork, which is referred to as the \u0093market exchange rate,\u0094\nor such other rate as may be set forth in the applicable\nsupplement. If that rate of exchange is not then\navailable or is not published for a particular payment\ncurrency, the market exchange rate will be based on the\nhighest bid quotation in The City of New York received by\nthe exchange rate agent at approximately 11:00 a.m., New\nYork City time, on the second business day preceding the\napplicable payment date from three recognized foreign\nexchange dealers for the purchase by the quoting dealer:\n                                                         \n      of the specified currency for U.S. dollars for     \n      settlement on the payment date;                    \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      in the aggregate amount of the specified currency  \n      payable to those holders or beneficial owners of   \n      non-U.S.                                           \n      dollar-denominated debt securities; and            \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      at which the applicable dealer commits to execute  \n      a contract.                                        \n                                                         \nOne of the dealers providing quotations may be the\nexchange rate agent unless the exchange rate agent is our\naffiliate. If those bid quotations are not available, the\nexchange rate agent will determine the market exchange\nrate at its sole discretion in accordance with prevailing\nmarket practice and the terms of the applicable debt\nsecurity and with any applicable arrangements between us\nand the exchange rate agent. The above provisions do not\napply if a specified currency is unavailable because it\nhas been replaced by the euro. If the euro has been\nsubstituted for a specified currency of the relevant\nnon-U.S.dollar-denominated debt security, we may, at our\noption, or will, if required by applicable law, without\nthe consent of the holders of the affected debt\nsecurities, pay the principal of and any premium,\ninterest or other amounts payable on any non-U.S.dollar-\ndenominated debt securities in euro instead of the\nspecified currency, in conformity with legally applicable\nmeasures taken pursuant to, or by virtue of, the Treaty\nestablishing the European Community, as amended. Any\npayment made in U.S. dollars or in euro as described\nabove where the required payment is in an unavailable\nspecified currency will not constitute an event of\ndefault under the relevant indenture. The exchange rate\nagent to be appointed by us may be one of our affiliates,\nand, from time to time after the initial appointment of\nan exchange rate agent, we may appoint one or more\ndifferent exchange rate agents for the relevant\nnon-U.S.dollar-denominated debt security without your\nconsent and without notifying you of the change. The\nexchange rate agent will determine the applicable rate of\nexchange that would apply to a payment made in U.S.\ndollars or a replacement currency in its sole discretion\nunless we state in the applicable supplement that any\ndetermination 28\n\nrequires our approval. Absent manifest error, those\ndeterminations will be final and binding on you and us.\n\nFor purposes of the above discussion about currency\nconversions and payments on non-U.S.dollar-denominated\ndebt securities, unless otherwise specified in the\napplicable supplement, the term \u0093business day\u0094 means any\nweekday that is not a legal holiday in New York, New York\nor Charlotte, North Carolina and is not a day on which\nbanking institutions in those cities are authorized or\nrequired by law or regulation to be closed.\n\nBook-entry and other indirect owners of a debt security\nwith a specified currency other than U.S. dollars should\ncontact their banks or brokers for information about how\nto receive payments in the specified currency or in U.S.\ndollars.\n\nNon-U.S.Dollar-Denominated Securities in Definitive Form\n\nWe will pay any interest on non-U.S. dollar-\ndenominateddebt securities in definitive form by, in our\ndiscretion, wire transfer of immediately available funds\nor check mailed to holders of the debt securities on the\napplicable record date at the address appearing on our or\nthe security registrar\u0092s records. We will pay principal\nand any premium, interest, or other amounts payable at\nthe maturity date of a non-U.S. dollar-denominateddebt\nsecurity in definitive form by wire transfer of\nimmediately available funds upon surrender of the debt\nsecurity at the corporate trust office of the applicable\ntrustee or an office of the applicable paying agent, as\nspecified in the applicable supplement.\n\nNo Sinking Fund\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement,\nour debt securities will not be entitled to the benefit\nof any sinking fund. This means that we will not deposit\nmoney on a regular basis into any separate custodial\naccount to repay the debt securities.\n\nRedemption\n\nThe applicable supplement will indicate whether we may\nredeem the debt securities prior to their stated\nmaturity. If we may redeem the debt securities prior to\ntheir stated maturity, the applicable supplement will\nindicate the redemption price, the method for redemption,\nand the date or dates upon which we may redeem the debt\nsecurities. The redemption of any debt security that is\nour eligible LTD will require the prior approval of the\nFederal Reserve if after such redemption we would fail to\nsatisfy our requirements as to eligible LTD or total\nloss-absorbing capacity under the TLAC Rules. In\naddition, unless we specify otherwise in the applicable\nsupplement, to the extent then required by applicable\nlaws or regulations, our subordinated debt securities may\nnot be redeemed prior to their stated maturity without\nthe requisite prior approvals, if any, from applicable\nregulators. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable\nsupplement, and, except with respect to a \u0093make-whole\u0094\nredemption, we may redeem debt securities on the date or\ndates specified in the applicable supplement upon prior\nwritten notice (as described below under \u0093\u0097Notice of\nRedemption\u0094) to the holders of the applicable series of\ndebt securities being redeemed at a redemption price\nequal to 100% of the principal amount of such series of\ndebt securities, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if\nany, thereon, to, but excluding, the applicable\nredemption date.\n\nNotice of Redemption\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement,\nwe may exercise our right to redeem debt securities by\ngiving notice to the holders under the applicable\nindenture at least 5 business\n\n29\n\ndays but not more than 60 calendar days before the\nspecified redemption date. The notice will specify:\n                                      \n      the date fixed for redemption;  \n                                      \n                                                         \n      the redemption price (or, if not then              \n      ascertainable, the manner of calculation           \n      thereof);                                          \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      the CUSIP number and any other identifying number  \n      of the debt securities to be redeemed;             \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      the amount to be redeemed, if less than all of a   \n      series of debt securities is to be redeemed;       \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      the place of payment for the debt securities to    \n      be redeemed;\u00a0and                                   \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      that, subject to satisfaction of any conditions    \n      to such redemption set forth in the notice of      \n      redemption and unless we default in payment of     \n      the                                                \n      redemption price, on and after the date fixed for  \n      redemption, interest (if any) will cease to        \n      accrue on the debt securities to be redeemed.      \n                                                         \nSuch redemption may be subject to the satisfaction of one\nor more conditions precedent, in which case the notice of\nredemption will describe each condition and, if\napplicable, state that the redemption date may, in our\ndiscretion, be delayed until such time as any or all\nconditions have been satisfied, or such redemption may\nnot occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event\nthat any or all of the conditions have not been satisfied\nby the redemption date stated in the notice of\nredemption, or by the redemption date as it may be\ndelayed in our discretion. So long as a depository is the\nrecord holder of the applicable debt securities to be\nredeemed, we, or the trustee on our behalf if we so\nrequest, will deliver any notice of our election to\nexercise our redemption right only to that depository.\nRepayment The applicable supplement will indicate whether\nthe debt securities can be repaid at the holder\u0092s option\nprior to their stated maturity. If the debt securities\nmay be repaid prior to their stated maturity, the\napplicable supplement will indicate the applicable\nrepayment price or prices, the procedures for repayment\nand the date or dates on or after which the holder can\nrequest repayment. Repurchase We may purchase at any time\nand from time to time, including through a subsidiary or\naffiliate of ours, outstanding debt securities by tender,\nin the open market, or by private agreement. The\nrepurchase of any debt security that is our eligible LTD\nwill require the prior approval of the Federal Reserve if\nafter such repurchase we would fail to satisfy our\nrequirements as to eligible LTD or total loss-absorbing\ncapacity under the TLAC Rules. We, or our affiliates,\nhave the discretion to hold or resell any repurchased\ndebt securities. We also have the discretion to cancel\nany repurchased debt securities. Conversion We may issue\ndebt securities that are convertible into, or exercisable\nor exchangeable for, at either our option or the holder\u0092s\noption or otherwise as provided in the applicable\nsupplement, our 30\n\npreferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, or\nother debt securities. The applicable supplement will\ndescribe the terms of any conversion, exercise, or\nexchange features, including:\n                                                         \n      the periods during which conversion, exercise, or  \n      exchange, as applicable, may be elected;           \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      the conversion, exercise, or exchange price        \n      payable and the number of shares or amount of our  \n      preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock,  \n      or                                                 \n      other debt securities, that may be issued upon     \n      conversion, exercise, or exchange, and any         \n      adjustment provisions; and                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      the procedures for electing conversion, exercise,  \n      or exchange, as applicable.                        \n                                                         \nExchange, Registration, and Transfer Subject to the terms\nof the applicable indenture, debt securities of any\nseries in definitive form may be exchanged at the option\nof the holder for other debt securities of the same\nseries and of an equal aggregate principal amount and\ntype in any authorized denominations. Debt securities in\ndefinitive form may be presented for registration of\ntransfer at the office of the security registrar or at\nthe office of any transfer agent that we designate and\nmaintain. The security registrar or the transfer agent\nwill make the registration of transfer only if it is\nsatisfied with the documents of title and identity of the\nperson making the request. There will not be a service\ncharge for any exchange or registration of transfer of\ndebt securities, but we may require payment of a sum\nsufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge\nthat may be imposed in connection with the exchange or\ntransfer. Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable\nsupplement, initially, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust\nCompany, N.A. will be the authenticating agent, security\nregistrar, and transfer agent for the debt securities\nissued under the respective indentures. We may change the\nsecurity registrar or the transfer agent or approve a\nchange in the location through which any security\nregistrar or transfer agent acts at any time, in each\ncase without your consent and without notifying you of\nsuch event. We will be required to maintain a security\nregistrar and transfer agent in each place of payment for\neach series of debt securities. At any time, we may\ndesignate additional transfer agents for any series of\ndebt securities. We will not be required to (1) issue,\nexchange, or register the transfer of any debt security\nof any series to be redeemed for a period of 15 days\nbefore the date on which we deliver the notice of\nredemption or (2) exchange or register the transfer of\nany debt security (i) that was selected, called, or is\nbeing called for redemption, except the unredeemed\nportion of any debt security being redeemed in part or\n(ii) as to which the holder has exercised any right to\nrequire us to repay such debt security, except the\nportion to remain outstanding of any debt security being\nrepaid in part. For a discussion of restrictions on the\nexchange, registration, and transfer of book-entry only\nsecurities, see \u0093Registration and Settlement\u0094 below.\nSubordination Our subordinated debt securities are\nsubordinated and junior in right of payment to all of our\n\u0093senior indebtedness.\u0094 The Subordinated Indenture defines\n\u0093senior indebtedness\u0094 as any indebtedness for money\nborrowed, including all of our indebtedness for borrowed\nand purchased money, all of our obligations arising from\noff-balancesheet guarantees and direct credit\nsubstitutes, and our obligations associated with\nderivative products such as interest and foreign exchange\nrate contracts and commodity contracts, that was\noutstanding on the date we executed the Subordinated\nIndenture, or was created, incurred, or assumed after\nthat date, for which we are 31\n\nresponsible or liable as obligor, guarantor, or\notherwise, and all deferrals, renewals, extensions, and\nrefundings of that indebtedness or obligations, other\nthan the debt securities issued under the Subordinated\nIndenture or any other indebtedness that by its terms is\nsubordinate in right of payment to any of our other\nindebtedness. Each supplement for a series of\nsubordinated debt securities will indicate the aggregate\namount of our senior indebtedness outstanding, as of the\nmost recent practicable date, and any limitation on the\nissuance of additional senior indebtedness. As of March\n31, 2021, on a non-consolidatedbasis, we had\napproximately $198 billion of senior long-term debt and\ncertain senior short-term borrowings. Senior indebtedness\nalso includes our obligations under letters of credit,\nguarantees, foreign exchange contracts and interest rate\nswap contracts, none of which are included in such\namount. In addition, holders of subordinated debt\nsecurities may be fully subordinated to interests held by\nthe U.S. government in the event that we enter into a\nreceivership, insolvency, liquidation or similar\nproceeding. If there is a default or event of default\nunder any senior indebtedness that would allow\nacceleration of maturity of that senior indebtedness and\nthat default or event of default is not remedied, and we\nand the trustee of the Subordinated Indenture receive\nnotice of this default from the holders of at least 10%\nin principal amount of any kind or category of any senior\nindebtedness or if the trustee of the Subordinated\nIndenture receives notice from us, then we will not be\nable to make any principal, premium, interest, or other\npayments on the subordinated debt securities or\nrepurchase our subordinated debt securities. If any\nsubordinated debt security is declared due and payable\nbefore the stated maturity (or other date for payment of\nprincipal) upon a payment or distribution of our assets\nto creditors pursuant to our dissolution, winding up,\nliquidation, or reorganization, whether voluntary or\ninvoluntary, we are required to pay all principal and any\npremium, interest, or other payments to holders of senior\nindebtedness before any holders of subordinated debt are\npaid. In addition, if any amounts previously were paid to\nthe holders of subordinated debt or the trustee under the\nSubordinated Indenture, the holders of senior\nindebtedness will have first rights to the amounts\npreviously paid. Subject to the payment in full of all\nour senior indebtedness, the holders of our subordinated\ndebt securities will be subrogated to the rights of the\nholders of our senior indebtedness to receive payments or\ndistributions of our assets applicable to the senior\nindebtedness until our subordinated debt securities are\npaid in full. For purposes of this subrogation, the\nsubordinated debt securities will be subrogated equally\nand ratably with all our other indebtedness that by its\nterms ranks equally with our subordinated debt securities\nand is entitled to like rights of subrogation. Due to\ndiffering subordination provisions in various series of\nsubordinated debt securities issued by us and our\npredecessors, in the event of a dissolution, winding up,\nliquidation, reorganization, insolvency, receivership or\nother proceeding, holders of subordinated debt securities\nmay receive more or less, ratably, than holders of some\nother series of our outstanding subordinated debt\nsecurities. Sale or Issuance of Capital Stock of Banks\nThe Senior Indenture prohibits the issuance, sale, or\nother disposition of capital stock, or securities\nconvertible into or options, warrants, or rights to\nacquire capital stock, of any Principal Subsidiary Bank\n(as defined below) or of any subsidiary which owns shares\nof capital stock, or securities convertible into or\noptions, warrants, or rights to acquire capital stock, of\nany Principal Subsidiary Bank, with the following\nexceptions:\n                                                         \n      sales or other dispositions of directors\u0092           \n      qualifying shares;                                 \n                                                         \n32\n                                                         \n      sales or other dispositions for fair market        \n      value, if, after giving effect to the disposition  \n      and to conversion of any shares or securities      \n      convertible                                        \n      into capital stock of a Principal Subsidiary       \n      Bank, we would own at least 80% of each class of   \n      the capital stock of that Principal Subsidiary     \n      Bank;                                              \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      sales or other dispositions made in compliance     \n      with an order of a court or regulatory authority   \n      of competent jurisdiction;                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      any sale by a Principal Subsidiary Bank of         \n      additional shares of its capital stock,            \n      securities convertible into shares of its capital  \n      stock, or options,                                 \n      warrants, or rights to subscribe for or purchase   \n      shares of its capital stock, to its stockholders   \n      at any price, so long as before that sale we       \n      owned, directly or indirectly, securities of the   \n      same class and immediately after the sale, we      \n      owned,                                             \n      directly or indirectly, at least as great a        \n      percentage of each class of securities of the      \n      Principal Subsidiary Bank as we owned before the   \n      sale of additional securities;\u00a0and                 \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      any issuance of shares of capital stock, or        \n      securities convertible into or options, warrants,  \n      or rights to subscribe for or purchase shares of   \n      capital                                            \n      stock, of a Principal Subsidiary Bank or any       \n      subsidiary which owns shares of capital stock, or  \n      securities convertible into or options, warrants,  \n      or rights to acquire capital stock, of any         \n      Principal Subsidiary Bank, to us or our wholly     \n      owned                                              \n      subsidiary.                                        \n                                                         \nA \u0093Principal Subsidiary Bank\u0094 is defined in the Senior\nIndenture as any subsidiary bank with total assets equal\nto more than 10% of our total consolidated assets. As of\nthe date of this prospectus, Bank of America, N.A. is our\nonly Principal Subsidiary Bank. Limitation on Mergers and\nSales of Assets Each indenture generally permits a\nconsolidation or merger between us and another entity,\nsubject to certain requirements. It also permits the\nsale, conveyance or transfer by us of all or\nsubstantially all of our assets, subject to certain\nrequirements. These transactions are permitted if:\n                                                         \n      the resulting or acquiring entity, if other than   \n      us, is organized and existing under the laws of    \n      the United States, any state of the United States  \n      or                                                 \n      the District of Columbia and expressly assumes     \n      all of our obligations under that indenture; and   \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      immediately after the transaction, we (or any      \n      successor entity) are not in default in the        \n      performance of any covenant or condition under     \n      that                                               \n      indenture.                                         \n                                                         \nThe foregoing requirements do not apply in the case of a\nsale, conveyance or transfer by us of all or\nsubstantially all of our assets to one or more entities\nthat are direct or indirect subsidiaries in which we\nand/or one or more of our subsidiaries own more than 50%\nof the combined voting power. Upon any consolidation,\nmerger, sale, conveyance or transfer of this kind (other\nthan, where permitted as described above, a sale,\nconveyance or transfer of all or substantially all of our\nassets to our direct or indirect subsidiary or\nsubsidiaries in which we own more than 50% of the\ncombined voting power as described in the preceding\nparagraph), the resulting or acquiring entity will be\nsubstituted for us in the applicable indenture with the\nsame effect as if it had been an original party to that\nindenture. As a result, the successor entity may exercise\nour rights and powers under that indenture. 33\n\nWaiver of Covenants The holders of a majority in\nprincipal amount of the debt securities of all affected\nseries then outstanding under an indenture may waive\ncompliance with some of the covenants or conditions of\nthat indenture. Modification of the Indentures We and the\ntrustee may modify the applicable indenture and the\nrights of the holders of the debt securities with the\nconsent of the holders of at least 50% of the aggregate\nprincipal amount of all series of outstanding debt\nsecurities under that indenture affected by the\nmodification. No modification may extend the fixed\nmaturity of, reduce the principal amount or redemption\npremium of, or reduce the rate of interest, or extend the\ntime of payment of interest or other amounts due on, any\ndebt security without the consent of each holder affected\nby the modification. No modification may reduce the\npercentage of debt securities that is required to consent\nto modification of an indenture without the consent of\nall holders of the debt securities outstanding under that\nindenture. In addition, we and the trustee may execute\nsupplemental indentures in some circumstances without the\nconsent of any holders of outstanding debt securities.\nFor purposes of determining the aggregate principal\namount of the debt securities outstanding at any time in\nconnection with any request, demand, authorization,\ndirection, notice, consent, or waiver under the\napplicable indenture, (1) the principal amount of any\ndebt security issued with original issue discount is that\namount of principal that would be due and payable at that\ntime upon a declaration of acceleration of the maturity\nof the original issue discount note, and (2) the\nprincipal amount of a debt security denominated in a\nforeign currency or currency unit is the U.S. dollar\nequivalent on the date of original issuance of the debt\nsecurity, determined as specified in the applicable\nsupplement for that debt security. Meetings and Action by\nSecurityholders The trustee may call a meeting in its\ndiscretion, or upon request by us or the holders of at\nleast 10% in principal amount of a series of outstanding\ndebt securities, by giving notice. If a meeting of\nholders is duly held, any resolution raised or decision\ntaken in accordance with the indenture will be binding on\nall holders of debt securities of that series. Events of\nDefault and Rights of Acceleration; Covenant Breaches The\nSenior Indenture defines an event of default for a series\nof senior debt securities as any one of the following\nevents:\n                                                         \n      our failure to pay principal of or any premium on  \n      any senior debt securities of that series when     \n      due and payable, and continuance of such default   \n      for a                                              \n      period of 30 days;                                 \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      our failure to pay interest on any senior debt     \n      securities of that series when due and payable,    \n      and continuance of such default for a period of    \n      30 days;                                           \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      specified events involving our bankruptcy,         \n      insolvency, or liquidation; and                    \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      any other events of default specified for a        \n      series of senior debt securities pursuant to the   \n      Senior Indenture.                                  \n                                                         \n34\n\nAny additional or different events of default for a\nseries of senior debt securities will be specified in the\napplicable supplement.\n\nThe Subordinated Indenture defines an event of default\nfor subordinated debt securities only as our voluntary or\ninvoluntary bankruptcy under U.S. federal bankruptcy laws\n(and, in the case of our involuntary bankruptcy,\ncontinuing for a period of 60 days) and any other events\nof default specified for a series of subordinated debt\nsecurities pursuant to the Subordinated Indenture.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable supplement,\nif an event of default under an indenture occurs and is\ncontinuing, either the trustee or the holders of 25% in\naggregate principal amount of the debt securities\noutstanding under the applicable indenture (or, in the\ncase of an event of default with respect to a series of\nsenior debt securities under the Senior Indenture, the\nholders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of the\noutstanding senior debt securities of all series\naffected) may declare the principal amount, or, if the\ndebt securities are issued with original issue discount,\nsuch amount as described in the applicable supplement, of\nall debt securities (or the outstanding senior debt\nsecurities of all series affected, as the case may be) to\nbe due and payable immediately. The holders of a majority\nin aggregate principal amount of the debt securities then\noutstanding (or of all series affected, as the case may\nbe), in some circumstances, may annul the declaration of\nacceleration and waive past defaults.\n\nWith respect to a failure on our part to observe or\nperform any of the covenants or agreements contained in\nthe debt securities or in the applicable indenture (other\nthan (i) with respect to senior debt securities, those\nfor which acceleration rights are available as discussed\nabove and (ii) with respect to subordinated debt\nsecurities, default in payment of principal or interest),\nwhich failure continues for a period of 90 days after the\ndate on which written notice of such failure is given (a\n\u0093covenant breach\u0094), the trustee and the holders of the\ndebt securities may pursue certain remedies as described\nbelow or as set forth in the applicable indenture.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable supplement,\nan event of default will not occur under our senior debt\nsecurities, and neither the trustee nor the holders of\nany senior debt securities will have the right to\naccelerate the payment of principal of such senior debt\nsecurities, as a result of a covenant breach. In\naddition, an event of default will not occur, and neither\nthe trustee nor the holders of such senior debt\nsecurities will have the right to accelerate the payment\nof principal of such senior debt securities, as a result\nof our failure to pay principal of or premium on such\nsenior debt securities when due and payable until such\ndefault has continued for a period of 30 days.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable supplement,\npayment of principal of the subordinated debt securities\nmay not be accelerated in the case of a default in the\npayment of principal or any premium, interest, or other\namounts or a breach in the performance of any of our\nother covenants.\n\nWe are required periodically to file with the trustees a\ncertificate stating that we are not in default under any\nof the terms of the indentures.\n\nCollection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by\nTrustee\n\nIf (i) we fail to pay the principal of or any premium on\nany debt securities or (ii) we are over 30 calendar days\nlate on an interest payment on the debt securities, the\napplicable trustee can demand that we pay to it, for the\nbenefit of the holders of those debt securities, the\namount which is due and payable on those debt securities,\nincluding any interest incurred because of our failure to\nmake that payment. In the event of our nonpayment of\nprincipal, interest or any premium (which nonpayment for\nsenior debt securities constitutes an event of default)\nor a covenant breach, the trustee may take appropriate\naction, including instituting judicial proceedings\nagainst us.\n\n35\n\nIn addition, a holder of our debt securities also may\nfile suit to enforce our obligation to make payment of\nprincipal and any premium, interest, or other amounts\npayable on such debt securities regardless of the actions\ntaken by the trustee. The holders of a majority in\nprincipal amount of each series of the debt securities\nthen outstanding under an indenture may direct the time,\nmethod, and place of conducting any proceeding for any\nremedy available to the trustee under that indenture. The\ntrustee may decline to act if the direction is contrary\nto law and in certain other circumstances set forth in\nthe applicable indenture. The trustee is not obligated to\nexercise any of its rights or powers under the applicable\nindenture at the request or direction of the holders of\nthe debt securities unless the holders offer the trustee\nreasonable indemnity against expenses and liabilities.\nLimitation on Suits Each indenture provides that no\nindividual holder of debt securities of any series may\ninstitute any action against us under that indenture,\nexcept actions for payment of overdue principal and\ninterest, unless the following actions have occurred:\n                                                         \n      the holder must have previously given written      \n      notice to the trustee of a continuing event of     \n      default or covenant breach;                        \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      the holders of not less than 25% in principal      \n      amount of such outstanding debt securities issued  \n      under the applicable indenture must have           \n      (1)\u00a0requested the trustee to institute             \n      proceedings in respect of such event of default    \n      or covenant breach and (2)\u00a0offered the trustee     \n      indemnity against liabilities incurred by the      \n      trustee for taking such action, which indemnity    \n      is                                                 \n      reasonably satisfactory to the trustee;            \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      the trustee must have failed to institute          \n      proceedings within 60 days after receipt of the    \n      request referred to above; and                     \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      the holders of a majority in principal amount of   \n      such outstanding debt securities issued under the  \n      applicable indenture must not have given           \n      direction                                          \n      to the trustee inconsistent with the request of    \n      the holders referred to above.                     \n                                                         \nHowever, the holder of any senior debt securities will\nhave an absolute right to receive payment of principal of\nand any premium and interest on the senior debt security\nwhen due and to institute suit to enforce this payment,\nand the holder of any subordinated debt securities will\nhave, subject to applicable subordination provisions, the\nabsolute right to receive payment of principal of and any\npremium and any interest on the subordinated debt\nsecurity when due and to institute suit to enforce this\npayment. Payment of Additional Amounts If we so specify\nin the applicable supplement, and subject to the\nexceptions and limitations set forth below, we will pay\nto the holder of any debt security that is a \u0093non-U.S.\nperson\u0094additional amounts to ensure that every net\npayment on that debt security will not be less, due to\nthe payment of U.S. withholding tax, than the amount then\notherwise due and payable.

For purposes of determining whether the\npayment of additional amounts is required, the term \u0093U.S.\nperson\u0094 means any individual who is a citizen or resident\nof the United States; any corporation, partnership, or\nother entity created or organized in or under the laws of\nthe United States; any estate if the income of such\nestate falls within the federal income tax jurisdiction\nof the United States regardless of the source of that\nincome; and any trust if a U.S. court is able to exercise\nprimary supervision over its administration and one or\nmore U.S. persons have the 39\n\nauthority to control all of the substantial decisions of\nthe trust. Additionally, for this purpose,\n\u0093non-U.S.person\u0094 means a person who is not a U.S. person,\nand \u0093United States\u0094 means the United States of America,\nincluding each state of the United States and the\nDistrict of Columbia, its territories, its possessions,\nand other areas within its jurisdiction. Redemption for\nTax Reasons If we so specify in the applicable\nsupplement, we may redeem the debt securities in whole,\nbut not in part, at any time before maturity, if we have\nor will become obligated to pay additional amounts, as\ndescribed above under \u0093\u0097Payment of Additional Amounts,\u0094\nas a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws\nor regulations of the United States or any political\nsubdivision or any authority of the United States having\npower to tax, or any change in the application or\nofficial interpretation of such laws or regulations,\nwhich change or amendment becomes effective on or after\nthe date of the applicable supplement for the issuance of\nthose debt securities. If we exercise such right to\nredeem the debt securities, unless we specify otherwise\nin the applicable supplement, we will give not less than\n5 business days\u0092 nor more than 60 calendar days\u0092 notice\nto the trustee under the applicable indenture and to the\nholders of the debt securities. In connection with any\nnotice of redemption for tax reasons, we will deliver to\nthe trustee under the indenture any required certificate,\nrequest, or order. Unless we specify otherwise in the\napplicable supplement, any debt securities redeemed for\ntax reasons will be redeemed at a redemption price equal\nto 100% of the principal amount of such debt securities,\nplus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to,\nbut excluding, the date fixed for redemption. Defeasance\nand Covenant Defeasance If we so specify in the\napplicable supplement, the provisions for full defeasance\nand covenant defeasance described below will apply to the\ndebt securities of a series if certain conditions are\nsatisfied. Full Defeasance. If there is a change in the\nU.S. federal income tax law, as described below, we can\nlegally release ourselves from all payment and other\nobligations on the debt securities of a series. This is\ncalled full defeasance. For us to do so, each of the\nfollowing must occur:\n                                                         \n      We must deposit in trust with the trustee for the  \n      benefit of the holders of those debt securities a  \n      combination of money and U.S.\u00a0government or        \n      U.S.\u00a0government agency notes or bonds that will    \n      generate enough cash to make interest, principal,  \n      and any other payments on those debt securities    \n      when due;                                          \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      There must be a change in current U.S.\u00a0federal     \n      income tax law or an Internal Revenue Service      \n      ruling that lets us make the above deposit         \n      without                                            \n      causing the beneficial owners to be taxed on       \n      those debt securities any differently than if we   \n      did not make the deposit and repaid those debt     \n      securities ourselves. Under current U.S.\u00a0federal   \n      income tax law, the deposit, and our legal         \n      release                                            \n      from your debt security, would be treated as       \n      though we took back your debt security and gave    \n      you your share of the cash and notes or bonds      \n      deposited in trust. In that event, you could       \n      recognize gain or loss on your debt security;\u00a0and  \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      We must deliver to the trustee under the           \n      indenture a legal opinion of our counsel           \n      confirming the tax law treatment described above.  \n                                                         \n40\n\nIf we ever fully defeased your debt security, you would\nhave to rely solely on the trust deposit for payments on\nyour debt security. Covenant Defeasance. Under current\nU.S. federal income tax law, we can make the same type of\ndeposit described above and be released from restrictive\ncovenants relating to your debt security. This is called\ncovenant defeasance. In that event, you would lose the\nprotection of those restrictive covenants. In order to\nachieve covenant defeasance for a series of debt\nsecurities, we must do both of the following:\n                                                         \n      We must deposit in trust with the trustee for the  \n      benefit of the holders of those debt securities a  \n      combination of money and U.S. government or U.S.   \n      government agency notes or bonds that will         \n      generate enough cash to make interest, principal,  \n      and any other payments on those debt securities    \n      on their due dates;\u00a0and                            \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      We must deliver to the trustee under the           \n      indenture a legal opinion of our counsel           \n      confirming that under current U.S. federal income  \n      tax law we may make                                \n      the above deposit without causing the beneficial   \n      owners to be taxed on those debt securities any    \n      differently than if we did not make the deposit    \n      and repaid the debt securities ourselves.          \n                                                         \nIf we achieve covenant defeasance with respect to your\ndebt security, you can still look to us for repayment of\nyour debt security in the event of any shortfall in the\ntrust deposit. You should note, however, that if one of\nthe remaining events of default occurred, such as our\nbankruptcy, and your debt security became immediately due\nand payable, there may be a shortfall. Depending on the\nevent causing the default, you may not be able to obtain\npayment of the shortfall. Satisfaction and Discharge of\nthe Indenture The indenture under which a series of debt\nsecurities has been issued will cease to be of further\neffect with respect to the debt securities of such\nseries, if at any time:\n                                                         \n      We have delivered to the trustee for cancellation  \n      all debt securities of such series; or             \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      All debt securities of such series not delivered   \n      to the trustee for cancellation have become due    \n      and payable, or will become due and payable        \n      within one                                         \n      year, or are to be called for redemption within    \n      one year under arrangements satisfactory to the    \n      trustee for the giving of notice of redemption,    \n      and we have irrevocably deposited with the         \n      trustee or the applicable paying agent as trust    \n      funds for the                                      \n      entire amount in cash due with respect to such     \n      debt securities on or after the date of such       \n      deposit, including at maturity or upon redemption  \n      of all such debt securities, including principal   \n      and any premium, interest and other amounts        \n      payable, and                                       \n      any mandatory sinking fund payments, on the dates  \n      on which such payments are due and payable.        \n                                                         \nThe trustee, on our demand, accompanied by an officer\u0092s\ncertificate of ours and an opinion of counsel and at our\ncost and expense, will execute proper instruments\nacknowledging such satisfaction of and discharging the\napplicable indenture with respect to such debt\nsecurities. Notices We or the trustee on our behalf, if\nso requested, will provide the holders with any required\nnotices by first-class mail to the addresses of the\nholders as they appear in the security register. So long\nas a depository is the record holder of a series of debt\nsecurities with respect to which a notice is given, we or\nthe trustee, if so requested, will deliver the notice\nonly to that depository in accordance with the procedures\nof that depository then in place. 41\n\nConcerning the Trustee\n\nWe and certain of our affiliates have from time to time\nmaintained deposit accounts and conducted other banking\ntransactions with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust\nCompany, N.A. and its affiliates in the ordinary course\nof business. We expect to continue these business\ntransactions. The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company,\nN.A. is initially serving as the trustee for the debt\nsecurities issued under the Senior Indenture and the\nSubordinated Indenture. The Bank of New York Mellon Trust\nCompany, N.A. and its affiliates also serve as trustee\nfor a number of series of outstanding indebtedness of us\nand our affiliates under other indentures. Consequently,\nif an actual or potential event of default occurs with\nrespect to any of these securities, the trustee may be\nconsidered to have a conflicting interest for purposes of\nthe Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. In that\ncase, the trustee may be required to resign under one or\nmore of the indentures, and we would be required to\nappoint a successor trustee. For this purpose, a\n\u0093potential\u0094 event of default means an event that would be\nan event of default if the requirements for giving us\ndefault notice or for the default having to exist for a\nspecific period of time were disregarded. In addition,\nthe trustee can resign for any reason by giving at least\n30 calendar days\u0092 written notice of resignation, and we\nwould be required to appoint a successor trustee. The\ntrustee will remain the trustee under the applicable\nindenture until a successor is appointed.\n\nGoverning Law\n\nThe indentures are and the debt securities will be\ngoverned by New York law.\n\n42\n\nDESCRIPTION OF WARRANTS General The warrants are options\nthat are securities within the meaning of Section\n2(a)(17) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We\nmay issue warrants, including securities warrants, index\nwarrants and currency warrants. We may offer warrants\nseparately or as part of a unit, as described below under\nthe heading \u0093Description of Units.\u0094 If we issue warrants\nas part of a unit, the applicable supplement will specify\nwhether those warrants may be separated from the other\nsecurities in the unit prior to the warrants\u0092 expiration\ndate. Universal warrants issued in the United States may\nnot be so separated prior to the 91st day after the\nissuance of the unit, unless otherwise specified in the\napplicable supplement. We may issue warrants in any\namounts or in as many distinct series as we determine. We\nwill issue each series of warrants under a separate\nwarrant agreement to be entered into between us and a\nwarrant agent to be designated in the applicable\nsupplement. When we refer to a series of warrants, we\nmean all warrants issued as part of the same series under\nthe applicable warrant agreement. Any warrants that we\nissue will contain, to the extent required, contractual\nprovisions required to comply with the \u0093Restrictions on\nQualified Financial Contracts of Systemically Important\nU.S. Banking Organizations and the U.S. Operations of\nSystemically Important Foreign Banking Organizations;\nRevisions to the Definition of Qualifying Master Netting\nAgreement and Related Definitions\u0094 as issued by the\nFederal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency and other applicable law. This section describes\nsome of the general terms and provisions of warrants. We\nwill describe the specific terms of a series of warrants\nand the applicable warrant agreement in the applicable\nsupplement. The following description and any description\nof the warrants in the applicable supplement may not be\ncomplete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety\nby reference to the terms and provisions of the\napplicable warrant agreement. A warrant agreement\nreflecting the particular terms and provisions of a\nseries of offered warrants will be filed with the SEC in\nconnection with the offering and incorporated by\nreference in the registration statement and this\nprospectus.

We refer to this type of warrant as\nan \u0093index warrant.\u0094 Description of Currency Warrants We\nmay also issue warrants entitling the holders thereof to\nreceive from us, upon exercise, an amount in cash\ndetermined by reference to decreases or increases in the\nprice or level (or relative price, level or exchange\nrate) of specified amounts of one or more currencies or\ncurrency units, providedthat these warrants will be\nlisted on a national securities exchange. We refer to\nthis type of warrant as a \u0093currency warrant.\u0094 44\n\nModification\n\nWe and the warrant agent may amend the terms of any\nwarrant agreement and the warrants without the consent of\nthe holders of the warrants to cure any ambiguity, to\ncorrect any inconsistent provision, or in any other\nmanner we deem necessary or desirable and which will not\naffect adversely the interests of the holders. In\naddition, we may amend the warrant agreement and the\nterms of the warrants with the consent of the holders of\na majority of the outstanding unexercised warrants\naffected. However, any modification to the warrants\ncannot change the exercise price, reduce the amounts\nreceivable upon exercise, cancellation, or expiration,\nshorten the time period during which the warrants may be\nexercised, or otherwise materially and adversely affect\nthe rights of the holders of the warrants or reduce the\npercentage of outstanding warrants required to modify or\namend the warrant agreement or the terms of the warrants,\nwithout the consent of the affected holders.\n\nEnforceability of Rights of Warrantholders; No Trust\nIndenture Act Protection\n\nThe warrant agent will act solely as our agent and will\nnot assume any obligation or relationship of agency or\ntrust with the holders of the warrants. Any record holder\nor beneficial owner of a warrant, without anyone else\u0092s\nconsent, may enforce by appropriate legal action, on his\nor her own behalf, his or her right to exercise the\nwarrant in accordance with its terms. A holder of a\nwarrant will not be entitled to any of the rights of a\nholder of the debt securities or other securities or\nwarrant property purchasable upon the exercise of the\nwarrant, including any right to receive payments on those\nsecurities or warrant property or to enforce any\ncovenants or rights in the relevant indenture or any\nother agreement, before exercising the warrant.\n\nNo warrant agreement will be qualified as an indenture,\nand no warrant agent under any warrant agreement will be\nrequired to qualify as a trustee, under the Trust\nIndenture Act of 1939. Therefore, holders of warrants\nissued under a warrant agreement will not have the\nprotection of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 with\nrespect to their warrants.\n\n45\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PURCHASE CONTRACTS General We may issue\npurchase contracts in any amounts and in as many distinct\nseries as we determine.

Applicability of Indenture\nPurchase contracts may require holders to satisfy their\nobligations under the purchase contracts at the time they\nare issued. We refer to these contracts as \u0093prepaid\npurchase contracts.\u0094 47\n\nIn certain circumstances, our obligation to settle a\nprepaid purchase contract on the relevant settlement date\nmay constitute our senior debt securities or our\nsubordinated debt securities. Accordingly, prepaid\npurchase contracts may be issued under the indentures,\nwhich are described above under the heading \u0093Description\nof Debt Securities.\u0094 Non-PrepaidPurchase Contracts; No\nTrust Indenture Act Protection Some purchase contracts do\nnot require holders to satisfy their obligations under\nthe purchase contracts until settlement. We refer to\nthese contracts as \u0093non-prepaidpurchase contracts.\u0094 The\nholder of a non-prepaidpurchase contract may remain\nobligated to perform under the contract for a substantial\nperiod of time. Non-prepaidpurchase contracts will be\nissued under a unit agreement, if they are issued in\nunits, or under some other document, if they are not. We\ndescribe unit agreements generally under the heading\n\u0093Description of Units\u0094 below. We will describe the\nparticular governing document that applies to your non-\nprepaidpurchase contracts in the applicable supplement.\nNon-prepaidpurchase contracts will not be our senior debt\nsecurities or subordinated debt securities and will not\nbe issued under one of our indentures, unless we specify\notherwise in the applicable supplement. Consequently, no\ngoverning documents for non-prepaidpurchase contracts\nwill be qualified as indentures, and no third party will\nbe required to qualify as a trustee with regard to those\ncontracts, under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.\nTherefore, holders of non-prepaidpurchase contracts will\nnot have the protection of the Trust Indenture Act of\n1939. Pledge by Holders to Secure Performance If we so\nspecify in the applicable supplement, the holder\u0092s\nobligations under the purchase contract and governing\ndocument will be secured by collateral. In that case, the\nholder, acting through the unit agent as its attorney-in-\nfact,if applicable, will pledge the items described below\nto a collateral agent that we will identify in the\napplicable supplement, which will hold them, for our\nbenefit, as collateral to secure the holder\u0092s\nobligations. We refer to this as the \u0093pledge\u0094 and all the\nitems described below as the \u0093pledged items.\u0094 Unless we\nspecify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the\npledge will create a security interest in the holder\u0092s\nentire interest in and to:\n                                                         \n      any other securities included in the unit, if the  \n      purchase contract is part of a unit, and/or any    \n      other property specified in the applicable         \n      supplement;                                        \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      all additions to and substitutions for the         \n      pledged items;                                     \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      all income, proceeds, and collections received in  \n      respect of the pledged items;\u00a0and                  \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      all powers and rights owned or acquired later      \n      with respect to the pledged items.                 \n                                                         \nThe collateral agent will forward all payments and\nproceeds from the pledged items to us, unless the\npayments and proceeds have been released from the pledge\nin accordance with the purchase contract and the\ngoverning document. We will use the payments and proceeds\nfrom the pledged items to satisfy the holder\u0092s\nobligations under the purchase contract. Settlement of\nPurchase Contracts that Are Part of Units Unless we\nspecify otherwise in the applicable supplement, where\npurchase contracts issued together with debt securities\nas part of a unit require the holders to buy purchase\ncontract 48\n\nproperty, the unit agent may apply principal payments\nfrom the debt securities in satisfaction of the holders\u0092\nobligations under the related purchase contract as\nspecified in the applicable supplement. The unit agent\nwill not so apply the principal payments if the holder\nhas delivered cash to meet its obligations under the\npurchase contract. If the holder is permitted to settle\nits obligations by cash payment, the holder may be\npermitted to do so by delivering the debt securities in\nthe unit to the unit agent as provided in the governing\ndocument. If the holder settles its obligations in cash\nrather than by delivering the debt security that is part\nof the unit, that debt security will remain outstanding,\nif the maturity extends beyond the relevant settlement\ndate and, as more fully described in the applicable\nsupplement, the holder will receive that debt security or\nan interest in the relevant global debt security.\n\nBook-entry and other indirect owners should consult their\nbanks or brokers for information on how to settle their\npurchase contracts.\n\nFailure of Holder to Perform Obligations\n\nIf the holder fails to settle its obligations under a\nnon-prepaidpurchase contract as required, the holder will\nnot receive the purchase contract property or other\nconsideration to be delivered at settlement. Holders that\nfail to make timely settlement also may be obligated to\npay interest or other amounts.\n\n49\n\nDESCRIPTION OF UNITS General We may issue units from time\nto time in such amounts and in as many distinct series as\nwe determine. We will issue each series of units under a\nunit agreement to be entered into between us and a unit\nagent to be designated in the applicable supplement. When\nwe refer to a series of units, we mean all units issued\nas part of the same series under the applicable unit\nagreement. Any units that we issue will contain, to the\nextent required, contractual provisions required to\ncomply with the \u0093Restrictions on Qualified Financial\nContracts of Systemically Important U.S. Banking\nOrganizations and the U.S. Operations of Systemically\nImportant Foreign Banking Organizations; Revisions to the\nDefinition of Qualifying Master Netting Agreement and\nRelated Definitions\u0094 as issued by the Federal Reserve,\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office\nof the Comptroller of the Currency and other applicable\nlaw. This section describes some of the general terms and\nprovisions applicable to all the units. We will describe\nthe specific terms of a series of units and the\napplicable unit agreement in the applicable supplement.\nThe following description and any description of the\nunits in the applicable supplement may not be complete\nand is subject to and qualified in its entirety by\nreference to the terms and provisions of the applicable\nunit agreement. A unit agreement reflecting the\nparticular terms and provisions of a series of offered\nunits will be filed with the SEC in connection with the\noffering and incorporated by reference in the\nregistration statement and this prospectus. See \u0093Where\nYou Can Find More Information\u0094 below for information on\nhow to obtain copies of any unit agreements. We may issue\nunits consisting of one or more securities described in\nthis prospectus or, in any combination. Each unit will be\nissued so that the holder of the unit is also the holder\nof each security included in the unit. Thus, the holder\nof a unit will have the rights and obligations of a\nholder of each included security. The unit agreement\nunder which a unit is issued may provide that the\nsecurities included in the unit may not be held or\ntransferred separately, at any time or at any time before\na specified date. If units are offered, the applicable\nsupplement will describe the terms of the units,\nincluding the following:\n                                                         \n      the designation and aggregate number of, and the   \n      price at which we will issue, the units;           \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      the terms of the units and of the securities       \n      comprising the units, including whether and under  \n      what circumstances the securities comprising the   \n      units                                              \n      may or may not be held or transferred separately;  \n                                                         \n                                   \n      the name of the unit agent;  \n                                   \n                                                         \n      a description of the terms of any unit agreement   \n      to be entered into between us and a bank or trust  \n      company, as unit agent, governing the units;       \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      if applicable, a discussion of the U.S.\u00a0federal    \n      income tax consequences;                           \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      whether the units will be listed on any            \n      securities exchange;\u00a0and                           \n                                                         \n50\n                                                         \n      a description of the provisions for the payment,   \n      settlement, transfer, or exchange of the units.    \n                                                         \nUnit Agreements: Prepaid, Non-Prepaid,and Other If a unit\nincludes one or more purchase contracts, and all those\npurchase contracts are prepaid purchase contracts, we\nwill issue the unit under a \u0093prepaid unit agreement.\u0094\nPrepaid unit agreements will reflect the fact that the\nholders of the related units have no further obligations\nunder the purchase contracts included in their units. If\na unit includes one or more non-prepaidpurchase\ncontracts, we will issue the unit under a \u0093non-\nprepaidunit agreement.\u0094 Non-prepaidunit agreements will\nreflect the fact that the holders have payment or other\nobligations under one or more of the purchase contracts\ncomprising their units. We may also issue units under\nother kinds of unit agreements, which will be described\nin the applicable supplement, if applicable. Each holder\nof units issued under a non-prepaidunit agreement will:\n                                                         \n      be bound by the terms of each non-prepaid          \n      purchase contract included in the holder\u0092s units    \n      and by the                                         \n      terms of the unit agreement with respect to those  \n      contracts;\u00a0and                                     \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      appoint the unit agent as its authorized agent to  \n      execute, deliver, and perform on the holder\u0092s       \n      behalf each                                        \n      non-prepaid purchase contract included in the      \n      holder\u0092s units.                                     \n                                                         \nAny unit agreement for a unit that includes a non-\nprepaidpurchase contract also will include provisions\nregarding the holder\u0092s pledge of collateral and special\nsettlement provisions. These are described above under\nthe heading \u0093Description of Purchase Contracts.\u0094 A unit\nagreement also may serve as the governing document for a\nsecurity included in a unit. For example, a non-\nprepaidpurchase contract that is part of a unit may be\nissued under and governed by the relevant unit agreement.\nModification We and the unit agent may amend the terms of\nany unit agreement and the units without the consent of\nthe holders to cure any ambiguity, to correct any\ninconsistent provision, or in any other manner we deem\nnecessary or desirable and which will not affect\nadversely the interests of the holders. In addition, we\nmay amend the unit agreement and the terms of the units\nwith the consent of the holders of a majority of the\noutstanding unexpired units affected. However, any\nmodification to the units that materially and adversely\naffects the rights of the holders of the units, or\nreduces the percentage of outstanding units required to\nmodify or amend the unit agreement or the terms of the\nunits, requires the consent of the affected holders.\nEnforceability of Rights of Unitholders; No Trust\nIndenture Act Protection The unit agent will act solely\nas our agent and will not assume any obligation or\nrelationship of agency or trust with the holders of the\nunits. Except as described below, any record holder of a\nunit, without anyone else\u0092s consent, may enforce his or\nher rights as holder under any security included in the\nunit, in accordance with the terms of the included\nsecurity and the indenture, warrant agreement, unit\nagreement, or purchase contract under which that security\nis issued. We describe these terms in other sections of\nthis prospectus relating to debt securities, warrants,\nand purchase contracts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a\nunit agreement may limit or otherwise affect the ability\nof a holder of units issued under that agreement to\nenforce his or her rights, including any right to 51\n\nbring legal action, with respect to those units or any\nincluded securities, other than debt securities. We will\ndescribe any limitations of this kind in the applicable\nsupplement.\n\nNo unit agreement will be qualified as an indenture, and\nno unit agent will be required to qualify as a trustee\nunder the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. Therefore, holders\nof units issued under a unit agreement will not have the\nprotection of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 with\nrespect to their units.\n\n52\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED STOCK General We may issue\npreferred stock in one or more series, each with the\npreferences, designations, limitations, conversion\nrights, and other rights as we may determine.

Unless we specify otherwise\nin the applicable supplement, whenever dividends on any\nnon-votingpreferred stock are in arrears for three or\nmore semi-annual dividend periods or six quarterly\ndividend periods, as applicable (whether or not\nconsecutive), holders of the non-votingpreferred stock\nwill have the right to elect two additional directors to\nserve on our board of directors, and these two additional\ndirectors will continue to serve until full dividends on\nsuch non-votingpreferred stock have been paid regularly\nfor at least two semi-annual or four quarterly dividend\nperiods.

We will deposit shares of\npreferred stock of each series represented by depositary\nshares under a deposit agreement between us and a U.S.\nbank or trust company that we will select (the\n\u0093depository\u0094).\n\nThis section describes some of the general terms and\nprovisions applicable to all depositary shares. We will\ndescribe the specific terms of a series of depositary\nshares and the applicable deposit agreement in the\napplicable supplement. A form of deposit agreement,\nincluding a form of depositary receipt, will be filed as\nan exhibit to the registration statement of which this\nprospectus forms a part. See \u0093Where You Can Find More\nInformation\u0094 below for information on how to obtain\ncopies of any deposit agreements and depositary receipts\nthat we may file with the SEC in connection with\ndepositary shares that we may offer.\n\nForm of the Depositary Shares\n\nThe depositary shares will be evidenced by depositary\nreceipts issued under a deposit agreement. Subject to the\nterms of the applicable deposit agreement, each holder of\na depositary share will be entitled, in proportion to the\nfractional interest of a share of preferred stock\nrepresented by the applicable depositary share, to all\nthe rights and preferences of the preferred stock being\nrepresented, including dividend, voting, redemption,\nconversion, and liquidation rights, all as will be set\nforth in the applicable supplement relating to the\ndepositary shares being offered. Unless we specify\notherwise in the applicable supplement, we will issue\ndepositary shares in book-entry only form. Depositary\nshares in book-entry only form will be represented by a\nglobal depositary receipt deposited with and held in the\nname of a clearing system or its nominee. Accordingly,\nthe clearing system will be the registered holder of all\nthe depositary shares represented by the global\ndepositary receipt. Those who own beneficial interests in\na global depositary receipt will do so through\nparticipants in that clearing system\u0092s book-entry system,\nand the rights of these indirect owners will be governed\nsolely by the applicable procedures of the clearing\nsystem and its participants. We describe the procedures\napplicable to book-entry only securities below under the\nheading \u0093Registration and Settlement.\u0094 A global\ndepositary receipt shall be exchangeable for definitive\ndepositary receipts only in certain circumstances.\n\nWithdrawal of Preferred Stock\n\nUnless the depositary shares have been called for\nredemption, a holder of depositary shares may surrender\nhis or her depositary receipts at the principal office of\nthe depository, pay any charges, and comply with any\nother terms as provided in the applicable deposit\nagreement for the number of shares of preferred stock\nunderlying the depositary shares. A holder of depositary\nshares who withdraws shares of preferred stock will be\nentitled to receive whole shares of preferred stock on\nthe basis set forth in the applicable supplement relating\nto the depositary shares being offered.\n\nHowever, unless we specify otherwise in the applicable\nsupplement, holders of whole shares of preferred stock\nwill not be entitled to deposit those shares under the\napplicable deposit agreement or to receive depositary\nreceipts for those shares after the withdrawal. If the\ndepositary shares surrendered by the holder in connection\nwith the withdrawal exceed the number of depositary\nshares that represent the number of whole shares of\npreferred stock to be withdrawn, the depository will\ndeliver to the holder at the same time a new depositary\nreceipt evidencing the excess number of depositary\nshares.\n\n89\n\nDividends and Other Distributions\n\nThe depository will distribute all cash dividends or\nother cash distributions received in respect of the\npreferred stock to the record holders of depositary\nshares relating to that preferred stock in proportion to\nthe number of depositary shares owned by those holders.\nHowever, the depository will distribute only the amount\nthat can be distributed without attributing to any holder\nof depositary shares a fraction of one cent. Any balance\nthat is not distributed will be added to and treated as\npart of the next sum received by the depository for\ndistribution to record holders.\n\nIf there is a distribution other than in cash, the\ndepository will distribute property it receives to the\nrecord holders of depositary shares who are entitled to\nthat property. However, if the depository determines that\nit is not feasible to make this distribution of property,\nthe depository, with our approval, may sell that property\nand distribute the net proceeds to the holders of the\ndepositary shares.\n\nRedemption of Depositary Shares\n\nIf a series of preferred stock represented by depositary\nshares is redeemed, the depositary shares will be\nredeemed from the proceeds received by the depository\nfrom the redemption, in whole or in part, of that series\nof preferred stock. Unless we specify otherwise in the\napplicable supplement, the depository will provide notice\nof redemption at least 30 and not more than 60 calendar\ndays before the date fixed for redemption to the record\nholders of the depositary shares to be redeemed. The\nredemption price per depositary share will be equal to\nthe applicable fraction of the redemption price per share\npayable on that series of the preferred stock.\n\nWhenever we redeem preferred stock held by the\ndepository, the depository will redeem as of the same\nredemption date the number of depositary shares\nrepresenting the shares of preferred stock so redeemed.\nIf less than all of the depositary shares are redeemed,\nthe depositary shares redeemed will be selected by lot or\npro rata.\n\nAfter the date fixed for redemption, the depositary\nshares called for redemption will no longer be deemed to\nbe outstanding. At that time, all rights of the holder of\nthe depositary shares will cease, except the right to\nreceive any money or other property they become entitled\nto receive upon surrender to the depository of the\ndepositary receipts.\n\nVoting the Deposited Preferred Stock\n\nAny voting rights of holders of the depositary shares are\ndirectly dependent on the voting rights of the underlying\npreferred stock, which customarily have limited voting\nrights. Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which\nthe holders of the preferred stock held by the depository\nare entitled to vote, the depository will mail the\ninformation contained in the notice of meeting to the\nrecord holders of the depositary shares relating to the\npreferred stock. Each record holder of depositary shares\non the record date, which will be the same date as the\nrecord date for the underlying preferred stock, will be\nentitled to instruct the depository as to the exercise of\nthe voting rights pertaining to the amount of preferred\nstock underlying the holder\u0092s depositary shares. The\ndepository will endeavor, insofar as practicable, to vote\nthe amount of preferred stock underlying the depositary\nshares in accordance with these instructions. We will\nagree to take all action which may be deemed necessary by\nthe depository to enable the depository to do so. The\ndepository will not vote any shares of preferred stock\nexcept to the extent it receives specific instructions\nfrom the holders of depositary shares representing that\nnumber of shares of preferred stock.\n\n90\n\nAmendment and Termination of the Deposit Agreement\n\nThe form of depositary receipt evidencing the depositary\nshares and any provision of the applicable deposit\nagreement may be amended by agreement between us and the\ndepository. However, any amendment which materially and\nadversely alters the rights of the existing holders of\ndepositary shares will not be effective unless the\namendment has been approved by the record holders of at\nleast a majority of the depositary shares then\noutstanding. Either we or the depository may terminate a\ndeposit agreement if all of the outstanding depositary\nshares have been redeemed or if there has been a final\ndistribution in respect of our preferred stock in\nconnection with our liquidation, dissolution, or winding\nup.\n\nCharges of Depository\n\nWe will pay all transfer and other taxes, assessments,\nand governmental charges arising solely from the\nexistence of the depository arrangements. We will pay the\nfees of the depository in connection with the initial\ndeposit of the preferred stock and any redemption of the\npreferred stock. Holders of depositary receipts will pay\ntransfer and other taxes, assessments, and governmental\ncharges and any other charges as are expressly provided\nin the applicable deposit agreement to be for their\naccounts. The depository may refuse to effect any\ntransfer of a depositary receipt or any withdrawals of\npreferred stock evidenced by a depositary receipt until\nall taxes, assessments, and governmental charges with\nrespect to the depositary receipt or preferred stock are\npaid by their holders.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThe depository will forward to the holders of depositary\nshares all of our reports and communications which are\ndelivered to the depository and which we are required to\nfurnish to the holders of our preferred stock.\n\nNeither we nor the depository will be liable if we are\nprevented or delayed by law or any circumstance beyond\nour control in performing our obligations under the\napplicable deposit agreement. All of our obligations as\nwell as the depository\u0092s obligations under the applicable\ndeposit agreement are limited to performance of our\nrespective duties set forth in the applicable deposit\nagreement without gross negligence, willful misconduct or\nbad faith, and neither of us will be obligated to\nprosecute or defend any legal proceeding relating to any\ndepositary shares or preferred stock unless provided with\nsatisfactory indemnity. We, and the depository, may rely\nupon written advice of counsel or accountants, or\ninformation provided by persons presenting preferred\nstock for deposit, holders of depositary shares, or other\npersons believed to be competent and on documents\nbelieved to be genuine.\n\nResignation and Removal of Depository\n\nThe depository may resign at any time by delivering to us\nnotice of its election to do so, and we may remove the\ndepository at any time, in each case without your consent\nand without notifying you of such event. Any resignation\nor removal will take effect only upon the appointment of\na successor depository and the successor depository\u0092s\nacceptance of the appointment. Any successor depository\nmust be a U.S. bank or trust company.\n\n91\n\nDESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK\n\nThis section describes the general terms and provisions\nof the shares of our common stock .We also have filed our\nRestated Certificate of Incorporation and our bylaws as\nexhibits to the registration statement of which this\nprospectus is a part. You should read our Restated\nCertificate of Incorporation and our bylaws for\nadditional information about our common stock.\n\nGeneral\n\nAs of the date of this prospectus, under our Restated\nCertificate of Incorporation, we are authorized to issue\ntwelve billion eight hundred million (12,800,000,000)\nshares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of\nwhich approximately 8.59 billion shares were outstanding\non March 31, 2021. Our common stock trades on the New\nYork Stock Exchange under the symbol \u0093BAC.\u0094 As of March\n31, 2021, approximately 451 million shares were reserved\nfor issuance in connection with our various employee and\ndirector benefit plans, the conversion of outstanding\nsecurities convertible into shares of our common stock,\nand for other purposes. After taking into account the\nreserved shares, there were approximately 3.76 billion\nauthorized shares of our common stock available for\nissuance as of March 31, 2021.\n\nShares of our common stock will be uncertificated unless\nour board of directors by resolution determines\notherwise. Shares represented by an existing certificate\nwill remain certificated until such certificate is\nsurrendered to us.\n\nVoting and Other Rights\n\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to one vote per\nshare. There are no cumulative voting rights. In general,\na majority of votes cast on a matter is sufficient to\ntake action upon routine matters, including the election\nof directors in an uncontested election. However, (1)\namendments to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation\ngenerally must be approved by the affirmative vote of the\nholders of a majority of the voting power of the\noutstanding stock, and (2) a merger, dissolution, or the\nsale of all or substantially all of our assets generally\nmust be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders\nof a majority of the voting power of the outstanding\nstock.\n\nIn the event of our liquidation, holders of our common\nstock will be entitled to receive pro rata any assets\nlegally available for distribution to stockholders,\nsubject to any prior rights of any preferred stock then\noutstanding.\n\nOur common stock does not have any preemptive rights,\nredemption privileges, sinking fund privileges, or\nconversion rights. All the outstanding shares of our\ncommon stock are, and upon proper conversion of any\nconvertible securities, all of the shares of our common\nstock into which those securities are converted will be,\nvalidly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable.\n\nComputershare Trust Company, N.A. is the transfer agent\nand registrar for our common stock.\n\nDividends\n\nSubject to the preferential rights of any holders of any\noutstanding series of preferred stock, the holders of our\ncommon stock are entitled to receive dividends or\ndistributions, whether payable in cash or otherwise, as\nour board of directors may declare out of funds legally\navailable for payments. Stock dividends, if any are\ndeclared, may be paid from our authorized but unissued\nshares of common stock.\n\n92\n\nCertain Anti-Takeover Matters\n\nCertain provisions of Delaware law and of our Restated\nCertificate of Incorporation and bylaws could make it\nmore difficult for a third party to acquire control of us\nor have the effect of discouraging a third party from\nattempting to acquire control of us. For example, we are\nsubject to Section 203 of the Delaware General\nCorporation Law, which would make it more difficult for\nanother party to acquire us without the approval of our\nboard of directors. Certain provisions of our Restated\nCertificate of Incorporation and bylaws may make it less\nlikely that our management would be changed or that\nsomeone would acquire voting control of our company\nwithout our board\u0092s consent. These provisions could make\nit more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if\nan acquisition might be in the best interest of our\nstockholders.\n\nPreferred Stock .Our board of directors can, at any time,\nunder our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and\nwithout stockholder approval, issue one or more new\nseries of preferred stock. In some cases, the issuance of\npreferred stock without stockholder approval could\ndiscourage or make more difficult attempts to take\ncontrol of our company through a merger, tender offer,\nproxy contest or otherwise. Preferred stock with special\nvoting rights or other features issued to persons\nfavoring our management could stop a takeover by\npreventing the person trying to take control of our\ncompany from acquiring enough voting shares necessary to\ntake control.\n\nAdvance Notice Requirements .Our bylaws establish advance\nnotice procedures with regard to stockholder proposals\nrelating to nominations for the election of directors or\nother business to be brought before meetings of our\nstockholders. These procedures provide that notice of\nsuch stockholder proposals must be timely given to our\ncorporate secretary prior to the meeting at which the\naction is to be taken. The notice must contain certain\ninformation specified in the bylaws and must otherwise\ncomply with the bylaws.\n\nVacancies .Under our bylaws, a majority vote of our board\nof directors may increase or decrease the number of\ndirectors. Any director may be removed at any time with\nor without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders\nof a majority of the voting power of the outstanding\nshares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.\nAny vacancy on our board of directors or newly created\ndirectorship will be filled by a majority vote of the\nremaining directors then in office, and those newly\nelected directors will serve for a term expiring at the\nnext annual meeting of stockholders, and until such\ndirectors\u0092 successor has been elected and qualified.\n\nAmendment of Bylaws. Our bylaws may be adopted, amended\nor repealed by a majority of our board of directors,\nsubject to certain limitations in our bylaws. Our\nstockholders also have the power to adopt, amend or\nrepeal our bylaws.\n\n93\n\nREGISTRATION AND SETTLEMENT\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement,\nwe will issue the securities in registered, and not\nbearer, form. This means that our obligation runs to the\nholder of the security named on the face of the security.\nEach debt security, warrant, purchase contract, unit,\nshare of preferred stock, and depositary share issued in\nregistered form will be represented either by a\ncertificate issued in definitive form to a particular\ninvestor or by one or more global securities representing\nthe entire series of securities.\n\nWe refer to those persons who have securities registered\nin their own names, on the books that we or the trustee,\nwarrant agent, or other agent maintain for this purpose,\nas the \u0093holders\u0094 of those securities. These persons are\nthe legal holders of the securities. We refer to those\nwho, indirectly through others, own beneficial interests\nin securities that are not registered in their own names\nas indirect owners or beneficial owners of those\nsecurities. As we discuss below, indirect owners are not\nlegal holders, and investors in securities issued in\nglobal, or book-entry only, form or in street name will\nbe indirect owners.\n\nBook-Entry Only Issuance\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement,\nwe will issue each security in global, or book-entry,\nform. This means that we will not issue certificated\nsecurities in definitive form to investors. Instead, we\nwill issue global securities in registered form\nrepresenting the entire series of securities. Each global\nsecurity will be registered in the name of a financial\ninstitution or clearing system that holds the global\nsecurity as depository on behalf of other financial\ninstitutions that participate in that depository\u0092s book-\nentry system. These participating institutions, in turn,\nhold beneficial interests in the global securities on\nbehalf of themselves or their customers.\n\nBecause securities issued in global form are registered\nin the name of the depository, we will recognize only the\ndepository as the holder of the securities. This means\nthat we will make all payments on the securities,\nincluding deliveries of any property other than cash, to\nthe depository. The depository passes along the payments\nit receives from us to its participants, which in turn\npass the payments along to their customers who are the\nbeneficial owners. The depository and its participants\nare not obligated to pass these payments along under the\nterms of the securities. Instead, they do so under\nagreements they have made with one another or with their\ncustomers.\n\nAs a result, investors will not own securities issued in\nbook-entry only form directly. Instead, they will own\nbeneficial interests in a global security, through a\nbank, broker, or other financial institution that\nparticipates in the depository\u0092s book-entry system or\nholds an interest through a participant in the\ndepository\u0092s book-entry system. As long as the securities\nare issued in global form, investors will be indirect\nowners, and not holders, of the securities. The\ndepository will not have knowledge of the actual\nbeneficial owners of the securities.\n\nDefinitive Securities\n\nIn the future, we may cancel a global security or we may\nissue securities initially in non-global,or definitive,\nform. We do not expect to exchange global securities for\ncertificated securities in definitive form registered in\nthe names of the beneficial owners of the global\nsecurities representing the securities except in the\nlimited circumstances described in the relevant\nsecurities or in the indenture, agreement or other\ninstrument governing the relevant securities.\n\nStreet Name Owners\n\nIf we issue certificated securities in definitive form\nregistered in the names of the beneficial owners,\ninvestors may choose to hold their securities in their\nown names or in street name.\n\n94\n\nSecurities held by an investor in street name would be\nregistered in the name of a bank, broker, or other\nfinancial institution that the investor chooses, and the\ninvestor would hold only a beneficial interest in those\nsecurities through an account that he or she maintains at\nthat institution. For securities held in street name, we\nwill recognize only the intermediary banks, brokers, and\nother financial institutions in whose names the\nsecurities are registered as the holders of those\nsecurities, and we will make all payments on those\nsecurities, including deliveries of any property other\nthan cash, to them. These institutions pass along the\npayments they receive to their customers who are the\nbeneficial owners, but only because they agree to do so\nin their customer agreements or because they are legally\nrequired to do so. Investors who hold securities in\nstreet name will be indirect owners, not holders, of\nthose securities. Legal Holders Our obligations, as well\nas the obligations of the trustee under any indenture and\nthe obligations, if any, of any warrant agents, unit\nagents, depository for depositary shares, and any other\nthird parties employed by us, the trustee, or any of\nthose agents, run only to the holders of the securities.\nWe do not have obligations to investors who hold\nbeneficial interests in global securities, who hold the\nsecurities in street name, or who hold the securities by\nany other indirect means. This will be the case whether\nan investor chooses to be an indirect owner of a security\nor has no choice because we are issuing the securities\nonly in global form. For example, once we make a payment\nor give a notice to the holder, we have no further\nresponsibility for that payment or notice even if that\nholder is required, under agreements with depository\nparticipants or customers or by law, to pass it along to\nthe indirect owners, but does not do so. Similarly, if we\nwant to obtain the approval of the holders for any\npurpose, such as to amend the indenture for a series of\ndebt securities or the warrant agreement for a series of\nwarrants or the unit agreement for a series of units or\nto relieve us of the consequences of a default or of our\nobligation to comply with a particular provision of an\nindenture, we would seek the approval only from the\nholders, and not the indirect owners, of the relevant\nsecurities. Whether and how the holders contact the\nindirect owners is up to the holders. When we refer to\n\u0093you\u0094 in this prospectus, we mean those who invest in the\nsecurities being offered by this prospectus, whether they\nare the holders or only indirect owners of those\nsecurities. When we refer to \u0093your securities\u0094 in this\nprospectus, we mean the securities in which you will hold\na direct or indirect interest. Special Considerations for\nIndirect Owners If you hold securities through a bank,\nbroker, or other financial institution, either in book-\nentry only form or in street name, you should check with\nyour own institution to find out:\n                                                         \n      how it handles payments on your securities and     \n      notices;                                           \n                                                         \n                                           \n      whether it imposes fees or charges;  \n                                           \n                                                         \n      whether and how you can instruct it to exercise    \n      any rights to purchase or sell warrant property    \n      under a warrant or purchase contract property      \n      under a                                            \n      purchase contract or to exchange or convert a      \n      security for or into other property;               \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      how it would handle a request for the holders\u0092      \n      consent, if required;                              \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      whether and how you can instruct it to send you    \n      the securities registered in your own name so you  \n      can be a holder, if that is permitted in the       \n      future;                                            \n                                                         \n95\n                                                         \n      how it would exercise rights under the securities  \n      if there were a default or other event triggering  \n      the need for holders to act to protect their       \n      interests;\u00a0and                                     \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      if the securities are in book-entry only form,     \n      how the depository\u0092s rules and procedures will      \n      affect these matters.                              \n                                                         \nDepositories for Global Securities Each security issued\nin book-entry only form will be represented by a global\nsecurity that we deposit with and register in the name of\none or more financial institutions or clearing systems,\nor their nominees, which we will select. A financial\ninstitution or clearing system that we select for this\npurpose is called the \u0093depository\u0094 for that security. A\nsecurity usually will have only one depository, but it\nmay have more. Each series of securities will have one or\nmore of the following as the depositories:\n                                                         \n      The Depository Trust\u00a0Company, New York, New York,  \n      which is known as \u0093DTC\u0094;                             \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      a financial institution holding the securities on  \n      behalf of Euroclear Bank SA/NV, which is known as  \n      \u0093Euroclear\u0094;                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      a financial institution holding the securities on  \n      behalf of Clearstream Banking S.A., Luxembourg,    \n      which is known as \u0093Clearstream,                     \n      Luxembourg\u0094;                                        \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc.,         \n      Toronto, Ontario, Canada, which is known as \u0093CDS\u0094;   \n      and                                                \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      any other clearing system or financial             \n      institution that we identify in the applicable     \n      supplement.                                        \n                                                         \nThe depositories named above also may be participants in\none another\u0092s clearing systems. For example, if DTC is\nthe depository for a global security, investors may hold\nbeneficial interests in that security through Euroclear\nor Clearstream, Luxembourg as DTC participants. We will\nname the depository or depositories for your securities\nin the applicable supplement. If no depository is named,\nthe depository will be DTC. The Depository Trust Company\nThe following is based on information furnished to us by\nDTC: Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable\nsupplement, DTC will act as securities depository for the\nsecurities. The securities will be issued as fully-\nregistered securities registered in the name of Cede &\nCo. (DTC\u0092s partnership nominee) or any other name as may\nbe requested by an authorized representative of DTC. One\nfully-registered security certificate will be issued for\neach issue of the securities, each in the aggregate\nprincipal amount of the issue, and will be deposited with\nDTC. If, however, the aggregate principal amount of any\nissue exceeds $500 million, one certificate will be\nissued with respect to each $500 million of principal\namount, and an additional certificate will be issued with\nrespect to any remaining principal amount of the issue.\nWe may also issue one or more global securities that\nrepresent multiple series of debt securities. DTC, the\nworld\u0092s largest securities depository, is a limited-\npurpose trust company organized under the New York\nBanking Law, a \u0093banking organization\u0094 within the meaning\nof the New York 96\n\nBanking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a\n\u0093clearing corporation\u0094 within the meaning of the New York\nUniform Commercial Code, and a \u0093clearing agency\u0094\nregistered under Section 17A of the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for\nover 3.5 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S.\nequityissues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and\nmoney market instruments (from over 100 countries) that\nDTC\u0092s direct participants deposit with DTC. DTC also\nfacilitates the post-trade settlement among direct\nparticipants of sales and other securities transactions\nin deposited securities, through electronic computerized\nbook-entry transfers and pledges between direct\nparticipants\u0092 accounts. This eliminates the need for\nphysical movement of securities certificates. Direct\nparticipants include both U.S. and non-U.S.securities\nbrokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing\ncorporations, and certain other organizations. DTC is a\nwholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust &\nClearing Corporation (\u0093DTCC\u0094). DTCC is the holding\ncompany for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation\nand Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are\nregistered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users\nof its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system\nis also available to others such as both U.S. and\nnon-U.S. securitiesbrokers and dealers, banks, trust\ncompanies, and clearing corporations that clear through\nor maintain a custodial relationship with a direct\nparticipant, either directly or indirectly (\u0093indirect\nparticipants\u0094). The DTC rules applicable to its\nparticipants are on file with the SEC. More information\nabout DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com. Information on\nthat website is not included or incorporated by reference\nherein.\n\nPurchases of the securities under the DTC system must be\nmade by or through direct participants, which will\nreceive a credit for the securities on DTC\u0092s records. The\nownership interest of each actual purchaser of each\nsecurity (\u0093beneficial owner\u0094) is in turn to be recorded\non the direct and indirect participants\u0092 records.\nBeneficial owners will not receive written confirmation\nfrom DTC of their purchase. Beneficial owners are,\nhowever, expected to receive written confirmations\nproviding details of the transaction, as well as periodic\nstatements of their holdings, from the direct or indirect\nparticipant through which the beneficial owner entered\ninto the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in\nthe securities are to be accomplished by entries made on\nthe books of direct and indirect participants acting on\nbehalf of beneficial owners. Beneficial owners will not\nreceive certificates representing their ownership\ninterests in the securities, except in the event that use\nof the book-entry system for the securities is\ndiscontinued.\n\nTo facilitate subsequent transfers, all securities\ndeposited by direct participants with DTC are registered\nin the name of DTC\u0092s partnership nominee, Cede & Co., or\nsuch other name as may be requested by an authorized\nrepresentative of DTC. The deposit of securities with DTC\nand their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such\nother DTC nominee do not effect any change in beneficial\nownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual beneficial\nowners of the securities; DTC\u0092s records reflect only the\nidentity of the direct participants to whose accounts\nsuch securities are credited, which may or may not be the\nbeneficial owners. The direct and indirect participants\nwill remain responsible for keeping account of their\nholdings on behalf of their customers.\n\nConveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to\ndirect participants, by direct participants to indirect\nparticipants, and by direct and indirect participants to\nbeneficial owners will be governed by arrangements among\nthem, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements\nas may be in effect from time to time. Beneficial owners\nof securities may wish to take certain steps to augment\nthe transmission to them of notices of significant events\nwith respect to the securities, such as redemptions,\ntenders, defaults, and proposed amendments to the\nsecurity documents. For example, beneficial owners of\nsecurities may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding\nthe securities for its benefit has agreed to obtain and\ntransmit notices to beneficial owners. In the\nalternative, beneficial owners may wish to provide their\nnames and addresses to the registrar and request that\ncopies of notices be provided directly to them.\n\n97\n\nNeither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee)\nwill consent or vote with respect to securities unless\nauthorized by a direct participant in accordance with\nDTC\u0092s Money Market Instrument (\u0093MMI\u0094) procedures. Under\nits usual procedures, DTC mails an omnibus proxy to us as\nsoon as possible after the record date. The omnibus proxy\nassigns Cede & Co.\u0092s consenting or voting rights to those\ndirect participants to whose accounts the securities are\ncredited on the record date (identified in a listing\nattached to the omnibus proxy).\n\nDividend payments or any payments of principal, any\npremium, interest, or other amounts on the securities\nwill be made to Cede & Co., or any other nominee as may\nbe requested by an authorized representative of DTC.\nDTC\u0092s practice is to credit direct participants\u0092 accounts\nupon DTC\u0092s receipt of funds and corresponding detail\ninformation from us, on the applicable payment date in\naccordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC\u0092s\nrecords. Payments by participants to beneficial owners\nwill be governed by standing instructions and customary\npractices, as is the case with securities held for the\naccounts of customers in bearer form or registered in\n\u0093street name,\u0094 and will be the responsibility of these\nparticipants and not of DTC or its nominee, us, the\ntrustee, or any other agent or party, subject to any\nstatutory or regulatory requirements that may be in\neffect from time to time. Payment of dividends or\nprincipal and any premium or interest to Cede & Co. (or\nany other nominee as may be requested by an authorized\nrepresentative of DTC) is our responsibility.\nDisbursement of the payments to direct participants is\nthe responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of the\npayments to the beneficial owners is the responsibility\nof the direct or indirect participants.\n\nWe will send any redemption notices to DTC. If less than\nall of the securities of a series are being redeemed,\nDTC\u0092s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the\ninterest of each direct participant in the issue to be\nredeemed.\n\nA beneficial owner shall give notice to elect to have its\nsecurities repurchased through the participant through\nwhich it holds its beneficial interest in the security to\nthe applicable trustee or tender agent. The beneficial\nowner shall effect delivery of its securities by causing\nthe direct participant to transfer its interest in the\nsecurities on DTC\u0092s records. The requirement for physical\ndelivery of securities in connection with an optional\ntender or a mandatory purchase will be deemed satisfied\nwhen the ownership rights in the securities are\ntransferred by the direct participant on DTC\u0092s records\nand followed by a book-entry credit of tendered\nsecurities to the applicable trustee or agent\u0092s DTC\naccount.\n\nDTC may discontinue providing its services as depository\nfor the securities at any time by giving us reasonable\nnotice. If this occurs, and if a successor securities\ndepository is not obtained, we will print and deliver\ndefinitive securities.\n\nWe may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-\nentry only transfers through DTC (or a successor\nsecurities depository). In that event, we will print and\ndeliver definitive securities to DTC.\n\nThe information in this section concerning DTC and DTC\u0092s\nbook-entry system has been obtained from sources that we\nbelieve to be reliable, but we take no responsibility for\nits accuracy.\n\nEuroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg\n\nEuroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg each hold\nsecurities for their customers and facilitate the\nclearance and settlement of securities transactions by\nelectronic book-entry transfer between their respective\naccount holders (each such account holder, a\n\u0093participant\u0094 and collectively, the \u0093participants\u0094).\nEuroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg provide various\nservices including safekeeping, administration, clearance\nand settlement of internationally traded securities and\n\n98\n\nsecurities lending and borrowing.

Euroclear is incorporated under the laws of\nBelgium and Clearstream, Luxembourg is incorporated under\nthe laws of Luxembourg.\n\nEuroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg customers are\nworld-wide financial institutions, including\nunderwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks,\ntrust companies, and clearing corporations. Indirect\naccess to Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg is\navailable to other institutions that clear through or\nmaintain a custodial relationship with a participant of\neither system.\n\nThe address of Euroclear is Euroclear Bank SA/NV, 1\nBoulevard du Roi Albert II, B-1210Brussels and the\naddress of Clearstream, Luxembourg is Clearstream\nBanking, 42 Avenue JF Kennedy, L-1855,Luxembourg.\n\nEuroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg may be depositories\nfor a global security sold or traded outside the United\nStates. In addition, if DTC is the depository for a\nglobal security, Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg\nmay hold interests in the global security as participants\nin DTC. As long as any global security is held by\nEuroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg as depository, you\nmay hold an interest in the global security only through\nan organization that participates, directly or\nindirectly, in Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. If\nEuroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg is the depository\nfor a global security and there is no depository in the\nUnited States, you will not be able to hold interests in\nthat global security through any securities clearing\nsystem in the United States.\n\nPayments, deliveries, transfers, exchanges, notices, and\nother matters relating to the securities made through\nEuroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg must comply with the\nrules and procedures of those clearing systems. Those\nclearing systems could change their rules and procedures\nat any time. We have no control over those clearing\nsystems or their participants, and we take no\nresponsibility for their activities. Transactions between\nparticipants in Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, on\none hand, and participants in DTC, on the other hand,\nwhen DTC is the depository, also would be subject to\nDTC\u0092s rules and procedures.\n\nInvestors will be able to make and receive through\nEuroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg payments,\ndeliveries, transfers, exchanges, notices, and other\ntransactions involving any securities held through those\nclearing systems only on days when those clearing systems\nare open for business. Those clearing systems may not be\nopen for business on days when banks, brokers, and other\ninstitutions are open for business in the United States.\nIn addition, because of time-zone differences, U.S.\ninvestors who hold their interests in the securities\nthrough these clearing systems and wish to transfer their\ninterests, or to receive or make a payment or delivery or\nexercise any other right with respect to their interests,\non a particular day may find that the transaction will\nnot be effected until the next business day in Brussels\nor Luxembourg, as applicable. Thus, investors who wish to\nexercise rights that expire on a particular day may need\nto act before the expiration date. In addition, investors\nwho hold their interests through both DTC and Euroclear\nor Clearstream, Luxembourg may need to make special\narrangements to finance any purchases or sales of their\ninterests between the United States and European clearing\nsystems, and those transactions may settle later than\nwould be the case for transactions within one clearing\nsystem.\n\nThe information in this section concerning Euroclear and\nClearstream, Luxembourg has been obtained from sources\nthat we believe to be reliable, but we take no\nresponsibility for its accuracy.\n\n99\n\nCDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc.\n\nDebt securities that are denominated in Canadian dollars\n(\u0093Canadian notes\u0094) may be issued as one or more\nregistered notes in global form (i.e., global notes),\ninitially registered in the name of CDS & CO., as nominee\nfor CDS, and deposited with CDS.

Special\nConsiderations for Global Securities As an indirect\nowner, an investor\u0092s rights relating to a global security\nwill be governed by the account rules of the depository\nand those of the investor\u0092s financial institution or\nother intermediary through which it holds its interest\n(e.g., Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, if DTC is\nthe depository), as well as general laws relating to\nsecurities transfers.

The following discussion is not exhaustive\nof all possible tax considerations. This summary is based\nupon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the\n\u0093Code\u0094), regulations promulgated under the Code by the\nU.S. Treasury Department (\u0093Treasury\u0094) (including proposed\nand temporary regulations), rulings, current\nadministrative interpretations and official\npronouncements of the Internal Revenue Service (the\n\u0093IRS\u0094), and judicial decisions, all as currently in\neffect and all of which are subject to differing\ninterpretations or to change, possibly with retroactive\neffect. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not\nassert, or that a court would not sustain, a position\ncontrary to any of the tax consequences described below.\nThis section constitutes the opinion of Davis Polk &\nWardwell LLP and Sidley Austin LLP, United States tax\ncounsel to Bank of America Corporation. This summary is\nfor general information only, and does not purport to\ndiscuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that\nmay be important to a particular investor in light of its\ninvestment or tax circumstances or to investors subject\nto special tax rules, such as: partnerships, or other\nentities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes, subchapter S corporations, any\ngovernment (or instrumentality or agency thereof), banks,\nfinancial institutions, tax-exemptentities, insurance\ncompanies, regulated investment companies, real estate\ninvestment trusts, trusts and estates, dealers in\nsecurities or currencies, traders in securities that have\nelected to use the mark-to-marketmethod of tax accounting\nfor their securities, persons holding the debt\nsecurities, preferred stock, depositary shares, or common\nstock as part of an integrated investment, including a\n\u0093straddle,\u0094 \u0093hedge,\u0094 \u0093constructive sale,\u0094 or \u0093conversion\ntransaction,\u0094 persons (other than Non-U.S.Holders) whose\nfunctional currency for tax purposes is not the U.S.\ndollar, and persons subject to the alternative minimum\ntax provisions of the Code. This summary does not address\nspecial rules applicable to a person required for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes to conform the timing of\nincome accruals with respect to the debt securities,\npreferred stock, depositary shares and common stock to\nits financial statements under Section 451(b) of the\nCode. This summary also does not include any description\nof the tax laws of any state or local governments, or of\nany foreign government, that may be applicable to a\nparticular holder. This summary also may not apply to all\nforms of debt securities, preferred stock, depositary\nshares, or common stock that we may issue. This\ndiscussion applies only to investors who, except as\notherwise specifically noted:\n                                                         \n      will purchase the debt securities, preferred       \n      stock, depositary shares, or common stock offered  \n      in this prospectus upon original issuance; and     \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      will hold such securities as capital assets        \n      within the meaning of Section\u00a01221 of the Code,    \n      which generally means as property held for         \n      investment.                                        \n                                                         \nYou should consult your own tax advisor concerning the\nU.S. federal income tax consequences to you of acquiring,\nowning, and disposing of these securities, as well as any\ntax consequences arising under the laws of any state,\nlocal, foreign, or other tax jurisdiction and the\npossible effects of changes in U.S. federal or other tax\nlaws. As used in this prospectus, the term \u0093U.S. Holder\u0094\nmeans a beneficial owner of the debt securities,\npreferred stock, depositary shares, or common stock\noffered in this prospectus that is for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes:\n                                                         \n      a citizen or individual resident of the United     \n      States;                                            \n                                                         \n104\n                                                         \n      a corporation (including an entity treated as a    \n      corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes)  \n      created or organized in or under the laws of the   \n      United States or of any state of the United        \n      States or the District of Columbia; or             \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      an estate or trust the income of which is subject  \n      to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its  \n      source.                                            \n                                                         \nAs used in this prospectus, the term \u0093Non-U.S.Holder\u0094 is\na beneficial owner that is not a U.S. Holder and is not a\npartnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If an\nentity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes holds the debt securities,\npreferred stock, depositary shares, or common stock\noffered in this prospectus, the U.S. federal income tax\ntreatment of a partner generally will depend upon the\nstatus of the partner and the activities of the\npartnership and accordingly, this summary does not apply\nto partnerships. A partner of a partnership holding the\ndebt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, or\ncommon stock should consult its own tax advisor regarding\nthe U.S. federal income tax consequences to the partner\nof the acquisition, ownership, and disposition by the\npartnership of the debt securities, preferred stock,\ndepositary shares, or common stock. This discussion is\nsubject to any additional discussion regarding U.S.\nfederal taxation contained in the applicable supplement.\nAccordingly, you should also consult the applicable\nsupplement for any additional discussion of U.S. federal\ntaxation with respect to the specific debt securities,\npreferred stock, depositary shares or common stock\noffered thereunder. Taxation of Debt Securities This\nsubsection describes the material U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences of the acquisition, ownership, and\ndisposition of the debt securities offered in this\nprospectus, other than the debt securities described\nbelow under \u0093\u0097Convertible, Renewable, Extendible,\nIndexed, and Other Debt Securities,\u0094 which will be\ndescribed in the applicable supplement. This subsection\nis directed solely to holders that, except as otherwise\nspecifically noted, will purchase the debt securities\noffered in this prospectus upon original issuance for\ncash at the issue price, as defined below. Consequences\nto U.S. Holders The following is a summary of the\nmaterial U.S. federal income tax consequences that will\napply to U.S. Holders of debt securities. Payment of\nStated Interest.Except as described below in the case of\ninterest on a debt security issued with original issue\ndiscount, as defined below under \u0093\u0097Original Issue\nDiscount,\u0094 stated interest on a debt security generally\nwill be included in the income of a U.S. Holder as\ninterest income at the time it is accrued or is received\nin accordance with the U.S. Holder\u0092s regular method of\naccounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and will\nbe ordinary income. Original Issue Discount.Some of our\ndebt securities may be issued with original issue\ndiscount (\u0093OID\u0094). U.S. Holders of debt securities issued\nwith OID, other than short-term debt securities with a\nmaturity of one year or less from its date of issue\n(after taking into account the last possible date that\nthe debt security could be outstanding under its terms),\nwill be subject to special tax accounting rules, as\ndescribed in greater detail below. For tax purposes, OID\nis the excess of the \u0093stated redemption price at\nmaturity\u0094 of a debt instrument over its \u0093issue price.\u0094\nThe \u0093stated redemption price at maturity\u0094 of a debt\nsecurity is the sum of all payments required to be made\non the debt security other than \u0093qualified stated\ninterest\u0094 payments, as defined below. The 105\n\n\u0093issue price\u0094 of a debt security is generally the first\noffering price to the public at which a substantial\namount of the issue was sold (ignoring sales to bond\nhouses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations\nacting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents,\nor wholesalers). The term \u0093qualified stated interest\u0094\ngenerally means stated interest that is unconditionally\npayable in cash or property (other than debt instruments\nof the issuer), or that is treated as constructively\nreceived, at least annually at a single fixed rate or,\nunder certain circumstances, at a variable rate. If a\ndebt security bears interest during any accrual period at\na rate below the rate applicable for the remaining term\nof the debt security (for example, debt securities with\nteaser rates or interest holidays), interest payable at\nthe lowest stated fixed rate generally is qualified\nstated interest and the excess, if any, is included in\nthe stated redemption price at maturity for purposes of\ndetermining whether the debt security will be issued with\noriginal issue discount.\n\nA U.S. Holder of a debt security with a maturity of more\nthan one year from its date of issue that has been issued\nwith OID (an \u0093OID debt security\u0094) is generally required\nto include any qualified stated interest payments in\nincome as interest at the time such interest is accrued\nor is received in accordance with the U.S. Holder\u0092s\nregular accounting method for tax purposes, as described\nabove under \u0093\u0097Payment of Stated Interest.\u0094 A U.S. Holder\nof an OID debt security is generally required to include\nin income the sum of the daily accruals of the OID for\nthe debt security for each day during the taxable year\n(or portion of the taxable year) in which the U.S. Holder\nheld the OID debt security, regardless of such holder\u0092s\nregular method of accounting. Thus, a U.S. Holder may be\nrequired to include OID in income in advance of the\nreceipt of some or all of the related cash payments. The\ndaily portion is determined by allocating the OID for\neach day of the accrual period. An accrual period may be\nof any length and the accrual periods may even vary in\nlength over the term of the OID debt security, provided\nthat each accrual period is no longer than one year and\neach scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs\neither on the first day of an accrual period or on the\nfinal day of an accrual period. The amount of OID\nallocable to an accrual period is equal to the excess of:\n(1) the product of the \u0093adjusted issue price\u0094 of the OID\ndebt security at the beginning of the accrual period and\nits yield to maturity (computed generally on a constant\nyield method and compounded at the end of each accrual\nperiod, taking into account the length of the particular\naccrual period) over (2) the amount of any qualified\nstated interest allocable to the accrual period. OID\nallocable to a final accrual period is the difference\nbetween the amount payable at maturity, other than a\npayment of qualified stated interest, and the adjusted\nissue price at the beginning of the final accrual period.\nSpecial rules will apply for calculating OID for an\ninitial short accrual period. The \u0093adjusted issue price\u0094\nof an OID debt security at the beginning of any accrual\nperiod is the sum of the issue price of the OID debt\nsecurity plus the amount of OID allocable to all prior\naccrual periods reduced by any payments received on the\nOID debt security that were not qualified stated\ninterest. Under these rules, a U.S. Holder generally will\nhave to include in income increasingly greater amounts of\nOID in successive accrual periods.\n\nIf the excess of the \u0093stated redemption price at\nmaturity\u0094 of a debt security over its \u0093issue price\u0094 is\nless than 1/4 of 1% of the debt instrument\u0092s stated\nredemption price at maturity multiplied by the number of\ncomplete years from its issue date to its maturity, or\nweighted average maturity in the case of debt securities\nwith more than one principal payment (\u0093de minimis OID\u0094),\nthe debt security is not treated as issued with OID. The\nweighted average maturity is the sum of the following\namounts determined for each payment under the debt\nsecurity other than a payment of qualified stated\ninterest: (i) the number of complete years from the issue\ndate of the debt security until the payment is made,\nmultiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is\nthe amount of the payment and the denominator of which is\nthe debt security\u0092s stated redemption price at maturity.\nA U.S. Holder generally must include the de minimis OID\nin income at the time payments, other than qualified\nstated interest, on the debt securities are made in\nproportion to the amount paid (unless the U.S. Holder\nmakes the election described below under \u0093\u0097Election to\nTreat All Interest as Original Issue Discount\u0094). Any\namount of de minimis OID that is included in income in\nthis manner will be treated as capital gain.\n\n106\n\nDebt Securities Subject to Early Redemption. A debt\nsecurity subject to redemption prior to maturity may be\nsubject to rules that differ from the general rules\ndescribed above for purposes of determining the yield and\nmaturity of the debt security (which may affect whether\nthe debt security is treated as issued with OID and, if\nso, the timing of accrual of the OID). Under applicable\nTreasury regulations, we will generally be presumed to\nexercise an option to redeem a debt security if the\nexercise of the option will lower the yield on the debt\nsecurity. Conversely, a U.S. Holder will generally be\npresumed to exercise an option to require us to\nrepurchase a debt security if the exercise of the option\nwill increase the yield on the debt security. If such an\noption is not in fact exercised, the debt security will\nbe treated, solely for purposes of calculating OID, as if\nit were redeemed and a new debt security were issued on\nthe presumed exercise date for an amount equal to the\ndebt security\u0092s \u0093adjusted issue price\u0094 on that date.\n\nUnder these rules, if a debt security provides for a\nfixed rate of interest that increases over the term of\nthe debt security, the debt security\u0092s issue price is not\nbelow its stated principal amount and we have an option\nto redeem the debt security for an amount equal to the\nstated principal amount (plus accrued interest, if any)\nprior to the first date on which an increased rate of\ninterest is in effect, the yield on the debt security\nwill be lowered if we redeem the debt security before the\ninitial increase in the interest rate, and therefore our\nredemption option will be treated as exercised. Since the\ndebt security will therefore be treated as if it were\nredeemed and reissued prior to the initial increase in\nthe interest rate, the debt security will not be treated\nas issued with OID. If a debt security is not treated as\nissued with OID and if, contrary to the presumption in\nthe applicable Treasury regulations, we do not redeem the\ndebt security before the initial increase in the interest\nrate, the same analysis will apply to all subsequent\nincreases in the interest rate. This means that the debt\nsecurity that is deemed reissued will be treated as\nredeemed prior to any subsequent increase in the interest\nrate, and therefore as issued without OID. If such a\ndeemed reissuance occurs when the remaining term of the\ndebt security is one year or less, it is possible that\nthe debt security would thereafter be treated as a short-\nterm debt instrument. See \u0093\u0097Short-Term Debt Securities\u0094\nbelow.\n\nAdditional rules applicable to debt securities with OID\nthat are denominated in or determined by reference to a\ncurrency other than the U.S. dollar are described under\n\u0093\u0097Non-U.S.Dollar Denominated Debt Securities\u0094 below.\n\nVariable Rate Debt Securities. In the case of a debt\nsecurity that is a variable rate debt security, special\nrules apply. A debt security will qualify as a \u0093variable\nrate debt instrument\u0094 under Treasury regulations if (i)\nthe debt security\u0092s issue price does not exceed the total\nnoncontingent principal payments by more than the lesser\nof: (a) 0.015 multiplied by the product of the total\nnoncontingent principal payments and the number of\ncomplete years to maturity from the issue date, or (b)\n15% of the total noncontingent principal payments; and\n(ii) the debt security provides for stated interest,\ncompounded or paid at least annually, only at one or more\nqualified floating rates, a single fixed rate and one or\nmore qualified floating rates, a single objective rate,\nor a single fixed rate and a single objective rate that\nis a qualified inverse floating rate.\n\nGenerally, a rate is a qualified floating rate if: (i)\n(a) variations in the value of the rate can reasonably be\nexpected to measure contemporaneous variations in the\ncost of newly borrowed funds in the currency in which the\ndebt security is denominated; or (b) the rate is equal to\nsuch a rate multiplied by either a fixed multiple that is\ngreater than 0.65 but not more than 1.35 or a fixed\nmultiple greater than 0.65 but not more than 1.35\nincreased or decreased by a fixed rate, and (ii) the\nvalue of the rate on any date during the term of the debt\nsecurity is set no earlier than three months prior to the\nfirst day on which that value is in effect and no later\nthan one year following that first day. If a debt\nsecurity provides for two or more qualified floating\nrates that are within 0.25 percentage points of each\nother on the issue date or can reasonably be expected to\nhave approximately the same values throughout the term of\nthe debt security, the qualified floating\n\n107\n\nrates together constitute a single qualified floating\nrate. A debt security will not have a variable rate that\nis a qualified floating rate, however, if the variable\nrate of interest is subject to one or more minimum or\nmaximum rate floors or ceilings or one or more governors\nlimiting the amount of increase or decrease unless such\nfloor, ceiling, or governor is fixed throughout the term\nof the debt security or is not reasonably expected as of\nthe issue date to significantly affect the yield on the\ndebt security.\n\nGenerally, an objective rate is a rate that is (i) not a\nqualified floating rate, (ii) is determined using a\nsingle fixed formula that is based on objective financial\nor economic information that is not within the control of\nthe issuer or a related party, and (iii) the value of the\nrate on any date during the term of the debt security is\nset no earlier than three months prior to the first day\non which that value is in effect and no later than one\nyear following that first day. If it is reasonably\nexpected that the average value of the variable rate\nduring the first half of the term of a debt security will\nbe either significantly less than or significantly\ngreater than the average value of the rate during the\nfinal half of the term of the debt security, then the\ndebt security will not have a variable rate that is an\nobjective rate. An objective rate is a qualified inverse\nfloating rate if that rate is equal to a fixed rate minus\na qualified floating rate and variations in the rate can\nreasonably be expected to inversely reflect\ncontemporaneous variations in the qualified floating\nrate.\n\nA debt security will also have a variable rate that is a\nsingle qualified floating rate or an objective rate if\ninterest on the debt security is stated at a fixed rate\nfor an initial period of one year or less followed by\neither a qualified floating rate or an objective rate for\na subsequent period, and the value of the qualified\nfloating rate or objective rate is intended to\napproximate the fixed rate (which is presumed if (a) the\nfixed rate and (b) the qualified floating rate or\nobjective rate have values on the issue date of the debt\nsecurity that do not differ by more than 0.25 percentage\npoints).\n\nIn the case of a debt security that provides for stated\ninterest that is unconditionally payable at least\nannually at a variable rate that is a single qualified\nfloating rate or objective rate, or one of those rates\nafter a single fixed rate for an initial period of one\nyear or less (as described above), all stated interest on\nthe debt security is treated as qualified stated\ninterest. In that case, both the debt security\u0092s yield to\nmaturity and qualified stated interest will be\ndetermined, solely for purposes of calculating the\naccrual of OID, if any, as though the debt security will\nbear interest in all periods throughout its term (in the\ncase of a single qualified floating rate or qualified\ninverse floating rate) at a fixed rate generally equal to\nthe value of the rate on the issue date or, in the case\nof an objective rate (other than a qualified inverse\nfloating rate), the rate that reflects the yield to\nmaturity that is reasonably expected for the debt\nsecurity (the \u0093fixed rate substitute\u0094). A U.S. holder\nshould then recognize OID, if any, that is calculated\nbased on the debt security\u0092s assumed yield to maturity.\nIf the interest actually accrued or paid during an\naccrual period exceeds or is less than the assumed fixed\ninterest, the qualified stated interest allocable to that\nperiod is increased or decreased, as applicable.\n\nIf a debt security provides for stated interest at (x)\nmultiple floating rates or (y) one or more floating rates\nin addition to a single fixed rate (other than a single\nfixed rate for an initial period of one year or less (as\ndescribed above)), the interest and OID accruals on the\ndebt security must be determined by (i) determining a\nfixed rate substitute for each qualified floating rate or\nqualified inverse floating rate provided under the debt\nsecurity (as described above), (ii) constructing the\nequivalent fixed rate debt instrument, using the fixed\nrate substitutes, (iii) determining the amount of\nqualified stated interest and OID with respect to the\nequivalent fixed rate debt instrument, and (iv) making\nappropriate adjustments to qualified stated interest or\nOID for actual variable rates during the applicable\naccrual period.\n\nIn the case of a debt security that provides for stated\ninterest either at one or more qualified floating rates\nor at a qualified inverse floating rate and also provides\nfor stated interest at a single\n\n108\n\nfixed rate other than at a single fixed rate for an\ninitial period (as described above), the interest and OID\naccruals on the debt security must be determined by using\nthe method described above. However, the debt security\nwill be treated, for purposes of the first three steps of\nthe determination, as if the debt security had provided\nfor a qualified floating rate, or a qualified inverse\nfloating rate, rather than the fixed rate. The qualified\nfloating rate, or qualified inverse floating rate, that\nreplaces the fixed rate must be such that the fair market\nvalue of the debt security as of the issue date\napproximates the fair market value of an otherwise\nidentical debt instrument that provides for the qualified\nfloating rate, or qualified inverse floating rate, rather\nthan the fixed rate.\n\nFixed-Rate Reset Notes. Unless otherwise provided in the\napplicable supplement, it is expected that a fixed-rate\nreset note will qualify as a \u0093variable rate debt\ninstrument\u0094 that provides for stated interest at a single\nqualified floating rate in addition to a single fixed\nrate. Assuming that such treatment applies, a fixed-rate\nreset note will be subject to the rules described above\nin \u0093\u0097Variable Rate Debt Securities.\u0094\n\nAcquisition Premium.If a U.S. Holder purchases an OID\ndebt security for an amount greater than its adjusted\nissue price (as determined above) at the purchase date\nand less than or equal to the sum of all amounts, other\nthan qualified stated interest, payable on the OID debt\nsecurity after the purchase date, the excess is\n\u0093acquisition premium.\u0094 Under these rules, in general, the\namount of OID which must be included in income for the\ndebt security for any taxable year (or any portion of a\ntaxable year in which the debt security is held) will be\nreduced (but not below zero) by the portion of the\nacquisition premium allocated to the period. The amount\nof acquisition premium allocated to each period is\ndetermined by multiplying the OID that otherwise would\nhave been included in income by a fraction, the numerator\nof which is the excess of the cost over the adjusted\nissue price of the OID debt security and the denominator\nof which is the excess of the OID debt security\u0092s stated\nredemption price at maturity over its adjusted issue\nprice.\n\nAmortizable Bond Premium.If a U.S. Holder purchases a\ndebt security (including an OID debt security) for an\namount in excess of the sum of all amounts payable on the\ndebt security after the purchase date, other than\nqualified stated interest, such holder will be considered\nto have purchased such debt security with \u0093amortizable\nbond premium\u0094 equal in amount to such excess. A U.S.\nHolder may elect to amortize such premium as an offset to\ninterest income using a constant yield method over the\nremaining term of the debt security based on the U.S.\nHolder\u0092s yield to maturity with respect to the debt\nsecurity.\n\nA U.S. Holder generally may use the amortizable bond\npremium allocable to an accrual period to offset interest\nrequired to be included in the U.S. Holder\u0092s income under\nits regular method of accounting with respect to the debt\nsecurity in that accrual period. If the amortizable bond\npremium allocable to an accrual period exceeds the amount\nof interest allocable to such accrual period, such excess\nwould be allowed as a deduction for such accrual period,\nbut only to the extent of the U.S. Holder\u0092s prior\ninterest inclusions on the debt security that have not\nbeen offset previously by bond premium. Any excess is\ngenerally carried forward and allocable to the next\naccrual period.\n\nIf a debt security may be redeemed by us prior to its\nmaturity date, the amount of amortizable bond premium\nwill be based on the amount payable at the applicable\nredemption date, but only if use of the redemption date\n(in lieu of the stated maturity date) results in a\nsmaller amortizable bond premium for the period ending on\nthe redemption date.\n\nAn election to amortize bond premium applies to all\ntaxable debt obligations held by the U.S. Holder at the\nbeginning of the first taxable year to which the election\napplies and thereafter\n\n109\n\nacquired by the U.S. Holder and may be revoked only with\nthe consent of the IRS. Generally, a holder may make an\nelection to include in income its entire return on a debt\nsecurity (i.e., the excess of all remaining payments to\nbe received on the debt security over the amount paid for\nthe debt security by such holder) in accordance with a\nconstant yield method based on the compounding of\ninterest, as discussed below under \u0093\u0097Election to Treat\nAll Interest as Original Issue Discount.\u0094 If a holder\nmakes such an election for a debt security with\namortizable bond premium, such election will result in a\ndeemed election to amortize bond premium for all of the\nholder\u0092s debt instruments with amortizable bond premium\nand may be revoked only with the permission of the IRS.\n\nA U.S. Holder that elects to amortize bond premium will\nbe required to reduce its tax basis in the debt security\nby the amount of the premium amortized during its holding\nperiod. OID debt securities purchased at a premium will\nnot be subject to the OID rules described above. If a\nU.S. Holder does not elect to amortize bond premium, the\namount of bond premium will be included in its tax basis\nin the debt security. Therefore, if a U.S. Holder does\nnot elect to amortize bond premium and it holds the debt\nsecurity to maturity, the premium generally will be\ntreated as capital loss when the debt security matures.\n\nMarket Discount.If a U.S. Holder purchases a debt\nsecurity for an amount that is less than its stated\nredemption price at maturity, or, in the case of an OID\ndebt security, its adjusted issue price, such holder will\nbe considered to have purchased the debt security with\n\u0093market discount.\u0094 Any payment, other than qualified\nstated interest, or any gain on the sale, exchange,\nretirement, or other disposition of a debt security with\nmarket discount generally will be treated as ordinary\ninterest income to the extent of the market discount not\npreviously included in income that accrued on the debt\nsecurity during such holder\u0092s holding period. In general,\nmarket discount is treated as accruing on a straight-line\nbasis over the term of the debt security unless an\nelection is made to accrue the market discount under a\nconstant yield method. In addition, a U.S. Holder may be\nrequired to defer, until the maturity of the debt\nsecurity or its earlier disposition in a taxable\ntransaction, the deduction of a portion of the interest\npaid on any indebtedness incurred or maintained to\npurchase or carry the debt security in an amount not\nexceeding the accrued market discount on the debt\nsecurity.\n\nA U.S. Holder may elect to include market discount in\nincome currently as it accrues (on either a straight-line\nor constant yield basis), in lieu of treating a portion\nof any gain realized on a sale, exchange, retirement, or\nother disposition of the debt security as ordinary\nincome. If an election is made to include market discount\non a current basis, the interest deduction deferral rule\ndescribed above will not apply. If a U.S. Holder makes\nsuch an election, it will apply to all market discount\ndebt instruments acquired by such holder on or after the\nfirst day of the first taxable year to which the election\napplies. The election may not be revoked without the\nconsent of the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult with\ntheir own tax advisors before making this election.\n\nIf the difference between the stated redemption price at\nmaturity of a debt security or, in the case of an OID\ndebt security, its adjusted issue price, and the amount\npaid for the debt security is less than 1/4 of 1% of the\ndebt instrument\u0092s stated redemption price at maturity or,\nin the case of an OID debt security, its adjusted issue\nprice, multiplied by the number of remaining complete\nyears to the debt security\u0092s maturity (\u0093de minimis market\ndiscount\u0094), the debt security is not treated as issued\nwith market discount.\n\nGenerally, a holder may make an election to include in\nincome its entire return on a debt security (i.e., the\nexcess of all remaining payments to be received on the\ndebt security over the amount paid for the debt security\nby such holder) in accordance with a constant yield\nmethod based on the compounding of interest, as discussed\nbelow under \u0093\u0097Election to Treat All Interest as Original\nIssue Discount.\u0094 If a holder makes such an election for a\ndebt security with market discount, the holder will be\nrequired to include market discount in income currently\nas it accrues on\n\n110\n\na constant yield basis for all market discount debt\ninstruments acquired by such holder on or after the first\nday of the first taxable year to which the election\napplies, and such election may be revoked only with the\npermission of the IRS.\n\nElection to Treat All Interest as Original Issue\nDiscount.A U.S. Holder may elect to include in income all\ninterest that accrues on a debt security using the\nconstant-yield method applicable to OID described above,\nsubject to certain limitations and exceptions. For\npurposes of this election, interest includes stated\ninterest, acquisition discount, OID, de minimis OID,\nmarket discount, de minimis market discount, and unstated\ninterest, as adjusted by any amortizable bond premium or\nacquisition premium, each as described herein. If this\nelection is made for a debt security, then, to apply the\nconstant-yield method: (i) the issue price of the debt\nsecurity will equal its cost, (ii) the issue date of the\ndebt security will be the date it was acquired, and (iii)\nno payments on the debt security will be treated as\npayments of qualified stated interest. A U.S. Holder must\nmake this election for the taxable year in which the debt\nsecurity was acquired, and may not revoke the election\nwithout the consent of the IRS. U.S. Holders should\nconsult with their own tax advisors before making this\nelection.\n\nDebt Securities That Trade \u0093Flat. \u0094We expect that certain\ndebt securities will trade in the secondary market with\naccrued interest. However, we may issue debt securities\nwith terms and conditions that would make it likely that\nsuch debt securities would trade \u0093flat\u0094 in the secondary\nmarket, which means that upon a sale of a debt security a\nU.S. Holder would not be paid a separate amount that\nreflects the accrued but unpaid interest with respect to\nsuch debt security. Nevertheless, for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes, a portion of the sales proceeds equal to\nthe interest accrued with respect to such debt security\nfrom the last interest payment date to the sale date must\nbe treated as interest income rather than as an amount\nrealized upon the sale. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder that\nsells such a debt security between interest payment dates\nwould be required to recognize interest income and, in\ncertain circumstances, would recognize a capital loss\n(the deductibility of which is subject to limitations) on\nthe sale of the debt security. Concurrently, a U.S.\nHolder that purchases such a debt security between\ninterest payment dates would not be required to include\nin income that portion of any interest payment received\nthat is attributable to interest that accrued prior to\nthe purchase. Such payment is generally treated as a\nreturn of capital which reduces the U.S. Holder\u0092s\nremaining cost basis in the debt security. However,\ninterest that accrues after the purchase date is included\nin income in the year received or accrued (depending on\nthe U.S. Holder\u0092s accounting method). U.S. Holders that\npurchase such debt securities between interest payment\ndates should consult their own tax advisors concerning\nsuch holders\u0092 adjusted tax basis in the debt security and\nwhether such debt securities should be treated as having\nbeen purchased with market discount, as described above.\n\nShort-Term Debt Securities. Some of our debt securities\nmay be issued with maturities of one year or less from\nthe date of issue (after taking into account the last\npossible date that the debt security could be outstanding\nunder its terms), which we refer to as short-term debt\nsecurities. Treasury regulations provide that no payments\nof interest on a short-term debt security are treated as\nqualified stated interest. Accordingly, in determining\nthe amount of discount on a short-term debt security, all\ninterest payments, including stated interest, are\nincluded in the short-term debt security\u0092s stated\nredemption price at maturity.\n\nIn general, individual and certain other U.S. Holders\nusing the cash basis method of tax accounting are not\nrequired to include accrued discount on short-term debt\nsecurities in income currently unless they elect to do\nso, but they are required to include any stated interest\nin income as the interest is received, except to the\nextent already included under such election. However, a\ncash basis U.S. Holder will be required to treat any gain\nrealized on a sale, exchange, or retirement of the short-\nterm debt security as ordinary income to the extent such\ngain does not exceed the discount accrued with respect to\nthe short-term debt security, which will be determined on\na\n\n111\n\nstraight-line basis unless the holder makes an election\nto accrue the discount under the constant-yield method,\nthrough the date of sale, exchange or retirement. Any\ngain in excess of this amount will be treated as short-\nterm capital gain. Any loss recognized will be treated as\na capital loss. In addition, a cash basis U.S. Holder\nthat does not elect to include accrued discount in income\ncurrently will not be allowed to deduct any of the\ninterest paid or accrued on any indebtedness incurred or\nmaintained to purchase or carry a short-term debt\nsecurity (in an amount not exceeding the deferred\nincome), but instead will be required to defer deductions\nfor such interest until the deferred income is realized\nupon the maturity of the short-term debt security or its\nearlier disposition in a taxable transaction.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, a cash- basis U.S. Holder\nof a short-term debt security may elect to include\naccrued discount in income on a current basis. If this\nelection is made, the limitation on the deductibility of\ninterest described above will not apply.\n\nA U.S. Holder using the accrual method of tax accounting\ngenerally will be required to include accrued discount on\na short-term debt security in income on a current basis,\non either a straight-line basis or, at the election of\nthe holder, under the constant-yield method based on\ndaily compounding.\n\nRegardless of whether a U.S. Holder is a cash-basis or\naccrual-basis holder, it may elect to include accrued\n\u0093acquisition discount\u0094 with respect to a short-term debt\nsecurity in income on a current basis. Acquisition\ndiscount is the excess of the remaining redemption amount\nof the short-term debt security at the time of\nacquisition over the purchase price. Acquisition discount\nwill be treated as accruing on a straight-line basis or,\nat the election of the holder, under a constant yield\nmethod based on daily compounding. If a U.S. Holder\nelects to include accrued acquisition discount in income,\nthe rules for including OID will not apply. In addition,\nthe market discount rules described above will not apply\nto short-term debt securities.\n\nSale, Exchange, or Retirement of Debt Securities. Upon\nthe sale, exchange, retirement, or other disposition of a\ndebt security, a U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss\nequal to the difference between the amount realized upon\nthe sale, exchange, retirement, or other disposition\n(less an amount equal to any accrued interest not\npreviously included in income if the debt security is\ndisposed of between interest payment dates, which will be\nincluded in income as interest income for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes) and the U.S. Holder\u0092s adjusted tax\nbasis in the debt security. The amount realized by the\nU.S. Holder will include the amount of any cash and the\nfair market value of any other property received for the\ndebt security. A U.S. Holder\u0092s adjusted tax basis in a\ndebt security generally will be the cost of the debt\nsecurity to such U.S. Holder, increased by any OID,\nmarket discount, de minimis OID, de minimis market\ndiscount, or any discount with respect to a short-term\ndebt security previously included in income with respect\nto the debt security, and decreased by the amount of any\npremium previously amortized to reduce interest on the\ndebt security and the amount of any payment (other than a\npayment of qualified stated interest) received in respect\nof the debt security.\n\nExcept as discussed above with respect to market\ndiscount, or as described below with respect to debt\nsecurities subject to contingencies and Non-U.S.Dollar\nDenominated Debt Securities, gain or loss realized on the\nsale, exchange, retirement, or other disposition of a\ndebt security generally will be capital gain or loss and\nwill be long-term capital gain or loss if the debt\nsecurity has been held for more than one year. Net long-\nterm capital gain recognized by an individual U.S. Holder\nis generally taxed at preferential rates. The ability of\nU.S. Holders to deduct capital losses is subject to\nlimitations under the Code.\n\nDebt Securities Subject to Contingencies. Certain of the\ndebt securities may provide for an alternative payment\nschedule or schedules applicable upon the occurrence of a\ncontingency or contingencies, other than a remote or\nincidental contingency, whether such contingency relates\nto payments of interest or of principal. In addition,\nsubject to the discussion above under \u0093\u0097Debt\n\n112\n\nSecurities Subject to Early Redemption,\u0094 certain of the\ndebt securities may contain provisions permitting them to\nbe redeemed prior to their stated maturity at our option\nand/or at the option of the holder. Debt securities\ncontaining these features may be characterized as\n\u0093contingent payment debt instruments\u0094 for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes.\n\nIf the debt securities are properly characterized as\ncontingent payment debt instruments for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes, such debt securities generally will\nbe subject to Treasury regulations governing contingent\npayment debt instruments. Under those regulations, a U.S.\nHolder will be required to report OID based on a\n\u0093comparable yield\u0094 and a \u0093projected payment schedule,\u0094\nboth as described below, established by us for\ndetermining interest accruals and adjustments with\nrespect to the debt security. A U.S. Holder that does not\nuse the \u0093comparable yield\u0094 and follow the \u0093projected\npayment schedule\u0094 to calculate its OID on a debt security\nmust timely disclose and justify the use of other\nestimates to the IRS. No payments on a contingent payment\ndebt instrument are treated as qualified stated interest.\n\nA \u0093comparable yield\u0094 with respect to a debt security\ngenerally is the yield at which we could issue a fixed-\nrate debt instrument with terms similar to those of the\ndebt security (taking into account for this purpose the\nlevel of subordination, term, timing of payments, and\ngeneral market conditions, but ignoring any adjustments\nfor liquidity or the riskiness of the contingencies with\nrespect to the debt security). Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, a comparable yield must not be less than the\napplicable U.S. federal rate based on the overall\nmaturity of the debt security.\n\nA \u0093projected payment schedule\u0094 with respect to a debt\nsecurity generally is a series of projected payments, the\namount and timing of which would produce a yield to\nmaturity on that debt security equal to the comparable\nyield. This projected payment schedule will consist of a\nprojection for tax purposes of each non-contingentand\ncontingent payment.\n\nBased on the comparable yield and the projected payment\nschedule of the debt securities, a U.S. Holder of a debt\nsecurity (regardless of its tax accounting method)\ngenerally will be required to accrue as OID the sum of\nthe daily portions of interest on the debt security for\neach day in the taxable year on which the holder held the\ndebt security, adjusted upward or downward to reflect the\ndifference, if any, between the actual and projected\namount of any contingent payments on the debt security,\nas set forth below. The daily portions of interest for a\ndebt security are determined by allocating to each day in\nan accrual period the ratable portion of interest on the\ndebt security that accrues in the accrual period. The\namount of interest on the debt security that accrues in\nan accrual period is the product of the comparable yield\non the debt security (adjusted to reflect the length of\nthe accrual period) and the adjusted issue price of the\ndebt security at the beginning of the accrual period. The\nadjusted issue price of a debt security at the beginning\nof the first accrual period will equal its issue price\n(as described above). For any subsequent accrual period,\nthe adjusted issue price will be (i) the sum of the issue\nprice of the debt security and any interest previously\naccrued on the debt security by a holder (without regard\nto any positive or negative adjustments, described below)\nminus (ii) the amount of any projected payments on the\ndebt security for previous accrual periods.\n\nA U.S. Holder of a debt security generally will be\nrequired to include in income OID in excess of actual\ncash payments received for certain taxable years. In\naddition to the accrued OID, a U.S. Holder will be\nrequired to recognize interest income equal to the amount\nof any positive adjustment for a debt security for the\ntaxable year in which a contingent payment is paid\n(including a payment of interest at maturity). A positive\nadjustment is the excess of actual payments in respect of\ncontingent payments over the projected amount of\ncontingent payments. A U.S. Holder also will be required\nto account for any \u0093negative adjustment\u0094 for a taxable\nyear in which a contingent payment is paid. A negative\nadjustment is the excess of the projected amounts of\ncontingent payments over actual payments in respect of\nthe contingent payments. A net negative adjustment is the\namount\n\n113\n\nby which total negative adjustments in a taxable year\nexceed total positive adjustments in such taxable year. A\nnet negative adjustment (i) will first reduce the amount\nof interest for the debt security that a U.S. Holder\nwould otherwise be required to include in income in the\ntaxable year, and (ii) to the extent of any excess, will\nresult in an ordinary loss equal to that portion of the\nexcess as does not exceed the excess of (a) the amount of\nall previous interest inclusions under the debt security\nover (b) the total amount of the U.S. Holder\u0092s net\nnegative adjustments treated as ordinary loss on the debt\nsecurity in prior taxable years. A net negative\nadjustment is not treated as a deductible miscellaneous\nitemized deduction under Section 67 of the Code. Any net\nnegative adjustment in excess of the amounts described\nabove in (i) and (ii) will be carried forward to offset\nfuture interest income on the debt security or to reduce\nthe amount realized on a sale, exchange, retirement or\nother disposition of the debt security.\n\nIf a contingent payment becomes fixed (within the meaning\nof applicable Treasury regulations) more than six months\nbefore its due date, a positive or negative adjustment,\nas appropriate, is made to reflect the difference between\nthe present value of the amount that is fixed and the\npresent value of the projected amount. The present value\nof each amount is determined by discounting the amount\nfrom the date the payment is due to the date the payment\nbecomes fixed, using a discount rate equal to the\ncomparable yield. If all contingent payments on the debt\nsecurity become fixed, substantially contemporaneously,\napplicable Treasury regulations provide that, with regard\nto contingent payments that become fixed on a day that is\nmore than six months before their due date, U.S. Holders\nshould take into account positive or negative adjustments\nin respect of such contingent payments over the period to\nwhich they relate in a reasonable manner. For purposes of\nthe preceding sentence, a payment (including an amount\npayable at maturity) will be treated as fixed if (and\nwhen) all remaining contingencies with respect to it are\nremote or incidental within the meaning of the applicable\nTreasury regulations. A U.S. Holder\u0092s tax basis in the\ndebt security and the character of any gain or loss on\nthe sale of the debt security will also be affected. U.S.\nHolders should consult their tax advisors concerning the\napplication of these special rules, including as to what\nwould be a \u0093reasonable manner\u0094 in their particular\nsituation.\n\nWe expect that the applicable supplement will include a\ntable that sets forth the following information with\nrespect to the principal amount of the debt securities\nfor each of the applicable accrual periods through the\nmaturity date of the debt securities: (i) the amount of\ninterest deemed to have accrued during the accrual\nperiod, and (ii) the total amount of interest deemed to\nhave accrued from the original issue date through the end\nof the accrual period. The table will be based upon a\nprojected payment schedule and a comparable yield. The\ncomparable yield will be determined based upon market\nconditions as of the date of the applicable supplement.\nThe comparable yield is likely to change between the date\nof any preliminary supplement and the date of the related\nfinal supplement. Therefore, the projected payment\nschedule included in any preliminary supplement will be\nsubject to change. We will determine the actual projected\npayment schedule and the actual comparable yield on the\npricing date. Any tax accrual table included in a\npreliminary supplement will be revised, and the revised\ntable will be set forth in the final supplement prepared\nin connection with the initial sale of the debt\nsecurities.\n\nUpon a sale, exchange, retirement, or other disposition\nof a debt security prior to maturity, a U.S. Holder\ngenerally will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to\nthe difference between the amount realized on the sale,\nexchange, retirement, or other disposition and that\nholder\u0092s tax basis in the debt security. A U.S. Holder\u0092s\ntax basis in a debt security generally will equal the\ncost of that debt security, increased by the amount of\nOID previously accrued by the holder for that debt\nsecurity (without regard to any positive or negative\nadjustments) and reduced by any projected payments for\nprevious periods on the debt securities. A U.S. Holder\ngenerally will treat any gain as interest income, and\nwill treat any loss as ordinary loss to the extent of the\nexcess of previous interest inclusions over the total\nnegative adjustments previously taken into account as\nordinary\n\n114\n\nlosses, and the balance as long-term or short-term\ncapital loss depending upon the U.S. Holder\u0092s holding\nperiod for the debt security. The deductibility of\ncapital losses by a U.S. Holder is subject to\nlimitations.\n\nU.S. Holders considering the purchase of debt securities\nwith these features should carefully examine the\napplicable supplement and should consult their own tax\nadvisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences to a U.S. Holder of the purchase, ownership\nand disposition of such debt securities.\n\nNon-U.S.Dollar Denominated Debt Securities.Additional\nconsiderations apply to a U.S. Holder of a debt security\npayable in a currency other than U.S. dollars (\u0093foreign\ncurrency\u0094).\n\nWe refer to these securities as Non-U.S.Dollar\nDenominated Debt Securities. In the case of payments of\nstated interest, U.S. Holders using the cash method of\naccounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be\nrequired to include in income the U.S. dollar value of\nthe foreign currency payment on a Non-U.S.Dollar\nDenominated Debt Security (other than OID or market\ndiscount) when the payment of interest is received. The\nU.S. dollar value of the foreign currency payment is\ndetermined by translating the foreign currency received\nat the spot rate for such foreign currency on the date\nthe payment is received, regardless of whether the\npayment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at that\ntime. The U.S. dollar value will be the U.S. Holder\u0092s tax\nbasis in the foreign currency received. The U.S. Holder\nwill not recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss\nwith respect to the receipt of such payment.\n\nU.S. Holders using the accrual method of accounting for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes will be required to\ninclude in income the U.S. dollar value of the amount of\ninterest income that has accrued and is otherwise\nrequired to be taken into account with respect to a\nNon-U.S.Dollar Denominated Debt Security during an\naccrual period. The U.S. dollar value of the accrued\nincome will be determined by translating the income at\nthe average rate of exchange for the accrual period or,\nwith respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable\nyears, at the average rate for the partial period within\nthe taxable year. A U.S. Holder may elect, however, to\ntranslate the accrued interest income using the exchange\nrate on the last day of the accrual period or, with\nrespect to an accrual period that spans two taxable\nyears, using the exchange rate on the last day of the\ntaxable year. If the last day of an accrual period is\nwithin five business days of the date of receipt of the\naccrued interest, a U.S. Holder may translate the\ninterest using the exchange rate on the date of receipt.\nThe above election will apply to all other debt\nobligations held by the U.S. Holder and the election may\nnot be changed without the consent of the IRS. U.S.\nHolders should consult their own tax advisors before\nmaking the above election. Upon receipt of an interest\npayment (including, upon the sale of the debt security,\nthe receipt of proceeds which include amounts\nattributable to accrued interest previously included in\nincome), the holder will recognize foreign currency\nexchange gain or loss in an amount equal to the\ndifference between the U.S. dollar value of such payment\n(determined by translating the foreign currency received\nat the spot rate for such foreign currency on the date\nsuch payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of\nthe interest income previously included in income with\nrespect to such payment. This gain or loss will be\ntreated as ordinary income or loss.\n\nOID on a debt security that is also a Non-U.S.Dollar\nDenominated Debt Security will be determined for any\naccrual period in the applicable foreign currency and\nthen translated into U.S. dollars, in the same manner as\ninterest income accrued by a holder on the accrual basis,\nas described above (regardless of such holder\u0092s regular\nmethod of tax accounting). A U.S. Holder will recognize\nforeign currency exchange gain or loss when OID is paid\n(including, upon the sale of such debt security, the\nreceipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to\nOID previously included in income) to the extent of the\ndifference between the U.S. dollar value of such payment\n(determined by translating the foreign currency received\nat the spot rate for such foreign currency\n\n115\n\non the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar\nvalue of the accrued OID (determined in the same manner\nas for accrued interest). For these purposes, all\nreceipts on a debt security will be viewed: (i) first, as\nthe receipt of any stated interest payment called for\nunder the terms of the debt security, (ii) second, as\nreceipts of previously accrued OID (to the extent\nthereof), with payments considered made for the earliest\naccrual periods first, and (iii) third, as the receipt of\nprincipal.\n\nThe amount of market discount on Non-U.S.Dollar\nDenominated Debt Securities includible in income\ngenerally will be determined by translating the market\ndiscount determined in the foreign currency into U.S.\ndollars at the spot rate on the date the Non-U.S.Dollar\nDenominated Debt Security is retired or otherwise\ndisposed of. If a U.S. Holder elected to accrue market\ndiscount currently, then the amount which accrues is\ndetermined in the foreign currency and then translated\ninto U.S. dollars on the basis of the average exchange\nrate in effect during such accrual period. A U.S. Holder\nwill recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss\nwith respect to market discount which is accrued\ncurrently using the approach applicable to the accrual of\ninterest income as described above.\n\nAmortizable bond premium on a Non-U.S.Dollar Denominated\nDebt Security will be computed in the applicable foreign\ncurrency. If a U.S. Holder elected to amortize the\npremium, the amortizable bond premium will reduce\ninterest income in the applicable foreign currency. At\nthe time bond premium is amortized, foreign currency\nexchange gain or loss will be realized based on the\ndifference between spot rates at such time and the time\nof acquisition of the Non-U.S.Dollar Denominated Debt\nSecurity. If a U.S. Holder does not elect to amortize\nbond premium, the bond premium computed in the foreign\ncurrency must be translated into U.S. dollars at the spot\nrate on the maturity date and such bond premium will\nconstitute a capital loss which may be offset or\neliminated by foreign currency exchange gain.\n\nIf a U.S. Holder purchases a Non-U.S.Dollar Denominated\nDebt Security with previously owned foreign currency,\nforeign currency exchange gain or loss (which will be\ntreated as ordinary income or loss) will be recognized in\nan amount equal to the difference, if any, between the\ntax basis in the foreign currency and the U.S. dollar\nfair market value of the foreign currency used to\npurchase the Non-U.S.Dollar Denominated Debt Security,\ndetermined on the date of purchase.\n\nUpon the sale, exchange, retirement, or other taxable\ndisposition of a Non-U.S.Dollar Denominated Debt\nSecurity, a U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss equal\nto the difference between the amount realized upon the\nsale, exchange, retirement, or other disposition (less an\namount equal to any accrued and unpaid interest not\npreviously included in income, which will be treated as a\npayment of interest for U.S. federal income tax purposes)\nand the adjusted tax basis in the Non-U.S.Dollar\nDenominated Debt Security. The adjusted tax basis in a\nNon-U.S.Dollar Denominated Debt Security will equal the\namount paid for the Non-U.S.Dollar Denominated Debt\nSecurity, increased by the amounts of any market discount\nor OID previously included in income with respect to the\nNon-U.S.Dollar Denominated Debt Security and reduced by\nany amortized acquisition or other premium and any\nprincipal payments received in respect of the\nNon-U.S.Dollar Denominated Debt Security. The amount of\nany payment in or adjustments measured by foreign\ncurrency will be equal to the U.S. dollar value of the\nforeign currency on the date of the purchase or\nadjustment. The amount realized will be based on the U.S.\ndollar value of the foreign currency on the date the\npayment is received or the Non-U.S.Dollar Denominated\nDebt Security is disposed of (or deemed disposed of as a\nresult of a material change in the terms of the debt\nsecurity). If, however, a Non-U.S.Dollar Denominated Debt\nSecurity is traded on an established securities market\nand the U.S. Holder uses the cash basis method of tax\naccounting, the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized\nwill be determined by translating the foreign currency\npayment at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement\ndate of the purchase or sale. A U.S. Holder that uses the\naccrual basis method of tax accounting may elect the same\ntreatment with respect to the purchase\n\n116\n\nand sale of Non-U.S.Dollar Denominated Debt Securities\ntraded on an established securities market, provided that\nthe election is applied consistently. This election\ncannot be changed without the consent of the IRS.\n\nExcept with respect to market discount as discussed\nabove, and the foreign currency rules discussed below,\ngain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange,\nretirement, or other taxable disposition of a\nNon-U.S.Dollar Denominated Debt Security will be capital\ngain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss\nif at the time of sale, exchange, retirement, or other\ndisposition the Non-U.S.Dollar Denominated Debt Security\nhas been held for more than one year. Net long-term\ncapital gain recognized by an individual U.S. Holder is\ngenerally taxed at preferential rates. The ability of\nU.S. Holders to deduct capital losses is subject to\nlimitations under the Code.\n\nA portion of the gain or loss with respect to the\nprincipal amount of a Non-U.S.Dollar Denominated Debt\nSecurity may be treated as foreign currency exchange gain\nor loss. Foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be\ntreated as ordinary income or loss. For these purposes,\nthe principal amount of the Non-U.S.Dollar Denominated\nDebt Security is the purchase price for the\nNon-U.S.Dollar Denominated Debt Security calculated in\nthe foreign currency on the date of purchase, and the\namount of exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to\nthe difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the\nprincipal amount determined on the date of the sale,\nexchange, retirement or other disposition of the\nNon-U.S.Dollar Denominated Debt Security and (ii) the\nU.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on\nthe date the Non-U.S.Dollar Denominated Debt Security was\npurchased. The amount of foreign currency exchange gain\nor loss will be limited to the amount of overall gain or\nloss realized on the disposition of the Non-U.S.Dollar\nDenominated Debt Security.\n\nThe tax basis in foreign currency received as interest on\na Non-U.S.Dollar Denominated Debt Security will be the\nU.S. dollar value of the foreign currency determined at\nthe spot rate in effect on the date the foreign currency\nis received. The tax basis in foreign currency received\non the sale, exchange, retirement, or other disposition\nof a Non-U.S.Dollar Denominated Debt Security will be\nequal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency,\ndetermined at the time of the sale, exchange, retirement\nor other disposition. As discussed above, if the\nNon-U.S.Dollar Denominated Debt Securities are traded on\nan established securities market, a cash basis U.S.\nHolder (or, upon election, an accrual basis U.S. Holder)\nwill determine the U.S. dollar value of the foreign\ncurrency by translating the foreign currency received at\nthe spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the\nsale, exchange, retirement, or other disposition.\nAccordingly, in such case, no foreign currency exchange\ngain or loss will result from currency fluctuations\nbetween the trade date and settlement date of a sale,\nexchange, retirement, or other disposition. Any gain or\nloss recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement, or other\ndisposition of foreign currency (including its exchange\nfor U.S. dollars or its use to purchase debt securities)\nwill be ordinary income or loss.\n\nSpecial rules may apply to Non-U.S.Dollar Denominated\nDebt Securities that are also treated as contingent\npayment debt instruments. For the special treatment, if\nany, of Non-U.S.Dollar Denominated Debt Securities that\nare also contingent payment debt securities, see the\napplicable supplement.\n\nAdditional Medicare Tax on Unearned Income. Certain U.S.\nHolders, including individuals, estates and trusts, are\nsubject to an additional 3.8% Medicare tax on unearned\nincome. For individual U.S. Holders, the additional\nMedicare tax applies to the lesser of (i) \u0093net investment\nincome\u0094 or (ii) the excess of \u0093modified adjusted gross\nincome\u0094 over $200,000 ($250,000 if married and filing\njointly or $125,000 if married and filing separately).\n\u0093Net investment income\u0094 generally equals the taxpayer\u0092s\ngross investment income reduced by the deductions that\nare allocable to such income. Investment income generally\nincludes passive income such as interest and capital\ngains. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax\nadvisors regarding the implications of the additional\nMedicare tax resulting from an investment in the debt\nsecurities.\n\n117\n\nConsequences to Non-U.S.Holders The following is a\nsummary of the material U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences that will apply to Non-U.S.Holders of debt\nsecurities. Non-U.S.Holders should consult their own tax\nadvisors regarding the U.S. and non-U.S.tax\nconsiderations of acquiring, holding, and disposing of\ndebt securities. Payments of Interest.Under current U.S.\nfederal income tax law and subject to the discussions\nbelow concerning backup withholding and FATCA, principal\n(and premium, if any) and interest payments, including\nany OID, that are received from us or our agent and that\nare not effectively connected with the conduct by the\nNon-U.S.Holder of a trade or business within the United\nStates, or a permanent establishment maintained in the\nUnited States if certain tax treaties apply, generally\nwill not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding\ntax except as provided below. Interest, including any\nOID, may be subject to a 30% withholding tax (or less\nunder an applicable treaty, if any) if:\n                                                         \n      a Non-U.S. Holder actually or constructively owns  \n      10% or more of the total combined voting power of  \n      all classes                                        \n      of our stock entitled to vote;                     \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      a Non-U.S. Holder is a \u0093controlled foreign          \n      corporation\u0094 for U.S. federal income tax purposes   \n      that is                                            \n      related to us (directly or indirectly) through     \n      stock ownership;                                   \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      a Non-U.S. Holder is a bank extending credit       \n      under a loan agreement in the ordinary course of   \n      its trade or                                       \n      business;                                          \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      the interest payments on the debt security are     \n      determined by reference to the income, profits,    \n      changes in the value of property or other          \n      attributes of                                      \n      the debtor or a related party (other than          \n      payments that are based on the value of a          \n      security or index of securities that are, and      \n      will continue to be, actively traded within the    \n      meaning of Section\u00a01092(d) of the Code, and that   \n      are not nor will                                   \n      be a \u0093United States real property interest\u0094 as       \n      described in Section\u00a0897(c)(1) or 897(g) of the    \n      Code); or                                          \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      the Non-U.S. Holder does not satisfy the           \n      certification requirements described below.        \n                                                         \nA Non-U.S.Holder generally will satisfy the certification\nrequirements if either: (A) the Non-U.S.Holder certifies\nto the applicable withholding agent, under penalties of\nperjury, that it is a non-UnitedStates person and\nprovides its name and address (which certification may\ngenerally be made on an IRS Form W-8BENor W-8BEN-E,or a\nsuccessor form), or (B) a securities clearing\norganization, bank, or other financial institution that\nholds customer securities in the ordinary course of its\ntrade or business (a \u0093financial institution\u0094) and holds\nthe debt security certifies to the applicable withholding\nagent under penalties of perjury that either it or\nanother financial institution has received the required\nstatement from the Non-U.S.Holder certifying that it is a\nnon-UnitedStates person and furnishes us with a copy of\nthe statement. Payments not meeting the requirements set\nforth above and thus subject to withholding of U.S.\nfederal income tax may nevertheless be exempt from\nwithholding (or subject to withholding at a reduced rate)\nif the Non-U.S.Holder provides the applicable withholding\nagent with a properly executed IRS Form W-8BENor\nW-8BEN-E(or successor form) claiming an exemption from,\nor reduction in, withholding under the benefit of a tax\ntreaty, or IRS Form W-8ECI(or other applicable form)\nstating that interest paid on the debt securities is not\nsubject to withholding tax because it is effectively\nconnected with the conduct of a trade or business within\nthe United States as discussed below. To claim benefits\nunder an income tax treaty, a Non-U.S.Holder must obtain\na 118\n\ntaxpayer identification number and certify as to its\neligibility under the appropriate treaty\u0092s limitations on\nbenefits article. In addition, special rules may apply to\nclaims for treaty benefits made by Non-U.S.Holders that\nare entities rather than individuals. A Non-U.S.Holder\nthat is eligible for a reduced rate of U.S. federal\nwithholding tax pursuant to an income tax treaty may\nobtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by filing\nan appropriate claim for refund with the IRS.\n\nSale, Exchange, or Retirement of Debt Securities.A\nNon-U.S.Holder generally will not be subject to U.S.\nfederal income or withholding tax on any capital gain or\nmarket discount realized on the sale, exchange,\nretirement, or other disposition of debt securities,\nprovided that: (a) the gain is not effectively connected\nwith the conduct of a trade or business within the United\nStates, or a permanent establishment maintained in the\nUnited States if certain tax treaties apply, (b) in the\ncase of a Non-U.S.Holder that is an individual, the\nNon-U.S.Holder is not present in the United States for\n183 days or more in the taxable year of the sale,\nexchange, or other disposition of the debt security, and\n(c) the Non-U.S.Holder is not subject to tax pursuant to\ncertain provisions of U.S. federal income tax law\napplicable to certain expatriates. An individual\nNon-U.S.Holder who is present in the United States for\n183 days or more in the taxable year of sale, exchange,\nor other disposition of a debt security, provided that\ncertain other conditions are met, will be subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax at a rate of 30% on the gain realized\non the sale, exchange, or other disposition of such debt\nsecurity.\n\nIncome Effectively Connected with a Trade or Business\nwithin the United States. If a Non-U.S.Holder of a debt\nsecurity is engaged in the conduct of a trade or business\nwithin the United States and if interest (including any\nOID) on the debt security, or gain realized on the sale,\nexchange, or other disposition of the debt security, is\neffectively connected with the conduct of such trade or\nbusiness (and, if certain tax treaties apply, is\nattributable to a permanent establishment maintained by\nthe Non-U.S.Holder in the United States), the\nNon-U.S.Holder, although exempt from U.S. federal\nwithholding tax (provided that the certification\nrequirements discussed above are satisfied), generally\nwill be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such\ninterest (including any OID) or gain on a net income\nbasis in the same manner as if it were a U.S. Holder.\nNon-U.S.Holders should read the material under the\nheading \u0093\u0097Consequences to U.S. Holders\u0094 for a description\nof the U.S. federal income tax consequences of acquiring,\nowning, and disposing of debt securities. In addition, if\nsuch Non-U.S.Holder is a foreign corporation, it may also\nbe subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or such\nlower rate provided by an applicable U.S. income tax\ntreaty) of a portion of its earnings and profits for the\ntaxable year that are effectively connected with its\nconduct of a trade or business in the United States,\nsubject to certain adjustments.\n\nConvertible, Renewable, Extendible, Indexed, and Other\nDebt Securities\n\nSpecial U.S. federal income tax rules are applicable to\ncertain other debt securities, including contingent\nNon-U.S.Dollar Denominated Debt Securities, debt\nsecurities that may be convertible into or exercisable or\nexchangeable for our common or preferred stock or other\nsecurities or debt or equity securities of one or more\nthird parties, debt securities the payments on which are\ndetermined or partially determined by reference to any\nindex and other debt securities that are subject to the\nrules governing contingent payment obligations, any\nrenewable and extendible debt securities and any debt\nsecurities providing for the periodic payment of\nprincipal over the life of the debt security. The\nmaterial U.S. federal income tax considerations with\nrespect to these debt securities will be discussed in the\napplicable supplement.\n\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting\n\nIn general, in the case of a U.S. Holder, other than\ncertain exempt holders, we and other payors are required\nto report to the IRS all payments of principal, any\npremium, and interest on\n\n119\n\nthe debt security, and the accrual of OID on an OID debt\nsecurity. In addition, we and other payors generally are\nrequired to report to the IRS any payment of proceeds of\nthe sale of a debt security before maturity.\nAdditionally, backup withholding generally will apply to\nany payments, including payments of OID, if a U.S. Holder\nfails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification\nnumber and certify that the taxpayer identification\nnumber is correct, the U.S. Holder is notified by the IRS\nthat it has failed to report all interest and dividends\nrequired to be shown on its U.S. federal income tax\nreturns or a U.S. Holder does not certify that it has not\nunderreported its interest and dividend income.\n\nIn the case of a Non-U.S.Holder, backup withholding and\ninformation reporting will not apply to payments made if\nthe Non-U.S.Holder provides the required certification\nthat it is not a United States person, or the\nNon-U.S.Holder otherwise establishes an exemption,\nprovided that the payor or withholding agent does not\nhave actual knowledge or reason to know that the holder\nis a United States person, or that the conditions of any\nexemption are not satisfied. However, we and other payors\nare required to report payments of interest on the debt\nsecurities on IRS Form 1042-Seven if the payments are not\notherwise subject to information reporting requirements.\n\nAny amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules\nwill be allowed as a refund or a credit against a\nholder\u0092s U.S. federal income tax liability provided the\nrequired information is furnished to the IRS.\n\nTaxation of Common Stock, Preferred Stock, and Depositary\nShares\n\nThis subsection describes the material U.S. federal\nincome tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and\ndisposition of the common stock, preferred stock and\ndepositary shares offered in this prospectus.\n\nTaxation of Holders of Depositary Shares\n\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, holders of\ndepositary shares generally will be treated as if they\nwere the holders of the preferred stock represented by\nsuch depositary shares. Accordingly, such holders will be\nentitled to take into account, for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes, income, and deductions to which they would\nbe entitled if they were holders of such preferred stock,\nas described more fully below. Exchanges of preferred\nstock for depositary shares and depositary shares for\npreferred stock generally will not be subject to U.S.\nfederal income taxation.\n\nConsequences to U.S. Holders\n\nThe following is a summary of the material U.S. federal\nincome tax consequences that will apply to U.S. Holders\nof our common stock, preferred stock, and depositary\nshares.\n\nDistributions on Common Stock, Preferred Stock, and\nDepositary Shares.Distributions made to U.S. Holders out\nof our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as\ndetermined for U.S. federal income tax purposes, will be\nincluded in the income of a U.S. Holder as dividend\nincome and will be subject to tax as ordinary income.\nDividends received by a non-corporateU.S. Holder that\nconstitute \u0093qualified dividend income\u0094 are generally\nsubject to tax at a maximum rate applicable to net long-\nterm capital gains, provided that certain holding period\nand other requirements are met. Dividends received by a\ncorporate U.S. Holder, except as described in the next\nsubsection, generally will be eligible for the 50%\ndividends-received deduction.\n\nDistributions in excess of our current and accumulated\nearnings and profits will not be taxable to a U.S. Holder\nto the extent that the distributions do not exceed the\nU.S. Holder\u0092s adjusted tax\n\n120\n\nbasis in the shares, but rather will reduce the adjusted\ntax basis of such shares. To the extent that\ndistributions in excess of our current and accumulated\nearnings and profits exceed the U.S. Holder\u0092s adjusted\ntax basis in the shares, such distributions will be\ntreated as gain from the disposition of our common stock,\npreferred stock or depositary shares. In addition, a\ncorporate U.S. Holder will not be entitled to the\ndividends- received deduction on this portion of a\ndistribution. Limitations on Dividends-Received\nDeduction.A corporate U.S. Holder may not be entitled to\ntake the 50% dividends-received deduction in all\ncircumstances. Prospective corporate investors in our\ncommon stock, preferred stock, or depositary shares\nshould consider the effect of:\n                                                         \n      Section\u00a0246A of the Code, which reduces the        \n      dividends-received deduction allowed to a          \n      corporate U.S. Holder that has incurred            \n      indebtedness that is                               \n      \u0093directly attributable\u0094 to an investment in          \n      portfolio stock, which may include our common      \n      stock, preferred stock, and depositary shares;     \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      Section\u00a0246(c) of the Code, which, among other     \n      things, disallows the dividends-received           \n      deduction in respect of any dividend on a share    \n      of stock                                           \n      that is held for less than the minimum holding     \n      period (generally, for common stock, at least 46   \n      days during the 91 day period beginning on the     \n      date which is 45 days before the date on which     \n      such share becomes                                 \n      ex-dividend with respect to such dividend); and    \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      Section\u00a01059 of the Code, which, under certain     \n      circumstances, reduces the basis of stock for      \n      purposes of calculating gain or loss in a          \n      subsequent                                         \n      disposition by the portion of any \u0093extraordinary    \n      dividend\u0094 (as defined below) that is eligible for   \n      the dividends-received deduction.                  \n                                                         \nExtraordinary Dividends. A corporate U.S. Holder will be\nrequired to reduce its tax basis (but not below zero) in\nour common stock, preferred stock, or depositary shares\nby the nontaxed portion of any \u0093extraordinary dividend\u0094\nif the stock was not held for more than two years before\nthe earliest of the date such dividend is declared,\nannounced, or agreed. Generally, the nontaxed portion of\nan extraordinary dividend is the amount excluded from\nincome by operation of the dividends-received deduction.\nAn extraordinary dividend generally would be a dividend\nthat:\n                                                         \n      in the case of common stock, equals or exceeds     \n      10% of the corporate U.S. Holder\u0092s adjusted tax     \n      basis in the common stock, treating all dividends  \n      having ex-dividend dates within an 85 day period   \n      as one dividend; or                                \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      in the case of preferred stock, equals or exceeds  \n      5% of the corporate U.S. Holder\u0092s adjusted tax      \n      basis in the preferred stock, treating all         \n      dividends having ex-dividend dates within an 85    \n      day period as one dividend; or                     \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      exceeds 20% of the corporate U.S. Holder\u0092s          \n      adjusted tax basis in the stock, treating all      \n      dividends having                                   \n      ex-dividend dates within a 365 day period as one   \n      dividend.                                          \n                                                         \nIn determining whether a dividend paid on stock is an\nextraordinary dividend, a corporate U.S. Holder may elect\nto substitute the fair market value of the stock for its\ntax basis for purposes of applying these tests if the\nfair market value as of the day before the ex-\ndividenddate is established to the satisfaction of the\nSecretary of the Treasury. An extraordinary dividend also\nincludes any amount treated as a dividend in the case of\na redemption that is either non-prorata as to all\nstockholders or in partial liquidation of the\ncorporation, regardless of the stockholder\u0092s holding\nperiod and regardless of the size of the dividend. Any\npart of the nontaxed portion of an extraordinary dividend\nthat is not applied to reduce the corporate U.S. Holder\u0092s\ntax basis as a 121\n\nresult of the limitation on reducing its basis below zero\nwould be treated as gain from the disposition of such\nstock and would be recognized in the taxable year in\nwhich the extraordinary dividend is received. Corporate\nU.S. Holders should consult with their own tax advisors\nwith respect to the possible application of the\nextraordinary dividend provisions of the Code to the\nownership or disposition of common stock, preferred\nstock, or depositary shares in their particular\ncircumstances. Sale, Exchange, or other Taxable\nDisposition.Upon the sale, exchange, or other taxable\ndisposition of our common stock, preferred stock, or\ndepositary shares (other than by redemption or repurchase\nby us), a U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or\nloss equal to the difference between the amount realized\nupon the sale, exchange, or other taxable disposition and\nthe U.S. Holder\u0092s adjusted tax basis in the shares. The\namount realized by the U.S. Holder will include the\namount of any cash and the fair market value of any other\nproperty received upon the sale, exchange, or other\ntaxable disposition of the shares. A U.S. Holder\u0092s tax\nbasis in a share generally will be equal to the cost of\nthe share to such U.S. Holder, which may be adjusted for\ncertain subsequent events (for example, if the U.S.\nHolder receives a nondividend distribution, as described\nabove). Gain or loss realized on the sale, exchange, or\nother taxable disposition of our common stock, preferred\nstock, or depositary shares generally will be capital\ngain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss\nif the shares have been held for more than one year. Net\nlong-term capital gain recognized by an individual U.S.\nHolder is generally taxed at preferential rates. The\nability of U.S. Holders to deduct capital losses is\nsubject to limitations under the Code. Redemption or\nRepurchase of Common Stock, Preferred Stock, or\nDepositary Shares. If we are permitted to and redeem or\nrepurchase a U.S. Holder\u0092s common stock, preferred stock,\nor depositary shares, the redemption or repurchase\ngenerally would be a taxable event for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes. A U.S. Holder would be treated as if\nit had sold its shares if the redemption or repurchase:\n                                                         \n      results in a complete termination of the U.S.      \n      Holder\u0092s stock interest in us;                      \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      is substantially disproportionate with respect to  \n      the U.S. Holder; or                                \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      is not essentially equivalent to a dividend with   \n      respect to the U.S. Holder, in each case as        \n      determined under the Code and applicable treasury  \n      regulations.                                       \n                                                         \nIn determining whether any of these tests has been met,\nshares of stock considered to be owned by a U.S. Holder\nby reason of certain constructive ownership rules set\nforth in Section 318 of the Code, as well as shares\nactually owned, must be taken into account. If we redeem\nor repurchase a U.S. Holder\u0092s shares in a redemption or\nrepurchase that meets one of the tests described above,\nthe U.S. Holder generally would recognize taxable gain or\nloss equal to the sum of the amount of cash and fair\nmarket value of property (other than our stock or the\nstock of a successor to us) received less the U.S.\nHolder\u0092s tax basis in the shares redeemed or repurchased.\nThis gain or loss generally would be long-term capital\ngain or capital loss if the shares have been held for\nmore than one year. If a redemption or repurchase does\nnot meet any of the tests described above, a U.S. Holder\ngenerally will be taxed on the cash and fair market value\nof the property received as a dividend to the extent paid\nout of our current and accumulated earnings and profits.\nAny amount in excess of our current and accumulated\nearnings and profits would first reduce the U.S. Holder\u0092s\ntax basis in the shares and thereafter would be treated\nas capital gain. If a redemption or repurchase is treated\n122\n\nas a distribution that is taxable as a dividend, the U.S.\nHolder\u0092s tax basis in the redeemed or repurchased shares\nwould be transferred to the remaining shares of our stock\nthat the U.S. Holder owns, if any.\n\nSpecial rules apply if we redeem our common stock,\npreferred stock, or depositary shares for our debt\nsecurities. We will discuss any special U.S. federal\nincome tax considerations in the applicable supplement if\nwe have the option to redeem our common stock, preferred\nstock, or depositary shares for our debt securities.\n\nAdditional Medicare Tax on Unearned Income. Certain U.S.\nHolders, including individuals, estates and trusts, are\nsubject to an additional 3.8% Medicare tax on unearned\nincome. For individual U.S. Holders, the additional\nMedicare tax applies to the lesser of (i) \u0093net investment\nincome\u0094 or (ii) the excess of \u0093modified adjusted gross\nincome\u0094 over $200,000 ($250,000 if married and filing\njointly or $125,000 if married and filing separately).\n\u0093Net investment income\u0094 generally equals the taxpayer\u0092s\ngross investment income reduced by the deductions that\nare allocable to such income. Investment income generally\nincludes passive income such as dividends and capital\ngains. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax\nadvisors regarding the implications of the additional\nMedicare tax resulting from an investment in the\npreferred stock, common stock, or depositary shares.\n\nConsequences to Non-U.S.Holders\n\nThe following is a summary of the material U.S. federal\nincome tax consequences that will apply to\nNon-U.S.Holders of our common stock, preferred stock, and\ndepositary shares.\n\nDistributions on Common Stock, Preferred Stock, and\nDepositary Shares.Distributions made to Non-U.S.Holders\nout of our current or accumulated earnings and profits,\nas determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and\nthat are not effectively connected with the conduct by\nthe Non-U.S.Holder of a trade or business within the\nUnited States, or a permanent establishment maintained in\nthe United States if certain tax treaties apply,\ngenerally will be subject to U.S. federal income and\nwithholding tax at a rate of 30% (or lower rate under an\napplicable treaty, if any). Subject to the discussions\nbelow concerning backup withholding and FATCA, payments\nsubject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax may\nnevertheless be exempt from withholding (or subject to\nwithholding at a reduced rate) if the Non-U.S.Holder\nprovides us with a properly executed IRS Form W-8BENor\nW-8BEN-E(or successor form) claiming an exemption from,\nor reduction in, withholding under the benefit of a tax\ntreaty, or IRS Form W-8ECI(or other applicable form)\nstating that a dividend paid on our shares is not subject\nto withholding tax because it is effectively connected\nwith the conduct of a trade or business within the United\nStates, as discussed below.\n\nTo claim benefits under an income tax treaty, a\nNon-U.S.Holder must certify to us or the applicable\nwithholding agent, under penalties of perjury, that it is\na non-UnitedStates person and provide its name and\naddress (which certification may generally be made on an\nIRS Form W-8BENor W-8BEN-E,or a successor form), obtain\nand provide a taxpayer identification number, and certify\nas to its eligibility under the appropriate treaty\u0092s\nlimitations on benefits article. In addition, special\nrules may apply to claims for treaty benefits made by\nNon-U.S.Holders that are entities rather than\nindividuals. A Non-U.S.Holder that is eligible for a\nreduced rate of U.S. federal withholding tax under an\nincome tax treaty may obtain a refund of any excess\namounts withheld by filing an appropriate claim for\nrefund with the IRS.\n\nSale, Exchange, or other Taxable Disposition.Subject to\nthe discussions below concerning backup withholding and\nFATCA, A Non-U.S.Holder generally will not be subject to\nU.S. federal\n\n123\n\nincome or withholding tax on any capital gain realized on\nthe sale, exchange, or other taxable disposition of our\ncommon stock, preferred stock, or depositary shares,\nprovided that: (a) the gain is not effectively connected\nwith the conduct of a trade or business within the United\nStates, or a permanent establishment maintained in the\nUnited States if certain tax treaties apply, (b) in the\ncase of a Non-U.S.Holder that is an individual, the\nNon-U.S.Holder is not present in the United States for\n183 days or more in the taxable year of the sale,\nexchange, or other disposition of the shares, (c) the\nNon-U.S.Holder is not subject to tax pursuant to certain\nprovisions of U.S. federal income tax law applicable to\ncertain expatriates, and (d) we are not nor have we been\na \u0093United States real property holding corporation\u0094 for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes. An individual\nNon-U.S.Holder who is present in the United States for\n183 days or more in the taxable year of sale, exchange,\nor other disposition of our common stock, preferred\nstock, or depositary shares, provided that certain other\nconditions are met, will be subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax at a rate of 30% on the gains realized on the\nsale, exchange, or other disposition of such shares.\n\nWe believe that we are not currently, and do not\nanticipate becoming, a \u0093United States real property\nholding corporation\u0094 for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes.\n\nIncome Effectively Connected with a Trade or Business\nwithin the United States. If a Non-U.S.Holder of our\ncommon stock, preferred stock, or depositary shares is\nengaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the\nUnited States and if dividends on the shares, or gain\nrealized on the sale, exchange, or other disposition of\nthe shares, are effectively connected with the conduct of\nsuch trade or business (and, if certain tax treaties\napply, is attributable to a permanent establishment\nmaintained by the Non-U.S.Holder in the United States),\nthe Non-U.S.Holder, although exempt from U.S. federal\nwithholding tax (provided that the certification\nrequirements discussed above are satisfied), generally\nwill be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such\ndividends or gain on a net income basis in the same\nmanner as if it were a U.S. Holder. Non-U.S.Holders\nshould read the material under the heading \u0093\u0097Consequences\nto U.S. Holders\u0094 above for a description of the U.S.\nfederal income tax consequences of acquiring, owning, and\ndisposing of our common stock, preferred stock, or\ndepositary shares. In addition, if such Non-U.S.Holder is\na foreign corporation, it may also be subject to a branch\nprofits tax equal to 30% (or such lower rate provided by\nan applicable U.S. income tax treaty) of a portion of its\nearnings and profits for the taxable year that are\neffectively connected with its conduct of a trade or\nbusiness in the United States, subject to certain\nadjustments.\n\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting\n\nIn general, in the case of a U.S. Holder, other than\ncertain exempt holders, we and other payors are required\nto report to the IRS all payments of dividends on our\ncommon stock, preferred stock, or depositary shares. In\naddition, we and other payors generally are required to\nreport to the IRS any payment of proceeds of the sale of\ncommon stock, preferred stock, or depositary shares.\nAdditionally, backup withholding generally will apply to\nany dividend payment and to proceeds received on a sale\nor exchange if a U.S. Holder fails to provide an accurate\ntaxpayer identification number and certify that the\ntaxpayer identification number is correct, the U.S.\nHolder is notified by the IRS that it has failed to\nreport all dividends required to be shown on its U.S.\nfederal income tax returns, or the U.S. Holder does not\ncertify that it has not underreported its interest and\ndividend income.\n\nIn the case of a Non-U.S.Holder, backup withholding and\ninformation reporting will not apply to payments made if\nthe Non-U.S.Holder provides the required certification\nthat it is not a United States person, as described\nabove, or the Non-U.S.Holder otherwise establishes an\nexemption, provided that the payor or withholding agent\ndoes not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the\nholder is a United States person, or that the conditions\nof any exemption are not satisfied.\n\n124\n\nAny amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules\nwill be allowed as a refund or a credit against a\nholder\u0092s U.S. federal income tax liability provided the\nrequired information is furnished to the IRS.\n\nConvertible Preferred Stock and Other Equity Securities\n\nSpecial U.S. federal income tax rules are applicable to\ncertain other of our equity securities, including\npreferred stock convertible into or exercisable or\nexchangeable for our common stock or other securities.\nThe material U.S. federal income tax considerations with\nrespect to these securities will be discussed in the\napplicable supplement. Investors should consult with\ntheir own tax advisors regarding the specific U.S.\nfederal income tax considerations with respect to these\nsecurities.\n\nTaxation of Warrants\n\nThe applicable supplement will contain a discussion of\nany special U.S. federal income tax considerations with\nrespect to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of\nwarrants offered in this prospectus, including any tax\nconsiderations relating to the specific terms of the\nwarrants. Investors considering the purchase of warrants\nwe are offering should carefully examine the applicable\nsupplement regarding the special U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations, if any, of the acquisition, ownership and\ndisposition of the warrants.\n\nInvestors should consult with their own tax advisors\nregarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences and\nthe tax consequences of any other taxing jurisdiction\nrelating to the ownership and disposition of warrants we\nare offering in light of their investment or tax\ncircumstances.\n\nTaxation of Purchase Contracts\n\nThe applicable supplement will contain a discussion of\nany special U.S. federal income tax considerations with\nrespect to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of\npurchase contracts offered in this prospectus, including\nany tax considerations relating to the specific terms of\nthe purchase contracts. Investors considering the\npurchase of purchase contracts we are offering should\ncarefully examine the applicable supplement regarding the\nspecial U.S. federal income tax considerations, if any,\nof the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the\npurchase contracts.\n\nInvestors should consult with their own tax advisors\nregarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences and\nthe tax consequences of any other taxing jurisdiction\nrelating to the ownership and disposition of the purchase\ncontracts in light of their investment or tax\ncircumstances.\n\nTaxation of Units\n\nThe applicable supplement will contain a discussion of\nany special U.S. federal income tax considerations with\nrespect to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of\nunits that we are offering, including any tax\nconsiderations relating to the specific terms of the\nunits. Investors considering the purchase of units that\nwe are offering should carefully examine the applicable\nsupplement regarding the special U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences, if any, of the acquisition, ownership and\ndisposition of the units.\n\nInvestors should consult with their own tax advisors\nregarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences and\nthe tax consequences of any other taxing jurisdiction\nrelating to the ownership and disposition of units\ncomprised of one or more of the securities we are\noffering in light of their investment or tax\ncircumstances.\n\n125\n\nReportable Transactions\n\nApplicable Treasury regulations require taxpayers that\nparticipate in \u0093reportable transactions\u0094 to disclose\ntheir participation to the IRS by attaching Form 8886 to\ntheir U.S. federal tax returns and to retain a copy of\nall documents and records related to the transaction. In\naddition, \u0093material advisors\u0094 with respect to such a\ntransaction may be required to file returns and maintain\nrecords, including lists identifying investors in the\ntransactions, and to furnish those records to the IRS\nupon demand. A transaction may be a \u0093reportable\ntransaction\u0094 based on any of several criteria, one or\nmore of which may be present with respect to an\ninvestment in the securities that we are offering.\nWhether an investment in these securities constitutes a\n\u0093reportable transaction\u0094 for any investor depends on the\ninvestor\u0092s particular circumstances. The Treasury\nregulations provide that, in addition to certain other\ntransactions, a \u0093loss transaction\u0094 constitutes a\n\u0093reportable transaction.\u0094 A \u0093loss transaction\u0094 is any\ntransaction resulting in the taxpayer claiming a loss\nunder Section 165 of the Code, in an amount equal to or\nin excess of certain threshold amounts, subject to\ncertain exceptions. The Treasury regulations specifically\nprovide that a loss resulting from a \u0093Section 988\ntransaction\u0094 will constitute a Section 165 loss, and\ncertain exceptions will not be available if the loss from\nsale or exchange is treated as ordinary under Section\n988. In general, certain securities issued in a foreign\ncurrency will be subject to the rules governing foreign\ncurrency exchange gain or loss. Therefore, losses\nrealized with respect to such a security may constitute a\nSection 988 transaction, and a holder of such a security\nthat recognizes exchange loss in an amount that exceeds\nthe loss threshold amount applicable to that holder may\nbe required to file Form 8886. Investors should consult\ntheir own tax advisors concerning any possible disclosure\nobligation they may have with respect to their investment\nin the securities that we are offering and should be\naware that, should any \u0093material advisor\u0094 determine that\nthe return filing or investor list maintenance\nrequirements apply to such a transaction, they would be\nrequired to comply with these requirements.\n\nForeign Account Tax Compliance Act\n\nLegislation commonly known as \u0093FATCA\u0094 (sections 1471\nthrough 1474 of the Code) imposes a 30% U.S. withholding\ntax on certain U.S. source payments, including interest\n(and OID), dividends, other fixed or determinable annual\nor periodical gain, profits, and income, and on the gross\nproceeds from a disposition of property of a type which\ncan produce U.S. source interest or dividends\n(\u0093Withholdable Payments\u0094), if paid to a foreign financial\ninstitution (including amounts paid to a foreign\nfinancial institution on behalf of a holder), unless such\ninstitution enters into an agreement with the Treasury to\ncollect and provide to the Treasury certain information\nregarding U.S. financial account holders, including\ncertain account holders that are foreign entities with\nU.S. owners, with such institution or otherwise complies\nwith FATCA. FATCA also generally imposes a withholding\ntax of 30% on Withholdable Payments made to a non-\nfinancialforeign entity unless such entity provides the\nwithholding agent with a certification that it does not\nhave any substantial U.S. owners or a certification\nidentifying the direct and indirect substantial U.S.\nowners of the entity. Under certain circumstances, a\nholder may be eligible for refunds or credits of such\ntaxes.\n\nThese withholding and reporting requirements generally\napply to U.S. source periodic payments and to payments of\ngross proceeds from a sale or redemption. However, under\nproposed Treasury regulations (the preamble to which\nspecifies that taxpayers are permitted to rely on them\npending finalization), no withholding under FATCA will\napply to payments of gross proceeds from a sale or\nredemption (other than income treated as U.S.-source\n\u0093fixed or determinable annual or periodical\u0094 income). If\nwe (or an applicable withholding agent) determine\nwithholding under FATCA is appropriate, we (or such\nagent) will withhold tax at the applicable statutory\nrate, without being required to pay any additional\namounts in respect of such withholding. Foreign financial\ninstitutions and non-financialforeign entities located in\njurisdictions that have an\n\n126\n\nintergovernmental agreement with the United States\ngoverning FATCA may be subject to different rules.\nHolders are urged to consult with their own tax advisors\nregarding the possible implications of FATCA on their\ninvestment in the debt securities, preferred stock,\ndepositary shares, or common stock.\n\n127\n\nPLAN OF DISTRIBUTION (CONFLICTS OF INTEREST) We may sell\nthe securities offered under this prospectus:\n                             \n      through underwriters;  \n                             \n                        \n      through dealers;  \n                        \n                          \n      through agents;\u00a0or  \n                          \n                               \n      directly to purchasers.  \n                               \nIn addition, we may issue the securities as a dividend or\ndistribution or in a subscription rights offering to our\nexisting security holders. The underwriters, dealers, or\nagents may include BofA Securities, Inc. (\u0093BofAS\u0094), or\nany of our other broker-dealer affiliates. Each\nsupplement relating to an offering of securities will\nstate the terms of the offering, including:\n                                                         \n      the names of any underwriters, dealers, or         \n      agents;                                            \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      the public offering or purchase price of the       \n      offered securities and the net proceeds that we    \n      will receive from the sale;                        \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      any underwriting discounts and commissions or      \n      other items constituting underwriters\u0092              \n      compensation;                                      \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      any discounts, commissions, or fees allowed or     \n      paid to dealers or agents;\u00a0and                     \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      any securities exchange on which the offered       \n      securities may be listed.                          \n                                                         \nDistribution Through Underwriters We may offer and sell\nsecurities from time to time to one or more underwriters\nwho would purchase the securities as principal for resale\nto the public, either on a firm commitment or best\nefforts basis. If we sell securities to underwriters, we\nwill execute an underwriting agreement with them at the\ntime of the sale and will name them in the applicable\nsupplement. In connection with these sales, the\nunderwriters may be deemed to have received compensation\nfrom us in the form of underwriting discounts and\ncommissions. The underwriters also may receive\ncommissions from purchasers of securities for whom they\nmay act as agent. Unless we specify otherwise in the\napplicable supplement, the underwriters will not be\nobligated to purchase the securities unless the\nconditions set forth in the underwriting agreement are\nsatisfied, and if the underwriters purchase any of the\nsecurities, they will be required to purchase all of the\noffered securities. The underwriters may acquire the\nsecurities for their own account and may resell the\nsecurities from time to time in one or more transactions,\nincluding negotiated transactions, at a fixed public\noffering price or varying prices determined at the time\nof sale. The underwriters may sell the offered securities\nto or through dealers, and those dealers may receive\ndiscounts, concessions, or commissions from the\nunderwriters as well as from the purchasers for whom they\nmay act as agent. Any initial public offering price and\nany discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid\nto dealers may be changed from time to time. 128\n\nDistribution Through Dealers\n\nWe may offer and sell securities from time to time to one\nor more dealers who would purchase the securities as\nprincipal. The dealers then may resell the offered\nsecurities to the public at fixed or varying prices to be\ndetermined by those dealers at the time of resale. We\nwill set forth the names of the dealers and the terms of\nthe transaction in the applicable supplement.\n\nDistribution Through Agents\n\nWe may offer and sell securities on a continuous basis\nthrough agents that become parties to an underwriting or\ndistribution agreement. We will name any agent involved\nin the offer and sale, and describe any commissions\npayable by us in the applicable supplement. Unless we\nspecify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the agent\nwill be acting on a best efforts basis during the\nappointment period.\n\nDirect Sales\n\nWe may sell directly to, and solicit offers from,\ninstitutional investors or others who may be deemed to be\nunderwriters, as defined in the Securities Act of 1933,\nfor any resale of the securities. We will describe the\nterms of any sales of this kind in the applicable\nsupplement.\n\nGeneral Information\n\nUnderwriters, dealers, or agents participating in an\noffering of securities may be deemed to be underwriters,\nand any discounts and commissions received by them and\nany profit realized by them on resale of the offered\nsecurities for whom they act as agent, may be deemed to\nbe underwriting discounts and commissions under the\nSecurities Act of 1933.\n\nWe may offer to sell securities either at a fixed price\nor at prices that may vary, at market prices prevailing\nat the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing\nmarket prices, or at negotiated prices. Securities may be\nsold in connection with a remarketing after their\npurchase by one or more firms including our affiliates,\nacting as principal for their own accounts or as our\nagent.\n\nIn connection with an underwritten offering of the\nsecurities, the underwriters may engage in overallotment,\nstabilizing transactions and syndicate covering\ntransactions in accordance with Regulation M under the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934. Overallotment involves\nsales in excess of the offering size, which creates a\nshort position for the underwriters. The underwriters may\nenter bids for, and purchase, securities in the open\nmarket in order to stabilize the price of the securities.\nSyndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the\nsecurities in the open market after the distribution has\nbeen completed in order to cover short positions. In\naddition, the underwriting syndicate may reclaim selling\nconcessions allowed to an underwriter or a dealer for\ndistributing the securities in the offering if the\nsyndicate repurchases previously distributed securities\nin transactions to cover syndicate short positions, in\nstabilization transactions, or otherwise. These\nactivities may cause the price of the securities to be\nhigher than it would otherwise be. Those activities, if\ncommenced, may be discontinued at any time.\n\nOrdinarily, each issue of securities will be a new issue,\nand there will be no established trading market for any\nsecurity other than our common stock prior to its\noriginal issue date. We may not list any particular\nseries of securities on a securities exchange or\nquotation system. Any underwriters to whom or agents\nthrough whom the offered securities are sold for offering\nand sale may make a market in the offered securities.\nHowever, any underwriters or agents that make a market\nwill not be obligated to do so and may stop doing so at\nany time without notice. We cannot assure you that there\nwill be a liquid trading market for the offered\nsecurities.\n\n129\n\nIf we offer securities in a subscription rights offering\nto our existing security holders, we may enter into a\nstandby underwriting agreement with dealers, acting as\nstandby underwriters. We may pay the standby underwriters\na commitment fee for the securities they commit to\npurchase on a standby basis. If we do not enter into a\nstandby underwriting arrangement, we may retain a dealer-\nmanager to manage a subscription rights offering for us.\n\nUnder agreements entered into with us, underwriters and\nagents may be entitled to indemnification by us against\ncertain civil liabilities, including liabilities under\nthe Securities Act of 1933, or to contribution for\npayments the underwriters or agents may be required to\nmake.\n\nIn the applicable supplement, we will specify the\nsettlement period for the offered securities. Under Rule\n15c6-1of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, trades in\nthe secondary market generally are required to settle in\ntwo business days, unless the parties to a trade\nexpressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, if we specify a\nlonger settlement cycle in the applicable supplement for\nan offering of securities, purchasers who wish to trade\nthose securities on any date prior to two business days\nbefore delivery of such securities, will be required to\nspecify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of\nthe trade to prevent a failed settlement and should\nconsult their own advisors in connection with that\nelection.\n\nMarket-Making Transactions by Affiliates\n\nFollowing the initial distribution of securities, our\nbroker-dealer affiliates, including BofAS, may buy and\nsell the securities in secondary market transactions as\npart of their business as broker-dealers. Resales of this\nkind may occur in the open market or may be privately\nnegotiated, at prevailing market prices at the time of\nresale or at related or negotiated prices. This\nprospectus and any related supplements may be used by one\nor more of our affiliates in connection with these\nmarket-making transactions to the extent permitted by\napplicable law. Our affiliates may act as principal or\nagent in these transactions.\n\nThe aggregate initial offering price specified on the\ncover of the applicable supplement will relate to the\ninitial offering of securities not yet issued as of the\ndate of this prospectus. This amount does not include any\nsecurities to be sold in market-making transactions. The\nsecurities to be sold in market-making transactions\ninclude securities issued after the date of this\nprospectus.\n\nInformation about the trade and settlement dates, as well\nas the purchase price, for a market-making transaction\nwill be provided to the purchaser in a separate\nconfirmation of sale.\n\nUnless we or our agent inform you in your confirmation of\nsale that the security is being purchased in its original\noffering and sale, you may assume that you are purchasing\nthe security in a market-making transaction.\n\nConflicts of Interest\n\nBofAS is our wholly-owned subsidiary, and unless\notherwise set forth in the applicable supplement, we will\nreceive the net proceeds of any offering in which BofAS\nparticipates as an underwriter, dealer or agent. The\noffer and sale of any securities by BofAS, or any of our\nother broker-dealer affiliates that is a member of the\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., or\n\u0093FINRA,\u0094 will comply with the requirements of FINRA Rule\n5121 regarding a FINRA member firm\u0092s offer and sale of\nsecurities of an affiliate. As required by FINRA Rule\n5121, any such offer and sale will not be made to any\ndiscretionary account without the prior approval of the\ncustomer.\n\nThe maximum commission or discount to be received by any\nFINRA member or independent broker-dealer will not be\ngreater than 8% of the initial gross proceeds from the\nsale of any security being sold.\n\n130\n\nThe underwriters, agents and their affiliates may engage\nin financial or other business transactions with us and\nour subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business.\n\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of their business\nactivities, one or more of the underwriters, dealers or\nagents and/or their respective affiliates, may make or\nhold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt\nand equity securities (or related derivative securities)\nand financial instruments (including bank loans) for\ntheir own account and for the accounts of their\ncustomers. These investments and securities activities\nmay involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our\naffiliates. These underwriters, dealers, agents, or their\naffiliates, that have a lending relationship with us\nroutinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent\nwith their customary risk management policies. Typically,\nthese parties would hedge such exposure to us by entering\ninto transactions which consist of either the purchase of\ncredit default swaps or the creation of short positions\nin our securities, including potentially the securities\noffered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely\naffect future trading prices of the securities offered\nhereby. These broker-dealers or their affiliates may also\nmake investment recommendations and/or publish or express\nindependent research views in respect of such securities\nor financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to\nclients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in\nsuch securities and instruments.\n\n131\n\nERISA CONSIDERATIONS\n\nA fiduciary of a pension, profit-sharing or other\nemployee benefit plan subject to the Employee Retirement\nIncome Security Act of 1974, as amended (\u0093ERISA\u0094), should\nconsider the fiduciary standards of ERISA in the context\nof the ERISA plan\u0092s particular circumstances before\nauthorizing an investment in the offered securities of\nBank of America. Among other factors, the fiduciary\nshould consider whether such an investment is in\naccordance with the documents governing the ERISA plan\nand whether the investment is appropriate for the ERISA\nplan in view of its overall investment policy and\ndiversification of its portfolio. A fiduciary should also\nconsider whether an investment in the offered securities\nmay constitute a \u0093prohibited transaction,\u0094 as described\nbelow.\n\nCertain provisions of ERISA and the Code, prohibit\nemployee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of\nERISA) that are subject to Title I of ERISA, plans\ndescribed in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code (including,\nwithout limitation, individual retirement accounts and\nretirement plans covering self-employed persons) that are\nsubject to Section 4975 of the Code, and entities whose\nunderlying assets include plan assets by reason of such\nemployee benefit plan\u0092s or plan\u0092s investment in such\nentities (including, without limitation, as applicable,\ninsurance company general accounts) (collectively,\n\u0093plans\u0094), from engaging in certain transactions involving\n\u0093plan assets\u0094 with parties that are \u0093parties in interest\u0094\nunder ERISA or \u0093disqualified persons\u0094 under the Code with\nrespect to the plan or entity (referred to as \u0093prohibited\ntransactions\u0094). Certain governmental, church, non-U.S.and\nother plans that are not subject to ERISA or to the Code\nmay be subject to similar restrictions under state,\nfederal, local or non-U.S.law (\u0093similar law\u0094).\n\nEach of Bank of America Corporation and certain of its\naffiliates may be considered a \u0093party in interest\u0094 or a\n\u0093disqualified person\u0094 with respect to many plans on\naccount of being a service provider to such plans. As a\nresult, a prohibited transaction may arise if the\nsecurities are acquired by or on behalf of a plan unless\nthose securities are acquired and held pursuant to an\navailable exemption.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Labor has issued five prohibited\ntransaction class exemptions (\u0093PTCEs\u0094) that may provide\nexemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited\ntransactions resulting from or occurring in connection\nwith the purchase or holding of these securities. Those\nclass exemptions are PTCE 96-23(for certain transactions\ndetermined by in-houseasset managers), PTCE 95-60(for\ncertain transactions involving insurance company general\naccounts), PTCE 91-38(for certain transactions involving\nbank collective investment funds), PTCE 90-1(for certain\ntransactions involving insurance company separate\naccounts) and PTCE 84-14(for certain transactions\ndetermined by independent qualified professional asset\nmanagers). In addition, ERISA Section 408(b)(17) and\nSection 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide an exemption for\nthe purchase and sale of securities and related lending\ntransactions, provided that neither the issuer of the\nsecurities nor any of its affiliates has or exercises any\ndiscretionary authority or control or renders any\ninvestment advice with respect to the assets of any plan\ninvolved in the transaction and provided further that the\nplan receives no less, nor pays no more, than adequate\nconsideration in connection with the transaction (the so-\ncalled\u0093Service Provider Exemption\u0094). There can be no\nassurance that any of these class or statutory exemptions\nwill be available with respect to transactions involving\nthese securities.\n\nAccordingly, unless otherwise provided in connection with\na particular offering of securities, offered securities\nmay not be purchased, held or disposed of by any plan or\nany other person investing \u0093plan assets\u0094 of any plan that\nis subject to the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA\nor Section 4975 of the Code or other similar law, unless\none of the following exemptions (or a similar exemption\nor exception acceptable to us) applies to such purchase,\nholding, and disposition: the Service Provider Exemption,\nPTCE 96-23, PTCE 95-60, PTCE 91-38, PTCE 90-1,or PTCE\n84-14.Therefore, unless otherwise provided in connection\nwith a particular offering of securities, any\n\n132\n\npurchaser of the offered securities or any interest\ntherein will be deemed to have represented and warranted\nto us on each day including the date of its purchase of\nthe offered securities through and including the date of\ndisposition of such offered securities that:\n                                                         \n       it is not a plan subject to Title I of ERISA,     \n       Section\u00a04975 of the Code or similar law and is    \n  (a)  not purchasing such securities or interest        \n       therein on behalf of, or with \u0093plan assets\u0094 of,     \n       any such plan;                                    \n                                                         \n                                                         \n       if it is a plan subject to Title I of ERISA or    \n       Section\u00a04975 of the Code, its purchase, holding,  \n  (b)  and disposition of such securities will           \n       not constitute or result in a non-exempt          \n       prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code;   \n       or                                                \n                                                         \n                                                         \n       if it is a governmental plan (as defined in       \n       section 3(32) of ERISA), church plan (as defined  \n       in section 3(33) of ERISA), non-U.S. plan or      \n  (c)  other plan that is not subject to the provisions  \n       of Title I of ERISA or Section\u00a04975 of the Code,  \n       its purchase, holding, and disposition of such    \n       securities will not violate any similar law and   \n       are not otherwise prohibited.                     \n                                                         \nMoreover, any purchaser that is a plan or is acquiring\nthe offered securities on behalf of a plan, including any\nfiduciary purchasing on behalf of a plan, will be deemed\nto have represented, in its corporate and its fiduciary\ncapacity, by its purchase and holding of the offered\nsecurities that (a) neither we, any of the underwriters\nnor any of our or their respective affiliates\n(collectively, the \u0093Seller\u0094) is a \u0093fiduciary\u0094 (under\nSection 3(21) of ERISA, or under any final or proposed\nregulations thereunder, or with respect to a\ngovernmental, church, or non-U.S.plan under any similar\nlaws) with respect to the acquisition, holding or\ndisposition of the offered securities, or as a result of\nany exercise by the Seller of any rights in connection\nwith the offered securities, (b) no advice provided by\nthe Seller has formed a primary basis for any investment\ndecision by or on behalf of such purchaser in connection\nwith the offered securities and the transactions\ncontemplated with respect to the securities, and (c) such\npurchaser recognizes and agrees that any communication\nfrom the Seller to the purchaser with respect to the\noffered securities is not intended by the Seller to be\nimpartial investment advice and is rendered in its\ncapacity as a seller of such offered securities and not\nas a fiduciary to such purchaser. This discussion is a\ngeneral summary of some of the rules which apply to ERISA\nplans and non-ERISAarrangements and their related\ninvestment vehicles as of the date of this prospectus.\nThe rules governing investments by ERISA plans and non-\nERISAarrangements change frequently, and we have no duty\nto, nor will we, inform you about any changes to such\nrules if and when they occur. This summary does not\ndescribe all of the rules or other considerations that\nmay be relevant to the investment in the offered\nsecurities by such plans or arrangements. The description\nabove is not, and should not be construed as, legal\nadvice or a legal opinion. Due to the complexity of these\nrules and the penalties imposed upon persons involved in\nprohibited transactions, it is important that any person\nconsidering the purchase of the offered securities with\nplan assets consult with its counsel regarding the\nconsequences under ERISA and the Code, or other similar\nlaw, of the acquisition and holding of offered securities\nand the availability of exemptive relief under the class\nor statutory exemptions listed above. The sale of the\nsecurities of Bank of America to a plan is in no respect\na representation by the Seller that such an investment\nmeets all relevant legal requirements with respect to\ninvestments by plans generally or any particular plan, or\nthat such an investment is appropriate for plans\ngenerally or any particular plan. 133\n\nWHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION We have filed a\nregistration statement on Form S-3with the SEC covering\nthe securities to be offered and sold using this\nprospectus.

carefully considering the risks of an investment in\nthe notes, including those discussed below in this\nprospectus supplement relating to floating-rate notes,\nfloating rates of interest, fixed-rate reset notes and\nfixed-rate reset rates of interest, and in the applicable\nsupplement for the specific notes, with your advisors in\nlight of your particular circumstances. The notes are not\nan appropriate investment for you if you are not\nknowledgeable about significant elements of the notes or\nfinancial matters in general. For information regarding\nrisks and uncertainties that may materially affect our\nbusiness and results, please refer to the information\nunder the captions \u0093Item 1A. Risk Factors\u0094 in our annual\nreport on Form 10-Kfor the year ended December 31, 2020,\nwhich is incorporated by reference in the accompanying\nprospectus, as well as those risks and uncertainties\ndiscussed in our subsequent filings that are incorporated\nby reference in the accompanying prospectus. You also\nshould review the risk factors that will be set forth in\nother documents that we will file after the date of this\nprospectus supplement.\n\nThis discussion of risks uses a number of capitalized and\nother terms that are defined elsewhere in this prospectus\nsupplement. A listing of the pages on which certain of\nsuch terms are defined can be found under the Index of\nCertain Defined Terms at the end of this prospectus\nsupplement.\n\nRisks Relating to the Floating-Rate Notes Generally\n\nThe following discussion of risks relates to the\nfloating-rate notes generally. You should carefully\nconsider the following discussion of risks before\ninvesting in floating-rate notes.\n\nFloating-rate notes bear additional risks.\n\nFor notes that bear interest at a floating-rate, there\nwill be additional significant risks not associated with\na conventional fixed-rate debt\nsecurity. These risks include fluctuation of the interest\nrates and the possibility that investors will receive an\namount of interest that is lower than expected. We have\nno control over a number of matters, including economic,\nfinancial, and\npolitical events, that are important in determining the\nexistence, magnitude, and longevity of market volatility\nand other risks and their impact on the value of, or\npayments made on, floating-rate notes. Volatility of\nrates may adversely impact the\nreturn on or market value of such floating-rate notes.\n\nWe or our affiliates may publish research reports that\ncould affect the market value of the floating-rate notes.\n\nWe or one or more of our affiliates, at present or in the\nfuture, may publish research reports with\nrespect to movements in interest rates generally or any\nbase rate that may be used for the floating-rate notes.\nThis research may be modified from time to time without\nnotice and may express opinions or provide\nrecommendations that are inconsistent\nwith purchasing or holding the notes. Any of these\nactivities may affect the market value of the notes.\n\nS-8\n\nIf the applicable base rate for certain floating-rate\nnotes is not available on a particular day, or has been\ndiscontinued and a replacement rate cannot be determined\nin accordance with applicable determination provisions,\nsuch unavailability or discontinuance may result in the\neffective application of a fixed rate of interest for\nsuch floating-rate notes.\n\nIn the event that any of BBSW, CDOR or EURIBOR becomes\nunavailable, but has not been eliminated or\ndiscontinued, and the applicable provisions for a\nreplacement rate have not been triggered, for a\nparticular interest period, under the relevant \u0093fallback\u0094\narrangements included in the terms and provisions of the\nfloating-rate notes using\nthese base rates, the base rate for the last preceding\ninterest period may be used as the base rate for such\nparticular interest period, or, if such base rate was not\nused for the preceding interest period (in the case of\nthe first interest period\nduring floating-rate period of a fixed/floating rate\nnote), the most recent such base rate that could have\nbeen determined in accordance with the applicable terms\nand provisions. If BBSW, CDOR or EURIBOR become\neliminated or discontinued and the\napplicable provisions for a replacement rate have been\ntriggered, but a replacement rate cannot be determined\nunder such provisions, then the use of the final fallback\nprovisions may result in the effective application of a\nfixed rate of interest\nfor the applicable floating-rate notes. In addition, if\nany of the federal funds (effective) rate, prime rate or\ntreasury (auction) rate are unavailable, then the use of\nthe final fallback provisions will result in the\neffective application of a\nfixed rate of interest for the applicable floating-rate\nnotes.\n\nHistorical rates are not an indication of future rates.\n\nIn the past, the base rates that may be used for the\nfloating-rate notes have experienced significant\nfluctuations. You should note that\nhistorical levels, fluctuations and trends of the base\nrates are not necessarily indicative of future levels.\nAny historical upward or downward trend in the applicable\nbase rate is not an indication that such base rate is\nmore or less likely to\nincrease or decrease at any time. Future levels of a base\nrate may bear little or no relation to the historical\nactual or historical indicative base rate data. Prior\nobserved patterns, if any, in the behavior of market\nvariables and their relation\nto the base rate, such as correlations, may change in the\nfuture. In addition, to the extent that any pre-\npublication historical data is published with respect to\na base rate, production of such historical\nindicative data inherently involves assumptions,\nestimates and approximations. No future performance of\nany base rate may be inferred from any of the historical\nactual or historical indicative base rate data.\n\nRisks Relating to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate\nand SOFR Notes Generally\n\nThe following discussion of risks relates to the Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate (\u0093SOFR\u0094) and SOFR notes\ngenerally.In this discussion, references to\u0093SOFR\nnotes\u0094mean a series of term SOFR notes, compounded SOFR\nnotes or simple average SOFR notes. You should carefully\nconsider the following discussion of risks before\ninvesting in SOFR notes.\n\nThe composition and characteristics of SOFR are not the\nsame as those of USD LIBOR, and SOFR is not expected to\nbe a comparable substitute, successor or replacement for\nUSD LIBOR.\n\nIn June 2017, the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York\u0092s Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the\n\u0093ARRC\u0094) announced SOFR as its recommended alternative to\nthe London Interbank Offered Rate for deposits in U.S.\ndollars (\u0093USD LIBOR\u0094). However, the composition and\ncharacteristics of SOFR are not the same as those of USD\nLIBOR. SOFR is a broad Treasury repo financing rate that\nrepresents overnight secured funding transactions and is\nnot the economic equivalent of USD LIBOR. While SOFR is a\nsecured rate, USD\nLIBOR is an unsecured rate. And, while SOFR\n\nS-9\n\ncurrently is an overnight rate only, USD LIBOR is a\nforward-looking rate that represents interbank funding\nfor a specified term. As a result, there can be no\nassurance that SOFR will perform in\nthe same way as USD LIBOR would have at any time,\nincluding, without limitation, as a result of changes in\ninterest and yield rates in the market, bank credit risk,\nmarket volatility or global or regional economic,\nfinancial, political, regulatory,\njudicial or other events. For the same reasons, SOFR is\nnot expected to be a comparable substitute, successor or\nreplacement for USD LIBOR. See also \u0093\u0097Any failure of SOFR\nto maintain market acceptance could adversely affect the\nreturn on\nor value of the SOFR notes and result in a limited\nsecondary trading market for the SOFR notes\u0094 below.\n\nSOFR may be more volatile than other benchmark or market\nrates.\n\nSince the initial publication of SOFR, daily changes in\nthe rate have, on occasion, been more\nvolatile than daily changes in other benchmark or market\nrates, such as USD LIBOR, during corresponding periods.\nIn addition, although changes in term SOFR, compounded\nSOFR and simple average SOFR generally are not expected\nto be as volatile as\nchanges in SOFR on a daily basis, the return on, value of\nand market for the SOFR notes may fluctuate more than\nfloating-rate debt securities with interest rates based\non less volatile rates.\n\nAny failure of SOFR to maintain market acceptance could\nadversely affect the return on or value of the SOFR notes\nand result in a limited secondary trading market for the\nSOFR notes.\n\nAccording to the ARRC, SOFR was developed for use in\ncertain U.S. dollar derivatives and\nother financial contracts as an alternative to USD LIBOR\nin part because it is considered a good representation of\ngeneral funding conditions in the overnight U.S. Treasury\nrepurchase agreement market. However, as a rate based on\ntransactions\nsecured by U.S. Treasury securities, it does not measure\nbank-specific credit risk and, as a result, is less\nlikely to correlate with the unsecured short-term funding\ncosts of banks. This may mean that market participants\nwould not consider SOFR a\nsuitable substitute, replacement or successor for USD\nLIBOR, which may, in turn, lead to lessened market\nacceptance of SOFR.\n\nFurther,\nother index providers are developing products that are\nperceived as competing with SOFR. It is possible that\nmarket participants will prefer one of these competing\nproducts and that such competing products may become more\nwidely accepted in the\nmarketplace than SOFR. To the extent market acceptance\nfor SOFR as a benchmark for floating-rate notes declines,\nthe return on and value of the SOFR notes and the price\nat which investors can sell the SOFR notes in the\nsecondary market could be\nadversely affected. In addition, investors in the SOFR\nnotes may not be able to sell the SOFR notes at all or\nmay not be able to sell the SOFR notes at prices that\nwill provide them with a yield comparable to similar\ninvestments that continue to\nhave a developed secondary market, and may consequently\nsuffer from increased pricing volatility and market risk.\n\nThere currently are\nmultiple market conventions with respect to the\nimplementation of SOFR as a base rate for floating-rate\nnotes or other securities. The manner of calculation and\nrelated conventions with respect to the determination of\ninterest rates based on SOFR in\nfloating-rate notes markets may differ materially\ncompared with the manner of calculation and related\nconventions with respect to the determination of interest\nrates based on SOFR in other markets, such as the\nderivatives and loan markets. Investors\nshould carefully consider how any potential\ninconsistencies between the manner of calculation and\nrelated conventions with respect to the determination of\ninterest or other payment rates based on SOFR across\nthese markets may impact any hedging or\nother financial arrangements that they may put in place\nin connection with any acquisition, holding or\ndisposition of the SOFR notes.\n\nS-10\n\nSOFR may be modified or discontinued, which could\nadversely affect the return on, value of or market for\naffected SOFR notes.\n\nSOFR is a relatively new rate, and the Federal Reserve\nBank of New York (the \u0093FRBNY\u0094)\n(or a successor), as administrator of SOFR, may make\nmethodological or other changes that could change the\nvalue of SOFR, including changes related to the method by\nwhich SOFR is calculated, eligibility criteria applicable\nto the transactions used\nto calculate SOFR, or timing related to the publication\nof SOFR. In addition, SOFR is published by the FRBNY\nbased on data received from sources other than us, and we\nhave no control over the methods of calculation,\npublication schedule, rate\nrevision practices or availability of SOFR or the SOFR\nIndex. If the manner in which SOFR is calculated is\nchanged, that change may result in a reduction of the\namount of interest payable on the SOFR notes, which may\nadversely affect the trading\nprices of the SOFR notes. The administrator of SOFR may\nwithdraw, modify, amend, suspend or discontinue the\ncalculation or dissemination of SOFR in its sole\ndiscretion and without notice and has no obligation to\nconsider the interests of investors\nin the SOFR notes in calculating, withdrawing, modifying,\namending, suspending or discontinuing SOFR. For purposes\nof the formula used to calculate interest with respect to\na series of SOFR notes, SOFR in respect of a particular\ndate will not be\nadjusted for any modifications or amendments to SOFR data\nthat the administrator of SOFR may publish after the\ninterest rate on SOFR notes for that day has been\ndetermined in accordance with the terms and provisions\nset forth in this prospectus\nsupplement and the applicable supplement.\n\nThere can be no guarantee that SOFR will not be modified\nor discontinued in a manner that is\nmaterially adverse to an investor in SOFR notes. If the\nmanner in which SOFR is calculated is changed or if SOFR\nis discontinued, that change or discontinuance could\nreduce or otherwise negatively impact the amount of\ninterest that accrues on a\nseries of SOFR notes, which could adversely affect the\nreturn on, value of and market for such series of SOFR\nnotes.\n\nRisks Relating to Sterling Overnight Index Average and\nSONIA Notes Generally\n\nThe following discussion of risks specifically relates to\nthe Sterling Overnight Index Average rate (\u0093SONIA\u0094) and\nSONIA notes generally. In this discussion, references to\n\u0093SONIA notes\u0094 mean a series of compounded SONIA notes or\nsimple average SONIA notes. You should carefully consider\nthe following discussion of risks before investing in\nSONIA notes.\n\nSONIA may be more volatile than other benchmark or market\nrates.\n\nSince the initial publication of SONIA, daily changes in\nthe rate have, on occasion, been more volatile than daily\nchanges in other benchmark\nor market rates. In addition, although changes in\ncompounded SONIA and simple average SONIA generally are\nnot expected to be as volatile as changes in SONIA on a\ndaily basis, the return on, value of and market for the\nSONIA notes may fluctuate more\nthan floating-rate debt securities with interest rates\nbased on less volatile rates.\n\nSONIA may be modified or discontinued, which could\nadversely affect the return on, value of or market for\naffected SONIA notes.\n\nSONIA is a relatively new rate, and the Bank of\nEngland (the \u0093BoE\u0094) (or a successor), as administrator of\nSONIA, may make methodological or other changes that\ncould change the value of SONIA, including changes\nrelated to the method by which SONIA is calculated,\neligibility criteria\napplicable to the transactions used to calculate SONIA,\nor timing related to the publication of SONIA (which may\ninclude withdrawing, suspending or discontinuing the\ncalculation or dissemination of SONIA). In addition, the\nBoE may make any or all of\nthese changes in its sole discretion and without notice,\nand it has no obligation to consider the interests of\ninvestors in any\n\nS-11\n\nSONIA notes in calculating, withdrawing, modifying,\namending, suspending or discontinuing SONIA. Because\nSONIA is published by the BoE based on data received from\nsources other than us, we have\nno control over the methods of calculation, publication\nschedule, rate revision practices or availability of\nSONIA or the SONIA Index at any time.\n\nThere can be no guarantee that SONIA will not be modified\nor discontinued in a manner that is materially adverse to\nan investor in SONIA\nnotes. If the manner in which SONIA is calculated is\nchanged or if SONIA is discontinued, that change or\ndiscontinuance could reduce or otherwise negatively\nimpact the amount of interest that accrues on a series of\nSONIA notes, which could adversely\naffect the return on, value of and market for such series\nof SONIA notes.\n\nThe market continues to develop in relation to SONIA as a\nbase rate for floating-rate notes.\n\nThe market continues to develop in relation to SONIA as a\nbase rate as an alternative to the\nLondon Interbank Offered Rate for pounds sterling. In\nparticular, market participants and relevant working\ngroups still are exploring alternative reference rates\nbased on the risk free rates, including for example term\nSONIA reference rates which\nseek to measure the market\u0092s forward expectation of an\naverage SONIA rate over a designated term. On August 3,\n2020, the BoE began publishing the SONIA Compounded\nIndex.\n\nThe market or a significant part thereof may adopt an\napplication of SONIA that differs significantly from that\nset out and used in the terms\nand provisions relating to the SONIA notes. The use of\nthe SONIA Compounded Index or the specific formula used\nto calculate compounded SONIA or simple average SONIA\nwith respect to a series of notes may not be widely\nadopted by other market\nparticipants, if at all. If the market adopts a different\ncalculation method, that would likely adversely affect\nthe market price of the applicable series of SONIA notes.\n\nIn the future, we may also issue notes referencing\ncompounded SONIA or simple average SONIA that differ\nmaterially in terms of interest\ndetermination when compared with any previous notes\nreferencing compounded SONIA or simple average SONIA, as\napplicable. The development of compounded SONIA or simple\naverage SONIA as interest base rates for the Eurobond\nmarkets, as well as\ncontinued development of the market infrastructure for\nadopting such rates, could result in reduced liquidity or\nincreased volatility or could otherwise affect the market\nprice of any SONIA notes.\n\nThere currently is no uniform market convention with\nrespect to the implementation of risk free rates as a\nbase rate for floating-rate notes\nor other securities. The manner of adoption or\napplication of SONIA in the Eurobond markets may differ\nmaterially compared with the application and adoption of\nSONIA in other markets, such as the derivative and loan\nmarkets. Investors should\ncarefully consider how any mismatch between the adoption\nof SONIA in the bond, loan and derivatives markets may\nimpact any hedging or other financial arrangement which\nthey may put in place in connection with any acquisition,\nholding or disposal of\nSONIA notes.\n\nRisks Relating to Term SOFR Notes\n\nThe following discussion of risks specifically relates to\nterm SOFR notes. We may issue term SOFR notes even though\nterm SOFR does not exist as of the date of this\nprospectus supplement and may not exist as of the\noriginal issue date of such term SOFR notes. Any term\nSOFR notes that we issue before term SOFR exists will\nprovide that interest on such term SOFR notes will be\ndetermined by reference to term SOFR beginning on a\nfuture date when term SOFR is expected to exist. You\nshould carefully consider the following discussion of\nrisks before investing in term SOFR notes.\n\nS-12\n\nTerm SOFR does not exist as of the date of this\nprospectus supplement, and the interest rate for the\nfloating-rate period applicable to any series of term\nSOFR notes may be determined based on a rate other than\nterm SOFR.\n\nThe interest rate applicable to a series of term SOFR\nnotes is expected to be based on term SOFR, a forward-\nlooking term rate for the index\nmaturity specified in the applicable supplement that in\nturn will be based on SOFR. Term SOFR does not exist as\nof the date of this prospectus supplement. In a March\n2021 announcement, the ARRC stated that it is not yet in\na position to recommend\nwith confidence a term rate based on SOFR due to the\ncurrent level of liquidity in SOFR derivatives markets\nand the ARRC\u0092s continued evaluation of the limited set of\ncases in which it believes a term rate based on SOFR\ncould be used. Further,\non May 21, 2021, the ARRC announced it had selected CME\nGroup as the administrator that it plans to recommend for\na forward-looking SOFR term rate, once specific market\nindicators for the term rate are met. In conjunction with\nits work towards\na final recommendation of a SOFR term rate, the ARRC also\nplans to recommend best practices for the use of the term\nrate. If, after the issue date of any series of term SOFR\nnotes, the ARRC recommends against the use of term SOFR\nfor newly issued\nfloating-rate notes, or does not recommend term SOFR for\nuse in newly issued floating-rate notes, this could\nadversely affect the return on, value of and market for\nsuch series of term SOFR notes.\n\nThere is no assurance that the development of a forward-\nlooking term rate based on SOFR for the index maturity\nspecified in the applicable\nsupplement will be completed or, if completed, will be\nrecommended or selected by the USD Relevant Governmental\nBody at the time term SOFR becomes applicable to a series\nof term SOFR notes. Uncertainty surrounding the\ndevelopment of forward-looking\nterm rates based on SOFR and their recommendation or\nselection by the USD Relevant Governmental Body could\nhave a material adverse effect on the return on, value of\nand market for term SOFR notes. If, at the commencement\nof the floating-rate period\nfor any series of term SOFR notes, the USD Relevant\nGovernmental Body has not selected or recommended term\nSOFR for the index maturity specified in the applicable\nsupplement, the development of term SOFR for the index\nmaturity specified in the\napplicable supplement that has been recommended or\nselected by the USD Relevant Governmental Body is not\ncomplete, or we or our designee, after consulting with\nus, determines that the use of term SOFR for the index\nmaturity specified in the\napplicable supplement is not administratively feasible,\nthen, unless we specify otherwise in the applicable\nsupplement, the first available USD Benchmark Replacement\nwith respect to term SOFR notes under the USD benchmark\ntransition provisions will\nbe used to determine the interest rate on the relevant\nseries of term SOFR notes during the applicable floating-\nrate period in respect of such term SOFR notes (unless a\nUSD Benchmark Transition Event and its related USD\nBenchmark Replacement Date\noccur with respect to such USD Benchmark Replacement).\n\nAfter the issuance of a series of term SOFR notes, we or\nour designee, after consulting with us, is expressly\nauthorized to make certain determinations, decisions or\nelections with respect to certain terms and provisions of\nsuch series of term SOFR notes that we or our designee,\nafter consulting with us, determines are appropriate to\nreflect the use of term SOFR as the base rate.\n\nAfter the issuance of any series of term SOFR notes, we\nor our\ndesignee, after consulting with us, is expressly\nauthorized to make determinations, decisions or elections\nwith respect to the term SOFR conventions, as defined\nunder \u0093Description of the Notes\u0097Floating-Rate\nNotes\u0097Floating-Rate Notes\nwithout Payment Delay\u0097Determination of Base Rates\u0097Term\nSOFR Notes\u0094 in this prospectus supplement, that we or our\ndesignee, after consulting with us, decides are\nappropriate to reflect the use of term SOFR as the base\nrate for such\nseries of term SOFR notes. For example, because the\nsource and method of publication for term SOFR are not\ncurrently known, we or our designee (after consulting\nwith us) will need to determine the manner and timing and\nother relevant details for the\ndetermination of term SOFR for the relevant index\nmaturity in respect of\n\nS-13\n\nany series of term SOFR notes. Such determinations and\nimplementation of any term SOFR conventions could reduce\nor otherwise negatively impact the amount of interest\nthat accrues on a series of\nterm SOFR notes, which could adversely affect the return\non, value of and market for such series of term SOFR\nnotes.\n\nRisks Relating to Compounded SOFR Notes, Compounded SONIA\nNotes, Simple Average SOFR Notes and Simple Average SONIA\nNotes\n\nThe following discussion of risks specifically relates to\ncompounded SOFR notes, compounded SONIA notes, simple\naverage SOFR notes and simple average SONIA notes\n(including, for the avoidance of doubt, compounded SOFR\nnotes using the SOFR Index convention and compounded\nSONIA notes using the SONIA Compounded Index convention).\nIn this discussion, references to \u0093compounded notes\u0094 mean\na series of compounded SOFR notes or compounded SONIA\nnotes, as applicable, references to \u0093simple average\nnotes\u0094 mean a series of simple average SOFR notes or\nsimple average SONIA notes, as applicable, references to\n\u0093daily rate\u0094 mean SOFR or SONIA, as applicable, and\nreferences to \u0093compounded index\u0094 mean the SOFR Index or\nthe SONIA Compounded Index, as applicable. You should\ncarefully consider the following discussion of risks\nbefore investing in compounded notes.\n\nThe interest rate on a series of compounded notes or\nsimple average notes will be based on a compounded or\nsimple average, respectively, of the applicable daily\nrate. Such compounded and simple average rates are\nrelatively new in the marketplace.\n\nFor each interest period, the interest rate on a series\nof compounded notes or simple average notes will be based\non a compounded or\nsimple average, respectively, of the applicable daily\nrate calculated as described under \u0093Description of the\nNotes\u0097Floating-Rate Notes\u0094, in this prospectus\nsupplement. For this and other reasons, the interest rate\non a series of\ncompounded notes or simple average notes during any\ninterest period may not be the same as the interest rate\non other instruments bearing interest at a rate based on\nSOFR or SONIA, as applicable, that use an alternative\nmethod to determine the\napplicable interest rate. Further, if a daily rate in\nrespect of a particular date during an interest period or\nobservation period (if applicable) for a series of\ncompounded notes or simple average notes is negative, the\ninclusion of such daily rate\nin the calculation of compounded notes or simple average\nnotes for the applicable interest period will reduce the\ninterest rate and the interest payable on such series of\ncompounded notes or simple average notes, as applicable,\nfor such interest\nperiod.\n\nThe method for calculating an interest rate based upon\ncompounded SOFR, compounded SONIA, simple average SOFR or\nsimple average\nSONIA (for example, payment delays, observation\nperiods/lookbacks and/or lockout/suspension periods) in\nmarket precedents varies. This variation in the market\ncould adversely affect the return on, value of and market\nfor the compounded notes or\nsimple average notes.\n\nInterest payments due on a series of compounded notes or\nsimple average notes will be determined only at the end\nof the relevant interest period.\n\nInterest payments due on a series of compounded notes or\nsimple average notes will be determined\nonly at the end of the relevant interest period.\nTherefore, investors in any series of compounded notes or\nsimple average notes will not know the amount of interest\npayable with respect to each interest period until\nshortly prior to the related\ninterest payment date, and it may be difficult for\ninvestors in such compounded notes or simple average\nnotes to estimate reliably the amounts of interest that\nwill be payable on each such interest payment date at the\nbeginning of or during the\nrelevant interest period. In addition, some investors may\nbe unwilling or unable to trade\n\nS-14\n\nsuch compounded notes or simple average notes without\nchanges to their information technology systems, which\ncould adversely impact the liquidity and trading price of\nany series of compounded\nnotes or simple average notes.\n\nWith respect to a series of compounded notes using the\npayment delay convention, or simple average notes, that\ndo not use a rate lookback, it will not be possible to\ncalculate accrued interest with respect to any period\nuntil after the end of such period.\n\nWith respect to a series of compounded notes using the\npayment delay convention, or simple average notes, that\ndo not use a rate lookback,\nbecause the applicable daily rate in respect of a given\nday is not published until the U.S. government securities\nbusiness day or London banking day, as applicable,\nimmediately following such day, it will not be possible\nto calculate accrued\ninterest with respect to any period until after the end\nof such period, which may adversely affect your ability\nto trade such notes in the secondary market.\n\nWith respect to a series of compounded notes using the\npayment delay convention, or a series of simple average\nnotes, that employs a rate cut-offdate, pursuant to the\nformula used to determine compounded SOFR, compounded\nSONIA, simple average SOFR or simple average SONIA, as\napplicable, for such notes for an applicable interest\nperiod, the applicable daily rate used in such\ncalculation for any day from, and including, the rate\ncut-offdate to, but excluding, the relevant interest\npayment date (or maturity or redemption date, if\napplicable) will be such daily rate in respect of the\nrelevant rate cut-offdate.\n\nThe formula used to determine the\nbase rate for compounded notes using the payment delay\nconvention employs a rate cut-off date for the final\ninterest period with respect to any series of notes, and\nthe formula used to determine the base rate\nfor simple average notes, if so specified in the\napplicable supplement for a series of such notes, may\nemploy a rate cut-off date for each interest period with\nrespect to such series.\n\nFor the final interest period with respect to a series of\ncompounded notes using the payment delay convention, the\napplicable daily rate used\nin the calculation of compounded SOFR or compounded\nSONIA, as applicable, for any day from, and including,\nthe rate cut-off date to, but excluding, the maturity\ndate or the redemption date, if applicable, will\nbe the applicable daily rate in respect of the rate cut-\noff date. The rate cut-off date will be (1) for\ncompounded SOFR, two U.S. government securities business\ndays (or such other number of U.S. government securities\nbusiness days as we may specify in the applicable\nsupplement) or (2) for compounded SONIA, five London\nbanking days (or such other number of London banking days\nas we may specify in the\napplicable supplement), prior to the maturity date (or\nredemption date, if applicable).\n\nFor each interest period with respect to a series\nof simple average notes using a rate cut-off date, the\napplicable daily rate used in the calculation of simple\naverage SOFR or simple average SONIA, as applicable, for\nany day from, and including, the rate cut-off date to,\nbut excluding, the relevant interest payment date or the\nmaturity or redemption date, if applicable, will be the\napplicable daily rate in respect of the rate\ncut-off date. The rate cut-off date will be (1) for\nsimple average SOFR, two U.S. government securities\nbusiness days (or such other number of U.S. government\nsecurities business days as we may specify in the\napplicable supplement) or (2) for simple average SONIA,\nfive London banking days (or such other number of London\nbanking days as we may specify in the applicable\nsupplement), prior to each\ninterest payment date or the maturity date (or redemption\ndate, if applicable).\n\nAs a result of the foregoing, a holder of a series of\ncompounded notes using the payment delay convention, or\nsimple average notes, using a rate cut-off date will not\nreceive the benefit of any\n\nS-15\n\nincrease in the level of SOFR or SONIA, as applicable, on\nany date subsequent to the applicable rate cut-off date\nin connection with the determination of\nthe interest payable with respect to (i) the final\ninterest period for an applicable series of compounded\nnotes using the payment delay convention or (ii) each\ninterest period for a series of simple average notes\nusing a rate cut-off date, which could reduce the amount\nof interest that may be payable on the applicable series\nof notes.\n\nInvestors in a series of compounded notes using the\npayment delay convention will receive payments of\ninterest on a delayed basis.\n\nThe interest payment dates for any series of compounded\nnotes using the payment delay convention with respect to\ninterest rate\ndetermination and interest payments will be two business\ndays (or such other number of business days as we may\nspecify in the applicable supplement) after the interest\nperiod demarcation date at the end of each interest\nperiod for such series. This\nconvention differs from the interest payment convention\nthat has been used historically for floating-rate notes\nwith interest rates based on other benchmark or market\nrates, where interest typically has been paid on a fixed\nday that immediately\nfollows the final day of the applicable interest period.\nAs a result, investors in a series of compounded notes\nusing the payment delay convention will receive payments\nof interest on a delayed basis as compared to traditional\nfloating-rate notes\nwithout payment delay in which they previously may have\ninvested.\n\nRisks Relating to USD Benchmark Transition Provisions\n\nThe following discussion of risks specifically relates to\nUSD benchmark transition provisions. You should carefully\nconsider the following discussion of risks relating to\nUSD benchmark transition provisions before investing in\nany SOFR notes. In this discussion, references to \u0093SOFR\nnotes\u0094 mean a series of term SOFR notes, compounded SOFR\nnotes or simple average SOFR notes.\n\nThe selection of a USD Benchmark Replacement could\nadversely affect the return on, value of or market for\naffected SOFR notes.\n\nIf we or our designee, after consulting with us,\ndetermines that a USD Benchmark Transition Event and\nrelated USD Benchmark\nReplacement Date have occurred with respect to a series\nof SOFR notes, the applicable USD Benchmark Replacement\nwill replace the then-current USD Benchmark (which will\nbe a rate based on SOFR at the original issue date of the\nrelevant SOFR notes)\nfor all purposes relating to such SOFR notes. If a\nparticular USD Benchmark Replacement or USD Benchmark\nReplacement Adjustment cannot be determined, then the\nnext-available USD Benchmark Replacement or USD Benchmark\nReplacement Adjustment will\napply. These replacement rates and adjustments may be\nselected or formulated by (i) the USD Relevant\nGovernmental Body (such as the ARRC), (ii) the\nInternational Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.\n(\u0093ISDA\u0094) or any successor\nthereto or (iii) in certain circumstances, us or our\ndesignee (which may be our affiliate), after consulting\nwith us.\n\nIn addition,\nthe terms of the SOFR notes expressly authorize us or our\ndesignee (which may be our affiliate), after consulting\nwith us, in connection with a USD Benchmark Replacement\nto make USD Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes with\nrespect to, among\nother things, the determination of interest periods and\nthe timing and frequency of determining rates and making\npayments of interest and other administrative matters.\nThe application of a USD Benchmark Replacement and USD\nBenchmark Replacement\nAdjustment, and any implementation of USD Benchmark\nReplacement Conforming Changes, could result in adverse\nconsequences to the interest rate or amount of interest\npayable on the SOFR notes, which could adversely affect\nthe return on, value of and\nmarket for such SOFR notes and the price at which\ninvestors may be able to sell such SOFR notes.\n\nS-16\n\nMoreover, certain determinations, decisions and elections\nwith respect to the USD Benchmark\nReplacement and any USD Benchmark Replacement Conforming\nChanges, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of a USD\nBenchmark Transition Event, may require the exercise of\ndiscretion and the making of subjective\njudgments by us or our designee (after consulting with\nus). Any determination, decision or election made by us\nor our designee pursuant to the USD benchmark transition\nprovisions set forth in this prospectus supplement will,\nif made by us, be made\nin our sole discretion and, if made by our designee, be\nmade after consultation with us and, in each case, will\nbecome effective without consent from the investors in\nthe affected SOFR notes or any other party. We may\ndesignate an entity to make any\ndetermination, decision or election that we have the\nright to make in connection with the USD benchmark\ntransition provisions set forth in this prospectus\nsupplement. Any designee that we may appoint in\nconnection with these determinations,\ndecisions or elections may be our affiliate. When\nperforming such functions, potential conflicts of\ninterest may exist between us, our designee and investors\nin the SOFR notes and making such potentially subjective\ndeterminations may adversely\naffect the return on, value of and market for the SOFR\nnotes. All determinations by us or our designee in our or\nits discretion will be conclusive for all purposes and\nbinding on us and investors in the applicable SOFR notes\nabsent manifest error.\n\nFurther, (i) the composition and characteristics of any\nUSD Benchmark Replacement for a series of SOFR notes will\nnot be the same as\nthose of the applicable SOFR rate for a series of SOFR\nnotes, the USD Benchmark Replacement will not be the\neconomic equivalent of term SOFR or SOFR, as applicable,\nthere can be no assurance that the USD Benchmark\nReplacement will perform in the\nsame way as term SOFR or SOFR, as applicable, would have\nat any time and there is no guarantee that the USD\nBenchmark Replacement will be a comparable substitute for\nterm SOFR or SOFR, as applicable (each of which means\nthat a USD Benchmark\nTransition Event could adversely affect the return on,\nvalue of and market for the applicable series of SOFR\nnotes), (ii) any failure of the USD Benchmark Replacement\nto gain market acceptance could adversely affect the\nrelevant series of SOFR\nnotes, (iii) the USD Benchmark Replacement may have a\nvery limited history and the future performance of the\nUSD Benchmark Replacement may not be able to be predicted\nbased on historical performance, (iv) the secondary\ntrading market for\ndebt securities linked to the USD Benchmark Replacement\nmay be limited and (v) the administrator of the USD\nBenchmark Replacement may make changes that could change\nthe value of the USD Benchmark Replacement or discontinue\nthe USD Benchmark\nReplacement and would not have any obligation to consider\nthe interests of investors in the relevant series of SOFR\nnotes in doing so.

You should\ncarefully consider the following discussion of risks\nbefore investing in EURIBOR notes (as defined below) or\nSONIA notes. In this discussion, references to \u0093notes\u0094\nmean a series of EURIBOR notes, compounded SONIA notes or\nsimple average SONIA notes.\n\nThe selection of a Non-USDBenchmark Replacement could\nadversely affect the return on, value of or market for\naffected notes.\n\nIf we or our designee, after consulting with us,\ndetermines that a Non-USD Benchmark Transition Event and\nrelated Non-USD Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred\nwith respect to a series of notes, the applicable Non-USD\nBenchmark Replacement will replace the then-current Non-\nUSD Benchmark for all purposes relating to such notes. If\na particular\nNon-USD Benchmark\n\nS-17\n\nReplacement or Non-USD Benchmark Replacement Adjustment\ncannot be determined, then the next-available Non-USD\nBenchmark Replacement or Non-USD Benchmark Replacement\nAdjustment will apply. These replacement rates and\nadjustments may be selected or formulated by the Non-USD\nRelevant Governmental Body or, in certain circumstances,\nus or our designee, after consulting with us.\n\nIn addition, the terms of the\nnotes expressly authorize us or our designee, after\nconsulting with us, in connection with implementation of\na Non-USD Benchmark Replacement to make Non-USD Benchmark\nReplacement Conforming Changes with respect to, among\nother things, the determination of interest periods and\nthe timing and frequency of determining rates and making\npayments of interest and other administrative matters.\nThe application of a Non-USD Benchmark Replacement and\nNon-USD Benchmark Replacement Adjustment, and any\nimplementation of Non-USD Benchmark Replacement\nConforming Changes, could result in adverse consequences\nto the interest rate or the amount of interest payable on\nthe notes, which could adversely affect the return on,\nvalue of and market for such notes and the price at which\ninvestors may be able\nto sell such notes.\n\nMoreover, certain determinations, decisions and elections\nwith respect to the\nNon-USD Benchmark Replacement and any Non-USD Benchmark\nReplacement Conforming Changes, or the occurrence or non-\noccurrence of a Non-USD Benchmark Transition Event, may\nrequire the exercise of discretion and the making of\nsubjective judgments by us or our designee (after\nconsulting with us). Any determination, decision or\nelection made by us\nor our designee pursuant to the Non-USD benchmark\ntransition provisions set forth in this prospectus\nsupplement will, if made by us, be made in our sole\ndiscretion and, if made by our designee, be made after\nconsultation with us and, in each case, will become\neffective without consent from the investors in the\naffected notes or any other party. We may designate an\nentity to make any determination, decision or election\nthat we have the right to make in\nconnection with the Non-USD benchmark transition\nprovisions set forth in this prospectus supplement. Any\ndesignee that we may appoint in connection with these\ndeterminations, decisions or elections may be our\naffiliate. When performing such functions, potential\nconflicts of interest may exist between us, our designee\nand investors in the notes and making such potentially\nsubjective determinations may adversely affect the return\non, value of and market\nfor the notes. All determinations by us or our designee\nin our or its discretion will be conclusive for all\npurposes and binding on us and investors in the\napplicable notes absent manifest error.\n\nFurther, (i) the composition and characteristics of any\nNon-USD Benchmark Replacement in respect\nof a series of notes will not be the same as those of\nEURIBOR or SONIA, as applicable, the Non-USD Benchmark\nReplacement will not be the economic equivalent of\nEURIBOR or SONIA, as applicable, there can be no\nassurance that the Non-USD Benchmark Replacement will\nperform in the same way as EURIBOR or SONIA, as\napplicable, would have at any time and there is no\nguarantee that the\nNon-USD Benchmark Replacement will be a comparable\nsubstitute for EURIBOR or SONIA, as applicable (each of\nwhich means that a Non-USD Benchmark Transition Event\ncould\nadversely affect the return on, value of and market for\nthe applicable series of notes), (ii) any failure of the\nNon-USD Benchmark Replacement to gain market acceptance\ncould adversely affect the relevant\nseries of notes, (iii) the Non-USD Benchmark Replacement\nmay have a very limited history and the future\nperformance of the Non-USD Benchmark Replacement may not\nbe\nable to be predicted based on historical performance,\n(iv) the secondary trading market for debt securities\nlinked to the Non-USD Benchmark Replacement may be\nlimited and (v) the administrator of the\nNon-USD Benchmark Replacement may make changes that could\nchange the value of the Non-USD Benchmark Replacement or\ndiscontinue the\nNon-USD Benchmark Replacement and would not have any\nobligation to consider the interests of investors in the\nrelevant series of notes in doing so. For more\ninformation, see the\nNon-USD benchmark transition provisions set forth under\n\u0093Description of the Notes\u0097Floating-Rate Notes\u0097Effect of a\nNon-USD Benchmark Transition Event and\nRelated Non-USD Benchmark Replacement Date with Respect\nto EURIBOR or SONIA\u0094 below.\n\nS-18\n\nRisks Relating to Euro Interbank Offered Rate Notes\n\nThe following discussion of risks specifically relates to\nthe Euro Interbank Offered Rate (\u0093EURIBOR\u0094) and EURIBOR\nnotes generally. You should carefully consider the\nfollowing discussion of risks before investing in EURIBOR\nnotes.\n\nRegulation, reform and the actual or potential\ndiscontinuation of EURIBOR may adversely affect the value\nof, return on and trading market for EURIBOR notes.\n\nPreviously certain interest rates which are deemed to be\n\u0093benchmark\u0094 rates have been the subject of national,\ninternational and\nother regulatory guidance, reform and other actions. This\nhas resulted in regulatory reform and changes to existing\nbenchmarks. Such reform of benchmarks includes the\nRegulation (EU) 2016/1011 (as amended, the \u0093EU Benchmarks\nRegulation\u0094) of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil of 8 June 2016 on indices used as benchmarks in\nfinancial instruments and financial contracts or to\nmeasure the performance of investment funds and amending\nDirectives 2008/48/EC\nand 2014/17/EU and Regulation (EU) No 596/2014, and the\nEU Benchmarks Regulation as it forms part of UK domestic\nlaw by virtue of the UK European Union (Withdrawal) Act\n2018 (the \u0093UK Benchmarks Regulation\u0094 and, together with\nthe EU\nBenchmarks Regulation, the \u0093Benchmarks Regulations\u0094),\nwhich apply to the provision of benchmarks, the\ncontribution of input data to a benchmark and the use of\na benchmark within the European Union (the \u0093EU\u0094) and the\nUnited\nKingdom (the \u0093UK\u0094), respectively.\n\nAmong other things, the Benchmarks Regulations (i)\nrequire benchmark administrators to\nbe authorized or registered (or, if non-EU-based or non-\nUK based, to be subject to an equivalent regime or\notherwise recognized\nor endorsed) and (ii) prevent certain uses by EU and UK\nsupervised entities, as applicable, of benchmarks of\nadministrators that are not authorized or registered (or\nif non EU-based or UK-based, as applicable, not deemed\nequivalent or recognized or endorsed).\n\nThe Benchmarks Regulations\ncould have a material impact on EURIBOR notes, in\nparticular, if the methodology or other terms of EURIBOR\nare changed in order to comply with the requirements of\nthe Benchmarks Regulations. Such changes could, among\nother things, have the effect of\nreducing, increasing or otherwise affecting the\nvolatility of the published rate or level of EURIBOR.\n\nOn September 21, 2017, the\nEuropean Central Bank announced that it would be part of\na new working group tasked with the identification and\nadoption of a \u0093risk free overnight rate\u0094 to serve as a\nbasis for an alternative to current benchmarks used in a\nvariety of\nfinancial instruments and contracts used in the euro\narea. On September 13, 2018, the working group on euro\nrisk-free rates recommended the new euro short-term rate\n(\u0093\u0080STR\u0094) as the new risk free rate for the euro area.\n\u0080STR\nwas published for the first time on October 2, 2019. In\naddition, in response to regulatory scrutiny and\napplicable legal requirements, the European Money Markets\nInstitute (the \u0093EMMI\u0094), as administrator of EURIBOR,\nconducted a series\nof consultations on a proposed reformed hybrid\nmethodology for EURIBOR. In July 2019, EMMI published its\nEURIBOR Benchmark Statement setting forth its reformed\nhybrid methodology and received regulatory authorization\nfor the continued administration\nof EURIBOR. Although EURIBOR has been reformed in order\nto comply with the terms of the EU Benchmarks Regulation,\nits future remains uncertain. It is not known how long\nEURIBOR will continue in its current form. Any of these\ndevelopments could have\na material adverse effect on the value and the return on\nEURIBOR notes.\n\nThe euro risk-free rate working group for the euro area\nhas\npublished a set of guiding principles and high level\nrecommendations for the fallback provisions in, among\nother things, new euro denominated cash products\n(including floating-rate notes) referencing EURIBOR. The\nguiding principles indicate, among\nother things, that continuing to reference EURIBOR in\nrelevant contracts (without robust fallback provisions)\nmay increase the risk to the euro area financial\n\nS-19\n\nsystem. On May 11, 2021, the euro risk-free rate working\ngroup published its recommendations on EURIBOR fallback\ntrigger events and \u0080STR-based\nfallback rates. \u0080STR has a different methodology and\nother important differences from EURIBOR and has little\nhistorical track record and may be subject to changes in\nits methodology.\n\nIn the future, EURIBOR could be subject to further\nregulatory scrutiny, reform efforts and/or other actions.\nAny such regulatory scrutiny,\nreform efforts and/or other actions could increase the\ncosts and risks of administering or otherwise\nparticipating in the setting of EURIBOR and complying\nwith applicable regulations or requirements. Such factors\nmay have the effect of discouraging\nmarket participants from continuing to administer or\ncontribute to EURIBOR, trigger changes in the rules or\nmethodologies used in EURIBOR or lead to the elimination,\ndiscontinuance or obsolescence of EURIBOR. Following the\nimplementation of reforms,\nthe manner of administration of EURIBOR may change, with\nthe result that EURIBOR may perform differently than in\nthe past, or could be eliminated or discontinued\nentirely, or there could be other consequences that\ncannot be predicted. Even prior to\nthe implementation of any changes, uncertainty as to the\nnature of potential alternative reference rates and as to\nthe nature and effect of potential changes to EURIBOR may\nadversely affect EURIBOR during the term of a series of\nEURIBOR notes, as\nwell as the value of, the return on and/or trading market\nfor such series. Any of the foregoing consequences could\nhave a material adverse effect on the interest rate on,\nvalue of, return on and trading market for any EURIBOR\nnotes.\n\nWith respect to any series of EURIBOR notes, if we or our\ndesignee, after consulting with us, determines that a\nNon-USD Benchmark Transition Event and related Non-USD\nBenchmark Replacement Date have occurred with respect to\nEURIBOR, the applicable\nNon-USD Benchmark Replacement will replace EURIBOR for\nall purposes relating to such notes. See \u0093Risks Relating\nto Non-USD Benchmark Transition Provisions\u0094\nabove. This may, among other things, result in the\napplication of backward-looking \u0080STR compounded in\narrears, whereas EURIBOR is expressed on the basis of a\nforward-looking term and includes a risk element based on\ninterbank lending.\n\nFurthermore, if EURIBOR is discontinued or ceases to be\npublished, there can be no assurances that we and other\nmarket participants will be\nadequately prepared for such discontinuance or cessation,\nwhich may have an unpredictable impact on contractual\nmechanics (including, but not limited to, the interest\nrate with respect to particular series of EURIBOR notes),\namong other adverse\nconsequences.\n\nRisks Relating to Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate Notes\n\nThe following discussion of risks specifically relates to\nthe Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate (\u0093BBSW\u0094) and BBSW notes\ngenerally. You should carefully consider the following\ndiscussion of risks before investing in BBSW notes.\n\nRegulation, reform and the actual or potential\ndiscontinuation of BBSW may adversely affect the value\nof, return on and trading market for BBSW notes.\n\nInterest rate\nbenchmarks, including BBSW, have been and continue to be\nthe subject of regulatory guidance and proposals for\nreform in Australia and internationally. These reforms\nmay cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in\nthe past, to disappear\nentirely, or have other consequences which cannot be\npredicted. Any such consequence as it relates to BBSW\ncould have a material adverse effect on BBSW notes. In\nAustralia, examples of reforms that are already effective\ninclude the replacement of\nthe Australian Financial Markets Association as BBSW\nadministrator with the Australian Securities Exchange,\nchanges to the methodology for calculation of BBSW, and\namendments to the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) made by the\nTreasury Laws Amendment\n(2017\n\nS-20\n\nMeasures No. 5) Act 2018 (Cth) which, among other things,\nenable the Australian Securities and Investment\nCommission (\u0093ASIC\u0094) to make rules relating to the\ngeneration and\nadministration of financial benchmarks. On June 6, 2018,\nASIC designated BBSW as a \u0093significant financial\nbenchmark\u0094 and made the ASIC Financial Benchmark\n(Administration) Rules 2018 and the ASIC Financial\nBenchmarks (Compelled) Rules\n2018.\n\nAlthough many of the Australian reforms were designed to\nsupport the reliability and robustness of BBSW, it is not\npossible to\npredict with certainty whether, and to what extent, BBSW\nwill continue to be supported or the extent to which\nrelated regulations, rules, practices or methodologies\nmay be amended going forward. This may cause BBSW to\nperform differently than it has\nin the past, and may have other consequences which cannot\nbe predicted. For example, it is possible that these\nchanges could cause BBSW to cease to exist, to become\ncommercially or practically unworkable, or to become more\nor less volatile or\nliquid. Any such changes could have a material adverse\neffect on the BBSW notes.\n\nIn March 2021, the Reserve Bank of Australia\n(\u0093RBA\u0094) expressed a view that calculations of BBSW using\ntenors of three months or six months are robust. The RBA,\nwith the support of the Australian Prudential Regulation\nAuthority and ASIC, has also recently recommended\nAustralian\ninstitutions to adhere to the 2020 IBOR Fallbacks\nProtocol and associated Supplement to the 2006 ISDA\nDefinitions which were launched by ISDA on October 23,\n2020, where suitable for the relevant security. However,\nreference to a specific risk\nfree rate as a fallback for BBSW has not yet been settled\nat an industry level in Australia or adopted. There is\ntherefore risk of inconsistency in the application of\npotential risk free fallback rates across different\nproducts. However the RBA is\nactively promoting, as of the date of this prospectus\nsupplement, a coordinated industry-agreed position on the\nrelevant fallback rate for BBSW.\n\nFor the purposes of determining payments of interest on\nthe BBSW notes, investors should be aware that the\nrelevant terms and provisions\nprovide for a fallback arrangement in the event that BBSW\ncannot be determined for an interest period. Any such\nfallback rates may also, at the relevant time, be\ndifficult to calculate, be more volatile than originally\nanticipated or not reflect the\nfunding cost or return anticipated by investors.\n\nInvestors should consult their own independent advisers\nand make their own assessment\nabout the potential risks imposed by BBSW reforms and the\npotential for BBSW to be discontinued in making any\ninvestment decision with respect to any BBSW notes.\n\nRisks Relating to Canadian Dollar Bankers\u0092 Acceptance\nRate Notes\n\nThe following discussion of risks specifically relates to\nthe Canadian dollar Bankers\u0092 Acceptance Rate (\u0093CDOR\u0094) and\nCDOR notes generally. You should carefully consider the\nfollowing discussion of risks before investing in CDOR\nnotes.\n\nRegulation, reform, and the potential or actual\ndiscontinuation of CDOR may adversely affect the value\nof, return on and trading market for the CDOR notes.\n\nCDOR and certain other rates or indices which are deemed\nto be \u0093benchmarks\u0094 are the subject of ongoing regulatory\nguidance and\nproposals for reform in Canada and internationally. Some\nof these reforms are already effective, while others are\nstill to be implemented. These reforms may cause such\n\u0093benchmarks\u0094 to perform differently than in the past or\nto be\ndiscontinued entirely and may have other consequences\nthat cannot be predicted. At this time, it is not\npossible to predict the effect of any such changes, any\nestablishment of alternative reference rates or any other\nreforms to CDOR that may be\nimplemented. If we or our designee, after consulting with\nus, determines that\n\nS-21\n\nCDOR has been permanently or indefinitely discontinued,\nwe or our designee will determine an alternative rate and\nadjustments to such alternative rate in accordance with\nthe terms and provisions\nset forth under \u0093Description of the Notes\u0097Floating-Rate\nNotes\u0097Floating-Rate Notes without Payment\nDelay\u0097Determination of Base Rates\u0097CDOR Notes.\u0094 In\naddition, if we or our designee determines that there is\nno clear\nmarket consensus as to an alternative rate, we will\nappoint, in our sole discretion, a financial institution\nor investment bank that is affiliated with a bank of\ninternational repute listed on any of the Schedules to\nthe Bank Act(Canada)\n(which may be an affiliate of ours) to determine an\nappropriate alternative reference rate and adjustments to\nsuch reference rate. All decisions and determinations\nmade by us or our designee or such financial institution\nor investment bank pursuant\nto the preceding sentences shall be binding on us, the\ntrustee, the investors in an applicable series of CDOR\nnotes and the beneficial owners of interests in the\nnotes. In so acting, we or our designee and the financial\ninstitution or investment\nbank would assume no obligations or relationship of\nagency or trust, including, but not limited to, any\nfiduciary duties or obligations, for or with any of the\ninvestors in the notes. Any of the factors noted above\ncould adversely affect the rate of\ninterest on the notes, which could adversely affect the\nreturn on, value of and market for the CDOR notes.\n\nRisks Relating to Fixed-Rate Reset Notes Generally\n\nThe following discussion of risks relates to the fixed-\nrate reset notes generally. You should carefully consider\nthe following discussion of risks before investing in\nfixed-rate reset notes.\n\nThe interest rate on a series of fixed-rate reset notes\nwill reset periodically and the subsequent interest rate\nmay be lower than the interest rate for prior interest\nperiods.\n\nThe interest\non a series of fixed-rate reset notes will reset\nperiodically and the interest or rate for each interest\nperiod will equal the reset reference rate specified in\nthe applicable supplement plus a spread, as applicable.\nTherefore, after the interest\nrate resets, the interest rate could be less than the\nfixed rate for the initial interest period and any\nsubsequent interest rate, if applicable, may be less than\na prior rate. We have no control over the factors that\nmay affect interest rates,\nincluding geopolitical conditions and economic,\nfinancial, political, regulatory, judicial or other\nevents that may affect the market generally and interest\nrates specifically.\n\nHistorical rates are not an indication of future rates.\n\nIn the past, the reset reference rates that may be used\nfor the fixed-rate reset notes have experienced\nsignificant fluctuations. You should\nnote that historical levels, fluctuations and trends of\nthe reset reference rates are not necessarily indicative\nof future levels. Any historical upward or downward trend\nin the applicable reset reference rate is not an\nindication that such reset\nreference rate is more or less likely to increase or\ndecrease at any time, and you should not take the\nhistorical reset reference rate levels as an indication\nof future levels.\n\nRisks Relating to Fixed-Rate Reset Notes with U.S.\nTreasury Rate as the Reset Reference Rate\n\nThe following discussion of risks relates to the fixed-\nrate reset notes with the U.S. Treasury Rate as the reset\nreference rate. You should carefully consider the\nfollowing discussion of risks before investing in fixed-\nrate reset notes with the U.S. Treasury Rate as the reset\nreference rate.\n\nThe value of and return on any fixed-rate reset notes for\nwhich the reset reference rate is the U.S. Treasury Rate\nmay be adversely affected if the interest rate is\ndetermined using an alternative method or a replacement\nrate is used.\n\nS-22\n\nUnder the circumstances described herein under\n\u0093Description of the\nNotes\u0097Fixed-Rate Reset Notes\u0097Determination of Reset\nReference Rates\u0097U.S. Treasury Rate,\u0094 the interest rate\nfor a series of fixed-rate reset notes for which the\nreset reference rate is the U.S. Treasury Rate will be\ndetermined\nusing an alternative method to determine the applicable\nU.S. Treasury Rate or, if a rate substitution event has\noccurred with respect to the applicable U.S. Treasury\nRate, using a replacement rate. If the interest rate on\nsuch a series of notes is\ndetermined by using such an alternative method or\nreplacement rate, such alternative method or replacement\nrate may result in an interest rate and interest payments\nthat are lower than or that do not otherwise correlate\nover time with the interest\nrate and interest payments that would have been made on\nsuch notes if the reset reference rate had been\ndetermined using the first method for determining the\napplicable U.S. Treasury Rate specified under\n\u0093Description of the\nNotes\u0097Fixed-Rate Reset Notes\u0097Determination of Reset\nReference Rates\u0097U.S. Treasury Rate.\u0094 If a rate\nsubstitution event has occurred and it is determined\nthere is no industry-accepted successor rate to the\napplicable U.S. Treasury\nRate (or then-applicable replacement rate), the interest\nrate for the applicable reset period will be: (a) if the\nfirst reset interest rate is to be determined, the\ninitial interest rate or (b) if a subsequent reset\ninterest rate is to be\ndetermined, the interest rate that was applicable for the\npreceding reset period.\n\nWe or our designee (after consulting with us) may make\ndeterminations with respect to the U.S. Treasury Rate\nthat could affect the market value of your fixed-rate\nreset notes.\n\nIf we\nor our designee, after consulting with us, determines\nthat the applicable U.S. Treasury Rate cannot be\ndetermined in the manner set forth under \u0093Description of\nthe Notes\u0097Fixed-Rate Reset Notes\u0097Determination of Reset\nReference\nRates\u0097U.S. Treasury Rate,\u0094 the terms of the applicable\nfixed-rate reset notes expressly authorize us or our\ndesignee, after consulting with us, to determine whether\nthere is an industry-accepted successor rate to the\napplicable U.S.\nTreasury Rate and, if applicable, to determine and make\ncertain adjustments with respect to such industry-\naccepted successor rate and the use thereof as the rate\nused to determine the interest rate on such fixed-rate\nreset notes. If we or our\ndesignee, after consulting with us, determines that there\nis no such industry-accepted successor rate, then the\ninterest rate for the applicable reset period will be (a)\nif the first reset interest rate is to be determined, the\ninitial interest\nrate or (b) if a subsequent reset interest rate is to be\ndetermined, the interest rate that was applicable for the\npreceding reset period, and such rate could remain in\neffect for so long as such fixed-rate reset notes are\noutstanding.\n\nCertain of these determinations, and other related\ndeterminations described in this prospectus supplement,\nmay require the exercise of\ndiscretion and the making of subjective judgments by us\nor our designee, after consulting with us. In making\nthese potentially subjective determinations, we or our\ndesignee may have economic interests that are adverse to\ninterests of investors in\nfixed-rate reset notes, and such determinations may\nadversely affect the return on, value of and market for\nthe fixed-rate reset notes.\n\nRisks Relating to Fixed-Rate Reset Notes with UK\nGovernment Bond (Gilt) Rate as the Reset Reference Rate\n\nThe following discussion of risks relates to the fixed-\nrate reset notes with the UK Government Bond (Gilt) Rate\nas the reset reference rate. You should carefully\nconsider the following discussion of risks before\ninvesting in fixed-rate reset notes with the UK\nGovernment Bond (Gilt) Rate as the reset reference rate.\n\nThe selection of a Gilt Benchmark Replacement could\nadversely affect the return on, value of or market for\naffected notes.\n\nS-23\n\nIf we or our designee, after consulting with us,\ndetermines that a Gilt Benchmark Transition\nEvent and related Gilt Benchmark Replacement Date have\noccurred with respect to a series of fixed-rate reset\nnotes for which the reset reference rate is specified in\nthe applicable supplement to be the UK Government Bond\n(Gilt) Rate, the applicable\nGilt Benchmark Replacement will replace the then-current\nGilt Benchmark for all purposes relating to such notes.\nIf a particular Gilt Benchmark Replacement or Gilt\nBenchmark Replacement Adjustment cannot be determined,\nthen the next-available Gilt\nBenchmark Replacement or Gilt Benchmark Replacement\nAdjustment will apply. These replacement rates and\nadjustments may be selected or formulated by the Gilt\nRelevant Governmental Body or, in certain circumstances,\nus or our designee, after\nconsulting with us.\n\nIn addition, the terms of fixed-rate reset notes for\nwhich the reset reference rate is specified in the\napplicable\nsupplement to be the UK Government Bond (Gilt) Rate\nexpressly authorize us or our designee, after consulting\nwith us, in connection with implementation of a Gilt\nBenchmark Replacement to make Gilt Benchmark Replacement\nConforming Changes with\nrespect to, among other things, the determination of\ninterest periods and the timing and frequency of\ndetermining rates and making payments of interest and\nother administrative matters. The application of a Gilt\nBenchmark Replacement and Gilt\nBenchmark Replacement Adjustment, and any implementation\nof Gilt Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, could\nresult in adverse consequences to the amount of interest\npayable on such notes, which could adversely affect the\ninterest rate, the\nreturn on, value of and market for such notes and the\nprice at which investors may be able to sell such notes.\n\nMoreover, certain\ndeterminations, decisions and elections with respect to\nthe Gilt Benchmark Replacement and any Gilt Benchmark\nReplacement Conforming Changes, or the occurrence or non-\noccurrence of a Gilt Benchmark Transition\nEvent, may require the exercise of discretion and the\nmaking of subjective judgments by us or our designee,\nafter consulting with us. Any determination, decision or\nelection made by us or our designee pursuant to the Gilt\nbenchmark transition\nprovisions set forth in this prospectus supplement under\nthe heading \u0093Description of the Notes\u0097Fixed-Rate Reset\nNotes\u0097Determination of Reset Reference Rates\u0097UK\nGovernment Bond (Gilt) Rate\u0097Effect of a Gilt Transition\nEvent\nand Related Gilt Replacement Date\u0094 will, if made by us,\nbe made in our sole discretion and, if made by our\ndesignee, be made after consultation with us and, in each\ncase, will become effective without consent from the\ninvestors in the affected\nnotes or any other party. We may designate an entity to\nmake any determination, decision or election that we have\nthe right to make in connection with the Gilt benchmark\ntransition provisions set forth in this prospectus\nsupplement. Any designee\nthat we may appoint in connection with these\ndeterminations, decisions or elections may be our\naffiliate. When performing such functions, potential\nconflicts of interest may exist between us or our\ndesignee and investors in the affected notes. All\ndeterminations by us or our designee in our or its\ndiscretion will be conclusive for all purposes and\nbinding on us and investors in the applicable notes\nabsent manifest error. In making these potentially\nsubjective determinations, we, or our\ndesignee may have economic interests that are adverse to\nyour interests, and such determinations may adversely\naffect the return on, value of and market for the\napplicable notes.\n\nFurther, (i) the composition and characteristics of any\nGilt Benchmark Replacement in respect of a series of\naffected notes will not be\nthe same as those of the applicable UK Government Bond\n(Gilt) Rate, as applicable, the Gilt Benchmark\nReplacement will not be the economic equivalent of the\napplicable UK Government Bond (Gilt) Rate, there can be\nno assurance that the Gilt Benchmark\nReplacement will perform in the same way as the\napplicable UK Government Bond (Gilt) Rate would have at\nany time and there is no guarantee that the Gilt\nBenchmark Replacement will be a comparable substitute for\nthe applicable UK Government Bond\n(Gilt) Rate (each of which means that a Gilt Benchmark\nTransition Event could adversely affect the return on,\nvalue of and market for the applicable series of notes),\n(ii) any failure of the Gilt Benchmark\n\nS-24\n\nReplacement to gain market acceptance could adversely\naffect the relevant series of notes, (iii) the Gilt\nBenchmark Replacement may have a very limited history and\nthe\nfuture performance of the Gilt Benchmark Replacement may\nnot be able to be predicted based on historical\nperformance, (iv) the secondary trading market for debt\nsecurities linked to the Gilt Benchmark Replacement may\nbe limited and (v) the\nadministrator of the Gilt Benchmark Replacement, if\napplicable, may make changes that could change the value\nof the Gilt Benchmark Replacement or discontinue the Gilt\nBenchmark Replacement and would not have any obligation\nto consider the interests\nof investors in the relevant series of notes in doing so.\nFor more information, see the Gilt benchmark transition\nprovisions set forth under \u0093Description of the\nNotes\u0097Fixed-Rate Reset Notes\u0097Determination of Reset\nReference\nRates\u0097UK Government Bond (Gilt) Rate\u0097Effect of a Gilt\nTransition Event and Related Gilt Replacement Date\u0094 below\nin this prospectus supplement.\n\nS-25\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES\n\nThis section describes general terms and provisions of\nthe notes, which may be senior or subordinated medium-\nterm notes. This section supplements, and should be read\ntogether with, the general description of our debt\nsecurities, and terms and provisions thereof, included in\n\u0093Description of Debt Securities\u0094 in the accompanying\nprospectus. If there is any inconsistency between the\ninformation in this prospectus supplement and the\naccompanying prospectus, you should rely on the\ninformation in this prospectus supplement.\n\nThe terms and provisions of the notes set forth in this\nprospectus supplement will apply to a series of notes, to\nthe extent applicable as set forth below, unless\notherwise specified in the applicable supplement. If the\napplicable supplement for a series of notes includes\nterms and provisions that modify, conflict with or\notherwise are inconsistent with the applicable terms and\nprovisions set forth below, then, regardless of whether\nor not the applicable terms and provisions set forth\nbelow are stated to apply \u0093unless otherwise specified in\nthe applicable supplement,\u0094 such terms and provisions set\nforth in the applicable supplement shall govern and\ncontrol with respect to such series of notes.\n\nCertain capitalized or other defined terms that are used\nin this section \u0093Description of the Notes\u0094 have the\nspecific meanings set forth herein. A listing of the\npages on which certain of such terms are defined can be\nfound under the Index of Certain Defined Terms at the end\nof this prospectus supplement.\n\nGeneral\n\nWe will issue the notes as part of a series of debt\nsecurities under the Senior Indenture or the Subordinated\nIndenture, as applicable, which\nare contracts between us, as issuer, and The Bank of New\nYork Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. In this\nprospectus supplement, we refer to The Bank of New York\nMellon Trust Company, N.A. and any successor trustee\nunder the Senior\nIndenture or the Subordinated Indenture, as applicable,\nas the \u0093trustee,\u0094 and we refer to the Senior Indenture\nand the Subordinated Indenture, each as may be\nsupplemented from time to time, individually as an\n\u0093Indenture\u0094 and\ntogether as the \u0093Indentures.\u0094 In addition to the\nfollowing summary of general terms of the notes and the\nIndentures, you should review the forms of the global\nnote certificates and the specific provisions of the\nSenior Indenture and the\nSubordinated Indenture, as applicable, which we have\nfiled with the SEC.\n\nThe Indentures are subject to, and governed by, the Trust\nIndenture Act of 1939.\n\nWe and the selling agents, in the ordinary course of our\nrespective businesses, have conducted and may conduct\nbusiness with the trustee or its affiliates. See\n\u0093Description of Debt Securities\u0097The Indentures\u0094 in the\naccompanying prospectus for more information about the\nIndentures and the functions of the trustee.\n\nThe notes are our direct unsecured obligations and are\nnot obligations of our subsidiaries. The Indentures do\nnot limit the amount of\nindebtedness that we may incur. We may issue other debt\nsecurities under the Indentures from time to time in one\nor more series up to the aggregate principal amount of\nthe then-existing grant of authority by our board of\ndirectors.\n\nUnless otherwise provided in the applicable supplement,\nthe minimum denomination of the notes will be $1,000 and\nany larger amount that is a\nwhole multiple of $1,000 (or the equivalent in other\ncurrencies).\n\nS-26\n\nRanking\n\nBecause we are a holding company, our right to\nparticipate in any distribution of assets of any\nsubsidiary upon such subsidiary\u0092s\nliquidation or reorganization or otherwise is subject to\nthe prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary, except\nto the extent we may ourselves be recognized as a\ncreditor of that subsidiary. Accordingly, our obligations\nunder senior notes or\nsubordinated notes will be structurally subordinated to\nall existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries,\nand claimants should look only to our assets for\npayments. In addition, the senior notes and the\nsubordinated notes will be unsecured\nand therefore in a bankruptcy or similar proceeding will\neffectively rank junior to our secured obligations to the\nextent of the value of the assets securing such\nobligations. See \u0093Risk Factors\u0097Risks Relating to Debt\nSecurities\nGenerally\u0094 in the accompanying prospectus.\n\nSenior Notes\n\nThe senior notes will be unsecured and will rank equally\nin right of payment with all our other unsecured and\nunsubordinated obligations from\ntime to time outstanding, except obligations that are\nsubject to any priorities or preferences by law.\n\nThe Senior Indenture and the\nsenior notes do not contain any limitation on the amount\nof obligations that we may incur in the future.\n\nSubordinated Notes\n\nOur indebtedness evidenced by the subordinated notes,\nincluding the principal and any premium, interest, and\nother amounts\npayable, will be unsecured and will be subordinate and\njunior in right of payment to all of our senior\nindebtedness from time to time outstanding to the extent\nand in the manner provided in the Subordinated Indenture.\nThe subordinated notes will\nrank equally in right of payment with all our other\nunsecured and subordinated indebtedness, other than\nunsecured and subordinated indebtedness that by its terms\nis subordinated to the subordinated notes. Due to\ndiffering subordination provisions in\nvarious series of subordinated debt securities issued by\nus and our predecessors, in the event of a dissolution,\nwinding up, liquidation, reorganization, insolvency,\nreceivership or other proceeding, investors in\nsubordinated notes may receive more\nor less, ratably, than investors in some other series of\nour outstanding subordinated debt securities. Payment of\nprincipal of our subordinated indebtedness, including any\nsubordinated notes, may not be accelerated if there is a\ndefault in the\npayment of amounts payable under, or a default in any of\nour other covenants applicable to, our subordinated\nindebtedness.\n\nThe\nSubordinated Indenture and the subordinated notes do not\ncontain any limitation on the amount of obligations\nranking senior to the subordinated notes, or the amount\nof obligations ranking equally with the subordinated\nnotes, that we may incur in the\nfuture.\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement,\nthe subordinated notes will not be guaranteed by us or\nany of our\naffiliates and will not be subject to any other\narrangement that legally or economically enhances the\nranking of the subordinated notes. For more information\nabout our subordinated notes, see \u0093Description of Debt\nSecurities\u0097Subordination\u0094 in the accompanying prospectus.\n\nFixed-Rate Notes\n\nWe may issue notes that bear interest at a fixed rate as\nset forth in the applicable supplement, which we refer to\nas \u0093fixed-rate\nnotes.\u0094 Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable\nsupplement,\n\nS-27\n\neach fixed-rate note will bear interest from its original\nissue date or from the most recent date to which interest\non the note has been paid or made available for payment.\nInterest will accrue\non the principal of a fixed-rate note at the fixed annual\nrate stated in the applicable supplement, until the\nprincipal is paid or made available for payment.\n\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement,\nwe will pay interest on any fixed-rate note quarterly,\nsemi-annually, or annually,\nas applicable, in arrears, on the days set forth in the\napplicable supplement (each such day being an \u0093interest\npayment date\u0094 for a fixed-rate note) and at maturity.\nUnless we specify otherwise in the applicable supplement,\neach interest\npayment due on an interest payment date or the maturity\ndate will include interest accrued from, and including,\nthe most recent interest payment date to which interest\nhas been paid, or, if no interest has been paid, from the\noriginal issue date,\nto, but excluding, the next interest payment date or the\nmaturity date or earlier redemption date, as the case may\nbe (each such period, an \u0093interest period\u0094). The amount\nof accrued interest on a fixed-rate note for an interest\nperiod is\ncalculated by multiplying the principal amount of such\nnote by an accrued interest factor. This accrued interest\nfactor will be determined by multiplying the per annum\nfixed interest rate by a factor resulting from the day\ncount convention that\napplies with respect to such determination. Unless we\nspecify otherwise in the applicable supplement, the\nfactor resulting from the day count convention will be\n(a) with respect to fixed-rate notes denominated in U.S.\ndollars, computed on the\nbasis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day\nmonths, which we may refer to as the \u009330/360\u0094 day count\nconvention, (b) with respect to fixed-rate\nnotes denominated in Australian dollars, computed on the\nbasis of the actual number of days in the relevant period\ndivided by 365, or if any portion of the relevant period\nfalls in a leap year, the sum of (i) the actual number of\ndays in that\nportion of the relevant period falling in a leap year\ndivided by 366 and (ii) the actual number of days in that\nportion of the relevant period falling in a non-leap year\ndivided by 365, which we may refer\nto as the \u0093Actual/Actual\u0094 day count convention, (c) with\nrespect to fixed-rate notes denominated in pounds\nsterling or euro, computed on the basis of an\nActual/Actual (ICMA) (as defined in the rulebook of the\nInternational Capital\nMarkets Association) day count convention, which we may\nrefer to as the \u0093Actual/Actual (ICMA)\u0094 day count\nconvention and (d) with respect to fixed-rate notes\ndenominated in Canadian dollars, computed on the basis of\n(i) the 30/360\nday count convention when calculating interest for a full\nsemi-annual interest period and (ii) the actual number of\ndays in the relevant period divided by 365, when\ncalculating interest for any period that is shorter than\na full semi-annual\ninterest period, which we may refer to as the \u0093Actual/365\n(Fixed)\u0094 or the \u0093Actual/Actual (Canadian Compound\nMethod)\u0094 day count convention. We will make payments on\nfixed-rate notes as described below under \u0093\u0097Payment of\nPrincipal, Interest, and Other Amounts Payable\u0094 and in\nthe accompanying prospectus under the heading\n\u0093Description of Debt Securities\u0097Payment of Principal,\nInterest, and Other Amounts Payable.\u0094\n\nWe also may issue amortizing notes, which are fixed-rate\nnotes for which combined principal and interest payments\nare made in installments\nover the life of the note. Payments on amortizing notes\nare applied first to interest due and then to the\nreduction of the unpaid principal amount. The applicable\nsupplement for an amortizing note will include a table\nsetting forth repayment\ninformation.\n\nFixed/Floating Rate Notes\n\nWe may issue notes with elements of each of the fixed-\nrate notes described above and floating-rate notes\ndescribed below. For example, a note\nmay bear interest at a fixed rate for some periods and at\na floating rate in others. We will describe the\ndetermination of interest for any of these notes in the\napplicable supplement.\n\nS-28\n\nFloating-Rate Notes We may issue notes that will bear\ninterest at a floating interest rate determined in\naccordance with the applicable terms and provisions set\nforth in this section and the applicable supplement. We\nrefer to these notes as \u0093floating-rate notes.\u0094 The terms\nand provisions of floating-rate notes set forth in this\nprospectus supplement will apply, to the extent\napplicable as set forth below, unless otherwise specified\nin the applicable supplement. Overview of Base Rates and\nFloating-Rate Note Provisions The interest rate for each\nseries of floating-rate notes will be determined by\nreference to a \u0093base rate\u0094 specified in the applicable\nsupplement. The \u0093base rate\u0094 for a floating-rate note\nwill, if so specified in the applicable supplement, be\none or more of the following, or may be any other base\nrate as may be specified in the applicable supplement:\n                                                         \n      the Australian dollar Bank Bill Swap Reference     \n      Rate, in which case the note will be a \u0093BBSW note\u0094;  \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      the Canadian dollar Bankers\u0092 Acceptance Rate, in    \n      which case the note will be a \u0093CDOR note\u0094;           \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      the euro interbank offered rate, in which case     \n      the note will be a \u0093EURIBOR note\u0094;

The terms and\nprovisions of such notes relating to accrued interest,\ninterest periods, the interest rate and/or timing of\ninterest payments for a particular interest period, among\nother terms and provisions of the notes, differ from the\nterms and provisions that generally are applicable to\nnotes that do not use a payment delay convention. If the\napplicable supplement for a series of compounded SOFR\nnotes or compounded SONIA notes specifies that the\n\u0093payment delay convention\u0094 applies, then the following\nterms and provisions will apply to such series.\nReferences to \u0093notes\u0094 in this subsection \u0093\u0097Payment Delay\nNotes\u0097Compounded SOFR and Compounded SONIA\u0094 are to\ncompounded SOFR notes or compounded SONIA notes, as\napplicable, using the payment delay convention. General\nTerms and Provisions Applicable to the Notes Using the\nPayment Delay Convention Each series of the notes will\naccrue interest from the original issue date of such\nseries until the principal amount is paid or made\navailable for payment at a rate per annum equal to\ncompounded SOFR or compounded SONIA, as specified in the\napplicable supplement, plus or minus the spread (if any),\nor multiplied by the spread multiplier (if any), as may\nbe specified in the applicable supplement. The \u0093spread\u0094\nis the number of basis points we may specify to be added\nto or subtracted from the applicable base rate. The\n\u0093spread multiplier\u0094 is the percentage (or number) we may\nspecify by which the specified base rate is multiplied in\norder to calculate the applicable interest rate. The\ninterest rate for a series of the notes also may be\nsubject to (i) a maximum interest rate limit, or ceiling,\non the interest that may accrue during any interest or\nother applicable period; (ii) a minimum interest rate\nlimit, or floor, on the interest that may accrue during\nany interest or other applicable period; or (iii) both.\nThe interest rate for a series of the notes will be\ndetermined by reference to compounded SOFR or compounded\nSONIA, calculated in respect of each interest period in\naccordance with the formula set forth under\n\u0093\u0097Determination of Compounded SOFR (Payment Delay)\u0094 or\n\u0093\u0097Determination of Compounded SONIA (Payment Delay)\u0094\nbelow, and the terms and provisions of the notes set\nforth under \u0093\u0097Effect of a USD Benchmark Transition Event\nand Related USD Benchmark Replacement Date with Respect\nto Term SOFR or SOFR\u0094 and \u0093\u0097Effect of a Non-USD Benchmark\nTransition Event and Related Non-USDBenchmark Replacement\nDate with Respect to EURIBOR or SONIA,\u0094 as applicable. We\nwill pay interest on a series of the notes on each\ninterest payment date with respect to such series of\nnotes. Each interest payment due on an interest payment\ndate, the maturity date or the S-31\n\nredemption date, as applicable, will include interest\naccrued from, and including, the most recent interest\nperiod demarcation date to which interest has been paid,\nor, if no interest has been\npaid, from the original issue date, to, but excluding,\nthe next interest period demarcation date (or, in the\ncase of the final interest period, the maturity date or,\nif such notes are redeemed, the redemption date) (each\nsuch period, an\n\u0093interest period\u0094 for such series of notes). The\napplicable supplement for a series of notes will specify,\namong other terms and provisions, the \u0093interest period\ndemarcation dates\u0094 with respect to such series.\n\nWe will pay interest on each series of the notes in\narrears, on the second business day (or such other number\nof business days we may specify\nin the applicable supplement) following each interest\nperiod demarcation date (each such day being an \u0093interest\npayment date\u0094 for such notes); provided that the interest\npayment date with respect to the final interest period\nfor a series\nof the notes will be the maturity date for such series\nor, if the notes are redeemed, the redemption date. On\neach interest payment date, we will pay accrued interest\nfor the most recently completed interest period.\n\nIf an interest period demarcation date other than the\nfinal interest period demarcation date otherwise would\nfall on a day that is not a\nbusiness day, then such interest period demarcation date\nwill be postponed to the next day that is a business day,\nexcept that, if the next succeeding business day falls in\nthe next calendar month, then such interest period\ndemarcation date will be\nadvanced to the immediately preceding day that is a\nbusiness day. If the scheduled final interest period\ndemarcation date (which will be the maturity date or, if\nwe elect to redeem the notes, the redemption date) falls\non a day that is not a\nbusiness day, the payment of principal and interest will\nbe made on the next succeeding business day, and such\nfinal interest period demarcation date will be postponed\nto such succeeding business day. In each case, the\nrelated interest periods also\nwill be adjusted for non-business days.\n\nWith respect to any series of fixed/floating rate notes\nfor which compounded SOFR or compounded SONIA is\nspecified to be the base rate for the applicable\nfloating-rate period and for which the payment delay\nconvention is specified to be applicable, notwithstanding\nanything to the contrary in applicable\nterms and provisions of the notes, and provided that such\nseries of notes is not redeemed prior to the commencement\nof the floating-rate period, if the final interest\npayment date falling in the fixed-rate period otherwise\nwould fall on a day that\nis not a business day, then such interest payment date\nwill be postponed to the next day that is a business day,\nand the related interest period also will be adjusted for\nnon-business days. If such final\ninterest payment date during the fixed-rate period is so\npostponed, the first day of the initial interest period\nduring the floating-rate period will be adjusted\naccordingly.\n\nThe calculation agent will determine compounded SOFR or\ncompounded SONIA, as applicable, the interest rate and\naccrued interest for each\ninterest period in arrears as soon as reasonably\npracticable on or after the interest period demarcation\ndate at the end of such interest period (or, in the case\nof the final interest period, the rate cut-off\ndate) and prior to the relevant interest payment date and\nwill notify us of compounded SOFR or compounded SONIA, as\napplicable, and such interest rate and accrued interest\nfor each interest period as soon as reasonably\npracticable after such\ndetermination, but in any event by the business day\nimmediately prior to the interest payment date.\n\nAll amounts resulting from any\ncalculation on a note will be rounded to the nearest\ncent, in the case of U.S. dollars, or to the nearest\npence, in the case of pounds sterling, with one-half cent\nor pence, as applicable, being rounded\nupward. All percentages resulting from any calculation\nwith respect to a note will be rounded, if necessary, to\nthe nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percent, with\nfive one-millionths of a percentage point\nrounded upwards, e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) being\nrounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655).\n\nS-32\n\nDetermination of Compounded SOFR (Payment Delay) The\ncalculation agent will determine \u0093compounded SOFR\u0094 for a\nseries of the notes for each interest period in\naccordance with the formula set forth below.

General Terms and\nProvisions Applicable to the Notes Determination of\nInterest Rates The interest rate for a floating-rate note\nwill be determined by reference to:\n                                                         \n      the specified base rate (based on the specified    \n      index maturity, if applicable) for each interest   \n      or other                                           \n      applicable period determined in accordance with    \n      the applicable provisions set forth in this        \n      prospectus supplement and/or the applicable        \n      supplement;                                        \n                                                         \nS-36\n                                                \n      plus or minus the spread, if any; and/or  \n                                                \n                                                    \n      multiplied by the spread multiplier, if any.  \n                                                    \nThe \u0093index maturity,\u0094 if applicable, is the period to\nmaturity of the instrument for which the base rate is\ncalculated and will be specified in the applicable\nsupplement. The \u0093spread\u0094 is the number of basis points we\nmay specify in the applicable supplement to be added to\nor subtracted from the applicable base rate. The \u0093spread\nmultiplier\u0094 is the percentage (or number) we may specify\nin the applicable supplement by which the specified base\nrate is multiplied in order to calculate the applicable\ninterest rate. Interest rates for a floating-rate note\nalso may be subject to:\n                                                         \n      a maximum interest rate limit, or ceiling, on the  \n      interest that may accrue during any interest or    \n      other                                              \n      applicable period;                                 \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      a minimum interest rate limit, or floor, on the    \n      interest that may accrue during any interest or    \n      other applicable                                   \n      period; or                                         \n                                                         \n\u0095 both. Accrual of Interest, Interest Payment Dates and\nInterest Periods Each floating-rate note will accrue\ninterest from its original issue date or from the most\nrecent date to which interest on the floating-rate note\nhas been paid or made available for payment. Interest\nwill accrue on the principal amount of a floating-rate\nnote at the applicable per annum floating interest rate\nuntil the principal amount is paid or made available for\npayment. We will pay accrued interest on any floating-\nrate note monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually\n(or for such other period as we may specify in the\napplicable supplement), as applicable, in arrears, on the\ndates set forth in the applicable supplement (each such\nday being an \u0093interest payment date\u0094 for such floating-\nrate note) and at maturity. Each interest payment due on\nan interest payment date or the maturity date will\ninclude interest accrued from, and including, the most\nrecent interest payment date to which interest has been\npaid, or, if no interest has been paid, from the original\nissue date, to, but excluding, the next interest payment\ndate or the maturity date, as the case may be (each such\nperiod, an \u0093interest period\u0094). Interest payment dates and\ninterest periods for floating-rate notes may be adjusted\nin accordance with the business day convention (as\ndescribed below under \u0093\u0097Payment of Principal, Interest,\nand Other Amounts Payable\u0097Business Day Conventions\u0094)\nspecified in the applicable supplement. Interest Reset\nDates and Interest Determination Dates for In Advance\nBase Rates The terms and provisions set forth below in\nthis section will apply to any series of notes for which\nthe base rate is specified in the applicable supplement\nto be BBSW, CDOR, EURIBOR, federal funds (effective)\nrate, prime rate, term SOFR, the treasury (auction) rate\nor any other base rate as may be specified in the\napplicable supplement as an In Advance Base Rate, but\nwill not apply to series of notes for which the base rate\nis specified in the applicable supplement to be\ncompounded SOFR, compounded SONIA, simple average SOFR or\nsimple average SONIA. The interest rate in effect from,\nand including, the original issue date of a series of\nfloating-rate notes to, but excluding, the first interest\nreset date for such notes will be the initial interest\nrate set forth in the applicable supplement or determined\nas set forth in the applicable supplement. The interest\nrate of a series of floating-rate notes may be reset\ndaily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi- S-37\n\nannually, or annually, or at any other interval, as we\nspecify in the applicable supplement. If so specified in\nthe applicable supplement, a single interest period may\ncontain multiple interest reset dates, in which case the\ninterest rate with respect to the applicable series of\nnotes will reset on each such interest reset date in\naccordance with the terms and provisions set forth in\nthis subsection or as otherwise set forth in the\napplicable supplement, and interest will accrue on such\nseries of notes at the interest rate in effect from time\nto time during such interest period. We refer to each\ndate on which the interest rate for a floating-rate note\nwill reset as an \u0093interest reset date.\u0094 We will specify\nthe interest reset dates in the applicable supplement.\nInterest reset dates may be adjusted in accordance with\nthe applicable business day convention (as described\nbelow under \u0093\u0097Payment of Principal, Interest, and Other\nAmounts Payable\u0097Business Day Conventions\u0094) specified in\nthe applicable supplement. The calculation agent will\ndetermine the interest rate for an interest period on the\ncorresponding interest determination date. The \u0093interest\ndetermination date\u0094 in respect of any interest reset date\nis the day to which the calculation agent will refer when\ndetermining the interest rate at which the applicable\nfloating interest rate will reset. Unless we specify\notherwise in the applicable supplement, the interest\ndetermination date for an interest reset date will be:\n                                                         \n      for a BBSW note, the first day of the relevant     \n      interest period;                                   \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      for a CDOR note, the first Toronto Banking Day of  \n      the relevant interest period;                      \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      for a EURIBOR note, the second TARGET Settlement   \n      Date preceding the interest reset date;            \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      for a federal funds (effective) rate note or a     \n      prime rate note, the business day immediately      \n      preceding the                                      \n      interest reset date;                               \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      for a term SOFR note, the date specified in the    \n      applicable supplement or determined in accordance  \n      with the term                                      \n      SOFR conventions;                                  \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      for a treasury (auction) rate note, the day of     \n      the week in which the interest reset date falls    \n      on which Treasury                                  \n      bills (as described below) would normally be       \n      auctioned; and                                     \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      for a floating-rate note with two or more base     \n      rates, the most recent business day that is at     \n      least two business                                 \n      days prior to the applicable interest reset date   \n      on which each applicable base rate is              \n      determinable.                                      \n                                                         \nWith respect to treasury (auction) rate notes, Treasury\nbills usually are sold at auction on Monday of each week,\nunless that day is a legal holiday, in which case the\nauction usually is held on the following Tuesday, except\nthat the auction may be held on the preceding Friday. If,\nas a result of a legal holiday, an auction is held on the\npreceding Friday, that preceding Friday will be the\ninterest determination date pertaining to the interest\nreset date occurring in the next succeeding week. The\ntreasury (auction) rate will be determined as of that\ndate, and the applicable interest rate will take effect\non the applicable interest reset date. If Treasury bills\nare sold at an auction that falls on a day that is an\ninterest reset date, that interest reset date will be the\nnext following business day unless we specify otherwise\nin the applicable supplement. In determining the base\nrate that applies to a CDOR note, a EURIBOR note, or a\ntreasury (auction) rate note during a particular interest\nperiod, the calculation agent may obtain rate quotes from\nvarious banks or dealers active in the relevant market,\nas described below under \u0093\u0097Determination of Base Rates\u0094\nand/or in the applicable supplement. Those reference\nbanks and dealers may include the calculation agent\nitself and its affiliates, as well as any underwriter,\ndealer or agent participating in the distribution of the\nrelevant notes, and its affiliates, and they may include\nour affiliates. S-38\n\nDetermination of Base Rates\n\nThe terms and provisions set forth below with respect to\nthe determination of the base rate for BBSW notes, CDOR\nnotes, EURIBOR notes, federal\nfunds (effective) rate notes, prime rate notes, term SOFR\nnotes, treasury (auction) rate notes, compounded SOFR\nnotes (other than compounded SOFR notes using the payment\ndelay convention), compounded SONIA notes (other than\ncompounded SONIA notes\nusing the payment delay convention), simple average SOFR\nnotes and simple average SONIA notes will apply to\napplicable series of floating-rate notes.\n\nBBSW Notes\n\nBBSW, for\nany interest determination date, will mean the rate for\nprime bank eligible securities having a tenor closest to\nthe index maturity specified in the applicable supplement\nwhich is designated as the \u0093AVG MID\u0094 on the Refinitiv\nScreen BBSW\nPage (or any designation which replaces that designation\non that page, or any replacement page, as applicable), or\nsuch other Relevant Screen Page as may be specified in\nthe applicable supplement, at the Publication Time on the\ninterest\ndetermination date. However, if such rate does not appear\non the Refinitiv Screen BBSW Page (or any replacement\npage) by 10:45 a.m., Sydney time, on such interest\ndetermination date (or such other time that is 15 minutes\nafter the then prevailing\nPublication Time), or if it does appear but the\ncalculation agent determines that there is an obvious\nerror in that rate, then BBSW means such other\nsubstitute, successor or replacement base rate that a\nreputable Australian financial institution\nappointed by us or our designee (upon our written\ndirection) determines, in its sole discretion, is most\ncomparable to BBSW and is consistent with industry\naccepted practices, which rate is notified in writing to\nthe calculation agent (with a copy\nto us) by such alternate financial institution. The rate\ndetermined by such alternate financial institution and\nnotified in writing to the calculation agent (with a copy\nto us) will be expressed as a percentage rate per annum.\nIf BBSW cannot be\ndetermined as described above on any interest\ndetermination date, then BBSW for the applicable interest\ndetermination date will be equal to BBSW in effect for\nthe previous interest period or, if BBSW was not used as\nthe base rate in the previous\ninterest period, the most recent rate that could have\nbeen determined in accordance with the first sentence of\nthis paragraph.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if we or our designee\n(after consulting with us) determines that (i) BBSW is\npermanently or indefinitely\ndiscontinued or (ii) the regulatory supervisor for the\nadministrator of BBSW has issued a public statement or\npublished information announcing that BBSW is no longer\nrepresentative or otherwise is not appropriate for use as\na base rate for\nAustralian dollar-denominated floating-rate notes as of\nthe relevant interest determination date, in each case\nprior to an interest determination date, then BBSW means\nsuch substitute, successor or replacement base rate that\nwe or a reputable\nAustralian financial institution or investment bank\nappointed by us as described below (after consulting with\nus) (we or such financial institution or investment bank,\nas applicable, the \u0093Determining Party\u0094), determines is\nmost comparable\nto BBSW and that is consistent with industry-accepted\npractices for Australian-dollar denominated floating-rate\nnotes, which rate is notified in writing to the\ncalculation agent (with a copy to us) if the Determining\nParty is not the calculation\nagent or us, as applicable, together with such spread\nadjustment (which may be positive or negative or zero)\nthat the Determining Party determines in its sole\ndiscretion is reasonable to produce in the aggregate a\nrate that is an industry-accepted\nsubstitute, successor or replacement rate for Australian-\ndollar denominated floating-rate notes at such time. In\nconnection with the implementation of such substitute,\nsuccessor or replacement rate, we or our designee (after\nconsulting with us) will\nhave the right to make BBSW Conforming Changes. We may,\nin our sole discretion, appoint a reputable Australian\nfinancial institution or investment bank to assist in\ndetermination of an appropriate substitute, successor or\nreplacement base rate and\nadjustments thereto (including spread adjustment) and the\napplicable BBSW Conforming Changes. If the Determining\nParty determines that there is no such substitute,\n\nS-39\n\nsuccessor or replacement base rate as so provided above,\nBBSW for the applicable interest determination date will\nbe equal to BBSW in effect for the previous interest\nperiod or, if BBSW was not\nused as the base rate in the previous interest period,\nthe most recent rate that could have been determined in\naccordance with the first sentence of the preceding\nparagraph.\n\n\u0093Relevant Screen Page\u0094 means the Bloomberg (or any\nsuccessor or replacement service) or Reuters (or any\nsuccessor or replacement\nservice) screen page specified as such in the applicable\nsupplement, in each case or such other page as may\nreplace such specified screen page on the applicable\ninformation service (or any successor or replacement\nservice).\n\n\u0093Publication Time\u0094 means approximately 10:30 a.m., Sydney\ntime (or such other time at which such rate customarily\nappears on that\npage, including, if corrected, recalculated or\nrepublished by the relevant administrator).\n\n\u0093BBSW Conforming Changes\u0094 means, in\nconnection with the implementation of such substitute,\nsuccessor or replacement rate, changes to (1) any\ninterest determination date, interest payment date, other\nrelevant date, business day convention or interest\nperiod, (2) the manner,\ntiming and frequency of determining rates and amounts of\ninterest that are payable on the BBSW notes and the\nconventions relating to such determination, (3) the\ntiming and frequency of making payments of interest, (4)\nrounding conventions,\n(5) tenors, and (6) any other terms or provisions of the\nrelevant series of notes, in each case that we or our\ndesignee (after consulting with us) determines, from time\nto time, to be reasonable to reflect the implementation\nof such\nsubstitute, successor or replacement rate giving due\nconsideration to any industry-accepted market practice\nfor Australian-dollar denominated floating-rate notes.\n\nCDOR Notes\n\nCDOR, for\nany interest determination date, will mean the average\nbid rate of interest (expressed as an annual percentage\nrate) rounded to the nearest one-hundred-thousandth of\none percent (with 0.000005 percent\nbeing rounded up) for Canadian dollar bankers\u0092\nacceptances having the index maturity specified in the\napplicable supplement which appears on the Reuters Screen\nCDOR Page as of approximately 10:15 a.m., Toronto time on\nsuch interest\ndetermination date.\n\nIf CDOR does not appear on the Reuters Screen CDOR Page\non any applicable interest determination date, or if the\nReuters Monitor Money Rates Service is not available or\nceases to exist, CDOR for such interest determination\ndate will be determined using an Alternative CDOR Page as\nof an Alternative Time on such day. If no such\nAlternative CDOR Page is available\non such interest determination date, CDOR for such\ninterest determination date shall be the average of the\nbid rates of interest (expressed as a percentage and\nrounded as set forth above) for Canadian dollar bankers\u0092\nacceptances having the\nindex maturity specified in the applicable supplement for\nsame day settlement as quoted by such of the Schedule I\nbanks (as defined in the Bank Act (Canada)) as may quote\nsuch a rate as of approximately 10:15 a.m., Toronto time,\non such\ninterest determination date. If CDOR cannot be determined\nas described above on any interest determination date,\nthen CDOR for that interest determination date will be\nequal to CDOR in effect for the prior interest period or,\nif CDOR was not used as\nthe base rate in the previous interest period, the most\nrecent rate that could have been determined in accordance\nwith the previous paragraph.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if we or our designee\n(after consulting with us) determines that CDOR for the\nindex maturity specified in the\napplicable supplement has been permanently or\nindefinitely discontinued on or prior to an interest\ndetermination date, then we shall use, as a substitute\nfor CDOR for the index maturity specified in the\napplicable supplement for that interest\ndetermination date and for each future interest\ndetermination date, the CDOR Alternative Rate.\n\nS-40\n\nIf we or our designee (after consulting with us)\ndetermines that there is no clear market\nconsensus as to a CDOR Alternative Rate, we will appoint,\nin our sole discretion, a financial institution or\ninvestment bank that is affiliated with a bank of\ninternational repute listed on any of the schedules to\nthe Bank Act (Canada) (which\nmay be an affiliate of ours) to determine an appropriate\nalternative base rate and adjustments thereto (including\nany spread to be applied to such alternative base rate).\nIn connection with the implementation of such alternative\nbase rate, we or our\ndesignee (after consulting with us) will have the right\nto make CDOR Conforming Changes. If such financial\ninstitution or investment bank is unable to determine an\nappropriate alternative base rate and adjustments, CDOR\nfor the index maturity\nspecified in the applicable supplement for such interest\nperiod will be CDOR for the index maturity specified in\nthe applicable supplement for the immediately preceding\ninterest period or, if this sentence is applicable to the\nfirst interest period\nduring the floating-rate period of a fixed/floating rate\nnote, the most recent such rate that could have been\ndetermined had the base rate been a floating rate during\nthe fixed rate period, and the process set forth in this\nparagraph to determine a\nCDOR Alternative Rate will be repeated for each\nsubsequent interest period until a CDOR Alternative Rate\ncan be determined.\n\n\u0093Reuters\nScreen CDOR Page\u0094 shall mean the display designated as\npage \u0093CDOR\u0094 on the Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service\n(or such other page as may replace the CDOR page on that\nservice) for the purpose of displaying, among other\nthings,\nCanadian dollar bankers\u0092 acceptance rates.\n\n\u0093Alternative CDOR Page\u0094 shall mean the display,\ndesignated as page\n\u0093CDOR\u0094 on Bloomberg, or an equivalent service that\ndisplays average bid rates of interest for Canadian\ndollar bankers\u0092 acceptances having the index maturity\nspecified in the applicable supplement.\n\n\u0093Alternative Time,\u0094 for any Alternative CDOR Page, shall\nmean the time of day at which such Alternative CDOR Page\nbecomes available.\n\n\u0093CDOR Alternative Rate\u0094 shall mean the alternative base\nrate selected or recommended by the central bank,\nmonetary authority,\nrelevant regulatory supervisor or any similar institution\n(including any committee or working group thereof\nsponsored by such central bank or monetary authority or\nrelevant regulatory supervisor), or identified through\nany other applicable\nregulatory or legislative action or guidance, that is\nconsistent with accepted market practice for debt\nobligations such as the CDOR notes, as identified by us\nor our designee (after consulting with us).\n\n\u0093CDOR Conforming Changes\u0094 means, in connection with the\nimplementation of such appropriate alternative base rate,\nchanges to\n(1) any interest determination date, interest payment\ndate, other relevant date, business day convention or\ninterest period, (2) the manner, timing and frequency of\ndetermining rates and amounts of interest that are\npayable on the CDOR\nnotes and the conventions relating to such determination,\n(3) the timing and frequency of making payments of\ninterest, (4) rounding conventions, (5) tenors, and (6)\nany other terms or provisions of the relevant series of\nnotes,\nin each case that we or our designee (after consulting\nwith us) determines, from time to time, are consistent\nwith accepted market practice or applicable regulatory or\nlegislative action or guidance for the use of such CDOR\nAlternative Rate for debt\nobligations such as the relevant series of notes.\n\nEURIBOR Notes\n\nEURIBOR, for any interest determination date, will mean\nthe rate for deposits in euro as sponsored, calculated,\nand published by the EMMI\nhaving the index maturity specified in the applicable\nsupplement, as that rate appears on the Designated\nEURIBOR Page, as of 11:00 a.m., Brussels time on such\ninterest determination date.\n\nS-41\n\nThe following procedures will be followed if EURIBOR\ncannot be determined as described above:\n                                                         \n      If no offered rate appears on the Designated       \n      EURIBOR Page on an interest determination date at  \n      approximately                                      \n      11:00\u00a0a.m., Brussels time, then the calculation    \n      agent will request four major banks in the         \n      Eurozone interbank market selected and identified  \n      by us to provide a quotation of the rate at which  \n      deposits in euro having the index maturity         \n      specified                                          \n      in the applicable supplement

    \n      transaction in euro in that market at that time.   \n      If at least two quotations are provided, EURIBOR   \n      will be the average of those quotations.           \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      If fewer than two quotations are provided, then    \n      the calculation agent will request four major      \n      banks in the                                       \n      Eurozone interbank market selected and identified  \n      by us to provide a quotation of the rate offered   \n      by them, at approximately 11:00\u00a0a.m., Brussels     \n      time, on the interest determination date, for      \n      loans in euro to prime banks in the Eurozone       \n      interbank market for a period of time equivalent   \n      to the index maturity specified in the applicable  \n      supplement commencing on the reset date to which   \n      such interest determination date relates and in a  \n      principal amount not less than the equivalent of   \n      \u00801,000,000, that is representative of a single      \n      transaction in euro in that market at that time.   \n      If at least three quotations are provided,         \n      EURIBOR will be the average of those quotations.   \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      If three quotations are not provided, EURIBOR for  \n      that interest determination date will be equal to  \n      EURIBOR for                                        \n      the immediately preceding interest period or, if   \n      EURIBOR was not used as the base rate in the       \n      previous interest period, the most recent rate     \n      that could

Event and\nRelated Non-USDBenchmark Replacement Date with Respect to\nEURIBOR or SONIA\u0094 below, then the Non-USDbenchmark\ntransition provisions set forth under such heading will\nthereafter apply to all determinations of the interest\nrate payable on the relevant notes. In accordance with\nthe Non-USDbenchmark transition provisions, after a Non-\nUSDBenchmark Transition Event and related Non-\nUSDBenchmark Replacement Date have occurred, the amount\nof interest that will be payable for each applicable\ninterest period will be determined by reference to a per\nannum rate equal to the Non-USDBenchmark Replacement plus\nor minus the spread, or multiplied by the spread\nmultiplier, as may be specified in the applicable\nsupplement. Certain capitalized terms used in this\nparagraph have the meanings set forth under \u0093\u0097Effect of a\nNon-USDBenchmark Transition Event and Related Non-\nUSDBenchmark Replacement Date with Respect to EURIBOR or\nSONIA.\u0094 As used in the foregoing terms and provisions\nrelating to the determination of EURIBOR: \u0093Designated\nEURIBOR Page\u0094 means the display on the page specified in\nthe applicable supplement for the purpose of displaying\nthe Eurozone interbank rates of major banks for the euro;\nprovided, however, that if no such page is specified in\nthe applicable supplement, the display on Reuters on the\nEURIBOR01 page (or any other page as may replace such\npage on such service) shall be used. \u0093Eurozone\u0094 means the\nregion comprised of member states of the European Union\nthat adopted the single currency in accordance with the\nTreaty establishing the European Community (signed in\nS-42\n\nRome on March 25, 1957), as amended by the Treaty on\nEuropean Union (signed in Maastricht on February 7, 1992)\nand the Treaty of Amsterdam (signed in Amsterdam on\nOctober 2, 1997). Federal Funds (Effective) Rate Notes\n\u0093Federal funds (effective) rate,\u0094 for any interest\ndetermination date, will be the rate for that date as\ndisplayed on the Reuters Screen Page FEDFUNDS1 (or any\nsuccessor service or any other page that replaces that\npage on that service) under the heading \u0093EFFECT\u0094 on that\ndate. With respect to any interest determination date, if\nsuch rate is not displayed on Reuters Screen Page\nFEDFUNDS1 by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on that date\nthe federal funds (effective) rate for such interest\ndetermination date will be the federal funds (effective)\nrate for such interest determination date, as published\non that date in H.15 Daily Update under the heading\n\u0093Federal Funds (Effective).\u0094 If such rate is not\npublished in H.15 Daily Update by 5:00 p.m., New York\nCity time, on that date, the federal funds (effective)\nrate for such interest determination date will be the\nfederal funds (effective) rate as published for the first\npreceding New York banking day for which the federal\nfunds (effective) rate can be determined in accordance\nwith the first sentence of this paragraph.

For\npurposes of the foregoing terms and provisions, the\nfollowing terms have the meanings set forth below: \u0093SOFR\u0094\nmeans, with respect to any U.S. government securities\nbusiness day prior to a Benchmark Replacement Date:\n                                                         \n       the Secured Overnight Financing Rate published    \n       for such U.S. government securities business day  \n       as such rate                                      \n  (1)  appears on the SOFR Administrator\u0092s Website at     \n       3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the             \n       immediately following U.S. government securities  \n       business day; or                                  \n                                                         \n                                                         \n       if the rate specified in (1)\u00a0above does not so    \n       appear, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as   \n       published                                         \n  (2)  in respect of the first preceding U.S.            \n       government securities business day for which the  \n       Secured Overnight Financing Rate was published    \n       on the SOFR Administrator\u0092s Website.               \n                                                         \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if we or our designee,\nafter consulting with us, determines that a USD Benchmark\nTransition Event and related USD Benchmark Replacement\nDate have occurred prior to the applicable USD Benchmark\nReference Time in respect of any determination of SOFR on\nany date as described under \u0093\u0097Effect of a USD Benchmark\nTransition Event and Related USD Benchmark Replacement\nDate with Respect to Term SOFR or SOFR\u0094 below, then the\nUSD benchmark transition provisions set forth under such\nheading will thereafter apply to all determinations of\nthe interest rate payable on the relevant notes. In\naccordance with the USD benchmark transition provisions,\nafter a USD Benchmark Transition Event and related USD\nBenchmark Replacement Date have occurred, the amount of\ninterest that will be payable for each applicable\ninterest period will be determined by reference to a per\nannum rate equal to the USD Benchmark Replacement plus or\nminus the spread, or multiplied by the spread multiplier,\nas may be specified in the applicable supplement. Certain\ncapitalized terms used in this paragraph have the\nmeanings set forth under \u0093\u0097Effect of a USD Benchmark\nTransition Event and Related USD Benchmark Replacement\nDate with Respect to Term SOFR or SOFR.\u0094 \u0093SOFR\nAdministrator\u0094 means the FRBNY (or a successor\nadministrator of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate).\n\u0093SOFR Administrator\u0092s Website\u0094 means the website of the\nFRBNY, or any successor source. The information contained\non such website is not part of this prospectus supplement\nand is not incorporated in this prospectus supplement by\nreference. Simple Average SONIA Notes \u0093Simple average\nSONIA\u0094 means, for each applicable interest period, a rate\nequal to the sum of the daily base rate for each calendar\nday in such interest period divided by the number of\ncalendar days in such interest period, calculated in\naccordance with the terms and provisions set forth below.\nS-53\n\nSubject to the provisions below relating to \u0093rate\nlookback\u0094 or \u0093rate cut-offdate,\u0094 as applicable, the\n\u0093daily base rate\u0094 with respect to each calendar day in a\nrelevant interest period will be SONIA in respect of such\nday; provided that for any calendar day in an interest\nperiod that is not a London banking day, SONIA in respect\nof such calendar day will be SONIA for the London banking\nday in such interest period immediately preceding such\ncalendar day. If the applicable supplement specifies that\na \u0093rate lookback\u0094 applies, then, notwithstanding the\nterms and provisions set forth in the preceding\nparagraph: (i) the \u0093daily base rate\u0094 with respect to each\nLondon banking day in a relevant interest period will be\nSONIA in respect of the London banking day falling five\nLondon banking days (or such other number of London\nbanking days as may be specified in the applicable\nsupplement) prior to such London banking day (such number\nof days, the \u0093lookback period\u0094); and (ii) the \u0093daily base\nrate\u0094 with respect to each calendar day in a relevant\ninterest period that is not a London banking day will be\nequal to the daily base rate in effect for the\nimmediately preceding London banking day. If the\napplicable supplement specifies that a \u0093rate cut-offdate\u0094\napplies then, notwithstanding the terms and provisions\nset forth in the second preceding paragraph, for each\ncalendar day in an interest period falling after the rate\ncut-offdate for such interest period, the \u0093daily base\nrate\u0094 for each such calendar day will be SONIA in respect\nof such rate cut-offdate. Unless we specify otherwise in\nthe applicable supplement, the \u0093rate cut-offdate\u0094 for an\ninterest period, if applicable, will be the five London\nbanking days (or such other number of London banking days\nas we may specify in the applicable supplement) prior to\nthe interest payment date for such interest period. The\ncalculation agent will determine simple average SONIA,\nthe interest rate and accrued interest for each interest\nperiod in arrears as soon as reasonably practicable prior\nto the relevant interest payment date and will notify us\nof simple average SONIA and such interest rate and\naccrued interest for each interest period as soon as\nreasonably practicable after such determination, but in\nany event by the London banking day immediately prior to\nthe interest payment date. For purposes of the foregoing\nterms and provisions, the following terms have the\nmeanings set forth below: \u0093SONIA\u0094 means, in relation to\nany London banking day, the daily Sterling Overnight\nIndex Average rate for such London banking day as\nprovided by the administrator of SONIA to authorized\ndistributors and as then published on the SONIA Screen\nPage or, if the SONIA Screen Page is unavailable, as\notherwise published by such authorized distributors in\neach case at 12:00 p.m., London time, on the London\nbanking day immediately following such London banking\nday; provided that if, in respect of any London banking\nday, the calculation agent determines that the SONIA rate\nis not available on the SONIA Screen Page or has not\notherwise been published by the relevant authorized\ndistributors, such SONIA rate shall be:\n                                                         \n       (i) the BoE\u0092s Bank Rate (the \u0093Bank Rate\u0094)            \n       prevailing at 5:00 p.m., London time, or, if      \n       earlier,                                          \n       close of business, on the relevant London         \n       banking day; plus (ii)\u00a0the mean of the spread of  \n       the SONIA rate to the Bank Rate over the          \n  (1)  previous five days on which a SONIA rate has      \n       been published, excluding the highest spread      \n       (or, if there is more                             \n       than one highest spread, one only of those        \n       highest spreads) and lowest spread (or, if there  \n       is more than one lowest spread, one only of       \n       those lowest spreads); or                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n       if the Bank Rate is not published by the BoE at   \n       5:00 p.m., London time, (or, if earlier, close    \n       of business) on                                   \n       the relevant London banking day, the SONIA rate   \n       published on the SONIA Screen Page (or otherwise  \n  (2)  published by the relevant authorized              \n       distributors) for the first preceding London      \n       banking day on which the SONIA rate was           \n       published on the SONIA Screen                     \n       Page (or otherwise published by the relevant      \n       authorized distributors).                         \n                                                         \nS-54\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if we or our designee,\nafter consulting with us, determines that a Non-\nUSDBenchmark Transition Event and related Non-\nUSDBenchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the\napplicable Non-USDBenchmark Reference Time in respect of\nany determination of SONIA on any date as described under\n\u0093\u0097Effect of a Non-USDBenchmark Transition Event and\nRelated Non-USDBenchmark Replacement Date with Respect to\nEURIBOR or SONIA\u0094 below, then the Non-USDbenchmark\ntransition provisions set forth under such heading will\nthereafter apply to all determinations of the interest\nrate payable on the relevant notes. In accordance with\nthe Non-USDbenchmark transition provisions, after a Non-\nUSDBenchmark Transition Event and related Non-\nUSDBenchmark Replacement Date have occurred, the amount\nof interest that will be payable for each applicable\ninterest period will be determined by reference to a per\nannum rate equal to the Non-USDBenchmark Replacement plus\nor minus the spread, or multiplied by the spread\nmultiplier, as may be specified in the applicable\nsupplement. Certain capitalized terms used in this\nparagraph have the meanings set forth under \u0093\u0097Effect of a\nNon-USDBenchmark Transition Event and Related Non-\nUSDBenchmark Replacement Date with Respect to EURIBOR or\nSONIA.\u0094 Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, in the\nevent the BoE publishes guidance as to (i) how SONIA is\nto be determined or (ii) any rate of interest that is to\nreplace the SONIA rate, the calculation agent shall, in\nconsultation with us, follow such guidance in order to\ndetermine the SONIA rate for so long as the SONIA rate is\nnot available or has not been published by the authorized\ndistributors. \u0093SONIA Screen Page\u0094 means Reuters Screen\nSONIA Page or such other page, section or other part as\nmay replace it as may be nominated by the person\nproviding or sponsoring the information appearing there\nfor the purpose of displaying rates or prices comparable\nto SONIA. Calculation of Interest Amounts for Floating-\nRate Notes The amount of accrued interest on a floating-\nrate note for an interest period is calculated by\nmultiplying the principal amount of such note by an\naccrued interest factor. This accrued interest factor\nwill be determined by multiplying the per annum floating\ninterest rate determined by reference to the applicable\nbase rate, as determined for the applicable interest\nperiod, by a factor resulting from the day count\nconvention that applies with respect to such\ndetermination. The factor resulting from the day count\nconvention will be, if so specified in the applicable\nsupplement, one of the following, or may be any other\nconvention set forth in the applicable supplement:\n                                                         \n      a factor based on a 360-day year of twelve         \n      30-day months if the day count convention          \n      specified in the applicable supplement is \u009330/360\u0094;  \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      a factor equal to the actual number of days in     \n      the relevant period divided by 360 if the day      \n      count convention                                   \n      specified in the applicable supplement is          \n      \u0093Actual/360\u0094;                                        \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      a factor equal to the actual number of days in     \n      the relevant period divided by 365, or if any      \n      portion of that                                    \n      relevant period falls in a leap year, the sum of   \n      (A)\u00a0the actual number of days in that portion of   \n      the relevant period falling in a leap year         \n      divided by 366 and (B)\u00a0the actual number of days   \n      in that portion of the relevant period falling in  \n      a non-leap year divided by 365, if the day count   \n      convention specified in the applicable supplement  \n      is \u0093Actual/Actual\u0094; or                               \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      a factor equal to the actual number of days in     \n      the relevant period divided by 365, if the day     \n      count convention                                   \n      specified in the applicable supplement is          \n      \u0093Actual/365 (Fixed).\u0094                                \n                                                         \nS-55\n\nIf no day count convention is specified in the applicable\nsupplement, the accrued interest factor will be as\nfollows:\n                                                         \n      for BBSW notes and CDOR notes, the factor will be  \n      equal to the actual number of days in the          \n      relevant period                                    \n      divided by 365;                                    \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      for treasury (auction) rate notes, compounded      \n      SONIA notes and simple average SONIA notes, the    \n      factor will be                                     \n      equal to the actual number of days in the          \n      relevant period divided by 365 (or, if any         \n      portion of such relevant period falls in a leap    \n      year, the sum of (a)\u00a0the actual number of days in  \n      that portion of such relevant period falling in a  \n      leap year,                                         \n      divided by 366 and (b)\u00a0the actual number of days   \n      in that portion of such relevant period falling    \n      in a non-leap year, divided by 365); and           \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      for EURIBOR notes, federal funds (effective) rate  \n      notes, prime rate notes, compounded SOFR notes,    \n      simple average                                     \n      SOFR notes and term SOFR notes and any other       \n      floating-rate notes other than the types of notes  \n      specified in this bulleted list, the factor will   \n      be equal to the actual number of days in the       \n      relevant period divided by 360.                    \n                                                         \nOn the relevant calculation date, the calculation agent\nwill calculate the amount of interest that has accrued\nduring each interest period in accordance with the\nprovisions set forth above. The \u0093calculation date\u0094 for\nany interest payment date will be the date by which the\ncalculation agent computes the amount of interest owed on\na floating-rate note for the related interest period. For\nany series of notes for which the specified base rate is\nan In Arrears Base Rate, the calculation date pertaining\nto an applicable interest payment date will be the\nbusiness day immediately preceding such interest payment\ndate (including, if applicable, the maturity date or the\ndate of earlier redemption or prepayment, as the case may\nbe). For any series of notes for which the specified base\nrate is an In Advance Base Rate, the calculation date\npertaining to an interest payment date will be the\nearlier of:\n                                                         \n      the tenth calendar day after the applicable        \n      interest determination date for the interest       \n      period to which such                               \n      interest payment date relates or, if that day is   \n      not a business day, the next succeeding business   \n      day; or                                            \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      the business day immediately preceding such        \n      interest payment date, the maturity date, or the   \n      date of redemption                                 \n      or prepayment, as the case may be.                 \n                                                         \nAll amounts resulting from any calculation on floating-\nrate notes will be rounded to the nearest cent, in the\ncase of U.S. dollars, or to the nearest corresponding\nhundredth of a unit, in the case of a currency other than\nU.S. dollars, with one-halfcent or one-halfof a\ncorresponding hundredth of a unit or more being rounded\nupward. All percentages resulting from any calculation\nwith respect to a floating-rate note will be rounded, if\nnecessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a\npercent, with five one-millionthsof a percentage point\nrounded upwards, e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) being\nrounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655). The interest rate on a\nnote may not be higher than the maximum rate permitted by\nNew York law, as that rate may be modified by U.S. law of\ngeneral application. Under current New York law, the\nmaximum rate of interest, subject to some exceptions, for\nany loan in an amount less than $250,000 is 16% and for\nany loan in the amount of $250,000 or more but less than\n$2,500,000 is 25% per annum on a simple interest basis.\nThese limits do not apply to loans of $2,500,000 or more\nto any one borrower. At the request of a holder of any\nBBSW note, CDOR note, EURIBOR note, federal funds\n(effective) rate note, prime rate note, term SOFR note or\ntreasury (auction) rate note, the S-56\n\ncalculation agent will provide the interest rate then in\neffect for that floating-rate note and, if already\ndetermined, the interest rate that is to take effect on\nthe next interest reset date. At the request of a holder\nof any compounded SOFR note, compounded SONIA note,\nsimple average SOFR note or simple average SONIA note,\nthe calculation agent will provide compounded SOFR,\ncompounded SONIA, simple average SOFR or simple average\nSONIA, as applicable, the interest rate and the amount of\ninterest accrued with respect to any interest period for\nsuch note, after compounded SOFR, compounded SONIA,\nsimple average SOFR or simple average SONIA, as\napplicable, and such interest rate and accrued interest\nhave been determined. Effect of a USD Benchmark\nTransition Event and Related USD Benchmark Replacement\nDate with Respect to Term SOFR or SOFR Unless we specify\notherwise in the applicable supplement, the provisions\nset forth in this subsection \u0093\u0097Effect of a USD Benchmark\nTransition Event and Related USD Benchmark Replacement\nDate with Respect to Term SOFR or SOFR,\u0094 which we refer\nto as the \u0093USD benchmark transition provisions,\u0094 will\napply to all term SOFR notes, compounded SOFR notes and\nsimple average SOFR notes.

SOFR is\npublished by the FRBNY and is intended to be a broad\nmeasure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight\ncollateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. FRBNY reports\nthat SOFR includes all trades in the Broad General\nCollateral Rate, plus bilateral\nTreasury repurchase agreement (\u0093repo\u0094) transactions\ncleared through the delivery-versus-payment service\noffered by the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (the\n\u0093FICC\u0094), a subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing\nCorporation (\u0093DTCC\u0094). SOFR is filtered by FRBNY to remove\na portion of the foregoing transactions considered to be\n\u0093specials.\u0094 According to FRBNY, \u0093specials\u0094 are repos for\nspecific-issue collateral which take place at\ncash-lending rates below those for general collateral\nrepos because cash providers are willing to accept a\nlesser return on their cash in order to obtain a\nparticular security.\n\nFRBNY reports that SOFR is calculated as a volume-\nweighted median of transaction-level tri-party repo\ndata collected from The Bank of New York Mellon, which\ncurrently acts as the clearing bank for the tri-party\nrepo market, as well as General Collateral Finance Repo\ntransaction data and data on bilateral U.S.\nTreasury repo transactions cleared through the FICC\u0092s\ndelivery-versus-payment service. FRBNY notes that it\nobtains information from DTCC Solutions LLC, an affiliate\nof DTCC.\n\nS-64\n\nIf data for a given market segment were unavailable for\nany day, then the most recently\navailable data for that segment would be utilized, with\nthe rates on each transaction from that day adjusted to\naccount for any change in the level of market rates in\nthat segment over the intervening period. SOFR would be\ncalculated from this\nadjusted prior day\u0092s data for segments where current data\nwere unavailable, and unadjusted data for any segments\nwhere data were available. To determine the change in the\nlevel of market rates over the intervening period for the\nmissing market\nsegment, the FRBNY would use information collected\nthrough a daily survey conducted by its trading desk of\nprimary dealers\u0092 repo borrowing activity. Such daily\nsurvey would include information reported by BofA\nSecurities, Inc., our affiliate,\nas a primary dealer. On June 3, 2019, FRBNY used this\ndaily survey mechanism to calculate SOFR for May 31,\n2019, when access was disrupted to one of the three\nprimary data sources used to calculate the SOFR.\n\nFRBNY currently publishes SOFR daily on its website at\nhttps://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/sofr. FRBNY\nstates on its publication\npage for SOFR that use of SOFR is subject to important\ndisclaimers, limitations and indemnification obligations,\nincluding that FRBNY may alter the methods of\ncalculation, publication schedule, rate revision\npractices or availability of SOFR at any\ntime without notice.\n\nEach U.S. government securities business day, the FRBNY\npublishes SOFR on its website at approximately 8:00 a.m.,\nNew York City time. If errors are discovered in the\ntransaction data provided by The Bank of New York Mellon\nor DTCC Solutions LLC, or in the calculation process,\nsubsequent to the initial publication of SOFR but on that\nsame day, SOFR and the\naccompanying summary statistics may be republished at\napproximately 2:30 p.m., New York City time.\nAdditionally, if transaction data from The Bank of New\nYork Mellon or DTCC Solutions LLC had previously not been\navailable in time for publication,\nbut became available later in the day, the affected rate\nor rates may be republished at around this time. Rate\nrevisions will only be effected on the same day as\ninitial publication and will only be republished if the\nchange in the rate exceeds one\nbasis point. Any time a rate is revised, a footnote to\nthe FRBNY\u0092s publication would indicate the revision. This\nrevision threshold will be reviewed periodically by the\nFRBNY and may be changed based on market conditions.\n\nSOFR is published by FRBNY based on data received from\nother sources, and we have no control over its\ndetermination, calculation or\npublication.\n\nFRBNY started publishing SOFR in April 2018. FRBNY also\nhas published historical indicative Secured Overnight\nFinancing\nRates dating back to 2014, although such historical\nindicative data inherently involves assumptions,\nestimates and approximations. Investors should not rely\non such historical indicative data or on any historical\nchanges or trends in SOFR as an\nindicator of the future performance of SOFR.\n\nNeither the SOFR Administrator\u0092s Website, nor any of the\ninformation or materials\navailable thereon, are incorporated by reference into\nthis prospectus supplement.\n\nOn April 20, 2021 the ARRC announced key principles for\nan ARRC recommended forward-looking SOFR term rate in\norder to help guide the\nARRC as it considers the conditions it believes are\nnecessary to recommend a SOFR term rate. The key\nprinciples for an ARRC-recommended forward-looking SOFR\nterm rate, are that this rate should: (1) meet the ARRC\u0092s\ncriteria for alternative\nreference rates; (2) be rooted in a robust and\nsustainable base of derivatives transactions over time;\nand (3) have a limited scope of use. In working to set\nout what it considers to be necessary conditions and the\nrecommended scope of\nuse, the ARRC is seeking to provide\n\nS-65\n\ngreater clarity to allow market participants to judge the\nlikelihood and potential timing of a recommended term\nrate for certain uses.\n\nFurther, on May 21, 2021, the ARRC announced it had\nselected CME Group as the administrator that it plans to\nrecommend for a\nforward-looking SOFR term rate, once market indicators\nfor the term rate are met. The market indicators the ARRC\nwill consider in order to recommend a term rate based on\nSOFR are: (1) continued growth in overnight SOFR-linked\nderivatives\nvolumes; (2) visible progress to deepen SOFR derivatives\nliquidity, consistent with ARRC best practices; and (3)\nvisible growth in offerings of cash products, including\nloans, linked to averages of SOFR, either in advance or\nin arrears.

If the applicable supplement for a series of\nfixed-rate reset notes includes terms and provisions that\nmodify, conflict with or otherwise are inconsistent with\nthe terms and provisions\nset forth below in this prospectus supplement, then,\nregardless of whether or not the applicable terms and\nprovisions set forth below are stated to apply \u0093unless\notherwise specified in the applicable supplement,\u0094 such\nterms and provisions\nset forth in the applicable supplement shall govern and\ncontrol with respect to such series of notes.\n\nOverview of Interest Rates and Reset Reference Rates for\nFixed-Rate Reset Notes\n\nEach fixed-rate reset note will bear interest from, and\nincluding, its\noriginal issue date to, but excluding, the \u0093first reset\ndate\u0094 specified in the applicable supplement, at the rate\nper annum specified to be the \u0093initial interest rate\u0094 in\nthe applicable supplement. The interest rate on any\nfixed-rate reset note will reset on the applicable first\nreset date and on any applicable subsequent reset date(s)\nspecified in the applicable supplement, all in accordance\nwith the terms and provisions of fixed-rate reset notes\nset forth below in\nthis prospectus supplement under \u0093\u0097Determination of\nInterest Rates for Fixed-Rate Reset Notes.\u0094 The interest\nrate to which any fixed-rate reset note resets on the\nfirst reset date and any applicable subsequent reset\ndate(s) will be\ndetermined by reference to the reset reference rate plus\nthe applicable \u0093spread,\u0094 if any, each as specified in the\napplicable supplement. The reset reference rate will be\neither the U.S. Treasury Rate or the UK Government Bond\n(Gilt) Rate,\nas specified in the applicable supplement to be the reset\nreference rate and as determined in accordance with the\nterms and provisions set forth below in this prospectus\nsupplement under \u0093\u0097Determination of Reset Reference\nRates\u0097UK\nGovernment Bond (Gilt) Rate\u0094 or \u0093\u0097Determination of Reset\nReference Rates\u0097U.S. Treasury Rate,\u0094 as applicable.\n\nS-66\n\nAccrual of Interest and Interest Payment Dates We will\npay interest on any fixed-rate reset note quarterly,\nsemi-annually, or annually, as applicable, in arrears, on\nthe days set forth in the applicable supplement (each\nsuch day being an \u0093interest payment date\u0094 for a fixed-\nrate reset note) and at maturity. Each interest payment\ndue on an interest payment date or the maturity date or\nearlier redemption date will include interest accrued\nfrom, and including, the most recent interest payment\ndate to which interest has been paid, or, if no interest\nhas been paid, from the original issue date, to, but\nexcluding, the next interest payment date or the maturity\ndate or earlier redemption date, as the case may be (each\nsuch period, an \u0093interest period\u0094). The amount of accrued\ninterest on any fixed-rate reset note for an interest\nperiod is calculated by multiplying the principal amount\nof such note by an accrued interest factor. This accrued\ninterest factor will be determined by multiplying the per\nannum fixed interest rate by a factor resulting from the\nday count convention that applies with respect to such\ndetermination. The interest rate applicable with respect\nto any interest period for any fixed-rate reset note will\nbe the rate per annum determined in accordance with the\napplicable terms and provisions set forth below under\n\u0093\u0097Determination of Interest Rates for Fixed-Rate Reset\nNotes\u0094 and \u0093\u0097Determination of Reset Reference Rates.\u0094\nInterest on fixed-rate reset notes for which the reset\nreference rate is specified in the applicable supplement\nto be the U.S. Treasury Rate will be computed and paid on\nthe basis of a 360-dayyear consisting of twelve\n30-daymonths, which we may refer to as the \u009330/360\u0094 day\ncount convention and, interest on fixed-rate reset notes\nfor which the reset reference rate is specified in the\napplicable supplement to be the UK Government Bond (Gilt)\nRate will be calculated on the basis of the actual number\nof days in the applicable interest period divided by 365.\nWe will make payments on fixed-rate reset notes as\ndescribed below in this prospectus supplement under\n\u0093\u0097Payment of Principal, Interest, and Other Amounts\nPayable\u0094 and in the accompanying prospectus under the\nheading \u0093Description of Debt Securities\u0097Payment of\nPrincipal, Interest, and Other Amounts Payable.\u0094\nDetermination of Interest Rates for Fixed-Rate Reset\nNotes Each fixed-rate reset note will bear interest:\n                                                         \n       from, and including, the original issue date to,  \n       but excluding, the first reset date (such         \n  (i)  period, the                                       \n       \u0093initial fixed rate period\u0094) at a rate per annum    \n       equal to the initial interest rate;               \n                                                         \n                                                         \n        from, and including, the first reset date to,    \n        but excluding, the first \u0093subsequent reset date\u0094   \n        specified in the applicable supplement or, if    \n  (ii)  no subsequent reset dates are specified in the   \n        applicable supplement, the maturity date at a    \n        rate per annum equal to the first reset          \n        interest rate; and                               \n                                                         \n                                                         \n         for each applicable subsequent reset period     \n  (iii)  thereafter (if any), at a rate per annum equal  \n         to the applicable                               \n         subsequent reset interest rate,                 \n                                                         \npayable, in each case, in arrears on each applicable\ninterest payment date.

S-76\n\nPayment of Principal, Interest, and Other Amounts Payable\nPaying Agents Initially, we have appointed the trustee to\nact as our paying agent, security registrar, and transfer\nagent with respect to the notes through the trustee\u0092s\ncorporate trust office. That office is currently located\nat 4655 Salisbury Road, Suite 300, Jacksonville, Florida\n32256.

Special U.S. federal\nincome tax rules are applicable to certain types of notes\nwe may issue\nunder this prospectus supplement. The material U.S.\nfederal income tax considerations with respect to any\nnotes we issue, and which are not addressed in the\naccompanying prospectus, will be discussed in the\napplicable supplement.\n\nYou should consult with your own tax advisor before\ninvesting in the notes.\n\nS-87\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION (CONFLICTS OF INTEREST)\n\nWe are offering the notes for sale on a continuing basis\nthrough the selling agents. The selling agents may act\neither on a principal\nbasis or on an agency basis. We may offer the notes at\nvarying prices relating to prevailing market prices at\nthe time of resale, as determined by the selling agents,\nor, if so specified in the applicable supplement, for\nresale at a fixed public\noffering price. The applicable supplement will set forth\nthe initial price for the notes, or whether they will be\nsold at varying prices.\n\nIf we sell notes on an agency basis, we will pay a\ncommission to the selling agent to be negotiated at the\ntime of sale. The commission will\nbe determined at the time of sale and will be specified\nin the applicable supplement. Each selling agent will use\nits reasonable best efforts when we request it to solicit\npurchases of the notes as our agent.\n\nUnless otherwise agreed and specified in the applicable\nsupplement, if notes are sold to a selling agent acting\nas principal, for its own\naccount, or for resale to one or more investors or other\npurchasers, including other broker-dealers, then any\nnotes so sold will be purchased by that selling agent at\na price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the\nnotes less a commission that\nwill be a percentage of the principal amount determined\nas described above. Notes sold in this manner may be\nresold by the selling agent to investors and other\npurchasers from time to time in one or more transactions,\nincluding negotiated\ntransactions, at a fixed public offering price or at\nvarying prices determined at the time of sale, or the\nnotes may be resold to other dealers for resale to\ninvestors. The selling agents may allow any portion of\nthe discount received in connection\nwith the purchase from us to the dealers, but the\ndiscount allowed to any dealer will not be in excess of\nthe discount to be received by the selling agent from us.\nAfter the initial public offering of notes, the selling\nagent may change the public\noffering price or the discount allowed to dealers.\n\nWe also may sell notes directly to investors, without the\ninvolvement of any selling\nagent. In this case, we would not be obligated to pay any\ncommission or discount in connection with the sale, and\nwe would receive 100% of the principal amount of the\nnotes so sold, unless otherwise specified in the\napplicable supplement.\n\nWe will name any selling agents or other persons through\nwhich we sell any notes, as well as any commissions or\ndiscounts payable to those\nselling agents or other persons, in the applicable\nsupplement. As of the date of this prospectus supplement,\nour selling agent is BofA Securities, Inc. (\u0093BofAS\u0094). We\nwill enter into a distribution agreement with BofAS that\ndescribes the\noffering of notes by them as our agent and as our\nprincipal. The form of distribution agreement will be\nfiled as an exhibit to the registration statement of\nwhich this prospectus supplement forms a part. We also\nmay accept offers to purchase notes\nthrough additional selling agents on substantially the\nsame terms and conditions, including commissions, as\nwould apply to purchases through BofAS under the\ndistribution agreement. BofAS may assign its rights under\nthe distribution agreement to\nanother one of our broker-dealer affiliates under the\ncircumstances set forth in the distribution agreement. If\na selling agent purchases notes as principal, that\nselling agent usually will be required to enter into a\nseparate purchase agreement for\nthe notes, and may be referred to in that purchase\nagreement and the applicable supplement, along with any\nother selling agents, as an \u0093underwriter.\u0094\n\nWe have the right to withdraw, cancel, or modify the\noffer made by this prospectus supplement without notice.\nWe will have the sole right to\naccept offers to purchase notes, and we, in our absolute\ndiscretion, may reject any proposed purchase of notes in\nwhole or in part. Each selling agent will have the right,\nin its reasonable discretion, to reject in whole or in\npart any proposed\npurchase of notes through that selling agent.\n\nS-88\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable supplement,\nthe obligations of the selling agents under the\ndistribution agreement, including any agreement to\npurchase notes, will be several and not joint. With\nrespect to any offering of notes, the selling agents will\noffer the notes subject to prior sale, when, as and if\nissued and accepted by them, subject to the satisfaction\nof conditions described in the distribution agreement and\nany other agreement between us and the selling agents,\nincluding any terms agreement. Any selling agent\nparticipating in the distribution of the notes may be\nconsidered to be an underwriter, as that term is defined\nin the Securities Act. We have agreed to indemnify each\nselling agent and certain other persons against certain\nliabilities, including liabilities under the Securities\nAct, or to contribute to payments that the selling agents\nmay be required to make. We also have agreed to reimburse\nthe selling agents for certain expenses. The notes will\nnot have an established trading market when issued, and\nwe do not intend to list the notes on any securities\nexchange, unless otherwise specified in the applicable\nsupplement. Any selling agent may purchase and sell notes\nin the secondary market from time to time. However, no\nselling agent is obligated to do so, and any selling\nagent may discontinue making a market in the notes at any\ntime without notice. There is no assurance that there\nwill be a secondary market for any of the notes. To\nfacilitate offerings of the notes by a selling agent that\npurchases notes as principal, and in accordance with\nindustry practice, selling agents may engage in\ntransactions that stabilize, maintain, or otherwise\naffect the market price of the notes. Those transactions\nmay include overallotment, entering stabilizing bids,\neffecting syndicate-covering transactions, and imposing\npenalty bids to reclaim selling concessions allowed to a\nmember of the syndicate or to a dealer, as follows:\n                                                         \n      An overallotment in connection with an offering    \n      creates a short position in the offered            \n      securities for the                                 \n      selling agent\u0092s own account.                        \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      A selling agent may place a stabilizing bid to     \n      purchase a note for the purpose of pegging,        \n      fixing, or maintaining                             \n      the price of that note.                            \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      Selling agents may engage in syndicate-covering    \n      transactions to cover overallotments or to         \n      stabilize the price of                             \n      the notes by bidding for, and purchasing, the      \n      notes or any other securities in the open market   \n      in order to reduce a short position created in     \n      connection with the offering.                      \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      The selling agent that serves as syndicate         \n      manager may impose a penalty bid on a syndicate    \n      member to reclaim a                                \n      selling concession in connection with an offering  \n      when offered securities originally sold by the     \n      syndicate member are purchased in                  \n      syndicate-covering transactions, in stabilization  \n      transactions, or otherwise.                        \n                                                         \nAny of these activities may stabilize or maintain the\nmarket price of the securities above independent market\nlevels.

BofAS, a selling agent and one of our\naffiliates, is a broker-dealer and member of the\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., or\n\u0093FINRA.\u0094 Each initial offering and any remarketing of\nnotes involving any of our broker-dealer affiliates,\nincluding BofAS, will be conducted in compliance with the\nrequirements of FINRA Rule 5121 regarding a FINRA member\nfirm\u0092s offer and sale of securities of an affiliate.

Resales of this kind may occur in the open market\nor may be privately negotiated at prevailing market\nprices at the time of sale. Notes may be sold in\nconnection with a remarketing after\ntheir purchase by one or more firms. Any of our\naffiliates may act as principal or agent in these\ntransactions.\n\nThis prospectus\nsupplement may be used by one or more of our affiliates\nin connection with offers and sales related to market-\nmaking transactions in the notes, including block\npositioning and block trades, to the extent permitted by\napplicable law.

Information about the trade and\nsettlement dates, as well as the purchase price, for a\nmarket-making transaction will be provided to the\npurchaser in a separate confirmation\nof sale. Unless we or one of our selling agents informs\nyou in the confirmation of sale that notes are being\npurchased in an original offering and sale, you may\nassume that you are purchasing the notes in a market-\nmaking transaction.\n\nBofAS and other selling agents that we may name in the\nfuture, or their affiliates, have engaged, and may in the\nfuture engage, in investment\nbanking, commercial banking, and financial advisory\ntransactions with us and our affiliates. These\ntransactions are in the ordinary course of business for\nthe selling agents and us and our respective affiliates.\nIn these transactions, the selling\nagents or their affiliates receive customary fees and\nexpenses.\n\nIn the applicable supplement, we will specify the\nsettlement period for\nthe offered notes. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, trades in the secondary market\ngenerally are required to settle in two business days,\nunless the parties to a trade expressly\nagree otherwise. Accordingly, if we specify a longer\nsettlement cycle in the applicable supplement for an\noffering of notes, purchasers who wish to trade those\nnotes on any date prior to two business days before\ndelivery of the notes, will be\nrequired to specify an alternative settlement cycle at\nthe time of the trade to prevent a failed settlement and\nshould consult their own advisors in connection with that\nelection.\n\nSelling Restrictions\n\nGeneral.Each of the selling agents, severally and not\njointly, has represented and agreed, and each further\nselling agent\nappointed in connection with the notes will be required\nto represent and agree, that it has not and will not\noffer, sell, or deliver any note, directly or indirectly,\nor distribute this prospectus supplement or the\naccompanying prospectus, or any\nother offering material relating to any of the notes, in\nany jurisdiction except under circumstances that will\nresult in compliance with applicable laws and regulations\nand that will not impose any obligations on us except as\nset forth in the\ndistribution agreement.\n\nArgentina.We have not made, and will not make, any\napplication to obtain an authorization from the\nComisi\u00f3n Nacional de Valores (the \u0093CNV\u0094) for the public\noffering of the notes in Argentina.

This section\nsummarizes some specific\nrisks and investment\nconsiderations with respect\nto an investment in the\nnotes. This prospectus does\nnot describe all of those\nrisks and investment\nconsiderations, including\nrisks and considerations\nrelating to your particular\ncircumstances. Neither we\nnor the agents are\nresponsible for advising you\nof these risks now or as\nthey may change in the\nfuture. In consultation with\nyour own financial, tax and\nlegal advisors, you should\nconsider carefully the\nfollowing discussion of\nrisks, among other matters,\nbefore deciding whether an\ninvestment in the notes is\nsuitable for you. The notes\nare not an appropriate\ninvestment for you if you\nare not knowledgeable about\nsignificant features of the\nnotes or financial matters\nin general. You should not\npurchase notes unless you\nunderstand and know you can\nbear these investment risks.\nFor information about risks\nand uncertainties that may\nmaterially affect our\nbusiness and results, please\nrefer to the information\nunder the captions \u0093Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\u0094 in our annual\nreport on Form 10-Kfor the\nyear ended December 31,\n2020, which is incorporated\nby reference in this\nprospectus, as well as those\nrisks and uncertainties\ndiscussed in our subsequent\nfilings with the SEC that\nare incorporated by\nreference in this\nprospectus. A resolution\nunder our single point of\nentry resolution strategy\ncould materially adversely\naffect our liquidity and\nfinancial condition and our\nability to pay our\nobligations on the notes. We\nare required periodically to\nsubmit a plan to the Federal\nDeposit Insurance\nCorporation (\u0093FDIC\u0094) and the\nBoard of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System\n(\u0093Federal Reserve\u0094)\ndescribing our resolution\nstrategy under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code in the event\nof material financial\ndistress or failure. In our\ncurrent plan, our preferred\nresolution strategy is a\nsingle point of entry\n(\u0093SPOE\u0094) strategy. This\nstrategy provides that only\nBank of America (the parent\nholding company) files for\nresolution under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code and\ncontemplates providing\ncertain key operating\nsubsidiaries with sufficient\ncapital and liquidity to\noperate through severe\nstress and to enable such\nsubsidiaries to continue\noperating or be wound down\nin a solvent manner\nfollowing a Bank of America\nbankruptcy. We have entered\ninto intercompany\narrangements governing the\ncontribution of most of our\ncapital and liquidity to\nthese key subsidiaries. As\npart of these arrangements,\nwe have transferred most of\nour assets (and have agreed\nto transfer additional\nassets) to a wholly-owned\nholding company subsidiary\nin exchange for a\nsubordinated note. Certain\nof our remaining assets\nsecure our ongoing\nobligations under these\nintercompany arrangements.\nThe wholly-owned holding\ncompany subsidiary also has\nprovided us with a committed\nline of credit that, in\naddition to our cash,\ndividends and interest\npayments, including interest\npayments we receive in\nrespect of the subordinated\nnote, may be used to fund\nour obligations. These\nintercompany arrangements\ninclude provisions to\nterminate the line of credit\nand forgive the subordinated\nnote and require us to\ncontribute our remaining\nfinancial assets to the\nwholly-owned holding company\nsubsidiary if our projected\nliquidity resources\ndeteriorate so severely that\nour resolution becomes\nimminent, which could\nmaterially and adversely\naffect our liquidity and\nability to meet our payment\nobligations, including under\nthe notes. In addition, our\npreferred resolution\nstrategy could result in\nholders of notes being in a\nworse position and suffering\ngreater losses than would\nhave been the case under a\nbankruptcy proceeding or\nother resolution scenarios\nor plans. Under Title II of\nthe Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer\nProtection Act of 2010 (the\n\u0093Financial Reform Act\u0094),\nwhen a global systemically\nimportant banking\norganization (\u0093G-SIB\u0094),such\nas Bank of America, is in\ndefault or danger of\ndefault, the FDIC may be\nappointed receiver in order\nto conduct an orderly\nliquidation of such\ninstitution. In the event of\nsuch\n\n7\n\nappointment, the FDIC could,\namong other things, invoke\nthe orderly liquidation\nauthority, instead of the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code, if the\nSecretary of the U.S.\nDepartment of Treasury makes\ncertain financial distress\nand systemic risk\ndeterminations. In 2013, the\nFDIC issued a notice\ndescribing its preferred\n\u0093single point of entry\u0094\nstrategy for resolving a\nG-SIB.Under this approach,\nthe FDIC could replace Bank\nof America with a bridge\nholding company, which could\ncontinue operations and\nresult in an orderly\nresolution of the underlying\nbank, but whose equity would\nbe held solely for the\nbenefit of our creditors.\nThe FDIC\u0092s single point of\nentry strategy may result in\nholders of notes suffering\ngreater losses than would\nhave been the case under a\nbankruptcy proceeding or a\ndifferent resolution\nstrategy. If we enter a\nresolution proceeding,\nholders of our unsecured\ndebt securities, including\nthe notes, would be at risk\nof absorbing our losses. If\nwe enter a resolution\nproceeding under either the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code or\nTitle II of the Financial\nReform Act, our losses would\nbe imposed first on holders\nof our equity securities and\nthereafter on our unsecured\ndebt, including the notes,\nand some or all of such\nsecurities could be\nsignificantly reduced or\neliminated as a result of\nsuch resolution planning.\nUnder our SPOE resolution\nstrategy, and the single\npoint of entry strategy\npreferred by the FDIC under\nTitle II of the Financial\nReform Act, the value that\nwould be distributed to\nholders of our unsecured\ndebt, including the notes,\nmay not be sufficient to\nrepay all or part of the\nprincipal amount and\ninterest on such debt, and\nholders of such debt could\nreceive no consideration at\nall under these resolution\nscenarios. Either of these\nresolution strategies could\nresult in holders of the\nnotes being in a worse\nposition and suffering\ngreater losses than would\nhave been the case under a\ndifferent resolution\nstrategy. Although SPOE is\nour preferred resolution\nstrategy, neither Bank of\nAmerica nor a bankruptcy\ncourt would be obligated to\nfollow our SPOE strategy.\nAdditionally, the FDIC is\nnot obligated to follow its\n\u0093single point of entry\u0094\nstrategy to resolve Bank of\nAmerica under Title II of\nthe Financial Reform Act.\nFor more information\nregarding the financial\nconsequences of any such\nresolution proceeding to the\nholders of our unsecured\ndebt securities, see\n\u0093Financial Consequences to\nUnsecured Debtholders of\nSingle Point of Entry\nResolution Strategy.\u0094 We are\nsubject to the final rules\nof the Board of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve\nrequiring U.S. G-SIBsto\nmaintain minimum amounts of\nlong-term debt meeting\nspecified eligibility\nrequirements. Under the\nrules of the Federal Reserve\nrelating to total loss-\nabsorbing capacity (the\n\u0093TLAC Rules\u0094), we, as a U.S.\nG-SIB,are required to, among\nother things, maintain\nminimum amounts of unsecured\nexternal long-term debt\nsatisfying certain\neligibility criteria\n(\u0093eligible LTD\u0094), and other\nloss-absorbing capacity for\nthe purpose of absorbing our\nlosses in a resolution\nproceeding under either the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code or\nTitle II of the Financial\nReform Act. Any senior long-\nterm debt must include terms\nrequired by the TLAC Rules\nin order to qualify as\neligible LTD. Actions\nrequired to comply with the\nTLAC Rules could impact our\nfunding and liquidity risk\nmanagement plans. Our\nobligations on the notes\nwill be structurally\nsubordinated to liabilities\nof our subsidiaries. Because\nwe are a holding company,\nour right to participate in\nany distribution of assets\nof any subsidiary upon such\nsubsidiary\u0092s liquidation or\nreorganization or otherwise\nis subject to the prior\nclaims of creditors of that\nsubsidiary, except to the\nextent we may ourselves be\nrecognized as a creditor of\nthat subsidiary. As a\nresult, our obligations\nunder the notes will be\nstructurally subordinated to\nall existing and future\nliabilities of our\nsubsidiaries, and claimants\nshould look only to our\nassets for payments.\nFurther, creditors of our\nsubsidiaries recapitalized\npursuant to our resolution\nplan generally would be\nentitled to payment of their\nclaims from the assets of\nthe subsidiaries, including\nour contributed assets. In\naddition, the notes will be\nunsecured and, therefore, in\na bankruptcy or similar\nproceeding, will effectively\nrank junior to our\n\n8\n\nobligations to the extent of\nthe value of the assets\nsecuring such obligations.\nHolders of notes could be at\ngreater risk for being\nstructurally subordinated if\nwe sell or convey all or\nsubstantially all of our\nassets to one or more of our\nmajority-owned subsidiaries.\nWe may sell, convey or\ntransfer all or\nsubstantially all of our\nassets to one or more\nentities that are direct or\nindirect majority-owned\nsubsidiaries of ours in\nwhich we or one or more of\nour subsidiaries owns more\nthan 50% of the combined\nvoting power, and under the\nindentures under which the\nnotes will be issued, such\nsubsidiary or subsidiaries\nwill not be required to\nassume our obligations under\nsuch notes, and we will\nremain the sole obligor on\nsuch notes. In such event,\ncreditors of any such\nsubsidiary or subsidiaries\nwould have additional assets\nfrom which to recover on\ntheir claims while holders\nof notes would be\nstructurally subordinated to\ncreditors of such subsidiary\nor subsidiaries with respect\nto such transferred assets.\nSee \u0093Description of\nNotes\u0097Limitation on Mergers\nand Sales of Assets\u0094 on page\n27 for more information.\nEvents for which\nacceleration rights under\nthe senior notes may be\nexercised are more limited\nthan those available\npursuant to the terms of our\noutstanding senior debt\nsecurities issued prior to\nJanuary 13, 2017. In\nresponse to the TLAC Rules,\nwe supplemented the\nindenture under which our\nsenior notes are issued, to,\namong other things, limit\nthe circumstances under\nwhich the payment of the\nprincipal amount of senior\nnotes can be accelerated.\nAll or substantially all of\nour outstanding senior debt\nsecurities issued prior to\nJanuary 13, 2017, (the\n\u0093Pre-2017Senior Debt\nSecurities\u0094), provide\nacceleration rights for\nnonpayment or bankruptcy.\nThe Pre-2017Senior Debt\nSecurities also provide\nacceleration rights if we\ndefault in the performance\nof our covenants in those\ndebt securities or the\napplicable indenture. In\naddition, the Pre-2017Senior\nDebt Securities do not\nrequire a 30-daycure period\nbefore a nonpayment of\nprincipal becomes an event\nof default\n\nand acceleration rights\nbecome exercisable with\nrespect to such nonpayment.\nHowever, under the indenture\nunder which our senior notes\nare issued, as supplemented,\nunless we specify otherwise\nin the applicable\nsupplement, payment of the\nprincipal amount of senior\nnotes:\n                                                         \n      may be accelerated only (i)\u00a0if we default in the   \n      payment of the principal of or interest on those   \n      senior notes and, in each case, the default        \n      continues for a period of 30 days, or (ii)\u00a0upon    \n      our voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy and, in    \n      the case of our involuntary bankruptcy, the        \n      default continues for a period of 60 days; and     \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      may not be accelerated if we default in the        \n      performance of any other covenants contained in    \n      the senior notes or such indenture.                \n                                                         \nAs a result of these\ndiffering provisions, if we\nbreach or otherwise default\nin the performance of a\ncovenant (other than a\npayment covenant) that is\napplicable both to the\nsenior notes offered and\nsold using this prospectus\nand the Pre-2017Senior Debt\nSecurities, the\nPre-2017Senior Debt\nSecurities would have\nacceleration rights that\nwould not be available to\nthe holders of such senior\nnotes. In addition, if we\nfail to pay principal when\ndue with respect to such\nsenior notes and the\nPre-2017Senior Debt\nSecurities, an event of\ndefault would occur\nimmediately with respect to\nthe Pre-2017Senior Debt\nSecurities (and the\nexercise of acceleration\nrights could proceed\nimmediately in accordance\nwith the provisions of the\napplicable indenture as in\neffect at the time of their\nissuance), while the\nholders of such senior\nnotes must wait for the\n30-daycure period to expire\nbefore such nonpayment of\nprincipal becomes an event\nof default and any\nacceleration rights are\ntriggered with respect to\nsuch nonpayment. Any\nrepayment of the principal\namount of Pre-2017Senior\nDebt Securities following\nthe exercise of\nacceleration rights in\ncircumstances in which such\nrights are not available to\nthe holders of the senior\nnotes could adversely\naffect our ability to make\ntimely payments on the\nsenior notes thereafter.\n\n9\n\nAcceleration rights for our\nsubordinated notes are\navailable only in limited\ncircumstances and are more\nlimited than those\navailable under our senior\nnotes. Unless we specify\notherwise in the applicable\nsupplement, payment of the\nprincipal amount of our\nsubordinated notes may be\naccelerated only in the\nevent of our voluntary or\ninvoluntary bankruptcy\nunder U.S. federal\nbankruptcy laws (and, in\nthe case of our involuntary\nbankruptcy, such event\ncontinues for a period of\n60 days). If you purchase\nany subordinated notes, you\nwill have no right to\naccelerate the payment of\nprincipal of the\nsubordinated notes if we\nfail to pay principal or\ninterest when due on those\nnotes or if we fail in the\nperformance of any of our\nother obligations under\nthose notes. The rights of\nacceleration under our\nsubordinated notes are more\nlimited than those\navailable pursuant to the\nterms of our senior debt\nsecurities, including the\nsenior notes. Our\nobligations under\nsubordinated notes will be\nsubordinated. Holders of\nour subordinated notes\nshould recognize that\ncontractual provisions in\nthe Subordinated Indenture\nmay prohibit us from making\npayments on the\nsubordinated notes. The\nsubordinated notes are\nunsecured and subordinate\nand junior in right of\npayment to all of our\nsenior indebtedness (as\ndefined in the Subordinated\nIndenture), to the extent\nand in the manner provided\nin the Subordinated\nIndenture. In addition, the\nsubordinated notes may be\nfully subordinated to\ninterests held by the U.S.\ngovernment in the event we\nenter into a receivership,\ninsolvency, liquidation or\nsimilar proceedings,\nincluding a proceeding\nunder Title II of the\nFinancial Reform Act. For\nadditional information\nregarding the subordination\nprovisions applicable to\nthe subordinated notes, see\n\u0093Description of\nNotes\u0097Subordination\u0094 on\npage 25. We may choose to\nredeem notes when\nprevailing interest rates\nare relatively low. If your\nnotes are redeemable at our\noption, we may choose to\nredeem your notes from time\nto time. Prevailing\ninterest rates at the time\nwe redeem your notes likely\nwould be lower than the\ninterest rate borne by your\nnotes. If prevailing\ninterest rates are lower\nwhen we elect to redeem\nyour notes, you may not be\nable to reinvest the\nredemption proceeds in a\ncomparable security at an\neffective interest rate as\nhigh as the interest rate\non the notes being\nredeemed. Our redemption\nright also may adversely\nimpact your ability to sell\nyour notes as our\nredemption date approaches.\nWe cannot assure you that a\ntrading market for your\nnotes will ever develop or\nbe maintained. Unless\notherwise specified in the\napplicable supplement, the\nnotes will not be listed on\nany securities exchange. We\ncannot predict how the\nnotes will trade in the\nsecondary market or whether\nthat market will be liquid\nor illiquid. The number of\npotential buyers of the\nnotes in any secondary\nmarket may be limited. We\ncannot assure you that a\ntrading market for your\nnotes will ever develop or\nbe maintained, which may\nlimit your ability to sell\nyour notes prior to\nmaturity. To the extent\nthat the agents engage in\nany market-making\nactivities, they may bid\nfor or offer notes. Any\nprice at which the agents\nmay bid for, offer,\npurchase or sell any notes\nmay differ from the values\ndetermined by pricing\nmodels that may be used by\nany agent, whether as a\nresult of dealer discounts,\nmark-upsor other\ntransaction costs. These\nbids, offers or completed\ntransactions may affect the\nprices, if any, at which\nthe notes might otherwise\ntrade in the market. In\naddition, if at any time\nthe agents were to cease\nacting as a market maker,\nit is likely that there\nwould be significantly less\nliquidity in the secondary\nmarket, in which case the\nprice at which the notes\ncould be sold likely would\nbe lower than if an active\nmarket existed. If you\nattempt to sell your notes\nprior to maturity, the\nmarket value of the notes,\nif any, may be less than\nthe principal amount of the\nnotes.\n\n10\n\nUnlike savings accounts,\ncertificates of deposit and\nother similar investment\nproducts, your right to\nredeem the notes prior to\nmaturity may be limited to\na valid exercise of the\nSurvivor\u0092s Option. If you\nwish to liquidate your\ninvestment in the notes\nprior to maturity, selling\nyour notes may be your only\noption. At that time, there\nmay be a very illiquid\nmarket for the notes or no\nmarket at all. Even if you\nwere able to sell your\nnotes, there are many\nfactors outside of our\ncontrol that may affect the\nmarket value of the notes,\nsome of these factors, but\nnot all, are stated below.\nSome of these factors are\ninterrelated in complex\nways and, as a result, the\neffect of any one factor\nmay be offset or magnified\nby the effect of another\nfactor. Those factors\ninclude, without\nlimitation:\n                                                         \n      the method of calculating the principal, premium,  \n      if any, interest or other amounts payable, if      \n      any, on the notes;                                 \n                                                         \n                                                        \n      the time remaining to the maturity of the notes;  \n                                                        \n                                                      \n      the aggregate outstanding amount of the notes;  \n                                                      \n                                                         \n      the redemption or repayment features of the        \n      notes;                                             \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      the level, direction and volatility of interest    \n      rates generally;                                   \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      general economic conditions of the capital         \n      markets in the United States;                      \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      geopolitical conditions and other financial,       \n      political, regulatory and judicial events that     \n      affect the financial markets generally; and        \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      any market-making activities with respect to the   \n      notes.                                             \n                                                         \nThere may be a limited\nnumber of buyers when you\ndecide to sell your notes.\nThis may affect the price\nyou receive for your notes\nor your ability to sell\nyour notes at all.\nFloating-rate notes bear\nadditional risks. If your\nnotes bear interest at a\nfloating rate, there will\nbe additional significant\nrisks not associated with a\nconventional fixed-rate\ndebt security. These risks\ninclude fluctuation of the\ninterest rates and the\n\npossibility that you will\nreceive an amount of\ninterest that is lower than\nexpected. We have no\ncontrol over a number of\nmatters, including\neconomic, financial and\npolitical events, that are\nimportant in determining\nthe existence, magnitude\nand longevity of market\nvolatility and other risks\nand their impact on the\nvalue of, or payments made\non, your floating-rate\nnotes. In recent years,\ninterest rates have been\nvolatile, and that\nvolatility may be expected\nin the future. If the\napplicable interest rate\nbasis for a series of\nfloating-rate notes is not\navailable on a particular\nday, then it may result in\nthe effective application\nof a fixed rate of interest\nfor such floating-rate\nnotes. In the event that\nthe federal funds\n(effective) rate, prime\nrate or treasury (auction)\nrate becomes unavailable\nbut has not been eliminated\nor discontinued, the\nrelevant terms and\nconditions of the notes\nprovide for certain\n\u0093fallback\u0094 arrangements\nthat will be used to\ndetermine the applicable\ninterest rate basis. In\ncertain of such\ncircumstances, the use of\nthe final fallback\nprovision for a particular\ninterest period may result\nin the interest rate basis\nfor the last preceding\ninterest determination date\nbeing used in the\ncalculation of the rate of\ninterest for such\nparticular interest period.\nThis may result in the\neffective application of a\nfixed rate of interest for\nsuch floating-rate notes.\nUnless we specifically\nprovide otherwise in the\napplicable supplement, your\nnotes will not be subject\nto the Survivor\u0092s Option;\nand even if the Survivor\u0092s\nOption is applicable to\nsome notes, it may be\nlimited in amount. Unless\nwe specify otherwise in the\napplicable supplement, your\nnotes will not be subject\nto the Survivor\u0092s Option.\nEven if the Survivor\u0092s\nOption is applicable to\nyour notes, we will have\nthe discretionary right to\nlimit the aggregate\nprincipal amount of notes\nsubject to any Survivor\u0092s\nOption that may be\nexercised in any calendar\nyear to an amount equal to\nthe greater of $2,000,000\nor 2% of the principal\namount of all notes\noutstanding as of the end\nof the most recent calendar\nyear. We also have the\ndiscretionary right to\nlimit to $250,000 in any\ncalendar year the aggregate\nprincipal 11\n\namount of notes subject to\nthe Survivor\u0092s Option that\nmay be exercised in such\ncalendar year on behalf of\nany individual deceased\nbeneficial owner of the\nnotes. Accordingly, even if\nthe Survivor\u0092s Option is\napplicable to your notes,\nno assurance can be given\nthat the Survivor\u0092s Option\nfor a desired amount will\nbe permitted in any single\ncalendar year. Our hedging\nactivities may affect your\nreturn at maturity and the\nmarket value of the notes.\nAt any time, we or our\naffiliates may engage in\nhedging activities relating\nto the notes. This hedging\nactivity, in turn, may\nincrease or decrease the\nmarket value of the notes.\nIn addition, we or our\naffiliates may acquire a\nlong or short position in\nthe notes from time to\ntime. All or a portion of\nthese positions may be\nliquidated at or about the\ntime of maturity of the\nnotes. The aggregate amount\nand the composition of\nthese positions are likely\nto vary over time. We have\nno reason to believe that\nany of our hedging\nactivities will have a\nmaterial effect on the\nnotes, either directly or\nindirectly, by impacting\nthe value of the notes.\nHowever, we cannot assure\nyou that our activities or\naffiliates\u0092 activities will\nnot affect these values.\nOur hedging and trading\nactivities may create\nconflicts of interest with\nyou. From time to time\nduring the term of each\nseries of notes and in\nconnection with the\ndetermination of the yield\non the notes, we or our\naffiliates may enter into\nadditional hedging\ntransactions or adjust or\nclose out existing hedging\ntransactions. We or our\naffiliates also may enter\ninto hedging transactions\nrelating to other notes or\ninstruments that we issue,\nsome of which may have\nreturns calculated in a\nmanner related to that of a\nparticular series of notes.\nWe or our affiliates will\nprice these hedging\ntransactions with the\nintent to realize a profit,\nconsidering the risks\ninherent in these hedging\nactivities, whether the\nvalue of the notes\nincreases or decreases.\nHowever, these hedging\nactivities may result in a\nprofit that is more or less\nthan initially expected, or\ncould result in a loss. We\nor one or more of our\nbroker-dealer affiliates,\nincluding BofA Securities,\nInc., may engage in trading\nactivities that are not for\nyour account or on your\nbehalf. These trading\nactivities may present a\nconflict of interest\nbetween your interest in\nthe notes and the interests\nwe and our affiliates may\nhave in our proprietary\naccounts, in facilitating\ntransactions, including\nblock trades, for our other\ncustomers, and in accounts\nunder our management. These\ntrading activities, if they\ninfluence the interest rate\nbasis (if any) for the\nnotes or secondary trading\n(if any) in the notes,\ncould be adverse to your\ninterests as a beneficial\nowner of the notes. Changes\nin our credit ratings may\naffect the market value of\nthe notes. Our credit\nratings are an assessment\nof our ability to pay our\nobligations. Consequently,\nour perceived\ncreditworthiness and actual\nor anticipated changes in\nour credit ratings may\naffect the market value of\nthe notes. However, because\nyour return on the notes\ndepends upon factors in\naddition to our ability to\npay our obligations, an\nimprovement in our credit\nratings will not reduce the\nother investment risks, if\nany, related to the notes.\nThe market value of the\nnotes may be affected by\nfactors in addition to\ncredit ratings. The notes\ncould trade at prices that\nmay be lower than their\ninitial offering price. In\naddition to credit ratings\nthat are assigned to the\nnotes, whether or not the\nnotes will trade at lower\nprices depends on various\nfactors, including\nprevailing interest rates\nand markets for similar\nsecurities, our financial\ncondition and future\nprospects and general\neconomic conditions.\nFurther, any credit ratings\nthat are assigned to the\nnotes may not reflect the\npotential impact of all\nrisks on their market\nvalue. Our ability to make\npayments on the notes\ndepends upon our receipt of\nfunds from our\nsubsidiaries, and\napplicable laws and\nregulations and actions we\nhave taken pursuant to our\nresolution plan could\nrestrict the ability of our\nsubsidiaries to transfer\nfunds to us.\n\n12\n\nAs a holding company, we\nconduct substantially all\nof our operations through\nour subsidiaries and depend\non dividends and other\ndistributions, loans,\nadvances and other payments\nfrom our banking and\nnonbank subsidiaries to\nfund payments on our\nobligations, including the\nnotes. Many of our\nsubsidiaries, including our\nbank and broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries, are subject\nto laws that restrict\ndividend payments or\nauthorize regulatory bodies\nto block or reduce the flow\nof funds from those\nsubsidiaries to us or to\nour other subsidiaries. In\naddition, our bank and\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries\nare subject to restrictions\non their ability to lend or\ntransact with affiliates\nand to minimum regulatory\ncapital and liquidity\nrequirements. Intercompany\narrangements we have\nentered into in connection\nwith our resolution\nplanning could restrict the\namount of funding available\nto us from our subsidiaries\nunder certain adverse\nconditions. These\nrestrictions could prevent\nthose subsidiaries from\npaying dividends or making\nother distributions to us\nor otherwise providing\nfunds to us that we need in\norder to make payments on\nthe notes. Also, our right\nto participate in any\ndistribution of assets of\nany of our subsidiaries\nupon such subsidiary\u0092s\nliquidation or otherwise\nwill be subject to the\nprior claims of creditors\nof that subsidiary, except\nto the extent that any of\nour claims as a creditor of\nsuch subsidiary may be\nrecognized. BANK OF AMERICA\nCORPORATION Bank of America\nCorporation is a Delaware\ncorporation, a bank holding\ncompany and a financial\nholding company. Through\nvarious bank and nonbank\nsubsidiaries throughout the\nUnited States and in\ninternational markets, we\nprovide a diversified range\nof banking and nonbank\nfinancial services and\nproducts. Our principal\nexecutive offices are\nlocated in the Bank of\nAmerica Corporate Center,\n100 North Tryon Street,\nCharlotte, North Carolina\n28255, and our telephone\nnumber is (704) 386-5681.\nFINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES TO\nUNSECURED DEBTHOLDERS OF\nSINGLE POINT OF ENTRY\nRESOLUTION STRATEGY We are\nsubject to TLAC Rules,\nwhich aim to improve the\nresiliency and\nresolvability of U.S.\nglobal systemically\nimportant bank holding\ncompanies (\u0093covered BHCs\u0094),\nincluding Bank of America,\nin the event of failure or\nmaterial financial\ndistress. The TLAC Rules\ninclude the requirement\nthat each covered BHC\nmaintain a minimum amount\nof eligible LTD and other\nloss-absorbing capacity.\nThe eligible LTD would\nabsorb the covered BHC\u0092s\nlosses, following the\ndepletion of its equity,\nupon its entry into a\nresolution proceeding under\nthe U.S. Bankruptcy Code or\na resolution proceeding\nadministered by the FDIC\nunder Title II of the\nFinancial Reform Act. Under\nTitle I of the Financial\nReform Act, we are required\nby the Federal Reserve and\nthe FDIC to periodically\nsubmit a plan for a rapid\nand orderly resolution\nunder the U.S. Bankruptcy\nCode in the event of\nmaterial financial distress\nor failure. Our preferred\nresolution strategy under\nthis plan is our SPOE\nstrategy under which only\nBank of America would enter\nbankruptcy proceedings.\nUnder this strategy, and\npursuant to existing\nintercompany arrangements\nunder which we have\ntransferred most of our\nassets to a wholly-owned\nholding company subsidiary,\nwhich holds the equity\ninterests in our key\noperating subsidiaries, we\nwould contribute our\nremaining financial assets,\nless a holdback to cover\nour bankruptcy expenses, to\nthis wholly-owned holding\ncompany subsidiary prior to\nfiling for bankruptcy. We\nwould then file for\nbankruptcy under Chapter 11\nof the U.S. Bankruptcy\nCode. Pursuant to an order\nfrom the bankruptcy court\nunder section 363 of the\nBankruptcy Code, we, as\ndebtor-in-possession,would\ntransfer our subsidiaries\nto a newly-formed entity\n(\u0093NewCo\u0094) that would be\nheld in trust for the sole\nand exclusive benefit of\nour bankruptcy estate.\nUnder our SPOE resolution\nstrategy, the obligations\nof Bank of America on its\nunsecured debt, including\nthe\n\n13\n\nnotes, would not be assumed\nby NewCo; instead, the\nclaims on such obligations\nwould be left behind in the\nbankruptcy proceeding.\nAfter the transferred\nsubsidiaries were\nstabilized, NewCo\u0092s\nresidual value in the form\nof shares or proceeds from\nthe sale of shares would be\ndistributed to the holders\nof claims against the\nbankruptcy estate in\naccordance with the\npriority of their claims,\nincluding to holders of the\nnotes and other unsecured\ndebt. In 2013, the FDIC\nissued a notice describing\nits similar preferred\nsingle point of entry\nrecapitalization model for\nresolving a global\nsystemically important\nbanking group, such as Bank\nof America, under Title II\nof the Financial Reform\nAct. Under Title II, when a\ncovered BHC is in default\nor danger of default, the\nFDIC may be appointed\nreceiver in order to\nconduct an orderly\nliquidation of such\ninstitution as an\nalternative to resolution\nof the entity under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code if the\nSecretary of the Treasury\nmakes certain financial\ndistress and systemic\ndeterminations. Pursuant to\nthe SPOE recapitalization\nmodel, the FDIC would use\nits power to create a\n\u0093bridge entity\u0094 for the\ncovered BHC; transfer the\nsystemically important and\nviable parts of the covered\nBHC\u0092s business to the\nbridge entity; recapitalize\nthose subsidiaries using\nassets of the covered BHC\nthat have been transferred\nto the bridge entity; and\nexchange external debt\nclaims against the covered\nBHC, including claims of\nholders of the notes and\nour other unsecured debt,\nfor equity in the bridge\nentity. This strategy would\nallow operating\nsubsidiaries of the covered\nBHC to continue to operate\nand impose losses on\nstockholders and creditors\nof the covered BHC, which\ncould include holders of\nour notes. USE OF PROCEEDS\nUnless we describe a\ndifferent use in the\napplicable supplement, we\nwill use the net proceeds\nfrom the sale of the notes\nfor general corporate\npurposes. General corporate\npurposes include, but are\nnot limited to, the\nfollowing:\n                                  \n      our working capital needs;  \n                                  \n                                                         \n      the funding of investments in, or extensions of    \n      credit to, our subsidiaries;                       \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      possible reduction, redemptions, repayments or     \n      repurchases of our outstanding indebtedness or     \n      equity securities;                                 \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      possible acquisitions of, or investments in,       \n      other financial institutions or other businesses;  \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      other uses in the ordinary course of conducting    \n      our business.                                      \n                                                         \nUntil we designate the use\nof these net proceeds, we\nwill invest them\ntemporarily. From time to\ntime, we may engage in\nadditional financings as we\ndetermine appropriate based\non our needs and prevailing\nmarket conditions. These\nadditional financings may\ninclude the sale of other\nnotes and our other\nsecurities. DESCRIPTION OF\nNOTES Our senior notes will\nbe issued under an amended\nand restated indenture dated\nas of July 1, 2001, as\namended or supplemented from\ntime to time (the \u0093Senior\nIndenture\u0094), between us and\nThe Bank of New York Mellon\nTrust Company, N.A.\n(formerly The Bank of New\nYork Trust Company, N.A.),\nas successor trustee to The\nBank of New York. Our\nsubordinated notes will be\nissued under an amended and\nrestated indenture dated as\nof July 1, 2001, as amended\nor supplemented from time to\ntime (the \u0093Subordinated\nIndenture,\u0094 and together\nwith the Senior Indenture,\nthe \u0093Indentures\u0094), between\nus and The Bank of New York\nMellon Trust Company, N.A.\n(formerly The Bank of New\nYork Trust Company, N.A.),\nas successor trustee to The\nBank of New York. The\nIndentures are subject to,\nand governed by, the Trust\nIndenture Act of 1939, as\namended. General terms and\nprovisions of the Indentures\nand the notes are summarized\nbelow. For additional\ninformation about the terms\nand provisions of the notes\nand the Indentures, you\nshould review the actual\nnotes and the Indentures,\nwhich are on file with the\nSEC. You also may review the\nIndentures at the offices of\nThe Bank of New York Mellon\nTrust Company, N.A. at the\n\n14\n\naddress indicated in the\nsection entitled \u0093Summary\u0094\nbeginning on page 4.\nWhenever we refer to\nparticular provisions of the\nIndentures or the defined\nterms contained in the\nIndentures, those provisions\nand defined terms are\nincorporated by reference in\nthis prospectus and any\napplicable supplement. The\nIndentures do not limit the\namount of additional\nindebtedness that we may\nincur. Accordingly, without\nthe consent of the holders\nof the notes, we may issue\nindebtedness under the\nIndentures in addition to\nthe notes offered by this\nprospectus. We may issue\nnotes that bear interest at\na fixed rate described in\nthe applicable supplement.\nWe refer to these notes as\n\u0093fixed-rate notes.\u0094 We may\nissue notes that bear\ninterest at a floating rate\nof interest determined by\nreference to one or more\ninterest rate bases, or by\nreference to one or more\ninterest rate formulae,\ndescribed in the applicable\nsupplement. We refer to\nthese notes as \u0093floating-\nrate notes.\u0094 In some cases,\nthe interest rate of a\nfloating-rate note also may\nbe adjusted by adding or\nsubtracting a spread or by\nmultiplying the interest\nrate by a spread multiplier.\nA floating-rate note also\nmay be subject to a maximum\ninterest rate limit, or\nceiling, and/or a minimum\ninterest rate limit, or\nfloor, on the rate of\ninterest and/or the interest\nthat may accrue during any\ninterest period. We will\nidentify the calculation\nagent for any floating-rate\nnotes in the applicable\nsupplement. The calculation\nagent may be one of our\naffiliates. The calculation\nagent will be responsible\nfor calculating the interest\nrate, reference rates,\nprincipal, premium, if any,\ninterest or other amounts\npayable, if any, applicable\nto the floating-rate notes,\nas the case may be, and for\ncertain other related\nmatters. The calculation\nagent, at the request of the\nholder of any floating-rate\nnote, will provide the\ninterest rate then in effect\nand, if already determined,\nthe interest rate that is to\ntake effect on the next\ninterest reset date, as\ndescribed below, for the\nfloating-rate note. We may\nappoint or replace any\ncalculation agent or elect\nto act as the calculation\nagent from time to time for\nsome or all of the notes,\nand the\n\ncalculation agent also may\nresign, without your consent\nand without notifying you of\nthe change. Absent manifest\nerror, all determinations of\nthe calculation agent will\nbe final and binding on you,\nthe selling agents and us.\nNotes issued in accordance\nwith this prospectus and the\napplicable supplement will\nhave the following general\ncharacteristics:\n                                                         \n      The notes will be our direct unsecured             \n      obligations. Each supplement will state whether    \n      the notes are senior or subordinated debt.

The\n\u0093spread\u0094 is the number of\nbasis points we specify on\nthe floating-rate note to\nbe added to or subtracted\nfrom the interest rate\nbasis. The \u0093spread\nmultiplier\u0094 is the\npercentage we specify on\nthe floating-rate note by\nwhich the interest rate\nbasis is multiplied in\norder to calculate the\napplicable interest rate. A\nfloating-rate note also may\nbe subject to a maximum\ninterest rate limit, or\nceiling, and/or a minimum\ninterest rate limit, or\nfloor, on the rate of\ninterest and/or the\ninterest that may accrue\nduring any interest period.\nIn addition, the interest\nrate on a floating-rate\nnote may not be higher than\nthe maximum rate permitted\nby New York law, as that\nrate may be modified by\nUnited States law of\ngeneral application. Under\ncurrent New York law, the\nmaximum rate of interest,\nsubject to some exceptions,\nfor any loan in an amount\nless than $250,000 is 16%\nand for any loan in the\namount of $250,000 or more\nbut less than $2,500,000 is\n25% per annum on a simple\ninterest basis. These\nlimits do not apply to\nloans of $2,500,000 or more\nto any one borrower.\nInterest Reset Dates.The\ninterest rate of each\nfloating-rate note may be\nreset daily, weekly,\nmonthly, quarterly, semi-\nannually or annually, as we\nspecify in the applicable\nsupplement. The interest\nrate in effect from the\nissue date to the first\ninterest reset date for a\nfloating-rate note will be\nthe initial interest rate,\nas specified in the\napplicable supplement or\ndetermined in accordance\nwith the method specified\nin the applicable\nsupplement.

Treasury bills\nusually are sold at auction\non Monday of each week,\nunless that day is a legal\nholiday, in which case the\nauction usually is held on\nthe following Tuesday,\nexcept that the auction may\nbe held on the preceding\nFriday. If, as a result of a\nlegal holiday, an auction is\nheld on the preceding\nFriday, that preceding\nFriday will be the interest\ndetermination date\npertaining to the interest\nreset date occurring in the\nnext succeeding week. The\ntreasury (auction) rate will\nbe determined as of that\ndate, and the applicable\ninterest rate will take\neffect on the applicable\ninterest reset date.

For\neach floating-rate note,\nthe calculation agent will\ndetermine the interest rate\nfor the applicable interest\nperiod and will calculate\nthe amount of interest\naccrued during each\ninterest period. Accrued\ninterest on a\n\n19\n\nfloating-rate note is\ncalculated by multiplying\nthe principal amount of a\nnote by an accrued interest\nfactor. This accrued\ninterest factor is the sum\nof the interest factors\ncalculated for each day in\nthe period for which\naccrued interest is being\ncalculated. Unless we\nspecify otherwise in the\napplicable supplement, the\ndaily interest factor will\nbe computed and interest\nwill be paid (including\npayments for partial\nperiods) as follows:\n                                                         \n      for federal funds (effective) rate notes, prime    \n      rate notes or any other floating-rate notes other  \n      than treasury (auction) rate notes, the daily      \n      interest factor will be computed on the basis of   \n      the actual number of days in the relevant period   \n      divided by 360; and                                \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      for treasury (auction) rate notes, the daily       \n      interest factor will be computed on the basis of   \n      the actual number of days in the relevant period   \n      divided                                            \n      by 365 or 366, as applicable.                      \n                                                         \nAll dollar amounts used in\nor resulting from any\ncalculation on floating-rate\nnotes will be rounded to the\nnearest cent, with one-\nhalfcent being rounded\nupward.

If\nthe applicable supplement\nstates that your note is\nredeemable at our option\nprior to its stated\nmaturity date, then on the\ndate or dates specified in\nthe supplement, we may\nredeem any of those notes,\neither in whole or from\ntime to time in part, by\ngiving written notice to\nthe holder of the note\nbeing redeemed at least 5\nbusiness days but not more\nthan 60 calendar days\nbefore the redemption date\nor dates specified in that\nsupplement (or such other\nprior notice as specified\nin the applicable\nsupplement). If the\napplicable supplement\nstates that your note is\nrepayable at your option\nprior to its stated\nmaturity date, we will\nrequire receipt of notice\nof the request for\nrepayment at least 30 but\nnot more than 60 days prior\nto the date or dates\nspecified in that\nsupplement. Repurchases of\nnotes upon exercise of any\nrepayment option may occur\nonly on an interest payment\ndate. We also must receive\nthe completed form entitled\n\u0093Option to Elect\nRepayment.\u0094 Exercise of the\nrepayment option by the\nholder of a note will be\nirrevocable. Since the\nnotes will be represented\nby a global note, DTC (as\nthe depository) or its\nnominee will be treated as\nthe holder of the notes;\ntherefore DTC or its\nnominee will be the only\nentity that receives\nnotices of\n\n22\n\nredemption of notes from\nus, in the case of our\nredemption of notes, and\nwill be the only entity\nthat can exercise the right\nto repayment of notes, in\nthe case of optional\nrepayment. See the section\nentitled \u0093Registration and\nSettlement\u0094 beginning on\npage 30. To ensure that DTC\nor its nominee will timely\nexercise a right to\nrepayment with respect to a\nparticular beneficial\ninterest in a note, the\nbeneficial owner of such\ninterest must instruct the\nbroker or other direct or\nindirect participant\nthrough which it holds a\nbeneficial interest in the\nnote to notify DTC or its\nnominee of its desire to\nexercise a right to\nrepayment. Because\ndifferent firms have\ndifferent cut-offtimes for\naccepting instructions from\ntheir customers, each\nbeneficial owner should\nconsult the broker or other\ndirect or indirect\nparticipant through which\nit holds the beneficial\ninterest in a note to\ndetermine the cut-offtime\nby which the instruction\nmust be given for timely\nnotice to be delivered to\nDTC or its nominee.\nConveyance of notices and\nother communications by DTC\nor its nominee to\nparticipants, by\nparticipants to indirect\nparticipants and by\nparticipants and indirect\nparticipants to beneficial\nowners of the notes will be\ngoverned by agreements\namong them and any\napplicable statutory or\nregulatory requirements.\nThe actual redemption or\nrepayment of a note\nnormally will occur on the\ninterest payment date or\ndates following receipt of\na valid notice. Unless\notherwise specified in the\napplicable supplement, the\nredemption or repayment\nprice will equal 100% of\nthe principal amount of the\nnote plus accrued and\nunpaid interest to the date\nor dates of redemption or\nrepayment. Notes will not\nbe redeemed in part in\nincrements less than their\nminimum denominations. We\nmay at any time purchase\nnotes at any price or\nprices in the open market\nor otherwise. If we\npurchase notes in this\nmanner, we will have the\ndiscretion to either hold\nor resell these notes or\nsurrender these notes to\nthe trustee for\ncancellation. The\nredemption or repurchase of\nany note that is our\neligible LTD will require\nthe prior approval of the\nFederal Reserve if after\nsuch redemption or\nrepurchase we would fail to\nsatisfy our requirements as\nto eligible LTD or total\nloss-absorbing capacity\nunder the TLAC rules. In\naddition, unless we specify\notherwise in the applicable\nsupplement, to the extent\nthen required by applicable\nlaws or regulations,\nsubordinated notes may not\nbe redeemed or repaid prior\nto their stated maturity\nwithout the requisite prior\napprovals, if any, from\napplicable regulators.\nSurvivor\u0092s Option The\n\u0093Survivor\u0092s Option\u0094 is a\nprovision in a note in\nwhich we agree to repay\nthat note, if requested by\nthe authorized\nrepresentative of the\nbeneficial owner of that\nnote, following the death\nof the beneficial owner of\nthe note, so long as the\nnote was acquired by the\nbeneficial owner a\nspecified period (which\nwill be stated in the\napplicable supplement for\nthe note) prior to the\nrequest. Unless we specify\notherwise in the applicable\nsupplement, the \u0093Survivor\u0092s\nOption\u0094 will not apply to\nyour notes. If the\napplicable supplement\nrelating to any note states\nthat the Survivor\u0092s Option\napplies to that note, upon\nthe valid exercise of the\nSurvivor\u0092s Option and the\nproper tender of the note\nfor repayment, we will\nrepay that note, in whole\nor in part, at a price\nequal to 100% of the\nprincipal amount of the\ndeceased beneficial owner\u0092s\nbeneficial interest in the\nnote plus any accrued and\nunpaid interest to the date\nof repayment. To be valid,\nthe Survivor\u0092s Option must\nbe exercised by or on\nbehalf of the person who\nhas authority to act on\nbehalf of the deceased\nbeneficial owner of the\nnote under the laws of the\napplicable jurisdiction\n(including, without\nlimitation, the personal\nrepresentative of or the\nexecutor of the estate of\nthe deceased beneficial\nowner or the surviving\njoint owner with the\ndeceased beneficial owner).\nA beneficial owner of a\nnote is a person who has\nthe right, immediately\nprior to such person\u0092s\ndeath, to receive the\nproceeds from the\ndisposition of that note,\nas well as the right to\nreceive payment of the\nprincipal of the note.\n\n23\n\nThe death of a person\nholding a beneficial\nownership interest in a\nnote as a joint tenant or\ntenant by the entirety with\nanother person, or as a\ntenant in common with the\ndeceased holder\u0092s spouse,\nwill be deemed the death of\na beneficial owner of that\nnote, and the entire\nprincipal amount of the\nnote held in this manner\nwill be subject to\nrepayment by us upon\nexercise of the Survivor\u0092s\nOption. However, the death\nof a person holding a\nbeneficial ownership\ninterest in a note as\ntenant in common with a\nperson other than such\ndeceased holder\u0092s spouse\nwill be deemed the death of\na beneficial owner only\nwith respect to such\ndeceased person\u0092s interest\nin the note, and only the\ndeceased beneficial owner\u0092s\npercentage interest in the\nprincipal amount of the\nnote will be subject to\nrepayment. The death of a\nperson who, during his or\nher lifetime, was entitled\nto substantially all of the\nbeneficial ownership\ninterests in a note will be\ndeemed the death of the\nbeneficial owner of that\nnote for purposes of the\nSurvivor\u0092s Option,\nregardless of whether that\nbeneficial owner was the\nregistered holder of the\nnote, if the beneficial\nownership interest can be\nestablished to the\nsatisfaction of the\ntrustee. A beneficial\nownership interest will be\ndeemed to exist in typical\ncases of nominee ownership,\nownership under the Uniform\nTransfers to Minors Act or\nUniform Gifts to Minors\nAct, community property or\nother joint ownership\narrangements between a\nhusband and wife. In\naddition, the beneficial\nownership interest in a\nnote will be deemed to\nexist in custodial and\ntrust arrangements where\none person has all of the\nbeneficial ownership\ninterest in that note\nduring his or her lifetime.\nWe have the discretionary\nright to limit the\naggregate principal amount\nof notes as to which\nexercises of the Survivor\u0092s\nOption will be accepted by\nus from all authorized\nrepresentatives of deceased\nbeneficial owners in any\ncalendar year to an amount\nequal to the greater of\n$2,000,000 or 2% of the\nprincipal amount of all\nnotes outstanding as of the\nend of the most recent\ncalendar year. We also have\nthe discretionary right to\nlimit the aggregate\nprincipal amount of notes\nas to which exercises of\nthe Survivor\u0092s Option will\nbe accepted by us from the\nauthorized representative\nfor any individual deceased\nbeneficial owner of notes\nin any calendar year to\n$250,000. In addition, we\nwill not permit the\nexercise of the Survivor\u0092s\nOption for a principal\namount less than $1,000,\nand we will not permit the\nexercise of the Survivor\u0092s\nOption if such exercise\nwill result in a note with\na principal amount of less\nthan $1,000 outstanding.\nIf, however, the original\nprincipal amount of a note\nwas less than $1,000, the\nauthorized representative\nof the deceased beneficial\nowner of the note may\nexercise the Survivor\u0092s\nOption, but only for the\nfull principal amount of\nthe note. A valid election\nto exercise the Survivor\u0092s\nOption may not be\nwithdrawn. An election to\nexercise the Survivor\u0092s\nOption will be accepted in\nthe order that it was\nreceived by the trustee,\nexcept for any note the\nacceptance of which would\ncontravene any of the\nlimitations described\nabove. Notes accepted for\nrepayment through the\nexercise of the Survivor\u0092s\nOption normally will be\nrepaid on the first\ninterest payment date that\noccurs 20 or more calendar\ndays after the date of the\nacceptance. For example, if\nthe acceptance date of a\nnote tendered pursuant to a\nvalid exercise of the\nSurvivor\u0092s Option is July\n1, 2022, and interest on\nthat note is paid monthly,\nwe would normally repay or\nrepurchase that note on the\ninterest payment date\noccurring on August 15,\n2022, because the July 15,\n2022 interest payment date\nwould occur less than 20\ndays from the date of\nacceptance. Each tendered\nnote that is not accepted\nin a calendar year due to\nthe application of any of\nthe limitations described\nin the preceding paragraph\nwill be deemed to be\ntendered in the following\ncalendar year in the order\nin which all such notes\nwere originally tendered.\nIf a note tendered through\na valid exercise of the\nSurvivor\u0092s Option is not\naccepted, the trustee will\ndeliver a notice by first-\nclass mail to the\nregistered holder, at that\nholder\u0092s last known address\nas indicated in the note\nregister, that states the\nreason that note has not\nbeen accepted for\nrepayment.\n\n24\n\nSince the notes will be\nrepresented by a global\nnote, DTC, as depository,\nor its nominee will be\ntreated as the holder of\nthe notes and will be the\nonly entity that can\nexercise the Survivor\u0092s\nOption for such notes.

The Subordinated\nIndenture generally defines\n\u0093Senior Indebtedness\u0094 as any\nindebtedness for money\nborrowed, including all of\nour indebtedness for\nborrowed and purchased\nmoney, all of our\nobligations arising from\noff-balancesheet guarantees\nand direct credit\nsubstitutes and our\nobligations associated with\nderivative products such as\ninterest and foreign\nexchange rate contracts and\ncommodity contracts, that\nwere outstanding on the date\nwe executed the Subordinated\nIndenture, or were\n\n25\n\ncreated, incurred or assumed\nafter that date, for which\nwe are responsible or liable\nas obligor, guarantor or\notherwise, and all\ndeferrals, renewals,\nextensions and refundings of\nthat indebtedness or\nobligations, other than the\nnotes issued under the\nSubordinated Indenture or\nany other indebtedness that\nby its terms is subordinate\nin right of payment to any\nof our other indebtedness.\nOur senior notes will be\nSenior Indebtedness. As of\nMarch 31, 2021, on a non-\nconsolidatedbasis, we had\napproximately $198 billion\nof senior long-term debt and\ncertain short-term senior\nborrowings. Senior\nindebtedness also includes\nour obligations under\nletters of credit,\nguarantees, foreign exchange\ncontracts and interest rate\nswap contracts, none of\nwhich are included in such\namount. In addition, holders\nof subordinated notes may be\nfully subordinated to\ninterests held by the U.S.\ngovernment in the event that\nwe enter into a\nreceivership, insolvency,\nliquidation or similar\nproceeding. We will not be\nable to make any principal,\npremium or interest payments\non the subordinated notes or\nrepurchase our subordinated\nnotes if there is a default\nor event of default on any\nSenior Indebtedness that\nwould allow acceleration of\nthe maturity thereof and\nthat is not remedied and we\nand the trustee for the\nSubordinated Indenture (the\n\u0093Subordinated Trustee\u0094)\nreceive notice of such\ndefault from the holders of\nat least 10% in principal\namount of any kind or\ncategory of any Senior\nIndebtedness or the\nSubordinated Trustee\nreceives notice from us. If\nany subordinated note is\ndeclared due and payable\nbefore the stated maturity\ndate or in connection with a\ndistribution of our assets\nto creditors pursuant to our\ndissolution, winding up,\nliquidation or\nreorganization, whether\nvoluntary or involuntary,\nany principal, premium (if\nany) or interest (if any)\nowing to holders of our\nSenior Indebtedness will be\npaid to those holders before\nany holders of subordinated\nnotes will be paid. In\naddition, if such amounts\nwere previously paid to the\nholder of a subordinated\nnote or the Subordinated\n\nTrustee, the holders of our\nSenior Indebtedness will\nhave first rights to such\namounts previously paid.\nSubject to payment in full\nof all Senior Indebtedness,\nthe holders of subordinated\nnotes will be subrogated to\nthe rights of the holders of\nSenior Indebtedness to\nreceive payments or\ndistributions of our assets\napplicable to the Senior\nIndebtedness until our\nsubordinated notes are paid\nin full. For purposes of\nthis subrogation, the\nsubordinated notes will be\nsubrogated equally and\nratably with all other\nindebtedness that by its\nterms ranks equally with our\nsubordinated notes and is\nentitled to like rights of\nsubrogation. Due to\ndiffering subordination\nprovisions in various series\nof subordinated debt\nsecurities issued by us and\nour predecessors, in the\nevent of a dissolution,\nwinding up, liquidation,\nreorganization, insolvency,\nreceivership or other\nproceeding, holders of the\nsubordinated notes may\nreceive more or less,\nratably, than holders of\nsome of our other series of\nour outstanding subordinated\ndebt securities.

At present, Bank of\nAmerica, N.A. is our only\nPrincipal Subsidiary Bank.\nThere is no comparable\ncovenant in the Subordinated\nIndenture. Waiver of\nCovenants The holders of a\nmajority in principal amount\nof the notes affected that\nare outstanding under each\nof the Indentures may waive\ncompliance with certain\ncovenants or conditions of\nsuch Indentures. Limitation\non Mergers and Sales of\nAssets Each Indenture\ngenerally permits a\nconsolidation or merger\nbetween us and another\nentity. It also permits the\n\nsale or transfer by us of\nall or substantially all of\nour assets. These\ntransactions are permitted\nif the following\nrequirements are met:\n                                                         \n      the resulting or acquiring entity, if other than   \n      us, is organized and existing under the laws of    \n      the United States, any state or the District of    \n      Columbia and expressly assumes all of our          \n      obligations under that Indenture; and              \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      immediately after the transaction, we (or any      \n      successor company) are not in default in the       \n      performance of any covenant or condition under     \n      that                                               \n      Indenture.                                         \n                                                         \nThe foregoing requirements\ndo not apply in the case of\na sale or conveyance by us\nof all or substantially all\nof our assets to one or\nmore entities that are\ndirect or indirect\nsubsidiaries in which we\nand/or one or more of our\nsubsidiaries own more than\n50% of the combined voting\npower. Upon any\nconsolidation, merger, sale\nor conveyance of this kind\n(other than a sale or\nconveyance to our direct or\nindirect subsidiary or\nsubsidiaries in which we\nown more than 50% of the\ncombined voting power as\ndescribed in the preceding\nparagraph), the resulting\nor acquiring entity will be\nsubstituted for us in the\napplicable Indenture with\nthe same effect as if it\nhad been an original party\nto that Indenture. As a\nresult, the successor\nentity may exercise our\nrights and powers under\nthat Indenture.\nModification of the\nIndentures We and the\ntrustee may modify each of\nthe Senior Indenture and\nthe Subordinated Indenture\nwith the consent of the\nholders of at least 66 2 /\n3 % of the aggregate\nprincipal amount of the\nnotes at the time\noutstanding under the\napplicable Indenture and\naffected by such\nmodification, voting as one\nclass. However, we cannot\nmodify either Indenture to\nextend the fixed maturity\nof, reduce the principal\namount or redemption\npremium of, or reduce the\nrate of or extend the time\nof payment of interest on,\nany note without the\nconsent of each noteholder\nso affected. Furthermore,\nwe cannot\n\n27\n\nmodify either Indenture to\nreduce the percentage of\nnotes required to consent\nto modification without the\nconsent of all holders of\nthe notes outstanding under\nthat Indenture. In\naddition, we and the\napplicable trustee may\nexecute supplemental\nindentures in limited\ncircumstances without the\nconsent of any holders of\noutstanding notes. Meetings\nand Action by Noteholders\nThe trustee may call a\nmeeting in its discretion\nor upon request by us or\nthe holders of at least 10%\nin principal amount of the\nnotes outstanding of any or\nall series under the\napplicable Indenture upon\nthe giving of notice. If a\nmeeting of noteholders is\nduly held, any resolution\nraised or decision taken\nwill be binding on all\nholders of notes\noutstanding of the relevant\nseries under that\nIndenture. Remedies Events\nof Default and Rights of\nAcceleration; Covenant\nBreaches.The Senior\nIndenture defines an event\nof default for a particular\nseries of senior notes as\nany one of the following\nevents:\n                                                         \n      our failure to pay principal or premium when due   \n      and payable on any senior notes of that series,    \n      and continuance of such default for a period of    \n      30                                                 \n      days;                                              \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      our failure to pay interest on any senior notes    \n      of that series when due and payable, and           \n      continuance of such default for a period of 30     \n      days;                                              \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      specified events involving our bankruptcy,         \n      insolvency or liquidation; and                     \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      any other event of default specified for a series  \n      of senior notes pursuant to the Senior Indenture.  \n                                                         \nAny additional or different\nevents of default for any\nissue of senior notes will\nbe specified in the\napplicable supplement. The\nSubordinated Indenture\ndefines an event of default\nfor subordinated notes\nsolely as our bankruptcy\nunder U.S. federal\nbankruptcy laws, whether\nvoluntary or involuntary\n(and, in the case of our\ninvoluntary\n\nbankruptcy, continuing for a\nperiod of 60 consecutive\ndays) and any other events\nof default specified for a\nseries of subordinated notes\npursuant to the Subordinated\nIndenture. Unless otherwise\nspecified in the applicable\nsupplement, if an event of\ndefault under the Senior\nIndenture or under the\nSubordinated Indenture\noccurs and is continuing,\neither the trustee or the\nholders of 25% in aggregate\nprincipal amount of the\nnotes outstanding under the\napplicable Indenture (or, in\nthe case of an event of\ndefault under the Senior\nIndenture with respect to a\nseries of senior notes, the\nholders of 25% in aggregate\nprincipal amount of the\noutstanding senior notes of\nall series affected) may\ndeclare the principal amount\nof all such notes (or the\noutstanding senior notes of\nall series affected, as the\ncase may be) to be due and\npayable immediately. The\nholders of a majority in\nprincipal amount of the\nnotes then outstanding (or\nof the series affected, as\nthe case may be), in some\ncircumstances, may annul the\ndeclaration of acceleration\nand waive past defaults.\nWith respect to a failure on\nour part to observe or\nperform any of the covenants\nor agreements contained in\nthe notes or in the\napplicable indenture (other\nthan those for which\nacceleration rights are\navailable as discussed\nabove), which failure\ncontinues for a period of 90\ndays after the date on which\nwritten notice of such\nfailure is given (a\n\u0093covenant breach\u0094), the\ntrustee and the holders of\nthe notes may pursue certain\nremedies as described below\nor as set forth in the\napplicable indenture. Unless\notherwise specified in the\napplicable supplement, with\nrespect to any senior notes\nissued under the Senior\nIndenture on or after April\n18, 2017, an event of\ndefault will not occur, and\nneither the trustee nor the\nholders of such senior notes\nwill have the right to\naccelerate the payment of\nprincipal of such senior\nnotes, as a result of a\ncovenant breach. In\naddition, an event of\ndefault will not occur, and\nneither the trustee nor the\nholders of such senior notes\nwill have the right to\naccelerate the payment of\nprincipal of such senior 28\n\nnotes, as a result of our\nfailure to pay principal of\nor premium or interest on\nsuch senior notes when due\nand payable until such\ndefault has continued for a\nperiod of 30 days. Unless\notherwise specified in the\napplicable supplement,\npayment of principal of the\nsubordinated notes may not\nbe accelerated in the case\nof a default in the payment\nof principal or any premium,\ninterest, or other amounts\nor a breach in the\nperformance of any of our\nother covenants. At least\nannually, we are required to\nfile with the trustee a\ncertificate stating that we\nare not in default with any\nof the terms of the\nrespective Indentures.\nCollection of Indebtedness\nand Suits for Enforcement by\nTrustee.If (i) we fail to\npay the principal of (or,\nunder the Senior Indenture,\nany premium on) any notes,\n(ii) we are over 30 days\nlate on an interest payment\non the notes, or (iii) for\nsubordinated notes, we\ndefault in the performance\nof our other covenants under\nthe Subordinated Indenture,\nthe applicable trustee can\ndemand that we pay to it,\nfor the benefit of the\nholders of those notes, the\namount which is due and\npayable on those notes,\nincluding any interest\nincurred because of our\nfailure to make that\npayment. In the event of our\nnonpayment of principal or\ninterest (which nonpayment\nfor senior notes constitutes\nan event of default) or a\ncovenant breach, the trustee\nmay take appropriate action,\nincluding instituting\njudicial proceedings against\nus. In addition, a holder of\nour notes may file suit to\nenforce our obligation to\nmake payment of principal,\nany premium, interest, or\nother amounts due on such\nnotes regardless of the\nactions taken by the\ntrustee. The holders of a\nmajority in principal amount\nof each series of notes then\noutstanding under the\napplicable Indenture may\ndirect the time, method and\nplace for conducting any\nproceeding for any remedy\navailable to the trustee or\nexercising any trust or\npower conferred on the\ntrustee under that\nIndenture, subject to\ncertain limitations\ndescribed in the applicable\nIndenture. The trustee may\ndecline to act if the\ndirection is contrary to law\nand in certain other\ncircumstances set forth in\nthe\n\napplicable Indenture. The\ntrustee is not obligated to\nexercise any of its rights\nor powers under the\napplicable Indenture at the\nrequest or direction of the\nholders of the notes unless\nthe holders offer the\ntrustee indemnity reasonably\nsatisfactory to the trustee\nagainst expenses and\nliabilities. Limitation on\nSuits.Each Indenture\nprovides that no individual\nholder of notes of any\nseries may institute any\naction against us under that\nIndenture, except actions\nfor payment of overdue\nprincipal and interest,\nunless the following actions\nhave occurred:\n                                                         \n      the holder must have previously given written      \n      notice to the trustee of a continuing event of     \n      default;                                           \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      the holders of not less than 25% in principal      \n      amount of such outstanding notes issued under the  \n      applicable Indenture must have (1)\u00a0requested the   \n      trustee to institute proceedings in respect of a   \n      default and (2)\u00a0offered the trustee indemnity      \n      reasonably satisfactory to the trustee against     \n      liabilities incurred by the trustee for taking     \n      such action;                                       \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      the trustee must have failed to institute          \n      proceedings within 60 days after receipt of the    \n      request referred to above; and                     \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      the holders of a majority in principal amount of   \n      such outstanding notes issued under the            \n      applicable Indenture must not have given           \n      direction to the                                   \n      trustee inconsistent with the request of the       \n      holders referred to above.                         \n                                                         \nHowever, the holder of any\nsenior notes will have an\nabsolute right to receive\npayment of principal of and\nany premium and interest on\nthe senior notes when due\nand to institute suit to\nenforce this payment, and\nthe holder of any\nsubordinated notes will\nhave, subject to applicable\nsubordination provisions,\nthe absolute right to\nreceive payment of\nprincipal of and any\npremium and any interest on\nthe subordinated note when\ndue in accordance with the\nSubordinated Indenture and\nto institute suit to\nenforce this payment.\n\n29\n\nReopening We have the\nability to \u0093reopen,\u0094 or\nincrease after the issuance\ndate, the principal amount\nof a particular series of\nour notes without notice to\nthe holders of existing\nnotes by selling additional\nnotes having the same terms\nprovided that such\nadditional notes shall be\nfungible for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes.\nHowever, any new notes of\nthis kind may have a\ndifferent offering price\nand may begin to bear\ninterest on a different\ndate. Notices We will\nprovide to noteholders any\nrequired notices by first-\nclass mail to the addresses\nof the holders as they\nappear in the note\nregister. Concerning the\nTrustees We and our\nsubsidiaries have from time\nto time maintained deposit\naccounts and conducted\nother banking transactions\nwith The Bank of New York\nMellon Trust Company, N.A.\nand its affiliated entities\nin the ordinary course of\nbusiness. The Bank of New\nYork Mellon Trust Company,\nN.A. is initially serving\nas the trustee for the\nnotes issued under the\nSenior Indenture and the\nSubordinated Indenture. The\nBank of New York Mellon\nTrust Company, N.A. and its\naffiliates also serve as\ntrustee for a number of\nseries of our outstanding\nindebtedness under other\nindentures. Consequently,\nif an actual or potential\nevent of default occurs\nwith respect to any of\nthese securities, the\ntrustee may be considered\nto have a conflicting\ninterest for purposes of\nthe Trust Indenture Act of\n1939, as amended. In that\ncase, the trustee may be\nrequired to resign under\none or more of the\nindentures, and we would be\nrequired to appoint a\nsuccessor trustee. For this\npurpose, a \u0093potential\u0094\nevent of default means an\nevent that would be an\nevent of default if the\nrequirements for giving us\ndefault notice or for the\ndefault having to exist for\na specific period of time\nwere disregarded. In\naddition, the trustee can\nresign for any reason by\ngiving at least 30 calendar\ndays\u0092 written notice of\nresignation, and we would\nbe required to appoint a\nsuccessor trustee. The\ntrustee will remain the\ntrustee under the indenture\nuntil a successor is\nappointed. REGISTRATION AND\nSETTLEMENT Book-Entry\nSystem All of the notes we\noffer will be issued in\nbook-entry only form. This\nmeans that we will not\nissue certificated notes in\ndefinitive form, which we\nrefer to as \u0093definitive\nnotes,\u0094 except in the\nlimited case described\nbelow. Instead, we will\nissue global notes in\nregistered form (each, a\n\u0093Global Note\u0094). Each Global\nNote is held through DTC,\nas depository, and is\nregistered in the name of\nCede & Co., as nominee of\nDTC. Accordingly, Cede &\nCo. will be the holder of\nrecord of all of the notes.\nEach note represents a\nbeneficial interest in that\nGlobal Note. Unless we\nspecify otherwise in the\napplicable supplement, your\nnotes will be represented\nby a kind of Global Note\nthat we refer to as a\nmaster global note. This\nkind of Global Note\nrepresents multiple notes\nthat have different terms\nand are issued at different\ntimes. Each note evidenced\nby a master global note\nwill be identified by the\ntrustee on a schedule to\nthe master global note. If\nwe specify in the\napplicable supplement that\nyour notes will be\nrepresented by a Global\nNote that is not a master\nglobal note, then the notes\nrepresented by the same\nGlobal Note will have the\nsame terms. Beneficial\ninterests in a Global Note\nare shown on, and transfers\nare effected through,\nrecords maintained by DTC\nor its participants. In\norder to own a beneficial\ninterest in a note, you\nmust be an institution that\nhas an account with DTC,\nwhich we refer to as a\n\u0093participant\u0092 in DTC, or\nhave a direct or indirect\naccount with such an\ninstitution. Transfers of\nownership interests in the\nnotes will be accomplished\nby making entries in DTC\nparticipants\u0092 books acting\non behalf of beneficial\nowners. Beneficial owners\nof these notes will not\nreceive definitive notes\nrepresenting their\nownership interest, except\nin the limited\ncircumstances described\nbelow. So long as DTC or\nits nominee is the\nregistered holder of a\nGlobal Note, DTC or its\nnominee, as the case may\nbe, will be the sole holder\nof the notes represented\n\n30\n\nthereby for all purposes,\nincluding payment of\nprincipal and interest,\nunder the applicable\nIndenture. Except as\notherwise provided below,\nthe beneficial owners of\nthe notes are not entitled\nto receive physical\ndelivery of definitive\nnotes and will not be\nconsidered the holders of\nthe notes for any purpose\nunder the applicable\nIndenture. Accordingly,\neach beneficial owner must\nrely on the procedures of\nDTC and, if such beneficial\nowner is not a DTC\nparticipant, on the\nprocedures of the DTC\nparticipant through which\nsuch beneficial owner owns\nits interest in order to\nexercise any rights of a\nholder of a note under the\napplicable Indenture. The\nlaws of some jurisdictions\nrequire that certain\npurchasers of notes take\nphysical delivery of such\nnotes in certificated or\ndefinitive form. Those\nlimits and laws may impair\nthe ability to transfer\nbeneficial interests in the\nnotes. Unless otherwise\nspecified in the relevant\nGlobal Note or the\napplicable Indenture, each\nGlobal Note representing\nnotes will be exchangeable\nfor certificated notes of\nlike tenor and terms and of\ndiffering authorized\ndenominations in a like\naggregate principal amount,\nonly if (1) DTC notifies us\nthat it is unwilling or\nunable to continue as\ndepository for the Global\nNotes or we become aware\nthat DTC has ceased to be a\nclearing agency registered\nunder the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934 and,\nin any such case we fail to\nappoint a successor to DTC\nwithin 90 calendar days or\n(2) we, in our sole\ndiscretion, determine that\nthe Global Notes shall be\nexchangeable for definitive\nnotes. DTC\u0092s current rules\nprovide that it would\nnotify its participants of\na request by us to\nterminate a Global Note,\nbut will only withdraw\nbeneficial interests from\nthe Global Note at the\nrequest of each DTC\nparticipant. Upon any such\nexchange, the definitive\nnotes will be registered in\nthe names of the beneficial\nowners of the Global Note\nrepresenting the notes. The\nDepository Trust Company\nThe following is based on\ninformation furnished by\nDTC: DTC will act as\nsecurities depository for\nthe notes. The notes will\nbe issued as fully-\nregistered securities\nregistered in the name of\nCede & Co. (DTC\u0092s\npartnership nominee) or\nsuch other name as may be\nrequested by an authorized\nrepresentative of DTC. One\nfully-registered Global\nNote will be issued for\neach issue of notes, each\nin the aggregate principal\namount of the issue, and\nwill be deposited with DTC.\nIf, however, the aggregate\nprincipal amount of any\nissue exceeds $500 million,\none certificate will be\nissued with respect to each\n$500 million of principal\namount and an additional\ncertificate will be issued\nwith respect to any\nremaining principal amount\nof such issue. We also may\nissue one or more Global\nNotes that represent\nmultiple issues of the\nnotes. DTC, the world\u0092s\nlargest securities\ndepository, is a limited-\npurpose trust company\norganized under the New\nYork Banking Law, a\n\u0093banking organization\u0094\nwithin the meaning of the\nNew York Banking Law, a\nmember of the Federal\nReserve System, a \u0093clearing\ncorporation\u0094 within the\nmeaning of the New York\nUniform Commercial Code,\nand a \u0093clearing agency\u0094\nregistered pursuant to the\nprovisions of Section 17A\nof the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934. DTC holds and\nprovides asset servicing\nfor over 3.5 million issues\nof U.S. and non-U.S.equity\nissues, corporate and\nmunicipal debt issues, and\nmoney market instruments\n(from over 100 countries)\nthat DTC\u0092s participants\n(\u0093direct participants\u0094)\ndeposit with DTC. DTC also\nfacilitates the post-trade\nsettlement among direct\nparticipants of sales and\nother securities\ntransactions in deposited\nsecurities, through\nelectronic computerized\nbook-entry transfers and\npledges between direct\nparticipants\u0092 accounts.\nThis eliminates the need\nfor physical movement of\nsecurities certificates.\nDirect participants include\nboth U.S. and\nnon-U.S.securities brokers\nand dealers, banks, trust\ncompanies, clearing\ncorporations, and certain\nother organizations. DTC is\na wholly-owned subsidiary\nof The Depository Trust &\nClearing Corporation\n(\u0093DTCC\u0094). DTCC is the\nholding company for DTC,\nNational Securities\nClearing Corporation and\nFixed Income Clearing\nCorporation, all of which\nare registered clearing\nagencies. DTCC is\n\n31\n\nowned by the users of its\nregulated subsidiaries.\nAccess to the DTC system is\nalso available to others\nsuch as both U.S. and\nnon-U.S.securities brokers\nand dealers, banks, trust\ncompanies, and clearing\ncorporations that clear\nthrough or maintain a\ncustodial relationship with\na direct participant,\neither directly or\nindirectly (\u0093indirect\nparticipants\u0094). The DTC\nRules applicable to its\nparticipants are on file\nwith the SEC. More\ninformation about DTC can\nbe found at www.dtcc.com.\nInformation on that website\nis not included or\nincorporated by reference\nherein. Purchases of the\nnotes under the DTC system\nmust be made by or through\ndirect participants, which\nwill receive a credit for\nthe notes on DTC\u0092s records.\nThe ownership interest of\neach actual purchaser of\neach note, or beneficial\nowner, is in turn to be\nrecorded on the direct and\nindirect participants\u0092\nrecords. Beneficial owners\nwill not receive written\nconfirmation from DTC of\ntheir purchase. Beneficial\nowners are, however,\nexpected to receive written\nconfirmations providing\ndetails of the transaction,\nas well as periodic\nstatements of their\nholdings, from the direct\nor indirect participant\nthrough which the\nbeneficial owner entered\ninto the transaction.\nTransfers of ownership\ninterests in the notes are\nto be accomplished by\nentries made on the books\nof direct and indirect\nparticipants acting on\nbehalf of beneficial\nowners. Beneficial owners\nwill not receive\ncertificates representing\ntheir ownership interests\nin the notes, except in the\nevent that use of the book-\nentry system for the notes\nis discontinued. To\nfacilitate subsequent\ntransfers, all notes\ndeposited by direct\nparticipants with DTC are\nregistered in the name of\nDTC\u0092s partnership nominee,\nCede & Co., or such other\nname as may be requested by\nan authorized\nrepresentative of DTC. The\ndeposit of the notes with\nDTC and their registration\nin the name of Cede & Co.\nor such other DTC nominee\ndo not effect any change in\nbeneficial ownership. DTC\nhas no knowledge of the\nactual beneficial owners of\nthe notes; DTC\u0092s records\nreflect only the identity\nof the direct participants\nto whose accounts such\nnotes are credited, which\nmay or may not be the\nbeneficial owners. The\ndirect and indirect\nparticipants will remain\nresponsible for keeping\naccount of their holdings\non behalf of their\ncustomers. Conveyance of\nnotices and other\ncommunications by DTC to\ndirect participants, by\ndirect participants to\nindirect participants, and\nby direct participants and\nindirect participants to\nbeneficial owners will be\ngoverned by arrangements\namong them, subject to any\nstatutory or regulatory\nrequirements as may be in\neffect from time to time.\nBeneficial owners of the\nnotes may wish to take\ncertain steps to augment\nthe transmission to them of\nnotices of significant\nevents with respect to the\nnotes, such as redemptions,\ntenders, defaults and\nproposed amendments to the\nnote documents. For\nexample, beneficial owners\nof the notes may wish to\nascertain that the nominee\nholding the notes for their\nbenefit has agreed to\nobtain and transmit notices\nto beneficial owners. In\nthe alternative, beneficial\nowners may wish to provide\ntheir names and addresses\nto the registrar and\nrequest that copies of\nnotices be provided\ndirectly to them. None of\nDTC, Cede & Co. or any\nother DTC nominee will\nconsent or vote with\nrespect to the notes unless\nauthorized by a direct\nparticipant in accordance\nwith DTC\u0092s Money Market\nInstrument, or MMI,\nprocedures. Under its usual\nprocedures, DTC mails an\nomnibus proxy to us as soon\nas possible after the\nrecord date. The omnibus\nproxy assigns Cede & Co.\u0092s\nconsenting or voting rights\nto those direct\nparticipants to whose\naccounts the notes are\ncredited on the regular\nrecord date (identified in\na listing attached to the\nomnibus proxy). Payments of\nprincipal and any premium,\ninterest payments or other\namounts payable on the\nnotes will be made to Cede\n& Co., or such other\nnominee as may be requested\nby an authorized\nrepresentative of DTC.\nDTC\u0092s practice is to credit\ndirect participants\u0092\naccounts, upon DTC\u0092s\nreceipt of funds and\ncorresponding detail\ninformation from us or the\ntrustee, on the applicable\npayment date in accordance\nwith their respective\nholdings shown on DTC\u0092s\nrecords. Payments by\n\n32\n\nparticipants to beneficial\nowners will be governed by\nstanding instructions and\ncustomary practices, as is\nthe case with securities\nheld for the accounts of\ncustomers in bearer form or\nregistered in \u0093street\nname,\u0094 and will be the\nresponsibility of such\nparticipant and not our\nresponsibility or the\nresponsibility of DTC or\nthe trustee, subject to any\nstatutory or regulatory\nrequirements that may be in\neffect from time to time.\nPayment of principal, any\npremium, interest or other\namounts payable to Cede &\nCo. or any other nominee as\nmay be requested by an\nauthorized representative\nof DTC, is our\nresponsibility or the\nresponsibility of the\ntrustee, disbursement of\nsuch payments to direct\nparticipants will be the\nresponsibility of DTC, and\ndisbursement of such\npayments to the beneficial\nowners will be the\nresponsibility of the\ndirect or indirect\nparticipants. We will send\nany redemption notices to\nDTC. If less than all of\nthe notes of an issue are\nbeing redeemed, DTC\u0092s\npractice is to determine by\nlot the amount of the\ninterest of each direct\nparticipant in such issue\nto be redeemed. DTC may\ndiscontinue providing its\nservices as depository for\nthe notes at any time by\ngiving us reasonable\nnotice. Under such\ncircumstances, if a\nsuccessor securities\ndepository is not obtained,\nwe will print and deliver\ncertificated notes in\ndefinitive registered form.\nWe may decide to\ndiscontinue use of the\nsystem of book-entry only\ntransfers through DTC (or a\nsuccessor securities\ndepository). In that event,\nwe will print and deliver\ncertificated notes to DTC.\nThe information in this\nsection concerning DTC and\nDTC\u0092s book-entry system has\nbeen obtained from sources\nthat we believe to be\nreliable, but neither we\nnor any agent takes\nresponsibility for its\naccuracy. TAX CONSEQUENCES\nTO U.S. HOLDERS The\nfollowing is a general\ndiscussion of the material\nU.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations of the\nownership and disposition\nof the notes. The following\ndiscussion is not\nexhaustive of all possible\ntax considerations. This\nsummary is based upon the\nInternal Revenue Code of\n1986, as amended (the\n\u0093Code\u0094), regulations\npromulgated under the Code\nby the U.S. Treasury\nDepartment (including\nproposed and temporary\nregulations), rulings,\ncurrent administrative\ninterpretations and\nofficial pronouncements of\nthe IRS and judicial\ndecisions, all as currently\nin effect and all of which\nare subject to differing\ninterpretations or to\nchange, possibly with\nretroactive effect. No\nassurance can be given that\nthe IRS would not assert,\nor that a court would not\nsustain, a position\ncontrary to any of the tax\nconsequences described\nbelow. In the opinion of\nDavis Polk & Wardwell LLP,\nUnited States tax counsel\nto Bank of America\nCorporation, the statements\nin this discussion, in so\nfar as they describe\nprovisions of current U.S.\nfederal income tax law, are\naccurate in all material\nrespects. This summary is\nfor general information\nonly, and does not purport\nto discuss all aspects of\nU.S. federal income\ntaxation that may be\nimportant to a particular\ninvestor in light of its\ninvestment or tax\ncircumstances or to\ninvestors subject to\nspecial tax rules, such as:\npartnerships, or other\nentities classified as\npartnerships for U.S.\nfederal income tax\npurposes, subchapter S\ncorporations, any\ngovernment (or\ninstrumentality or agency\nthereof), banks, financial\ninstitutions, tax-\nexemptentities, insurance\ncompanies, regulated\ninvestment companies, real\nestate investment trusts,\ntrusts and estates, dealers\nin securities or\ncurrencies, traders in\nsecurities that have\nelected to use the mark-to-\nmarketmethod of tax\naccounting for their\nsecurities, persons holding\nthe notes as part of an\nintegrated investment,\nincluding a \u0093straddle,\u0094\n\u0093hedge,\u0094 \u0093constructive\nsale\u0094 or \u0093conversion\ntransaction,\u0094 persons whose\nfunctional currency for tax\npurposes is not the U.S.\ndollar and persons subject\nto the alternative minimum\ntax provisions of the Code.\nThis summary does not\naddress special rules\napplicable to a person\nrequired for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes to\nconform the timing of\nincome accruals with\nrespect to the notes to its\nfinancial statements under\n\n33\n\nSection 451(b) of the Code.\nThis summary also does not\ninclude any description of\nthe tax laws of any state\nor local governments, or of\nany foreign government,\nthat may be applicable to a\nparticular holder. This\nsummary also may not apply\nto all forms of notes. This\ndiscussion applies only to\ninvestors who, except as\notherwise specifically\nnoted, will purchase the\nnotes offered in this\nprospectus upon original\nissuance at the issue price\n(as defined below) and will\nhold such notes as capital\nassets within the meaning\nof Section 1221 of the\nCode, which generally means\nas property held for\ninvestment. You should\nconsult your own tax\nadvisor concerning the U.S.\nfederal income tax\nconsequences to you of\nacquiring, owning and\ndisposing of the notes, as\nwell as any tax\nconsequences arising under\nthe laws of any state,\nlocal, foreign, or other\ntax jurisdiction and the\npossible effects of changes\nin U.S. federal or other\ntax laws. As used in this\nprospectus, the term \u0093U.S.\nHolder\u0094 means a beneficial\nowner of a note that is for\nU.S. federal income tax\npurposes:\n                                                         \n      a citizen or individual resident of the United     \n      States;                                            \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      a corporation (including an entity treated as a    \n      corporation for U.S.\u00a0federal income tax purposes)  \n      created or organized in or under the laws of the   \n      United States or of any state of the United        \n      States or the District of Columbia; or             \n                                                         \n                                                         \n      an estate or trust the income of which is subject  \n      to U.S.\u00a0federal income taxation regardless of its  \n      source;                                            \n                                                         \nIf an entity or arrangement\ntreated as a partnership\nfor U.S. federal income tax\npurposes holds the notes,\nthe U.S. federal income tax\ntreatment of a partner\ngenerally will depend upon\nthe status of the partner\nand the activities of the\npartnership and\naccordingly, this summary\ndoes not apply to\npartnerships. A partner of\na partnership holding the\nnotes should consult its\nown tax advisor regarding\nthe U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences to the partner\nof the acquisition,\n\nownership and disposition\nby the partnership of the\nnotes. This discussion is\nsubject to any additional\ndiscussion regarding U.S.\nfederal taxation contained\nin the applicable\nsupplement. Accordingly,\nyou should also consult the\napplicable supplement for\nany additional discussion\nof U.S. federal taxation\nwith respect to the notes\noffered thereunder. Payment\nof Stated Interest.Except\nas described below in the\ncase of interest on a note\nissued with original issue\ndiscount, as defined below\nunder \u0093\u0097Original Issue\nDiscount,\u0094 stated interest\non a note generally will be\nincluded in the income of a\nU.S. Holder as interest\nincome at the time it is\naccrued or is received in\naccordance with the U.S.\nHolder\u0092s regular method of\naccounting for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes and\nwill be ordinary income.\nOriginal Issue\nDiscount.Some of our notes\nmay be issued with original\nissue discount (\u0093OID\u0094).\nU.S. Holders of notes\nissued with OID, other than\nshort-term notes with a\nmaturity of one year or\nless from the date of issue\n(after taking into account\nthe last possible date that\nthe note could be\noutstanding under its\nterms), will be subject to\nspecial tax accounting\nrules, as described in\ngreater detail below. For\ntax purposes, OID is the\nexcess of the \u0093stated\nredemption price at\nmaturity\u0094 of a note over\nits \u0093issue price.\u0094 The\n\u0093stated redemption price at\nmaturity\u0094 of a note is the\nsum of all payments\nrequired to be made on the\nnote other than \u0093qualified\nstated interest\u0094 payments,\nas defined below. The\n\u0093issue price\u0094 of a note is\ngenerally the first\noffering price to the\npublic at which a\nsubstantial amount of the\nissue was sold (ignoring\nsales to bond houses,\nbrokers or similar persons\nor organizations acting in\nthe capacity of\nunderwriters, placement\nagents or wholesalers). The\nterm \u0093qualified stated\ninterest\u0094 generally means\nstated interest that is\nunconditionally payable in\ncash or property (other\nthan debt instruments of\nthe issuer), or that is\ntreated as constructively\nreceived, at least annually\nat a single fixed rate or,\nunder certain\ncircumstances, at a\nvariable rate. If, after\napplying a 34\n\nspecial rule for certain\nteaser rates or interest\nholidays, a note has OID\nand bears interest during\nany accrual period at a\nrate below the rate\napplicable for the\nremaining term of the note,\ninterest payable at the\nlowest stated fixed rate\ngenerally is qualified\nstated interest and the\nexcess is included in the\nstated redemption price at\nmaturity. A U.S. Holder of\na note with a maturity of\nmore than one year from its\ndate of issue that has been\nissued with OID (an \u0093OID\nnote\u0094) is generally\nrequired to include any\nqualified stated interest\npayments in income as\ninterest at the time it is\naccrued or is received in\naccordance with the U.S.\nHolder\u0092s regular accounting\nmethod for tax purposes, as\ndescribed above under\n\u0093\u0097Payment of Stated\nInterest.\u0094 A U.S. Holder of\nan OID note is generally\nrequired to include in\nincome the sum of the daily\naccruals of the OID for the\nnote for each day during\nthe taxable year (or\nportion of the taxable\nyear) in which the U.S.\nHolder held the OID note,\nregardless of such holder\u0092s\nregular method of\naccounting. Accordingly, a\nU.S. Holder may be required\nto include OID in income in\nadvance of the receipt of\nsome or all of the related\ncash payments. The daily\nportion is determined by\nallocating the OID for each\nday of the accrual period.\nAn accrual period may be of\nany length and the accrual\nperiods may even vary in\nlength over the term of the\nOID note, provided that\neach accrual period is no\nlonger than one year and\neach scheduled payment of\nprincipal or interest\noccurs either on the first\nday of an accrual period or\non the final day of an\naccrual period. The amount\nof OID allocable to an\naccrual period is equal to\nthe excess of: (1) the\nproduct of the \u0093adjusted\nissue price\u0094 of the OID\nnote at the beginning of\nthe accrual period and its\nyield to maturity (computed\ngenerally on a constant\nyield method and compounded\nat the end of each accrual\nperiod, taking into account\nthe length of the\nparticular accrual period)\nover (2) the amount of any\nqualified stated interest\nallocable to the accrual\nperiod. OID allocable to a\nfinal accrual period is the\ndifference between the\namount payable at maturity,\nother than a payment of\nqualified stated interest,\nand the adjusted issue\nprice at the beginning of\nthe final accrual period.\nSpecial rules will apply\nfor calculating OID for an\ninitial short accrual\nperiod. The \u0093adjusted issue\nprice\u0094 of an OID note at\nthe beginning of any\naccrual period is the sum\nof the issue price of the\nOID note plus the amount of\nOID allocable to all prior\naccrual periods reduced by\nany payments received on\nthe OID note that were not\nqualified stated interest.\nUnder these rules, a U.S.\nHolder generally will have\nto include in income\nincreasingly greater\namounts of OID in\nsuccessive accrual periods.\nIf the excess of the\n\u0093stated redemption price at\nmaturity\u0094 of a note over\nits \u0093issue price\u0094 is less\nthan 1/4 of 1% of the\nnote\u0092s stated redemption\nprice at maturity\nmultiplied by the number of\ncomplete years from its\nissue date to its maturity,\nor weighted average\nmaturity in the case of\nnotes with more than one\nprincipal payment (\u0093 de\nminimis OID\u0094), the note is\nnot treated as issued with\nOID. The weighted average\nmaturity is the sum of the\nfollowing amounts\ndetermined for each payment\nunder the note other than a\npayment of qualified stated\ninterest: (i) the number of\ncomplete years from the\nissue date of the note\nuntil the payment is made,\nmultiplied by (ii) a\nfraction, the numerator of\nwhich is the amount of the\npayment and the denominator\nof which is the note\u0092s\nstated redemption price at\nmaturity. A U.S. Holder\ngenerally must include the\nde minimisOID in income at\nthe time payments, other\nthan qualified stated\ninterest, on the notes are\nmade in proportion to the\namount paid (unless the\nU.S. Holder makes the\nelection described below\nunder \u0093\u0097Election to Treat\nAll Interest as Original\nIssue Discount\u0094). Any\namount of de minimisOID\nthat is included in income\nin this manner will be\ntreated as capital gain.\nVariable Rate Notes. In the\ncase of a note that is a\nvariable rate note, special\nrules apply. A note will\nqualify as a \u0093variable rate\ndebt instrument\u0094 under U.S.\nTreasury regulations if (i)\nthe note\u0092s issue price does\nnot exceed the total\nnoncontingent principal\npayments by more than the\nlesser of: (a) 0.015\nmultiplied by the\n\n35\n\nproduct of the total\nnoncontingent principal\npayments and the number of\ncomplete years to maturity\nfrom the issue date, or (b)\n15% of the total\nnoncontingent principal\npayments; and (ii) the note\nprovides for stated\ninterest, compounded or\npaid at least annually,\nonly at one or more\nqualified floating rates, a\nsingle fixed rate and one\nor more qualified floating\nrates, a single objective\nrate, or a single fixed\nrate and a single objective\nrate that is a qualified\ninverse floating rate.\nGenerally, a rate is a\nqualified floating rate if:\n(i) (a) variations in the\nvalue of the rate can\nreasonably be expected to\nmeasure contemporaneous\nvariations in the cost of\nnewly borrowed funds in the\ncurrency in which the note\nis denominated; or (b) the\nrate is equal to such a\nrate multiplied by either a\nfixed multiple that is\ngreater than 0.65 but not\nmore than 1.35 or a fixed\nmultiple greater than 0.65\nbut not more than 1.35,\nincreased or decreased by a\nfixed rate, and (ii) the\nvalue of the rate on any\ndate during the term of the\nnote is set no earlier than\nthree months prior to the\nfirst day on which that\nvalue is in effect and no\nlater than one year\nfollowing that first day.\nIf a note provides for two\nor more qualified floating\nrates that are within 0.25\npercentage points of each\nother on the issue date or\ncan reasonably be expected\nto have approximately the\nsame values throughout the\nterm of the note, the\nqualified floating rates\ntogether constitute a\nsingle qualified floating\nrate. A note will not have\na variable rate that is a\nqualified floating rate,\nhowever, if the variable\nrate of interest is subject\nto one or more minimum or\nmaximum rate floors or\nceilings or one or more\ngovernors limiting the\namount of increase or\ndecrease unless such floor,\nceiling, or governor is\nfixed throughout the term\nof the note or is not\nreasonably expected as of\nthe issue date to\nsignificantly affect the\nyield on the note.\nGenerally, an objective\nrate is a rate that is (i)\nnot a qualified floating\nrate, (ii) is determined\nusing a single fixed\nformula that is based on\nobjective financial or\neconomic information that\nis not within the control\nof the issuer or a related\nparty, and (iii) the value\nof the rate on any date\nduring the term of the note\nis set no earlier than\nthree months prior to the\nfirst day on which that\nvalue is in effect and no\nlater than one year\nfollowing that first day.\nIf it is reasonably\nexpected that the average\nvalue of the variable rate\nduring the first half of\nthe term of a note will be\neither significantly less\nthan or significantly\ngreater than the average\nvalue of the rate during\nthe final half of the term\nof the note, then the note\nwill not have a variable\nrate that is an objective\nrate. An objective rate is\na qualified inverse\nfloating rate if that rate\nis equal to a fixed rate\nminus a qualified floating\nrate and variations in the\nrate can reasonably be\nexpected to inversely\nreflect contemporaneous\nvariations in the qualified\nfloating rate. A note will\nalso have a variable rate\nthat is a single qualified\nfloating rate or an\nobjective rate if interest\non the note is stated at a\nfixed rate for an initial\nperiod of one year or less\nfollowed by either a\nqualified floating rate or\nan objective rate for a\nsubsequent period, and the\nvalue of the qualified\nfloating rate or objective\nrate is intended to\napproximate the fixed rate\n(which is presumed if (a)\nthe fixed rate and (b) the\nqualified floating rate or\nobjective rate have values\non the issue date of the\nnote that do not differ by\nmore than 0.25 percentage\npoints.) In the case of a\nnote that provides for\nstated interest that is\nunconditionally payable at\nleast annually at a\nvariable rate that is a\nsingle qualified floating\nrate or objective rate, or\none of those rates after a\nsingle fixed rate for an\ninitial period of one year\nor less (as described\nabove), all stated interest\non the note is treated as\nqualified stated interest.\nIn that case, both the\nnote\u0092s yield to maturity\nand qualified stated\ninterest will be\ndetermined, solely for\npurposes of calculating the\naccrual of OID, if any, as\nthough the note will bear\ninterest in all periods\nthroughout its term (in the\ncase of a single qualified\nfloating rate or qualified\ninverse floating rate) at a\nfixed rate generally equal\nto the value of the rate on\nthe issue date or, in the\ncase of an objective rate\n(other than a qualified\ninverse floating rate), the\nrate that reflects the\nyield to maturity that is\nreasonably expected for the\nnote (the \u0093fixed rate\n\n36\n\nsubstitute\u0094). A U.S. Holder\nshould then recognize OID,\nif any, that is calculated\nbased on the note\u0092s assumed\nyield to maturity. If the\ninterest actually accrued\nor paid during an accrual\nperiod exceeds or is less\nthan the assumed fixed\ninterest, the qualified\nstated interest allocable\nto that period is increased\nor decreased, as\napplicable. If a note\nprovides for stated\ninterest at (x) multiple\nfloating rates or (y) one\nor more floating rates in\naddition to a single fixed\nrate (other than a single\nfixed rate for an initial\nperiod of one year or less\n(as described above)), the\ninterest and OID accruals\non the note must be\ndetermined by (i)\ndetermining a fixed rate\nsubstitute for each\nqualified floating rate or\nqualified inverse floating\nrate provided under the\nnote (as described above),\n(ii) constructing the\nequivalent fixed rate debt\ninstrument, using the fixed\nrate substitutes, (iii)\ndetermining the amount of\nqualified stated interest\nand OID with respect to the\nequivalent fixed rate debt\ninstrument, and (iv) making\nappropriate adjustments to\nqualified stated interest\nor OID for actual variable\nrates during the applicable\naccrual period. In the case\nof a note that provides for\nstated interest either at\none or more qualified\nfloating rates or at a\nqualified inverse floating\nrate and also provides for\nstated interest at a single\nfixed rate other than at a\nsingle fixed rate for an\ninitial period (as\ndescribed above), the\ninterest and OID accruals\non the note must be\ndetermined by using the\nmethod described above.\nHowever, the note will be\ntreated, for purposes of\nthe first three steps of\nthe determination, as if\nthe note had provided for a\nqualified floating rate, or\na qualified inverse\nfloating rate, rather than\nthe fixed rate. The\nqualified floating rate, or\nqualified inverse floating\nrate, that replaces the\nfixed rate must be such\nthat the fair market value\nof the note as of the issue\ndate approximates the fair\nmarket value of an\notherwise identical debt\ninstrument that provides\nfor the qualified floating\nrate, or qualified inverse\nfloating rate, rather than\nthe fixed rate. Acquisition\nPremium. If a U.S. Holder\npurchases an OID note for\nan amount greater than its\nadjusted issue price (as\ndetermined above) at the\npurchase date and less than\nor equal to the sum of all\namounts, other than\nqualified stated interest,\npayable on the OID note\nafter the purchase date,\nthe excess is \u0093acquisition\npremium.\u0094 Under these\nrules, in general, the\namount of OID which must be\nincluded in income for the\nnote for any taxable year\n(or any portion of a\ntaxable year in which the\nnote is held) will be\nreduced (but not below\nzero) by the portion of the\nacquisition premium\nallocated to the period.\nThe amount of acquisition\npremium allocated to each\nperiod is determined by\nmultiplying the OID that\notherwise would have been\nincluded in income by a\nfraction, the numerator of\nwhich is the excess of the\ncost over the adjusted\nissue price of the OID note\nand the denominator of\nwhich is the excess of the\nOID note\u0092s stated\nredemption price at\nmaturity over its adjusted\nissue price. Amortizable\nBond Premium.If a U.S.\nHolder purchases a note\n(including an OID note) for\nan amount in excess of the\nsum of all amounts payable\non the note after the\npurchase date, other than\nqualified stated interest,\nsuch holder will be\nconsidered to have\npurchased such note with\n\u0093amortizable bond premium\u0094\nequal in amount to such\nexcess. A U.S. Holder may\nelect to amortize such\npremium as an offset to\ninterest income using a\nconstant yield method over\nthe remaining term of the\nnote based on the U.S.\nHolder\u0092s yield to maturity\nwith respect to the note. A\nU.S. Holder generally may\nuse the amortizable bond\npremium allocable to an\naccrual period to offset\ninterest required to be\nincluded in the U.S.\nHolder\u0092s income under its\nregular method of\naccounting with respect to\nthe note in that accrual\nperiod. If the amortizable\nbond premium allocable to\nan accrual period exceeds\nthe amount of interest\nallocable to such accrual\nperiod, such excess would\nbe allowed as a deduction\nfor such accrual period,\nbut only to the extent of\nthe U.S. Holder\u0092s prior\ninterest inclusions on the\nnote that have not been\noffset previously by bond\npremium.\n\n37\n\nAny excess is generally\ncarried forward and\nallocable to the next\naccrual period. If a note\nmay be redeemed by us prior\nto its maturity date, the\namount of amortizable bond\npremium will be based on\nthe amount payable at the\napplicable redemption date,\nbut only if use of the\nredemption date (in lieu of\nthe stated maturity date)\nresults in a smaller\namortizable bond premium\nfor the period ending on\nthe redemption date. An\nelection to amortize bond\npremium applies to all\ntaxable debt obligations\nheld by the U.S. Holder at\nthe beginning of the first\ntaxable year to which the\nelection applies and\nthereafter acquired by the\nU.S. Holder and may be\nrevoked only with the\nconsent of the IRS.\nGenerally, a U.S. Holder\nmay make an election to\ninclude in income its\nentire return on a note (\ni.e., the excess of all\nremaining payments to be\nreceived on the note over\nthe amount paid for the\nnote by such U.S. Holder)\nin accordance with a\nconstant yield method based\non the compounding of\ninterest, as discussed\nbelow under \u0093\u0097Election to\nTreat All Interest as\nOriginal Issue Discount.\u0094\nIf a U.S. Holder makes such\nan election for a note with\namortizable bond premium,\nsuch election will result\nin a deemed election to\namortize bond premium for\nall of the U.S. Holder\u0092s\ndebt instruments with\namortizable bond premium\nand may be revoked only\nwith the permission of the\nIRS. A U.S. Holder that\nelects to amortize bond\npremium will be required to\nreduce its tax basis in the\nnote by the amount of the\npremium amortized during\nits holding period. OID\nnotes purchased at a\npremium will not be subject\nto the OID rules described\nabove. If a U.S. Holder\ndoes not elect to amortize\nbond premium, the amount of\nbond premium will be\nincluded in its tax basis\nin the note. Therefore, if\na U.S. Holder does not\nelect to amortize bond\npremium and it holds the\nnote to maturity, the\npremium generally will be\ntreated as capital loss\nwhen the note matures.\nMarket Discount.If a U.S.\nHolder purchases a note for\nan amount that is less than\nits stated redemption price\nat maturity, or, in the\ncase of an OID note, its\nadjusted issue price, that\nholder will be considered\nto have purchased the note\nwith \u0093market discount.\u0094 Any\npayment, other than\nqualified stated interest,\nor any gain on the sale,\nexchange, retirement or\nother disposition of a note\nwith market discount\ngenerally will be treated\nas ordinary interest income\nto the extent of the market\ndiscount not previously\nincluded in income that\naccrued on the note during\nsuch holder\u0092s holding\nperiod. In general, market\ndiscount is treated as\naccruing on a straight-line\nbasis over the term of the\nnote unless an election is\nmade to accrue the market\ndiscount under a constant\nyield method. In addition,\na U.S. Holder may be\nrequired to defer, until\nthe maturity of the note or\nits earlier disposition in\na taxable transaction, the\ndeduction of a portion of\nthe interest paid on any\nindebtedness incurred or\nmaintained to purchase or\ncarry the note in an amount\nnot exceeding the accrued\nmarket discount on the\nnote. A U.S. Holder may\nelect to include market\ndiscount in income\ncurrently as it accrues (on\neither a straight-line or\nconstant yield basis), in\nlieu of treating a portion\nof any gain realized on a\nsale, exchange, retirement\nor other disposition of the\nnote as ordinary income. If\nan election is made to\ninclude market discount on\na current basis, the\ninterest deduction deferral\nrule described above will\nnot apply. If a U.S. Holder\nmakes such an election, it\nwill apply to all market\ndiscount debt instruments\nacquired by such holder on\nor after the first day of\nthe first taxable year to\nwhich the election applies.\nThe election may not be\nrevoked without the consent\nof the IRS. U.S. Holders\nshould consult with their\nown tax advisors before\nmaking this election. If\nthe difference between the\nstated redemption price at\nmaturity of a note or, in\nthe case of an OID note,\nits adjusted issue price,\nand the amount paid for the\nnote is less than 1/4 of 1%\nof the note\u0092s stated\nredemption price at\nmaturity or, in the case of\nan OID note, its adjusted\nissue price, multiplied by\nthe number of remaining\ncomplete years to the\nnote\u0092s maturity (\u0093 de\nminimis market discount\u0094),\nthe note is not treated as\nissued with market\ndiscount.\n\n38\n\nGenerally, a U.S. Holder\nmay make an election to\ninclude in income its\nentire return on a note\n(i.e., the excess of all\nremaining payments to be\nreceived on the note over\nthe amount paid for the\nnote by that U.S. Holder)\nin accordance with a\nconstant yield method based\non the compounding of\ninterest, as discussed\nbelow under \u0093\u0097Election to\nTreat All Interest as\nOriginal Issue Discount.\u0094\nIf a U.S. Holder makes such\nan election for a note with\nmarket discount, the U.S.\nHolder will be required to\ninclude market discount in\nincome currently as it\naccrues on a constant yield\nbasis for all market\ndiscount debt instruments\nacquired by such U.S.\nHolder on or after the\nfirst day of the first\ntaxable year to which the\nelection applies, and such\nelection may be revoked\nonly with the permission of\nthe IRS. Election to Treat\nAll Interest as Original\nIssue Discount.A U.S.\nHolder may elect to include\nin income all interest that\naccrues on a note using the\nconstant-yield method\napplicable to OID described\nabove, subject to certain\nlimitations and exceptions.\nFor purposes of this\nelection, interest includes\nstated interest,\nacquisition discount, OID,\nde minimisOID, market\ndiscount, de minimismarket\ndiscount and unstated\ninterest, as adjusted by\nany amortizable bond\npremium or acquisition\npremium, each as described\nherein. If this election is\nmade for a note, then, to\napply the constant-yield\nmethod: (i) the issue price\nof the note will equal its\ncost, (ii) the issue date\nof the note will be the\ndate it was acquired and\n(iii) no payments on the\nnote will be treated as\npayments of qualified\nstated interest. A U.S.\nHolder must make this\nelection for the taxable\nyear in which the note was\nacquired, and may not\nrevoke the election without\nthe consent of the IRS.\nU.S. Holders should consult\nwith their own tax advisors\nbefore making this\nelection. Notes That Trade\n\u0093Flat. \u0094We expect that some\nnotes will trade in the\nsecondary market with\naccrued interest. However,\nwe may issue notes with\nterms and conditions that\nwould make it likely that\nsuch notes would trade\n\u0093flat\u0094 in the secondary\nmarket, which means that\nupon a sale of a note a\nU.S. Holder would not be\npaid a separate amount that\nreflects the accrued but\nunpaid interest with\nrespect to such note.\nNevertheless, for U.S.\nfederal income tax\npurposes, a portion of the\nsales proceeds equal to the\ninterest accrued with\nrespect to such note from\nthe last interest payment\ndate to the sale date must\nbe treated as interest\nincome rather than as an\namount realized upon the\nsale. Accordingly, a U.S.\nHolder that sells such a\nnote between interest\npayment dates would be\nrequired to recognize\ninterest income and, in\ncertain circumstances,\nwould recognize a capital\nloss (the deductibility of\nwhich is subject to\nlimitations) on the sale of\nthe note. Concurrently, a\nU.S. Holder that purchases\nsuch a note between\ninterest payment dates\nwould not be required to\ninclude in income that\nportion of any interest\npayment received that is\nattributable to interest\nthat accrued prior to the\npurchase. Such payment is\ngenerally treated as a\nreturn of capital which\nreduces the U.S. Holder\u0092s\nremaining cost basis in the\nnote. However, interest\nthat accrues after the\npurchase date is included\nin income in the year\nreceived or accrued\n(depending on the U.S.\nHolder\u0092s accounting\nmethod). U.S. Holders that\npurchase such notes between\ninterest payment dates\nshould consult their own\ntax advisors concerning\nsuch holders\u0092 adjusted tax\nbasis in the note and\nwhether such notes should\nbe treated as having been\npurchased with market\ndiscount, as described\nabove. Short-Term\nNotes.Some of our notes may\nbe issued with maturities\nof one year or less from\nthe date of issue (after\ntaking into account the\nlast possible date that the\nnote could be outstanding\nunder its terms), which we\nrefer to as short-term\nnotes. Treasury regulations\nprovide that no payments of\ninterest on a short-term\nnote are treated as\nqualified stated interest.\nAccordingly, in determining\nthe amount of discount on a\nshort-term note, all\ninterest payments,\nincluding stated interest,\nare included in the short-\nterm note\u0092s stated\nredemption price at\nmaturity. In general,\nindividual and certain\nother U.S. Holders using\nthe cash basis method of\ntax accounting are not\nrequired to include accrued\ndiscount on short-term\nnotes\n\n39\n\nin income currently unless\nthey elect to do so, but\nthey are required to\ninclude any stated interest\nin income as the interest\nis received, except to the\nextent already included\nunder such election.\nHowever, a cash basis U.S.\nHolder will be required to\ntreat any gain realized on\na sale, exchange or\nretirement of the short-\nterm note as ordinary\nincome to the extent such\ngain does not exceed the\ndiscount accrued with\nrespect to the short-term\nnote, which will be\ndetermined on a straight-\nline basis unless the\nholder makes an election to\naccrue the discount under\nthe constant-yield method,\nthrough the date of sale,\nexchange or retirement. Any\ngain in excess of this\namount will be treated as\nshort-term capital gain.\nAny loss recognized will be\ntreated as a capital loss.\nIn addition, a cash basis\nU.S. Holder that does not\nelect to include accrued\ndiscount in income\ncurrently will be not\nallowed to deduct any of\nthe interest paid or\naccrued on any indebtedness\nincurred or maintained to\npurchase or carry a short-\nterm note (in an amount not\nexceeding the deferred\nincome), but instead will\nbe required to defer\ndeductions for such\ninterest until the deferred\nincome is realized upon the\nmaturity of the short-term\nnote or its earlier\ndisposition in a taxable\ntransaction. However, a\ncash-basis U.S. Holder of a\nshort-term note may elect\nto include accrued discount\nin income on a current\nbasis. If this election is\nmade, the limitation on the\ndeductibility of interest\ndescribed above will not\napply. A U.S. Holder using\nthe accrual method of tax\naccounting generally will\nbe required to include\naccrued discount on a\nshort-term note in income\non a current basis, on\neither a straight-line\nbasis or, at the election\nof the holder, under the\nconstant-yield method based\non daily compounding.\nRegardless of whether a\nU.S. Holder is a cash-basis\nor accrual-basis holder, it\nmay elect to include\naccrued \u0093acquisition\ndiscount\u0094 with respect to a\nshort-term note in income\non a current basis.\nAcquisition discount is the\nexcess of the remaining\nredemption amount of the\nshort-term note at the time\nof acquisition over the\npurchase price. Acquisition\ndiscount will be treated as\naccruing on a straight-line\nbasis or, at the election\nof the holder, under a\nconstant yield method based\non daily compounding. If a\nU.S. Holder elects to\ninclude accrued acquisition\ndiscount in income, the\nrules for including OID\nwill not apply. In\naddition, the market\ndiscount rules described\nabove will not apply to\nshort-term notes. Sale,\nExchange or Retirement of\nNotes.Upon the sale,\nexchange, retirement or\nother disposition of a\nnote, a U.S. Holder will\nrecognize gain or loss\nequal to the difference\nbetween the amount realized\nupon the sale, exchange,\nretirement or other\ndisposition (less an amount\nequal to any accrued\ninterest not previously\nincluded in income if the\nnote is disposed of between\ninterest payment dates,\nwhich will be included in\nincome as interest income\nfor U.S. federal income tax\npurposes) and the U.S.\nHolder\u0092s adjusted tax basis\nin the note. The amount\nrealized by the U.S. Holder\nwill include the amount of\nany cash and the fair\nmarket value of any other\nproperty received for the\nnote. A U.S. Holder\u0092s\nadjusted tax basis in a\nnote generally will be the\ncost of the note to such\nU.S. Holder, increased by\nany OID, market discount,\nde minimisOID, de\nminimismarket discount or\nany discount with respect\nto a short-term note\npreviously included in\nincome with respect to the\nnote, and decreased by the\namount of any premium\npreviously amortized to\nreduce interest on the note\nand the amount of any\npayment (other than a\npayment of qualified stated\ninterest) received in\nrespect of the note. Except\nas discussed above with\nrespect to market discount,\ngain or loss realized on\nthe sale, exchange,\nretirement or other\ndisposition of a note\ngenerally will be capital\ngain or loss and will be\nlong-term capital gain or\nloss if the note has been\nheld for more than one\nyear. Net long-term capital\ngain recognized by an\nindividual U.S. Holder is\ngenerally taxed at\npreferential rates. The\nability of U.S. Holders to\ndeduct capital losses is\nsubject to limitations\nunder the Code. Additional\nMedicare Tax on Unearned\nIncome. Certain U.S.\nHolders, including\nindividuals, estates and\ntrusts, are subject to an\nadditional 3.8% Medicare\ntax on unearned income. For\nindividual U.S. Holders,\nthe additional Medicare tax\napplies to the lesser of\n\n40\n\n(i) \u0093net investment income\u0094\nor (ii) the excess of\n\u0093modified adjusted gross\nincome\u0094 over $200,000\n($250,000 if married and\nfiling jointly or $125,000\nif married and filing\nseparately). \u0093Net\ninvestment income\u0094\ngenerally equals the\ntaxpayer\u0092s gross investment\nincome reduced by the\ndeductions that are\nallocable to such income.\nInvestment income generally\nincludes passive income\nsuch as interest and\ncapital gains. U.S. Holders\nare urged to consult their\nown tax advisors regarding\nthe implications of the\nadditional Medicare tax\nresulting from an\ninvestment in the notes.\nBackup Withholding and\nInformation Reporting. In\ngeneral, other than in the\ncase of certain exempt\nholders, we and other\npayors are required to\nreport to the IRS all\npayments of principal, any\npremium and interest on a\nnote, and the accrual of\nOID on an OID note. In\naddition, we and other\npayors generally are\nrequired to report to the\nIRS any payment of proceeds\nof the sale of a note\nbefore maturity.\nAdditionally, backup\nwithholding generally will\napply to any payments,\nincluding payments of OID,\nif a U.S. Holder fails to\nprovide an accurate\ntaxpayer identification\nnumber and certify that the\ntaxpayer identification\nnumber is correct, the U.S.\nHolder is notified by the\nIRS that it has failed to\nreport all interest and\ndividends required to be\nshown on its U.S. federal\nincome tax returns or a\nU.S. Holder does not\ncertify that it has not\nunderreported its interest\nand dividend income. Any\namounts withheld under the\nbackup withholding rules\nwill be allowed as a refund\nor a credit against a\nholder\u0092s U.S. federal\nincome tax liability\nprovided the required\ninformation is furnished to\nthe IRS. Foreign Account\nTax Compliance Act.\nLegislation commonly known\nas \u0093FATCA\u0094 (sections 1471\nthrough 1474 of the Code)\nimposes a 30% U.S.\nwithholding tax on certain\nU.S. source payments,\nincluding interest (and\nOID), dividends, other\nfixed or determinable\nannual or periodical gain,\nprofits, and income, and on\nthe gross proceeds from a\ndisposition of property of\na type which can produce\nU.S. source interest or\ndividends (\u0093Withholdable\nPayments\u0094), if paid to a\nforeign financial\ninstitution (including\namounts paid to a foreign\nfinancial institution on\nbehalf of a holder), unless\nsuch institution enters\ninto an agreement with the\nTreasury to collect and\nprovide to the Treasury\ncertain information\nregarding U.S. financial\naccount holders, including\ncertain account holders\nthat are foreign entities\nwith U.S. owners, with such\ninstitution or otherwise\ncomplies with FATCA. FATCA\nalso generally imposes a\nwithholding tax of 30% on\nWithholdable Payments made\nto a non-financialforeign\nentity unless such entity\nprovides the withholding\nagent with a certification\nthat it does not have any\nsubstantial U.S. owners or\na certification identifying\nthe direct and indirect\nsubstantial U.S. owners of\nthe entity. Under certain\ncircumstances, a holder may\nbe eligible for refunds or\ncredits of such taxes.\nThese withholding and\nreporting requirements\ngenerally apply to U.S.\nsource periodic payments\nand to payments of gross\nproceeds from a sale or\nredemption. However, under\nproposed Treasury\nregulations (the preamble\nto which specifies that\ntaxpayers are permitted to\nrely on them pending\nfinalization), no\nwithholding under FATCA\nwill apply to payments of\ngross proceeds from a sale\nor redemption (other than\nincome treated as\nU.S.-source \u0093fixed or\ndeterminable annual or\nperiodical\u0094 income). If we\n(or an applicable\nwithholding agent)\ndetermine withholding under\nFATCA is appropriate with\nrespect to the notes, we\n(or such agent) will\nwithhold tax at the\napplicable statutory rate,\nwithout being required to\npay any additional amounts\nin respect of such\nwithholding. Foreign\nfinancial institutions and\nnon-financialforeign\nentities located in\njurisdictions that have an\nintergovernmental agreement\nwith the United States\ngoverning FATCA may be\nsubject to different rules.\nHolders are urged to\nconsult with their own tax\nadvisors regarding the\npossible implications of\nFATCA on their investment\nin the notes. ERISA\nCONSIDERATIONS A fiduciary\nof a pension, profit-\nsharing or other employee\nbenefit plan subject to the\nEmployee\n\n41\n\nRetirement Income Security\nAct of 1974, as amended\n(\u0093ERISA\u0094), should consider\nthe fiduciary standards of\nERISA in the context of the\nERISA plan\u0092s particular\ncircumstances before\nauthorizing an investment\nin the offered notes of\nBank of America. Among\nother factors, the\nfiduciary should consider\nwhether such an investment\nis in accordance with the\ndocuments governing the\nERISA plan and whether the\ninvestment is appropriate\nfor the ERISA plan in view\nof its overall investment\npolicy and diversification\nof its portfolio. A\nfiduciary should also\nconsider whether an\ninvestment in the offered\nnotes may constitute a\n\u0093prohibited transaction,\u0094\nas described below. Certain\nprovisions of ERISA and the\nCode, prohibit employee\nbenefit plans (as defined\nin Section 3(3) of ERISA)\nthat are subject to Title I\nof ERISA, plans described\nin Section 4975(e)(1) of\nthe Code (including,\nwithout limitation,\nindividual retirement\naccounts and retirement\nplans covering self-\nemployed persons) that are\nsubject to Section 4975 of\nthe Code, and entities\nwhose underlying assets\ninclude plan assets by\nreason of such employee\nbenefit plan\u0092s or plan\u0092s\ninvestment in such entities\n(including, without\nlimitation, as applicable,\ninsurance company general\naccounts) (collectively,\n\u0093plans\u0094), from engaging in\ncertain transactions\ninvolving \u0093plan assets\u0094\nwith parties that are\n\u0093parties in interest\u0094 under\nERISA or \u0093disqualified\npersons\u0094 under the Code\nwith respect to the plan or\nentity (referred to as\n\u0093prohibited transactions\u0094).\nCertain governmental,\nchurch, non-U.S.and other\nplans that are not subject\nto ERISA or to the Code may\nbe subject to similar\nrestrictions under state,\nfederal, local or\nnon-U.S.law (\u0093similar\nlaw\u0094). Each of Bank of\nAmerica Corporation and\ncertain of its affiliates\nmay be considered a \u0093party\nin interest\u0094 or a\n\u0093disqualified person\u0094 with\nrespect to many plans on\naccount of being a service\nprovider to such plans. As\na result, a prohibited\ntransaction may arise if\nthe notes are acquired by\nor on behalf of a plan\nunless those notes are\nacquired and held pursuant\nto an available exemption.\nThe U.S. Department of\nLabor has issued five\nprohibited transaction\nclass exemptions (\u0093PTCEs\u0094)\nthat may provide exemptive\nrelief for direct or\nindirect prohibited\ntransactions resulting from\nor occurring in connection\nwith the purchase or\nholding of these notes.\nThose class exemptions are\nPTCE 96-23(for certain\ntransactions determined by\nin-houseasset managers),\nPTCE 95-60(for certain\ntransactions involving\ninsurance company general\naccounts), PTCE 91-38(for\ncertain transactions\ninvolving bank collective\ninvestment funds), PTCE\n90-1(for certain\ntransactions involving\ninsurance company separate\naccounts) and PTCE\n84-14(for certain\ntransactions determined by\nindependent qualified\nprofessional asset\nmanagers). In addition,\nERISA Section 408(b)(17)\nand Section 4975(d)(20) of\nthe Code provide an\nexemption for the purchase\nand sale of securities and\nrelated lending\ntransactions, provided that\nneither the issuer of the\nsecurities nor any of its\naffiliates has or exercises\nany discretionary authority\nor control or renders any\ninvestment advice with\nrespect to the assets of\nany plan involved in the\ntransaction and provided\nfurther that the plan\nreceives no less, nor pays\nno more, than adequate\nconsideration in connection\nwith the transaction (the\nso-called\u0093Service Provider\nExemption\u0094). There can be\nno assurance that any of\nthese class or statutory\nexemptions will be\navailable with respect to\ntransactions involving\nthese notes. Accordingly,\nunless otherwise provided\nin connection with a\nparticular offering of\nnotes, offered notes may\nnot be purchased, held or\ndisposed of by any plan or\nany other person investing\n\u0093plan assets\u0094 of any plan\nthat is subject to the\nprohibited transaction\nrules of ERISA or Section\n4975 of the Code or other\nsimilar law, unless one of\nthe following exemptions\n(or a similar exemption or\nexception acceptable to us)\napplies to such purchase,\nholding, and disposition:\nthe Service Provider\nExemption, PTCE 96-23, PTCE\n95-60, PTCE 91-38, PTCE\n90-1,or PTCE\n84-14.Therefore, unless\notherwise provided in\nconnection with a\nparticular offering of\nnotes, any purchaser of the\noffered notes or any\ninterest\n\n42\n\ntherein will be deemed to\nhave represented and\nwarranted to us on each day\nincluding the date of its\npurchase of the offered\nnotes through and including\nthe date of disposition of\nsuch offered notes that:\n                                                         \n       it is not a plan subject to Title I of ERISA,     \n       Section\u00a04975 of the Code or similar law and is    \n  (a)  not purchasing such notes or interest             \n       therein on behalf of, or with \u0093plan assets\u0094 of,     \n       any such plan;                                    \n                                                         \n                                                         \n       if it is a plan subject to Title I of ERISA or    \n       Section\u00a04975 of the Code, its purchase, holding,  \n  (b)  and disposition of such notes will not            \n       constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited   \n       transaction under ERISA or the Code; or           \n                                                         \n                                                         \n       if it is a governmental plan (as defined in       \n       section 3(32) of ERISA), church plan (as defined  \n       in section 3(33) of ERISA), non-U.S. plan or      \n  (c)  other plan that is not subject to the provisions  \n       of Title I of ERISA or Section\u00a04975 of the Code,  \n       its purchase, holding, and disposition of such    \n       notes will not violate any similar law and are    \n       not otherwise prohibited.                         \n                                                         \nMoreover, any purchaser\nthat is a plan or is\nacquiring the offered notes\non behalf of a plan,\nincluding any fiduciary\npurchasing on behalf of a\nplan, will be deemed to\nhave represented, in its\ncorporate and its fiduciary\ncapacity, by its purchase\nand holding of the offered\nnotes that (a) neither we,\nany of the underwriters nor\nany of our or their\nrespective affiliates\n(collectively, the\n\u0093Seller\u0094) is a \u0093fiduciary\u0094\n(under Section 3(21) of\nERISA, or under any final\nor proposed regulations\nthereunder, or with respect\nto a governmental, church,\nor non-U.S.plan under any\nsimilar laws) with respect\nto the acquisition, holding\nor disposition of the\noffered notes, or as a\nresult of any exercise by\nthe Seller of any rights in\nconnection with the offered\nnotes, (b) no advice\nprovided by the Seller has\nformed a primary basis for\nany investment decision by\nor on behalf of such\npurchaser in connection\nwith the offered notes and\nthe transactions\ncontemplated with respect\nto the notes, and (c) such\npurchaser recognizes and\nagrees that any\ncommunication from the\nSeller to the purchaser\nwith\n\nrespect to the offered\nnotes is not intended by\nthe Seller to be impartial\ninvestment advice and is\nrendered in its capacity as\na seller of such offered\nnotes and not as a\nfiduciary to such\npurchaser. This discussion\nis a general summary of\nsome of the rules which\napply to ERISA plans and\nnon-ERISAarrangements and\ntheir related investment\nvehicles as of the date of\nthis prospectus. The rules\ngoverning investments by\nERISA plans and non-\nERISAarrangements change\nfrequently, and we have no\nduty to, nor will we,\ninform you about any\nchanges to such rules if\nand when they occur. This\nsummary does not describe\nall of the rules or other\nconsiderations that may be\nrelevant to the investment\nin the offered notes by\nsuch plans or arrangements.\nThe description above is\nnot, and should not be\nconstrued as, legal advice\nor a legal opinion. Due to\nthe complexity of these\nrules and the penalties\nimposed upon persons\ninvolved in prohibited\ntransactions, it is\nimportant that any person\nconsidering the purchase of\nthe offered notes with plan\nassets consult with its\ncounsel regarding the\nconsequences under ERISA\nand the Code, or other\nsimilar law, of the\nacquisition and holding of\noffered notes and the\navailability of exemptive\nrelief under the class or\nstatutory exemptions listed\nabove. The sale of the\nnotes of Bank of America to\na plan is in no respect a\nrepresentation by the\nSeller that such an\ninvestment meets all\nrelevant legal requirements\nwith respect to investments\nby plans generally or any\nparticular plan, or that\nsuch an investment is\nappropriate for plans\ngenerally or any particular\nplan. PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION\nAND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\nWe will enter into an\nAmended and Restated\nSelling Agent Agreement\nwith the agents, including\nthe Purchasing Agent,\npursuant to which the notes\nwill be offered from time\nto time by us to the\nPurchasing Agent for\nsubsequent resale to the\nagents and other dealers.\nThe form of the Amended and\nRestated Selling Agency 43\n\nAgreement will be filed as\nan exhibit to the\nregistration statement of\nwhich this prospectus is a\npart. The notes will be\noffered for sale in the\nUnited States only. Dealers\nwho are members of the\nselling group will execute\na Master Selected Dealer\nAgreement with the\nPurchasing Agent. The\nagents will not be required\nto sell any specific amount\nof notes but will agree to\nuse their reasonable best\nefforts to solicit offers\nfrom investors to purchase\nthe notes. We also may\nappoint additional agents\nto solicit offers to\npurchase the notes. Any\nsolicitation and sale of\nthe notes through those\nadditional agents, however,\nwill be on the same terms\nand conditions to which the\noriginal agents have\nagreed. We will pay the\nPurchasing Agent a gross\nselling concession to be\ndivided among the\nPurchasing Agent and the\nother agents as they agree.\nThe concession will be\npayable to the Purchasing\nAgent in the form of a\ndiscount ranging from 0.30%\nto 3.15% of the non-\ndiscountedprice for each\nnote sold. However, we also\nmay pay the Purchasing\nAgent a concession greater\nthan or less than the range\nspecified above. The gross\nselling concession that we\nwill pay to the Purchasing\nAgent will be set forth in\nthe applicable supplement.\nThe Purchasing Agent also\nmay sell notes to dealers\nat a discount not in excess\nof the concession it\nreceived from us. In\ncertain cases, the\nPurchasing Agent and the\nother agents and dealers\nmay agree that the\nPurchasing Agent will\nretain the entire gross\nselling concession. It is\nanticipated that in these\ncircumstances the other\nagents and dealers will be\ncompensated by their\nclients based on a\npercentage of assets under\nmanagement. We will\ndisclose any of these\narrangements in the\napplicable supplement.\nFollowing the solicitation\nof orders, each of the\nagents, severally and not\njointly, may purchase notes\nas principal for its own\naccount from the Purchasing\nAgent. Unless otherwise set\nforth in the applicable\nsupplement, these notes\nwill be purchased by the\nagents and resold by them\nto one or more investors at\na fixed public offering\nprice. After the initial\npublic offering of notes to\nbe resold by an agent to\ninvestors, the public\noffering price (in the case\nof notes to be resold at a\nfixed public offering\nprice), concession and\ndiscount may be changed. We\nwill have the sole right to\naccept offers to purchase\nnotes and may reject any\nproposed offer to purchase\nnotes in whole or in part.\nEach agent also has the\nright, in its discretion\nreasonably exercised, to\nreject any proposed offer\nto purchase notes in whole\nor in part. We reserve the\nright to withdraw, cancel\nor modify any offer without\nnotice. We also may change\nthe terms, including the\ninterest rate we will pay\non the notes, at any time\nprior to our acceptance of\nan offer to purchase. Each\nagent, including the\nPurchasing Agent, may be\ndeemed to be an\n\u0093underwriter\u0094 within the\nmeaning of the Securities\nAct of 1933. We will agree\nto indemnify the agents\nagainst certain\nliabilities, including\nliabilities under the\nSecurities Act of 1933, or\nto contribute to payments\nthe agents may be required\nto make with respect to\nthose liabilities. We also\nhave agreed to reimburse\nthe agents for certain\nexpenses. If any notes are\nto be distributed by means\nother than those set forth\nin the Amended and Restated\nSelling Agent Agreement,\nprior to commencement of\nthat distribution, copies\nof the proposed\ndistribution agreements\nwill be submitted to FINRA\nfor review along with an\nestimate of the maximum\ncompensation to be received\nby any FINRA member or\nrelated person\nparticipating in the\ndistribution. If we decide\nto list any note on a stock\nexchange, we will specify\nthe exchange in the\nsupplement relating to\nthose notes. No note will\nhave an established trading\nmarket when issued.\nHowever, we have been\nadvised by the agents that\nthey may purchase and sell\nnotes in the secondary\nmarket as permitted by\napplicable laws and\nregulations. The agents are\nnot obligated to make a\nmarket in the notes, and\nthey may discontinue making\na market in the notes at\nany time without notice.\nNeither we nor the agents\ncan provide any assurance\nregarding the development,\nliquidity or maintenance of\nany trading market for any\nnotes. All secondary\ntrading in\n\n44\n\nthe notes will settle in\nimmediately available\nfunds. See the section\nentitled \u0093Registration and\nSettlement\u0094 beginning on\npage 30. In connection with\ncertain offerings of notes,\nthe rules of the SEC permit\nthe Purchasing Agent to\nengage in transactions that\nmay stabilize the price of\nthe notes. The Purchasing\nAgent will conduct these\nactivities for the agents.\nThese transactions may\nconsist of short sales,\nstabilizing transactions\nand purchases to cover\npositions created by short\nsales. A short sale is the\nsale by the Purchasing\nAgent of a greater amount\nof notes than the amount\nthe Purchasing Agent has\nagreed to purchase in\nconnection with a specific\noffering of notes.\nStabilizing transactions\nconsist of certain bids or\npurchases made by the\nPurchasing Agent to prevent\nor retard a decline in the\nprice of the notes while an\noffering of notes is in\nprocess. In general, these\npurchases or bids for the\nnotes for the purpose of\nstabilization or to reduce\na syndicate short position\ncould cause the price of\nthe notes to be higher than\nit might otherwise be in\nthe absence of those\npurchases or bids.
